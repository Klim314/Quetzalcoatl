TI  - The chitinolytic cascade in Vibrios is regulated by chitin oligosaccharides and a two-component chitin catabolic sensor/kinase.
AB  - Chitin, a highly insoluble polymer of GlcNAc, is produced in massive quantities in the marine environment. Fortunately for survival of aquatic ecosystems, chitin is rapidly catabolized by marine bacteria. Here we describe a bacterial two-component hybrid sensor/kinase (of the ArcB type) that rigorously controls expression of approximately 50 genes, many involved in chitin degradation. The sensor gene, chiS, was identified in Vibrio furnissii and Vibrio cholerae (predicted amino acid sequences, full-length: 84% identical, 93% similar). Mutants of chiS grew normally on GlcNAc but did not express extracellular chitinase, a specific chitoporin, or beta-hexosaminidases, nor did they exhibit chemotaxis, transport, or growth on chitin oligosaccharides such as (GlcNAc)(2). Expression of these systems requires three components: wild-type chiS; a periplasmic high-affinity chitin oligosaccharide, (GlcNAc)(n) (n > 1), binding protein (CBP); and the environmental signal, (GlcNAc)(n). Our data are consistent with the following model. In the uninduced state, CBP binds to the periplasmic domain of ChiS and "locks" it into the minus conformation. The environmental signal, (GlcNAc)(n), dissociates the complex by binding to CBP, releasing ChiS, yielding the plus phenotype (expression of chitinolytic genes). In V. cholerae, a cluster of 10 contiguous genes (VC0620-VC0611) apparently comprise a (GlcNAc)(2) catabolic operon. CBP is encoded by the first, VC0620, whereas VC0619-VC0616 encode a (GlcNAc)(2) ABC-type permease. Regulation of chiS requires expression of CBP but not (GlcNAc)(2) transport. (GlcNAc)(n) is suggested to be essential for signaling these cells that chitin is in the microenvironment.
TI  - Genetic analysis of phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase from Vibrio furnissii and characterization of its role in virulence.
AB  - The pmm gene from Vibrio furnissii, which encodes phosphomannomutase (PMM), was cloned and sequenced. The open reading frame consisted of 1,434 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 477 amino acids with a molecular mass of 53,325 Da. The predicted amino acid sequence of V. furnissii PMM showed high similarity with PMMs from other enteric bacteria, such as V. cholerae, Salmonella sp. and Escherichia coli. The PMM protein was overexpressed in E. coli as a His(6)-tagged recombinant protein. The estimated apparent K(m )and k(cat) values of the purified recombinant protein for mannose 1-phosphate were about 60 microM and 800 min(-1), respectively. To investigate the biochemical functions and the role of pmm in the virulence of V. furnissii, a pmm knock-out mutant was constructed by homologous recombination mutation. Under the various physical conditions, cell numbers of the wild-type and the mutant did not differ. Oral introduction of bacterial suspensions to a mouse model showed that the pmm-deficient mutant decreased in viability at the intestine. Microscopy of the isolated intestines from mice revealed significant damage after 3 days in intestinal mucosa infected with the wild-type as compared with the mutant. The pmm-deficient mutant caused a reduction of virulence in mice and the loss of O-antigen polysaccharide, and showed low resistance relative to the wild-type when incubated with normal human serum.
TI  - Conserved amplification of chemotactic responses through chemoreceptor interactions.
AB  - Many bacteria concentrate their chemoreceptors at the cell poles. Chemoreceptor location is important in Escherichia coli, since chemosensory responses are sensitive to receptor proximity. It is not known, however, whether chemotaxis in other bacteria is similarly regulated. To investigate the importance of receptor-receptor interactions in other bacterial species, we synthesized saccharide-bearing multivalent ligands that are designed to cluster relevant chemoreceptors. As has been shown with E. coli, we demonstrate that the behaviors of Bacillus subtilis, Spirochaete aurantia, and Vibrio furnissii are sensitive to the valence of the chemoattractant. Moreover, in B. subtilis, chemotactic responses to serine were increased by pretreatment with saccharide-bearing multivalent ligands. This result indicates that, as in E. coli, signaling information is transferred among chemoreceptors in B. subtilis. These results suggest that interreceptor communication may be a general mechanism for modulating chemotactic responses in bacteria.
TI  - Isolation of a glucosamine-specific kinase, a unique enzyme of Vibrio cholerae.
AB  - We showed previously that chitin catabolism by the marine bacterium Vibrio furnissii involves at least three signal transduction systems and many genes, several of which were molecularly cloned, and the corresponding proteins were characterized. The predicted amino acid sequences of these proteins showed a high degree of identity to the corresponding proteins from Vibrio cholerae, whose complete genomic sequence has recently been determined. We have therefore initiated studies with V. cholerae. We report here a novel ATP-dependent glucosamine kinase of V. cholerae encoded by a gene designated gspK. The protein, GspK (31.6 kDa), was purified to apparent homogeneity from recombinant Escherichia coli. The product of the reaction was shown to be GlcN-6-P by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI mass spectrometry) and NMR. The K(m) values for GlcN, ATP, and MgCl(2) were 0.45, 2.4, and 2.2 mm, respectively, and the V(max) values were in the range 180-200 nmol/microg/min (approximately 6 nmol/pmol/min). Kinase activity was not observed with any other sugar, including: galactosamine, mannosamine, Glc, GlcNAc, GalNAc, mannose, 2-deoxyglucose, and oligosaccharides of chitosan. The enzyme is also ATP-specific. The kinase can be used to specifically determine micro quantities of GlcN in acid hydrolysates of glycoconjugates. The physiological function of this enzyme remains to be determined.
TI  - Cloning, sequences, and characterization of two chitinase genes from the Antarctic Arthrobacter sp. strain TAD20: isolation and partial characterization of the enzymes.
AB  - Arthrobacter sp. strain TAD20, a chitinolytic gram-positive organism, was isolated from the sea bottom along the Antarctic ice shell. Arthrobacter sp. strain TAD20 secretes two major chitinases, ChiA and ChiB (ArChiA and ArChiB), in response to chitin induction. A single chromosomal DNA fragment containing the genes coding for both chitinases was cloned in Escherichia coli. DNA sequencing analysis of this fragment revealed two contiguous open reading frames coding for the precursors of ArChiA (881 amino acids [aa]) and ArChiB (578 aa). ArChiA and ArChiB are modular enzymes consisting of a glycosyl-hydrolase family 18 catalytic domain as well as two and one chitin-binding domains, respectively. The catalytic domain of ArChiA exhibits 55% identity with a chitodextrinase from Vibrio furnissii. The ArChiB catalytic domain exhibits 33% identity with chitinase A of Bacillus circulans. The ArChiA chitin-binding domains are homologous to the chitin-binding domain of ArChiB. ArChiA and ArChiB were purified to homogeneity from the native Arthrobacter strain and partially characterized. Thermal unfolding of ArChiA, ArChiB, and chitinase A of Serratia marcescens was studied using differential scanning calorimetry. ArChiA and ArChiB, compared to their mesophilic counterpart, exhibited increased heat lability, similar to other cold-adapted enzymes.
TI  - Rapid method for species-specific identification of Vibrio cholerae using primers targeted to the gene of outer membrane protein OmpW.
AB  - The distribution of genes for an outer membrane protein (OmpW) and a regulatory protein (ToxR) in Vibrio cholerae and other organisms was studied using respective primers and probes. PCR amplification results showed that all (100%) of the 254 V. cholerae strains tested were positive for ompW and 229 ( approximately 98%) of 233 were positive for toxR. None of the 40 strains belonging to other Vibrio species produced amplicons with either ompW- or toxR-specific primers, while 80 bacterial strains from other genera tested were also found to be negative by the assay. These studies were extended with representative number of strains using ompW- and toxR-specific probes in DNA dot blot assay. While the V. cholerae strains reacted with ompW probe, only one (V. mimicus) out of 60 other bacterial strains tested showed weak recognition. In contrast, several strains belonging to other Vibrio species (e.g., V. mimicus, V. splendidus, V. alginolyticus, V. fluvialis, V. proteolyticus, V. aestuarianus, V. salmonicida, V. furnissii, and V. parahaemolyticus) showed weak to strong reactivity to the toxR probe. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and nucleotide sequence data revealed that the ompW sequence is highly conserved among V. cholerae strains belonging to different biotypes and/or serogroups. All of these results suggest that the ompW gene can be targeted for the species-specific identification of V. cholerae strains. The scope of this study was further extended through the development of a one-step multiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous amplification of ompW and ctxA genes which should be of considerable value in the screening of both toxigenic and nontoxigenic V. cholerae strains of clinical as well as environmental origin.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase of Escherichia coli and its role in cell wall recycling.
AB  - The beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase of Escherichia coli was found to have a novel specificity and to be encoded by a gene (nagZ) that maps at 25.1 min. It corresponds to an open reading frame, ycfO, whose predicted amino acid sequence is 57% identical to that of Vibrio furnissii ExoII. NagZ hydrolyzes the beta-1,4 glycosidic bond between N-acetylglucosamine and anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid in cell wall degradation products following their importation into the cell during the process for recycling cell wall muropeptides. From amino acid sequence comparisons, the novel beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase appears to be conserved in all 12 gram-negative bacteria whose complete or partial genome sequence data are available.
TI  - Chitin catabolism in the marine bacterium Vibrio furnissii. Identification, molecular cloning, and characterization of A N, N'-diacetylchitobiose phosphorylase.
AB  - The major product of bacterial chitinases is N,N'-diacetylchitobiose or (GlcNAc)(2). We have previously demonstrated that (GlcNAc)(2) is taken up unchanged by a specific permease in Vibrio furnissii (unlike Escherichia coli). It is generally held that marine Vibrios further metabolize cytoplasmic (GlcNAc)(2) by hydrolyzing it to two GlcNAcs (i.e. a "chitobiase "). Here we report instead that V. furnissii expresses a novel phosphorylase. The gene, chbP, was cloned into E. coli; the enzyme, ChbP, was purified to apparent homogeneity, and characterized kinetically. The DNA sequence indicates that chbP encodes an 89-kDa protein. The enzymatic reaction was characterized as follows. (GlcNAc)(2)+P(i) GlcNAc-alpha-1-P+GlcNAc K'(cq)=1.0+/-0.2 Reaction 1 The K(m) values for the four substrates were in the range 0.3-1 mm. p-Nitrophenyl-(GlcNAc)(2) was cleaved at 8.5% the rate of (GlcNAc)(2), and p-nitrophenyl (PNP)-GlcNAc was 36% as active as GlcNAc in the reverse direction. All other compounds tested displayed </=1% of the activity of the indicated substrates including: for phosphorolysis, higher chitin oliogsaccharides, (GlcNAc)(n), n = 3-5, cellobiose, PNP-GlcNAc, and PNP-(GlcNAc)(3); for synthesis, (GlcNAc)(n) (n = 2-5), glucose, etc. (GlcNAc)(2) is a major regulator of the chitin catabolic cascade. Conceivably GlcNAc-alpha-1-P plays a similar but different role in regulation.
TI  - Chitin catabolism in the marine bacterium Vibrio furnissii. Identification and molecular cloning of a chitoporin.
AB  - Chitin catabolism by the marine bacterium Vibrio furnissii involves many genes and proteins, including two unique periplasmic hydrolases, a chitodextrinase and a beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Keyhani, N. O. , and Roseman, S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 33414-33424 and 33425-33432). A specific chitoporin in the outer membrane may be required for these glycosidases to be accessible to extracellular chitooligosaccharides, (GlcNAc)(n), that are produced by chitinases. We report here the identification and molecular cloning of such a porin. An outer membrane protein, OMP (apparent molecular mass 40 kDa) was expressed when V. furnissii was induced by (GlcNAc)(n), n = 2-6, but not by GlcNAc or other sugars. Based on the N-terminal sequence of OMP, oligonucleotides were synthesized and used to clone the gene, chiP. The deduced amino acid sequence of ChiP is similar to several bacterial porins; OMP is a processed form of ChiP. In Escherichia coli, two recombinant proteins were observed, corresponding to processed and unprocessed forms of ChiP. A null mutant of chiP was constructed in V. furnissii. In contrast to the parental strain, the mutant did not grow on (GlcNAc)(3) and transported a nonmetabolizable analogue of (GlcNAc)(2) at a reduced rate. These results imply that ChiP is a specific chitoporin.
TI  - Identification of genes in a KG- phenotype of Lactococcus garvieae, a fish pathogenic bacterium, whose proteins react with antiKG- rabbit serum.
AB  - Five different clones (SA1B05, SA1B10, SA2F01, SA8A11 and SA9H10) were isolated from the gene library of the Lactococcus garvieae SA8201 (KG-) strain by immunological screening using rabbit serum against L. garvieae (KG-) phenotype cells. A Western blot analysis indicated that the molecular sizes of immunologically detected proteins of SA1B05, SA1B10, SA2F01, SA8A11 and SA9H10, which were fused with LacZ protein, were 25, 30, 28, 26 and 13 kDa, respectively. The amino acid sequences of the immunologically detected proteins of SA1B05, SA1B10, SA2F01 and SA8A11 were homologous to a processing protease of Bacillus subtilis (36.6%), dihydropteroate synthase of Escherichia coli (34.6%), trigger factor of B. subtilis (45.8%) and N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase of Vibrio furnissii (37.1%), respectively. There was no significant homologous sequence of SA9H10 in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank and SwissProt. We cloned and sequenced a longer DNA fragment (SA9H10L) of SA9H10 from the gene library. The predicted amino acid sequence of this clone was weak homology to M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes (22.7%). Five genes were specifically expressed in the KG- phenotype strains. However, SA8A11 and SA9H10 was expressed in the mutated strain SA8201-TTC, whose serological phenotype was changed from KG- to KG+ by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride.
TI  - Horizontal transfer of chromosomal DNA between the marine bacterium Vibrio furnissii and Escherichia coli revealed by sequence analysis.
AB  - Previous in silico analysis of the 67.4-76.0 minutes region of the Escherichia coli genome led to the identification of a gene cluster (named aga) comprising five genes encoding homologs of the mannose transporter of E. coli, a member of the sugar-specific phosphoenolypyruvate/sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). In the present work, we compared the aga gene cluster of E. coli, which has been considered to be involved in N-acetylgalactosamine or N-acetylmannosamine transport and metabolism, to the region comprising the recently identified mannose transporter of the marine bacterium Vibrio furnissii. Our analysis revealed that the proteins encoded by three genes (agaV, agaW, and agaA), located in the proximal portion of the aga gene cluster, shared striking similarities with the proteins encoded by the manX (IIBMan), manY (IICMan), and manD (a putative deacetylase) genes of V. furnissii, respectively (70%-82.3% identity among the three pairs of proteins). Moreover, we found that the two following aga genes (agaS and agaY) were homologous to the sequences flanking the mannose operon of V. furnissii. These observations strongly support the idea of a horizontal transfer of the chromosomally encoded man operon of V. furnissii into the E. coli genome.
TI  - Sugar transport by the marine chitinolytic bacterium Vibrio furnissii. Molecular  cloning and analysis of the mannose/glucose permease.
AB  - We have previously reported that the chitin catabolic cascade in Vibrio furnissii involves multiple signal transducing systems, and that mono- and disaccharide chemoreceptors/transporters are essential components of some of these systems. This and the accompanying papers (Bouma, C. L., and Roseman, S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem 271, 33457-33467; Keyhani, N. O., Wang, L.-X., Lee, Y. C., and Roseman, S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 33409-33413) describe some of the sugar transporters. A 13-kilobase pair fragment of V. furnissii DNA was found to impart a Glc+, Man+ phenotype to Escherichia coli ptsG ptsM mutants, and encodes the mannose transporter, ptsM, of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system. Unlike the E. coli mannose permease, V. furnissii IIMan is inactive with GlcNAc and Fru, and is encoded by four genes rather than three. The gene order is manXYZW, where the product of manY corresponds to IIPMan, manZ to the mannose receptor IIBMan, and manX and manW to the single E. coli gene, manX (which encodes IIIMan, viz. IIAMan). Thus, in V. furnissii, the E. coli manX equivalent comprises two genes, which are separated in the genome by two other genes of the ptsM complex. Two additional open reading frames were detected in the V. furnissii DNA fragment. One encodes a GlcNAc-6-P deacetylase, and the other is similar to aldolase.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase from Vibrio furnissii.
AB  - The accompanying papers (Keyhani, N. O., and Roseman, S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 33414-33424; Keyhani, N. O., and Roseman, S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 33425-33432) describe two unique beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases from Vibrio furnissii. A third, ExoII, is reported here. The gene, exoII, was cloned into Escherichia coli, sequenced, and ExoII purified to apparent homogeneity (36 kDa). The molecular weight and N-terminal 16 amino acids of the protein conform to the predicted sequence. ExoII exhibited unique substrate specificity. It rapidly cleaved p-nitrophenyl and 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-GlcNAc, was slightly active with p-nitrophenyl-beta-GalNAc, and was inactive with all other GlcNAc derivatives tested, including N,N'-diacetylchitobiose and (GlcNAc)n, n = 3-6. Unlike GlcNAc (Ki, 210 microM), (GlcNAc)n are poor inhibitors of ExoII. The predicted protein sequence is unique among beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases excepting Cht60, recently cloned from a marine Alteromonas (Tsujibo, H., Fujimoto, K., Tanno, H., Miyamoto, K., Imada, C., Okami, Y., and Inamori, Y. (1994) Gene (Amst.) 146, 111-115). Cht60, a chitobiase, is 26.9% identical to ExoII in a 182-amino acid overlap, but the two enzymes differ in substrate specificity and other properties. ExoII shares similarity with five bacterial and yeast beta-glucosidases, up to 44% identity in the 25-amino acid catalytic domain. By analogy, ExoII may play a role in signal transduction between invertebrate hosts and V. furnissii.
TI  - The chitin catabolic cascade in the marine bacterium Vibrio furnissii. Molecular  cloning, isolation, and characterization of a periplasmic beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase.
AB  - We have described some steps in chitin catabolism by Vibrio furnissii, and proposed that chitin oligosaccharides are hydrolyzed in the periplasmic space to GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2. Since (GlcNAc)2 is an important inducer in the cascade, it must resist hydrolysis in the periplasm. Known V. furnissii periplasmic hydrolases comprise an endoenzyme (Keyhani, N. O. and Roseman, S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 33414-33424), and the beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, ExoI, reported here. ExoI was isolated from a recombinant strain of Escherichia coli, and hydrolyzes aryl-beta-GlcNAc, aryl-beta-GalNAc, and chitin oligosaccharides. No other beta-GlcNAc glycosides were cleaved. The pH optimum was 7.0 for (GlcNAc)n, n = 3-6, but 5.8 for (GlcNAc)2. At the pH of sea water (8.0-8.3), the enzymatic activity with (GlcNAc)2 is virtually undetectable. These results explain the stability of (GlcNAc)2 in the periplasmic space. The cloned beta-GlcNAcidase gene, exoI, encodes a 69,377-kDa protein (611 amino acids); the predicted N-terminal 20 amino acid residues matched those of the isolated protein. The protein amino acid sequence displays significant homologies to the alpha- and beta-chains of human hexosaminidase despite their marked differences in substrate specificities and pH optima.
TI  - The chitin catabolic cascade in the marine bacterium Vibrio furnissii. Molecular  cloning, isolation, and characterization of a periplasmic chitodextrinase.
AB  - Chitin catabolism in Vibrio furnissii comprises several signal transducing systems and many proteins. Two of these enzymes are periplasmic and convert chitin oligosaccharides to GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2. One of these unique enzymes, a chitodextrinase, designated EndoI, is described here. The protein, isolated from a recombinant Escherichia coli clone, exhibited (via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) two enzymatically active, close running bands ( approximately mass of 120 kDa) with identical N-terminal sequences. The chitodextrinase rapidly cleaved chitin oligosaccharides, (GlcNAc)4 to (GlcNAc)2, and (GlcNAc)5,6 to (GlcNAc)2 and (GlcNAc)3. EndoI was substrate inhibited in the millimolar range and was inactive with chitin, glucosamine oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycopeptides containing (GlcNAc)2. The sequence of the cloned gene indicates that it encodes a 112,690-kDa protein (1046 amino acids). Both proteins lacked the predicted N-terminal 31 amino acids, corresponding to a consensus prokaryotic signal peptide. Thus, E. coli recognizes and processes this V. furnissii signal sequence. Although inactive with chitin, the predicted amino acid sequence of EndoI displayed similarities to many chitinases, with 8 amino acids completely conserved in 10 or more of the homologous proteins. There was, however, no "consensus" chitin-binding domain in EndoI.
TI  - Chitin utilization by marine bacteria. Degradation and catabolism of chitin oligosaccharides by Vibrio furnissii.
AB  - Chemotaxis of the marine bacterium Vibrio furnissii to chitin oligosaccharides has been described (Bassler, B. L., Gibbons, P. J., Yu, C., and Roseman, S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 24268-24275). Some steps in catabolism of the oligosaccharides are reported here. GlcNAc, (GlcNAc)2, and (GlcNAc)3 are very rapidly consumed by intact cells, about 320 nmol of GlcNAc equivalents/min/mg of protein. (GlcNAc)4 is utilized somewhat more slowly. During these processes, there is virtually no release of hydrolysis products by the cells. The oligosaccharides enter the periplasmic space (via specific porins?) and are hydrolyzed by a unique membrane-bound endoenzyme (chitodextrinase) and an exoenzyme (N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase; beta-Glc-NAcidase). The genes encoding these enzymes have been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The chitodextrinase cleaves soluble oligomers, but not chitin, to the di- and trisaccharides, while the periplasmic beta-GlcNAcidase hydrolyzes the GlcNAc termini from the oligomers. The end products in the periplasm, GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2 (possibly (GlcNAc)3) are catabolized as follows. (a) Disaccharide pathway, A (GlcNAc)2 permease is apparently expressed by Vibrio furnissii. Translocated (GlcNAc)2 is rapidly hydrolyzed by a soluble, cytosolic beta-GlcNAcidase, and the GlcNAc is phosphorylated by an ATP-dependent, constitutive kinase to GlcNAc-6-P. (b) Monosaccharide pathway, Periplasmic GlcNAc is taken up by Enzyme IINag of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system, yielding GlcNAc-6-P, the common intermediate for both pathways. Finally, GlcNAc-6-P----Ac- + GlcNH2-6-P----Fru-6-P + NH3. (GlcNAc)2 is probably the "true" inducer of the chitin degradative enzymes described in this report and, depending on its concentration in the growth medium, differentially induces the periplasmic and cytosolic beta-GlcNAcidases. The disaccharide pathway appears to be the most important when the cells are confronted with low concentrations of the oligomers (e.g. in chemotaxis swarm plates). The relative activities of the induced enzymes suggest that the rate-limiting steps in oligosaccharide catabolism are the glycosidase activities in the periplasm.
TI  - Chitin utilization by marine bacteria. Chemotaxis to chitin oligosaccharides by Vibrio furnissii.
AB  - The adhesion/deadhesion apparatus of the marine bacterium Vibrio furnissii (Yu, C., Lee, A., Bassler, B. L., and Roseman, S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 24260-24267) probably catalyzes the first step in colonizing chitin. Evidence is presented here for a second step, chemotaxis to chitin hydrolysis products. V. furnissii swarms toward chitin oligomers (GlcNAc)n, n = 1-6, at initial concentrations as low as 10 microM. A modified capillary assay was used for quantitation; the cells exhibit low level constitutive taxis to GlcNAc but not to the oligosaccharides. A mutant defective in the GlcNAc receptor (IINag of the phosphotransferase system) showed inducible taxis to the oligosaccharides. Two (or more) independently inducible receptors with overlapping specificities recognize (GlcNAc)n, n = 2-4. (GlcNAc)5 and (GlcNAc)6 were inactive in the capillary assay; expression of this receptor(s) apparently require special induction conditions. The (GlcNAc)n, n = 1-4, chemoreceptors of V. furnissii may be the most potent reported for bacteria. L-Amino acids were weak, constitutive attractants; glutamine, not known to be an attractant in other bacteria, was the most effective amino acid. The most potent receptor in Escherichia coli, Tar (aspartate), is not expressed in V. furnissii. The chemotactic responses were greatly affected by growth and induction conditions and the presence of nutrients in the assay media. Taxis to GlcNAc and GlcNAc oligomers was optimally induced by growth in lactate medium containing 0.6 mM sugar, while growth on the sugar per se resulted in poor taxis. Chemotaxis to the sugars increased 2- to 3-fold when the cells were starved. Nutrients in the assay medium, especially compounds that feed into or are part of the Krebs cycle, were potent inhibitors of taxis to the sugars and Gln. With the exception of isocitrate, inhibition of taxis correlated with the rate of oxidation of these compounds. The results suggest a link between catabolism and taxis in this organism, i.e. interactions or "cross-talk" between systems that are regulated by protein phosphorylation (Stock, J. A., Ninfa, A. J., and Stock, A. M. (1989) Microbiol. Rev. 53, 450-490).
TI  - Chemotaxis to chitin oligosaccharides by Vibrio furnissii, a chitinivorous marine bacterium.
AB  - We have reported that Vibrio furnissii, a chitinivorous marine bacterium, expresses a complex apparatus for adhesion/deadhesion to chitin analogues (1). In the present studies, we show that this organism exhibits a chemotactic response (swarming) to chitin oligosaccharides at concentrations as low as 10 microM. In contrast, V. furnissii exhibits slight to no chemotaxis to other utilizable compounds (glycerol, lactate, amino acids), with the exception of L-glutamic acid. V. furnissii may lack the tar (aspartate) receptor of Escherichia coli.
