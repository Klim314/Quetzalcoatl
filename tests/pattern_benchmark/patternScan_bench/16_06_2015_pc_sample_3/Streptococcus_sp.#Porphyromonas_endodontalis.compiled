TI  - Salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (CD) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [T-CD]). The same number of healthy children (HC) was used as controls. The salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. Metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. Compared to HC, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (P < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the T-CD children. As shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest Shannon's diversity and substrate richness were found in HC. Pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for HC. Levels of Lachnospiraceae, Gemellaceae, and Streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the T-CD children. Streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in T-CD children. The saliva of T-CD children showed the largest amount of Bacteroidetes (e.g., Porphyromonas sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of Actinobacteria. T-CD children were also characterized by decreased levels of some Actinomyces species, Atopobium species, and Corynebacterium durum. Rothia mucilaginosa was the only Actinobacteria species found at the highest level in T-CD children. As shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated T-CD children. Some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with T-CD children. Correlations (false discovery rate [FDR], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The findings of this study indicated that CD is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.
TI  - Molecular mapping to species level of the tonsillar crypt microbiota associated with health and recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - The human palatine tonsils, which belong to the central antigen handling sites of the mucosal immune system, are frequently affected by acute and recurrent infections. This study compared the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts in children and adults affected by recurrent tonsillitis with that of healthy adults and children with tonsillar hyperplasia. An in-depth 16S rRNA gene based pyrosequencing approach combined with a novel strategy that included phylogenetic analysis and detection of species-specific sequence signatures enabled identification of the major part of the microbiota to species level. A complex microbiota consisting of between 42 and 110 taxa was demonstrated in both children and adults. This included a core microbiome of 12 abundant genera found in all samples regardless of age and health status. Yet, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were almost exclusively detected in children. In contrast, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae was present in all samples. Obligate anaerobes like Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium were abundantly present in children, but the species diversity of Porphyromonas and Prevotella was larger in adults and included species that are considered putative pathogens in periodontal diseases, i.e. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Tannerella forsythia. Unifrac analysis showed that recurrent tonsillitis is associated with a shift in the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts. Fusobacterium necrophorum, Streptococcus intermedius and Prevotella melaninogenica/histicola were associated with recurrent tonsillitis in adults, whereas species traditionally associated with acute tonsillitis like pyogenic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus were scarce. The findings suggest that recurrent tonsillitis is a polymicrobial infection in which interactions within consortia of taxa play an etiologic role. The study contributes to the human microbiome data, to the understanding of the etiology of infections affecting the tonsils, and forms a basis for further insight into the consequences of the intense microbe-host interactions that take place in the tonsils.
TI  - Assessing the oral microbiota of healthy and alcohol-treated rats using whole-genome DNA probes from human bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the capacity of whole-genome DNA probes prepared from human oral bacteria to cross-react with bacteria from the oral cavity of rats, and to assess the influence of alcohol ingestion on the animals' oral biofilm. DESIGN: Twenty four mature Wistar rats were equally divided in two groups. One group (control) was fed balanced diet of rat pellets and water. The alcohol-treated group (AT) received the same diet and 20% ethanol solution. Upon euthanasia after 30 days, bacterial samples from the oral biofilm covering the animals' teeth were collected using microbrushes. Bacteria identification and quantification were performed using the DNA checkerboard hybridization method with 33 probes prepared from human oral bacteria. Signals corresponding to bacterial genome counts and percentages were compared using a Mann-Whitney U test with a significance level <0.05. RESULTS: Cross-reaction for all targeted species, except Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus mitis-like species, occurred in the control group. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Veillonella parvula-like species only produced detectable signals in the AT group. Significantly more signals were detected in the control group compared to the AT group (p=0.001). The percentage of E. coli-like species was highest in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-genome DNA probes prepared from human oral bacteria can cross-react with rats' oral bacterial species. Alcohol consumption is associated with lower levels and diversity of bacterial species in the oral cavity of rats.
TI  - Bacterial flora and extraradicular biofilm associated with the apical segment of  teeth with post-treatment apical periodontitis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microorganisms are able to survive and cause persistent infection in the extraradicular area. The aims of this study were to investigate the primary bacterial flora and the localization of extraradicular biofilm in persistent apical periodontitis lesions. METHODS: Apical root samples from root-end surgery were collected from 23 root-filled teeth with apical periodontitis. Five samples were examined for the presence of biofilm by scanning electron microscopy. Another 5 samples were examined for the presence of biofilm by Brown and Brenn-modified Gram staining. The DNA from 13 samples was processed for amplification via polymerase chain reaction and separated with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Selected bands were excised from the gel and sequenced for identification. RESULTS: The extraradicular biofilm present on the external root surface of treated teeth consisted of abundant, amorphous extracellular material and multiple bacterial species. The following species were detected in the microbial community from the apical samples: Actinomyces sp. oral, Propionibacterium, Prevotella sp. oral, Streptococcus, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Burkholderia. The prevalence of Actinomyces sp. oral and Propionibacterium were highest (84.6% and 61.5%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Extraradicular biofilm was present on the external root surface of treated teeth with persistent periapical lesions. Actinomyces sp. oral and Propionibacterium are likely important contributors to extraradicular biofilm formation and persistent periapical infection.
TI  - Molecular analysis of 16S rRNA genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  - PURPOSE: Small subunit rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Template DNA prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16S rRNA bacterial and archaeal genes. Amplicons were cloned, sequenced, and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the microorganisms present. RESULTS: Two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11 phyla, including members of the uncultivable TM7, SR1, and Chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate Synergistetes and Spirochaetes. Dialister invisus, Filifactor alocis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. Dialister invisus and F nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms. The archaeal species, Methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. Several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.
TI  - Impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (RP) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [GR]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) analysis. METHODS: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or >3 sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GR (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after treatment. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM analysis. Significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. Species that increased or persisted in high frequency in RP but were significantly reduced in GR included Bacteroidetes sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Dialister spp., Selenomonas spp., Catonella morbi, Eubacterium spp., Filifactor alocis, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus sp. OT113, Fusobacterium sp. OT203, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Streptococcus intermedius or Streptococcus constellatus, and Shuttlesworthia satelles. In contrast, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Gemella haemolysans, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Kingella oralis, Lautropia mirabilis, Neisseria elongata, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus australis, and Veillonella spp. were more associated with therapeutic success. CONCLUSION: Persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.
TI  - The subgingival microbiota of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. This comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with PLS used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) clonal analysis and the 16S rRNA-based Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: Thirteen patients with PLS from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. Subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic DNA was extracted. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the HOMIM. RESULTS: The most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were Gemella morbillorum, Gemella haemolysans, Granulicatella adiacens, Lachnospiraceae OT 100 (EI074), Parvimonas micra, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. As a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. In the HOMIM analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with PLS. Of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. The high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter spp., Capnocytophaga granulosa, G. morbillorum, P. micra, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Streptococcus spp., and Tannerella forsythia. CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival microbiota in PLS is diverse. Periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development of severe periodontitis in patients with PLS.
TI  - Electrochemically induced anatase inhibits bacterial colonization on Titanium Grade 2 and Ti6Al4V alloy for dental and orthopedic devices.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of implanted devices is a common cause of their failure.  The aim of the present study was to assess the capability of electrochemical procedures to: (a) promote the formation of anatase on the surface of commercially pure Grade 2 Ti and Ti Grade 5 (Ti6Al4V) alloy; (b) inhibit in vitro biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis and oral plaque in vivo, (c) preserve favorable response of osteoblasts and fibroblasts to materials surfaces. Ti Grade 2 and Ti Grade 5 were respectively anodized at two different voltages: 90 and 130V for pure titanium; 100 and 120V for Ti6Al4V alloy. Surface characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with EDS probe, laser profilometry and X-ray diffractometry. Bacterial adhesion characterization was performed either in vitro and in vivo in patients. Osteoblast and fibroblast response was evaluated by metabolic activity assessment. The higher voltage applied in the anodization treatment of pure titanium (130V) and Ti6Al4V alloy (120V) surfaces, compared to the untreated pure titanium and Ti6Al4V and to lower voltage treatments, resulted in a greater decrease in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. In contrast, the high voltage treatments were found to promote osteoblasts and fibroblasts proliferation. The observations indicated that the experimented high voltage anodization treatments may contribute to preserve the tissue integration and reduce bacteria colonization of titanium and titanium alloy for implantable applications.
TI  - Analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic primary root canal infections in adult Norwegian patients.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This molecular study analyzed the microbiota of primary root canal  infections from adult Norwegian patients. METHODS: Samples were taken from the necrotic root canals of teeth with symptomatic (n = 13) or asymptomatic (n = 21) apical periodontitis and chronic apical abscesses (n = 9). DNA was extracted from samples, and bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 50 candidate endodontic pathogens. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was detected in all cases. In teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis, the most frequent taxa were Dialister invisus (71%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (62%), and Porphyromonas endodontalis (62%). In chronic apical abscesses, the most prevalent taxa were P. endodontalis (100%), D. invisus (89%), Parvimonas micra (78%), and Solobacterium moorei (78%). In teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis, the most prevalent taxa were D. invisus, P. endodontalis, S. moorei, Propionibacterium acnes, and Streptococcus species (all in 69%). None of the targeted taxa were significantly associated with either sinus tract or pain (P > .05), except for Selenomonas sputigena, which was more frequently found in painful cases (P = .04). No taxa were found in significantly higher levels in any conditions (P > .05). Cluster analyses revealed bacterial groupings that differed between cases with and without pain. CONCLUSIONS: Although basically the same species were highly prevalent in the different conditions examined and none of the most prevalent taxa were positively associated with symptoms, results revealed that species formed different partnerships and associations in samples from teeth with or without pain. Therefore, it is possible that more virulent multispecies communities can form as a result of overall bacterial combinations and give rise to acute inflammation.
TI  - Comparison of the in vivo antimicrobial effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite and  chlorhexidine used as root canal irrigants: a molecular microbiology study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this clinical study was to compare the antimicrobial effects of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) when used as irrigants during treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis. METHODS: Forty-seven single-rooted single-canal teeth with necrotic pulps and asymptomatic apical periodontitis were selected for this study according to stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria. Bacterial samples were taken at the baseline (S1) and after (S2) chemomechanical preparation using 2.5% NaOCl (n = 30) or 0.12% CHX (n = 17) as the irrigant. Bacterial, archaeal, and fungal presence was evaluated by broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR), whereas bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 28 candidate endodontic pathogens. RESULTS: All S1 samples were PCR positive for bacterial presence but negative for both archaea and fungi. Both NaOCl- and CHX-based protocols were significantly effective in reducing the bacterial levels and number of taxa. No significant differences were observed between them in all tested parameters including the incidence of negative PCR results in S2 (40% for NaOCl vs 47% for CHX, p = 0.8), reduction in the number of taxa per canal (p = 0.3), and reduction in the bacterial levels (p = 0.07). The most prevalent taxa in S2 samples from the NaOCl group were Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus species, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Selenomonas sputigena. In the CHX group, the most prevalent taxa in S2 were Dialister invisus, Actinomyces israelii, Prevotella baroniae, Propionibacterium acidifaciens, and Streptococcus species. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment protocols using irrigation with either NaOCl or CHX succeeded in significantly reducing the the number of bacterial taxa and their levels in infected root canals, with no significant difference between these substances.
TI  - Apical root canal microbiota as determined by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis of cryogenically ground root samples from teeth with apical periodontitis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacteria located in the apical root canal system potentially participate in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. Detection and identification of apical bacteria can be compromised because of limitations in conventional sampling and identification procedures. This study identified several bacterial taxa in the apical and middle/coronal segments of primarily infected root canal system by using pulverized root segments and a culture-independent molecular method. METHODS: Seventeen extracted teeth with attached apical periodontitis lesions were sectioned to obtain 2 root fragments (apical and middle/coronal segments). Root fragments were cryogenically ground, and DNA was extracted from samples. After multiple displacement amplification, DNA from samples was used as template in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay targeting 28 bacterial taxa. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was detected in all samples. The most prevalent taxa in the apical root canal system were Olsenella uli (76.5%), Prevotella baroniae (71%), Porphyromonas endodontalis (65%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (53%), and Tannerella forsythia (47%). O. uli, P. endodontalis, and Propionibacterium acnes were as frequently detected in apical samples as they were in middle/coronal samples. P. baroniae, T. forsythia, and F. nucleatum were found more frequently in the apical part of the canal as compared with matched coronal segments. Streptococcus species were more prevalent in middle/coronal samples. The median and mean of shared bacterial taxa between matched apical and middle/coronal segments were 27% and 41%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Several candidate endodontic pathogens were very prevalent in the apical root canal system. The apical microbiota was usually complex and differed in species composition when compared with the microbiota of middle/coronal samples from the same tooth.
TI  - Surgical endodontic treatment of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study explored the effect of surgical endodontic treatment of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm. STUDY DESIGN: Endodontic surgery was conducted on a case of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm. During the procedure, the samples of periapical tissues were collected for microbiologic analysis. The resected root ends were observed under scanning electron microscope. The patient was recalled every 3 months to evaluate the treatment effect for 1 year. RESULTS: The samples yielded 1 type of facultative anaerobic bacteria (Streptococcus sanguis) and 2 types of obligate anaerobic bacteria (Porphynomonas endodontalis and Prevotella oralis). Mature bacteria biofilms were formed on the surface of the root apexes. At the 1-year recall visit, the radiograph and the clinic examination showed the refractory periapical periodontitis was cured successfully. CONCLUSIONS: The periapical bacterial biofilm may contribute to the refractory periapical periodontitis. Endodontic surgery is a good option for definitive removal of an established extraradicular infection.
TI  - Bacteria in the apical root canal of teeth with primary apical periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacteria settled in the apical root canal are in a privileged position to inflict damage to the periradicular tissues. Therefore, the species identified in this region can be of special relevance for the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. This study investigated the occurrence and levels of several bacterial taxa in the apical root canal of teeth with apical periodontitis. STUDY DESIGN: DNA extracts from samples taken from the apical part of the root canal of extracted teeth evincing chronic apical periodontitis lesions served as templates for analysis of the presence and levels of 28 bacterial species/phylotypes using a 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was detected in 19 out of 20 samples. Detected taxa included Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (32%), Bacteroidetes clone X083 (26%), Streptococcus species (21%), Olsenella uli (10.5%), Synergistes clone BA121 (10.5%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (10.5%), Porphyromonas endodontalis (10.5%), Dialister clone BS016 (5%), Filifactor alocis (5%), Parvimonas micra (5%), and Treponema denticola (5%). Of these, only Bacteroidetes clone X083 and Synergistes clone BA121 were found at levels above 10(5). CONCLUSION: Occurrence of these bacterial taxa in the apical part of infected root canals indicates their potential pathogenetic role in the etiology of apical periodontitis.
TI  - The impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and who ate a diet available in the Stone Age. METHODS: Ten subjects living in an environment replicating the Stone Age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. Bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (PD) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization methods. RESULTS: No subject had periodontitis. Mean BOP decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (P <0.001). Mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (P <0.001). PD at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; P <0.001). At week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (P <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including Bacteroides ureolyticus, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosis, and Streptococcus mitis. Bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (P <0.001) for 20 species, including Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and Streptococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., Stone Age) does not include refined sugars. Although plaque levels increased, BOP and PD decreased. Subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.
TI  - The microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  - As the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. We hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. Abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. Associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. The most prevalent taxa were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, and Porphyromonas endodontalis. Other frequently found taxa included Olsenella uli, streptococci, Eikenella corrodens, some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (Bacteroidetes clone X083 and Synergistes clone BA121), and newly named species (Prevotella baroniae and Dialister invisus). Several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. Findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in persistent periapical lesions on root-filled teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to analyze the bacterial diversity in persistent apical lesions on root-filled teeth by using culture-independent molecular methods. DESIGN: Twenty surgically removed apical lesions from therapy-resistant teeth were examined for the presence of bacterial DNA using PCR targeting the 16s ribosomal RNA gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was detected in 17 of the 20 samples (85%). A total of 236 clones were analyzed. Seven different bacterial phyla were represented and a total of 75 different bacterial taxa were identified; 36% of the species have not yet been cultivated. Commonly detected bacterial species included Fusobacterium spp., Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Treponema denticola, Bacteroidetes spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of bacteria was identified in periapical lesions on therapy-resistant teeth. These bacteria may contribute in the etiology of periapical infection and impede healing of these lesions.
TI  - An agar diffusion comparison of the antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide at  five different concentrations with three different vehicles.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if varying the percent (by weight) of  aqueous calcium hydroxide or using different vehicles had an effect on its antibacterial efficacy against common endodontic pathogens in a pour plate/traditional streak agar diffusion model. Mixtures of calcium hydroxide powder and sterile saline in 40, 50 and 60 percent concentrations and the commercial preparations UltraCal XS and Vitapex were tested against six known endodontic pathogens with an agar diffusion method. Each medicament was placed in one of five wells, in each of 10 agar plates (n = 10), for cultures of each bacterial species. Zones of inhibition were measured after 48 hours incubation for aerobes and 96 hours incubation for anaerobes. Multiple one-way analyses of variance and post-hoc Student Neuman Keuls evaluated the data at alpha = 0.05. Larger zones of inhibition were consistently observed for higher concentrations of calcium hydroxide with statistical significance among the bacteria, particularly between 40% and 60%. Vitapex had significantly smaller zones of inhibition than all other medicaments and 35% UltraCal XS with methylcellulose was nearly as effective as 50% Ca(OH)(2) in inhibitory activity. Formulations containing 50-60% Ca(OH)(2) or 35% Ca(OH)(2) with aqueous methylcellulose are recommended as endodontic interappointment medicaments.
TI  - PCR-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using PCR method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. The presence of selected pathogens (Actinomyces israelii, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus intermedius, Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra, Tannerella forsythensis, Enterococcus faecium, Prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using PCR. RESULTS: T. denticola (P = .012, .02) and E. faecalis (P = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while P. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (P = .01, .015). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  - AIM: To examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. METHODOLOGY: Samples were collected by means of a size 15 H-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. The presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: The species found at the highest levels and prevalence were Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter gracilis and Neisseria mucosa. Total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: P > 0.05). E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (Mann-Whitney test, P < 0.05). Higher levels of P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. Leptotrichia buccalis (OR = 1.83; CI 95%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (OR = 2.15; CI 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. CONCLUSIONS: Primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species. Specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.
TI  - Comparative study of the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gel, chlorhexidine solution and sodium hypochlorite as endodontic irrigants.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate gel as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance compared to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. The antimicrobial efficacy of the tested substances was evaluated using the agar diffusion test. The growth inhibition zones produced by 0.2%, 1% and 2% chlorhexidine gel were evaluated against 5 facultative anaerobic bacteria and 4 pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes, and compared to the results obtained by NaOCl and chlorhexidine solution. The largest growth inhibition zones were produced when the test bacteria were in contact with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel (11.79 mm), being significantly different (p<0.05) from the growth inhibition zones produced by all NaOCl concentrations, including 5.25% (9.54 mm). However, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the growth inhibition zones obtained with equal concentrations of chlorhexidine solution and gel. The results of this study indicate that, as far as its antimicrobial properties are concerned, chlorhexidine gel has a great potential to be used as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance.
TI  - Improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. However, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) origins is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. To minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. METHODS: GeneScan-1000 ROX was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (MW) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16S recombinant RNA gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis. Using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of the conventional method. Microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new MW size definition. Bacterial species were assigned to peaks using TRFMA, a Web-based tool for T-RFLP analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. RESULTS: Using the new size definition, the average sizing error for 40 T-RFs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. More than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by T-RFLP. CONCLUSION: The size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the T-RFLP analysis. This provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. METHODS: Samples were collected from the root canals using #15 Hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization techniques. RESULTS: The mean number of species per sample was 22. Enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), Campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), Leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), Neisseria mucosa (87.5%), Prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), Eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), Streptococcus anginosus (75%), and Veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. The species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), E. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), E. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), N. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), V. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), C. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), Treponema socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), Micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), Prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). Most of these species were also found in high proportions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  - Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. Nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the Ribosomal Database Project II database. Phylotypes from 37 genera representing Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria were identified. Results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythensis and Treponema denticola. Since members of the domain Archaea have been implicated in the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16S archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. A Methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. DNA from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. Trep. denticola was detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. Conversely, Porph. endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. All other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers in both patients. These results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic infections associated with clinical symptoms.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices Activ Point (chlorhexidine; Roeko) and Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. The efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (Friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's signed rank test). RESULTS: Activ Point produced significantly larger inhibition zones (P < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: The chlorhexidine slow-release device (Activ Point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.
TI  - A new checkerboard panel for testing bacterial markers in periodontal disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Various microbiological methods have been used for testing bacterial markers for periodontitis and periodontal disease progression. Most studies have used only a limited number of well recognized bacterial species. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association of 13 more recently identified bacterial species in a new panel in comparison with 12 previously more recognized periodontotopathogens ('old panel') using the 'checkerboard' DNA-DNA hybridization method. METHODS: Fifty individuals were chosen who showed at least one site with a probing pocket depth of 6 mm or more (disease) and bleeding on probing and at least one site with a probing pocket depth of 3 mm and without bleeding on probing (health). One diseased and one healthy site on each individual were sampled with the paperpoint technique and the samples were processed in the checkerboard technique against deoxigenin-labeled whole genomic probes to 25 subgingival species representing 12 well recognized and 13 newly identified periodontitis associated species. RESULTS: Twenty-four (out of 25) species were detected more frequently in the subgingival plaque of diseased than healthy sites both at score 1 (> 10(4)) and score 3 (> 10(5)). A significant difference at the higher score (score 3) was noticed for all species of the old panel except for three (Streptococcus intermedius, Selenomonas noxia, and Eikenella corrodens). Of the species in the new panel only Prevotella tannerae, Filifactor alocis, and Porphyromonas endodontalis showed a statistical significant difference between diseased and healthy sites. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that P. tannerae, F. alocis, and P. endodontalis should be added to the 12 species used for routine diagnostics of periodontitis-associated bacterial flora.
TI  - Microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). Strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. RESULTS: A total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. Individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. Of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. The anaerobes most frequently isolated were: Peptostreptococcus micros (35%), Fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). The root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. On the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. Suggested relationships were found between anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (P<0.05). In particular, associations were found between: a) pain (n=29) and P. micros (P<0.01), P. intermedia/nigrescens and Eubacterium spp. (both P<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and P. micros (P<0.01) Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and Porphyromonas spp. (P<0.01), Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P<0.01), Porphyromonas and Enterococcus spp. (P<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus spp., P. micros, F. necrophorum (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. They also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.
TI  - Production of monoclonal antibody inhibiting dipeptidylaminopeptidase IV activity of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative anaerobic bacterial species implicated as an important pathogen in the development of adult periodontitis. We previously cloned a gene encoding dipeptydilaminopeptidase IV (DAPIV) from P. gingivalis. In the present study, for immunological diagnosis and development of passive immunization, we produced a mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) capable of inhibiting the DAPIV activity of P. gingivalis using highly purified recombinant DAPIV as an immunogen. The constructed MAb, designated as MAb-Pg-DAP-1, significantly inhibited DAPIV activity in P. gingivalis, as well as slightly inhibited that in other gram-negative bacteria such as Porphyromonas endodontalis and Prevotella loesheii, whereas no inhibition was seen in the gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces viscosus. Furthermore, the MAb did not inhibit DAPIV enzyme activity in human serum. This novel MAb may be useful for the development of immunological diagnosis capability and in passive immunization.
TI  - The subgingival microflora in phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Microbial flora and gingival conditions were compared between a group of patients with phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia as a test group, a control group of patients who were administered phenytoin without gingival hyperplasia and a blank group who took no phenytoin and no gingival hyperplasia in mentally retarded patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were collected from a PHT-induced overgrown gingival pocket and microbiological experiments were performed by culture and PCR methods. RESULTS: The predominant genera in total cultivable bacteria from subgingival plaque samples were streptococcus and actinomyces with recovery ranges of 37.6-42.1% and 23.4-25.5% of total bacteria, respectively, in all groups. The test group showed a significantly higher level of obligate Gram-negative rods than the control and blank groups. Black-pigmented obligate anaerobic Gram-negative rods were detected in 10.3% of total cultivable bacteria in the test group. The black-pigmented rods were predominantly Prevotella intermedia in the test group and Prevotella nigrescens in the control and blank groups. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas endodontalis were also detected in the test group with small values. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that black-pigmented rods, particularly P. intermedia, could be habitable in the environment of gingival hyperplasia.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  - Self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. The antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond, Imperva FL Bond, One-Up BondF and Prompt L-Pop were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC25175, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus catenaforme, Lactobacillus jensenii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Clostridium ramosum, Prevotella oris, Prevotella denticola and Fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. A single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (Excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. After incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. One-Up BondF, Prompt L-Pop and Excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. The bonding agents of Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond and Imperva FL Bond were unable to inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus jensenii and Actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.
TI  - Microbial susceptibility to calcium hydroxide pastes and their vehicles.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of some microorganisms commonly isolated from root canals to calcium hydroxide in combination with several vehicles by the agar diffusion method. Stainless-steel cylinders were placed on each inoculated agar medium. The test medications and their controls were placed inside the cylinders. The zones of growth inhibition were measured and recorded after the incubation period for each plate, and the results were analyzed statistically. Enterococcus faecalis was most resistant, whereas the anaerobic Porphyromonas endodontalis was more susceptible to all medications, followed by P. gingivalis and Prevotella intermedial intermedia. Ca(OH)2 + CMCP + glycerin showed significantly larger mean zones of inhibition when compared with the other medications. We conclude that anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to calcium hydroxide pastes than facultative Gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - PCR-based identification of bacteria associated with endodontic infections.
AB  - PCR primers that target the bacterial 16S rRNA genes (or the tuf gene for the genus Enterococcus) were used to identify 10 putative bacterial pathogens in root canals with necrotic pulp. In addition, the associations of these microorganisms with symptoms and a history of diabetes mellitus were investigated. Microbial samples from the root canals of 24 teeth with necrotic pulp were included in the study. PCR with universal bacterial primers identified bacterial DNA in 22 specimens; the remaining 2 specimens were from intact teeth that had been traumatized 6 months prior to treatment. PCR with specific primers showed that preoperative symptoms were significantly associated with the presence of Streptococcus spp. (P < 0.001 by chi-square analysis). There was also a nonsignificant trend for symptoms to be associated with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis (odds ratio, >2) and for diabetes mellitus to be associated with P. gingivalis and Porphyromonas endodontalis (odds ratio, >2). Cloning and sequencing of the universal PCR product in one specimen revealed the presence of an organism related to the genus Olsenella, which has not previously been described in endodontic infections.
TI  - An optimal host response to a bacterium may require the interaction of leukocytes and resident host cells.
AB  - Bacterial infection results in inflammatory responses that may lead to soft-tissue damage and bone resorption. However, the mechanisms by which different bacteria contribute to lesions of endodontic origin are not fully understood. This study examined the response to Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas endodontalis in two cell types that are involved in periapical pathology, mononuclear and osteoblastic cells. This was accomplished by measuring the induction of chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-2) and proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, interferon-gamma). The results demonstrated that S. mutans more efficiently stimulate inflammatory cytokine production by mononuclear cells, whereas P. endodontalis is relatively more potent in activating osteoblastic cells. Moreover, optimal activation of osteoblastic cells by S. mutans requires soluble mediators produced by mononuclear cells, whereas P. endodontalis does not. These results suggest that the association of different bacteria with specific pathologic processes may be partially explained by their capacities to activate specific host cells.
TI  - T lymphocyte subpopulations and interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-4 in rat pulpitis experimentally induced by specific bacteria.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the expression of surface markers  on T lymphocytes and the Th1/Th2 immune response in pulpal inflammation associated with specific bacteria. Pulpal inflammation was experimentally induced in rat mandibular incisors by drilling, without coolant, to open pulp chambers. Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans group), Porphyromonas endodontalis (P. endodontalis group), and a sterile cotton pellet only (control group) were inoculated in the canal. The expression of CD25 and CD54 on CD4+, and CD8+ lymphocytes in pulp tissues was determined by using a flow cytometer. The levels of interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and IL-4 were measured by ELISA. Flow-cytometric analysis showed that the mean ratio of CD4+:CD8+ was 0.96 in the control group, 0.99 in the S. mutans group, and 0.52 in the P. endodontalis group. An increase in CD25 and CD54 expression on CD4+ T lymphocytes was related to the bacterial infection (p < 0.05) and accompanied an increase in IL-2 concentration. The higher concentration of IFN-gamma than IL-4 in the P. endodontalis group suggested a Th1 reaction in the early stage of pulpal inflammation induced by P. endodontalis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers against endodontic pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic pathogens. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (AH26, AH plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (N2), and one calcium hydroxide-based sealer (Sealapex). The testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia). The freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. After varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. All the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial activity. The sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types and bacterial strains. N2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. The extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of fifth-generation dentin bonding systems.
AB  - Past concepts that the pulp does not become infected until an actual carious exposure takes place have been challenged. The antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems Single Bond, Prime&Bond NT, and Excite were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus intermedius, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella oris, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Clostridium ramosum with a disk diffusion method. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. After incubation zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. Prime&Bond NT showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans were remarkably resistant to Single Bond, whereas EX produced no inhibitory effect on Porphyromonas endodontalis, although the adhesive produced the maximum halo inhibition to Streptococcus mutans (15+/-1 mm), showing an antibacterial effect closest to chlorhexidine. The variety of results obtained in this study suggest that antibacterial properties of current dentin adhesives may depend on components that are originally incorporated to promote adhesion.
TI  - Assessment of periradicular microbiota by DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - In the present study the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. Thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. In Group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in Group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. The gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. Bacterial DNA was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. The mean number (+/- SD) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in Group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). The majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from Group 1 than from Group 2. The differences were most notable for Campylobacter gracilis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Streptococcus constellatus and Actinomyces naeslundii I. Bacterial species such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. Also, P. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. The data supported the idea that following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. The study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. The detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and Arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  - Arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. They possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. Although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. Also, the antimicrobial activity of Arnica has not been extensively investigated. Therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by Arnica and propolis extracts. Arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from Minas Gerais State were compared with controls. Fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: Candida albicans--NTCC 3736, F72; Staphylococcus aureus--ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis--ATCC 29212; Streptococcus sobrinus 6715; Strep. sanguis--ATCC 10556; Strep. cricetus--HS-6; Strep. mutans--Ingbritt 1600; Strep. mutans--OMZ 175; Actinomyces naeslundii--ATCC 12104, W 1053; Act. viscosus OMZ 105; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Porph. endodontalis and Prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). Antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. To assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. To assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 M sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. Arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. The propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for Actinomyces spp. The Arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. Cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. The Arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for Strep. mutans and 15% for Strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same concentrations. Thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the Arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.
TI  - Bacterium-dependent induction of cytokines in mononuclear cells and their pathologic consequences in vivo.
AB  - Viridans streptococci are a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria that are normal inhabitants of the mouth. These organisms are thought to contribute significantly to the etiology of infective endocarditis, although recently they have been implicated in serious infections in other settings. Another group of oral bacteria, gram-negative anaerobes, is associated with chronic dental infections, such as periodontal diseases or endodontic lesion formation. We evaluated the ability of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas endodontalis to induce a pathogenic response in vivo, with the goal of quantifying the inflammatory response in soft tissue by measuring leukocyte recruitment and hard tissues by measuring osteoclastogenesis. S. mutans induced a strong inflammatory response and was a potent inducer of osteoclast formation, while P. endodontalis was not. To further study the mechanisms by which P. endodontalis and S. mutans elicit significantly different levels of inflammatory responses in vivo, we tested the capacity of each to induce production of cytokines by mononuclear cells in vitro. S. mutans stimulated high levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12), gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), all of which are associated with inflammation, enhanced monocyte function, and generation of a Th1 response. In contrast, P. endodontalis stimulated production of IL-10 but not of TNF-alpha, IL-12, or IFN-gamma. These results demonstrate that oral pathogens differ dramatically in their abilities to induce inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines. Moreover, there is a high degree of correlation between the cytokine profile induced by these bacteria in vitro and their pathogenic capacity in vivo.
TI  - Endodontic pathogens stimulate monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-8 in mononuclear cells.
AB  - Microbial infection of the dental pulp leads to the recruitment of leukocytes and the formation of lesions of endodontic origin. The chemokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) are relatively specific chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. In the present studies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated by Streptococcus mutants, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which are associated with lesions of endodontic origin. Each of these bacteria induced a dose-dependent increase in IL-8 and MCP-1, determined by ELISA. The levels induced are physiologically relevant. However, low doses of P. endodontalis were less effective in inducing IL-8 or MCP-1 expression, compared with S. mutants or P. anaerobius. Thus, these bacteria can induce significant levels of the chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1, which could contribute to the recruitment of neutrophils or monocytes in vivo. The expression of these mediators may contribute to the development of endodontic infections, particularly with regard to inflammatory leukocyte recruitment.
TI  - Phototoxicity of argon laser irradiation on biofilms of Porphyromonas and Prevotella species.
AB  - Species of Prevotella (Pr.) and Porphyromonas (Po.) and other microorganisms were cultivated as biofilms on agar medium and examined for their susceptibility to argon laser irradiation (continuous mode; wavelengths, 488-514 nm; fluences, 20-200 J cm(-2)). Fluences of 35 to 80 J cm(-2) inhibited biofilm growth in Po. endodontalis, Po. gingivalis, Pr. denticola, Pr. intermedia, Pr. melaninogenica and Pr. nigrescens. A fluence of 70 J cm(-2) did not affect biofilm growth in species of Bacillus, Candida, Enterobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. The phototoxic effects of argon laser irradiation against Prevotella and Porphyromonas species were: (1) caused by the radiation alone; (2) modified by biofilm age; (3) dependent on the presence of atmospheric oxygen; (4) influenced by medium supplements of hemin, hemoglobin and blood; (5) greater when compared with other microbial species; (6) demonstrated without augmentation with an exogenous photosensitizer; and (7) apparently unrelated to the protoporphyrin content of the cells. Overall, these in vitro findings suggest that low doses of argon laser radiation may be effective in the treatment and/or prevention of clinical infections caused by biofilm-associated species of Prevotella or Porphyromonas.
TI  - Studies into the microbial spectrum of apical periodontitis.
AB  - This study examined the variety of obligate and facultative anaerobic bacterial species recovered from cases of acute apical periodontitis. A total of 19 root canal samples and 24 periapical granuloma samples were taken from patients suffering pain and discomfort. Bacteria were identified by applying the following techniques: culturing on various media, Gram-staining and using commercially available biochemical test strips. In addition, Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas endodontalis were differentiated on a molecular genetic level using species-specific oligodeoxynucleotide probes. The most frequently identified bacteria were Prevotella intermedia, Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus milleri-group and Bacteroides spp. Obligate anaerobes occurred at a rate of 82.3%, and the average number of isolates was 6.4 per sample.
TI  - Degradation of immunoglobulin G by periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a substrate for growth. This was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with IgG. Stimulation of growth was observed for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella oralis, Lactobacillus catenaforme and Streptococcus intermedius. Immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a protein assay demonstrated that P. intermedia and P. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of IgG. Partial breakdown of IgG was observed for P. asaccharolytica and C. ochracea, whereas P. oralis cleaved the IgG heavy chain, yielding Fc and Fab fragments. All these bacteria utilized IgG as a substrate for growth. Binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific IgG with P. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with P. intermedia, P. gingivalis, C. ochracea or Fusobacterium nucleatum. Degradation or inactivation of IgG by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.
TI  - Black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections.
AB  - Necrotic dental root canal infections are polymicrobial infections dominated by anaerobic bacteria. The number of different species in one canal is usually low, approx. 4-7 species. The species isolated most frequently belong to the genera Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium and Streptococcus. The frequency of isolation of black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections varies from 25% to > 50%. Pr. intermedia is the most commonly found pigmented species, followed by Pr. denticola and two Porphyromonas species, P. gingivalis and P. endodontalis. Several studies have shown that P. gingivalis and P. endodontalis are closely related to the presence of acute symptoms in endodontic infections, whereas other black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes are not. However, several other species may also be involved in acute infections. Moreover, Porphyromonas species have occasionally been isolated from cases with no symptoms. Although Porphyromonas spp. are clearly related to symptoms at the beginning of therapy, they are not important for the prognosis of the treatment.
TI  - Identification of proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria as activators of latent human neutrophil and fibroblast-type interstitial collagenases.
AB  - Activation of latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases as well as degradation of native type I collagen by supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts, an 80-kDa trypsinlike protease from Porphyromas gingivalis (ATCC 33277), a 95-kDa chymotrypsinlike protease from Treponema denticola (ATCC 29522), and selected bacterial species commonly isolated in periodontitis was studied. The bacteria included were Prevotella intermedia (ATCC 25261), Prevotella buccae (ES 57), Prevotella oris (ATCC 33573), Porphyromonas endodontalis (ES 54b), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (ATCC 295222), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 10953), Mitsuokella dentalis (DSM 3688), and Streptococcus mitis (ATCC 15909). None of the bacteria activated latent procollagenases; however, both sub- and supragingival dental plaque extracts (neutral salt extraction) and proteases isolated from cell extracts from potentially periodontopathogenic bacteria P. gingivalis and T. denticola were found to activate latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases. The fibroblast-type interstitial collagenase was more efficiently activated by bacterial proteases than the neutrophil counterpart, which instead preferred nonproteolytic activation by the oxidative agent hypochlorous acid. The proteases were not able to convert collagenase tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) complexes into active form or to change the ability of TIMP-1 to inhibit interstitial collagenase. None of the studied bacteria, proteases from P. gingivalis and T. denticola, or extracts of supra- and subgingival dental plaque showed any significant collagenolytic activity. However, the proteases degraded native and denatured collagen fragments after cleavage by interstitial collagenase and gelatinase. Our results indicate that proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria can act as direct proteolytic activators of human procollagenases and degrade collagen fragments. Thus, in concert with host enzymes the bacterial proteases may participate in periodontal tissue destruction.
TI  - Associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  - The existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. Samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. The most frequent species were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Eubacterium alactolyticum, Eubacterium lentum and Wolinella recta. An odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. Strong positive associations were found between F. nucleatum and P. micros, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Selenomonas sputigena and W. recta. There was also a positive association between P. intermedia and P. micros, P. anaerobius and the eubacteria. In general, species of streptococci, Propionibacterium propionica, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. The results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.
TI  - The formation of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan by oral bacteria.
AB  - The capacity to form volatile sulfur compounds was tested in bacteria isolated from subgingival microbiotas and in a representative number of reference strains. A majority of the 75 tested oral bacterial species and 7 unnamed bacterial taxa formed significant amounts of hydrogen sulfide from L-cysteine. The most active bacteria were found in the genera Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Selenomonas, Centipeda, Bacteroides and Fusobacterium. Methyl mercaptan from L-methionine was formed by some members of the genera Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas and Eubacterium. When incubated in serum for 7 d, the most potent producers of hydrogen sulfide were Treponema denticola and the black-pigmented species, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides loescheii, Porphyromonas endodontalis and Porphyromonas gingivalis. P. endodontalis and P. gingivalis also produced significant amounts of methyl mercaptan in serum. No other volatile sulfur compound was detected in serum or in the presence of L-cysteine and L-methionine. These findings significantly increase the list of oral bacteria known to produce volatile sulfur compounds.
