TI  - Microbial diversity in failed endodontic root-filled teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent/secondary infections of human root canals play an important role in the failure of endodontic treatment. This study used 16S rRNA sequencing to assess microbial diversity in root-filled teeth associated with failed endodontic treatment. METHODS: DNA was extracted from 15 teeth with persistent intraradicular infections, and the 16S rRNA of all present bacteria were amplified by PCR, followed by cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA amplicons. RESULTS: All sample extracts were positive for PCR amplification using the universal 16S rRNA gene primers. Negative control reactions yielded no amplicons. Sixty-five phylotypes belonging to seven phyla were identified from 760 clones; a mean of 9.4 phylotypes were detected in each sample (range 3 - 15). Twenty-eight phylotypes were detected in more than one sample, revealing a high inter-sample variability. Parvimonas micra (60%, 9/15), Solobacterium moore (47%, 7/15), Dialister invisus (33%, 5/15), Enterococcus faecalis (33%, 5/15), Filifactor alocis (27%, 4/15), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (27%, 4/15) were the prevalent species. Nineteen as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes were identified, comprising a substantial proportion of the bacteria in many cases. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent intraradicular infections were present in all root-filled teeth associated with failed endodontic treatment. The current observations reveal new candidate endodontic pathogens, including as-yet-uncultivated bacteria and phylotypes that may participate in the mixed infections associated with post-treatment apical periodontitis.
TI  - Analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic primary root canal infections in adult Norwegian patients.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This molecular study analyzed the microbiota of primary root canal  infections from adult Norwegian patients. METHODS: Samples were taken from the necrotic root canals of teeth with symptomatic (n = 13) or asymptomatic (n = 21) apical periodontitis and chronic apical abscesses (n = 9). DNA was extracted from samples, and bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 50 candidate endodontic pathogens. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was detected in all cases. In teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis, the most frequent taxa were Dialister invisus (71%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (62%), and Porphyromonas endodontalis (62%). In chronic apical abscesses, the most prevalent taxa were P. endodontalis (100%), D. invisus (89%), Parvimonas micra (78%), and Solobacterium moorei (78%). In teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis, the most prevalent taxa were D. invisus, P. endodontalis, S. moorei, Propionibacterium acnes, and Streptococcus species (all in 69%). None of the targeted taxa were significantly associated with either sinus tract or pain (P > .05), except for Selenomonas sputigena, which was more frequently found in painful cases (P = .04). No taxa were found in significantly higher levels in any conditions (P > .05). Cluster analyses revealed bacterial groupings that differed between cases with and without pain. CONCLUSIONS: Although basically the same species were highly prevalent in the different conditions examined and none of the most prevalent taxa were positively associated with symptoms, results revealed that species formed different partnerships and associations in samples from teeth with or without pain. Therefore, it is possible that more virulent multispecies communities can form as a result of overall bacterial combinations and give rise to acute inflammation.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - New bacterial compositions in root-filled teeth with periradicular lesions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to isolate and detect microorganisms of root-filled teeth associated with periradicular lesions. Specimens were sampled from patients undergoing root canal retreatment. The bacteria were characterized by morphologic and biochemical analysis and by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Microorganisms were detected in 10 of 18 teeth. The majority of positive samples revealed a mixed culture of 2-8 species. In 2 teeth Enterococcus faecalis was the only detected species. For the first time Vagococcus fluvialis was detected in root canals. Solobacterium moorei and Fusobacterium nucleatum were the most prevalent species. Presence of F. nucleatum was associated with the presence of S. moorei in 5 of 7 cases. In all teeth with Parvimonas micra and Dialister invisus, F. nucleatum and S. moorei were found. Moreover, members of additional different genera were detected delivering bacterial compositions that have been not described yet.
TI  - The microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  - As the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. We hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. Abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. Associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. The most prevalent taxa were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, and Porphyromonas endodontalis. Other frequently found taxa included Olsenella uli, streptococci, Eikenella corrodens, some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (Bacteroidetes clone X083 and Synergistes clone BA121), and newly named species (Prevotella baroniae and Dialister invisus). Several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. Findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.
