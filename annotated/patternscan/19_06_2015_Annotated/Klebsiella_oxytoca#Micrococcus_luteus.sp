TI  == biofilms on tracheoesophageal voice prostheses: a confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstration of mixed bacterial and yeast biofilms.
AB  == the aim of this study was to demonstrate the presence of yeast and bacterial biofilms on the surface of tracheoesophageal voice prostheses (tvps) by a double-staining technique with confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). biofilms of 12 removed tvps were visualized by scanning electron microscopy, then stained with cona-fitc and propidium iodide for clsm. microbial identification was by partial 16s rrna gene analysis and its-2 sequence analysis. microbial biofilms on the tvps consisted of bacteria and filamentous cells. bacterial cells were attached to the filamentous and unicellular yeast cells, thus forming a network. sequence analyses of six voice prostheses identified the presence of a variety of bacterial and yeast species. in vivo studies showed that klebsiella oxytoca and micrococcus luteus efficiently attached to candida albicans. clsm with double fluorescence staining can be used to demonstrate biofilm formations composed of a mixture of yeast and bacterial cells on the surface of tvps.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ganoderma lucidum extract alone and in combination with some antibiotics.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of gl (the aqueous extract from the carpophores of ganoderma lucidum (fr)karst) was tested in vitro against gram positive and gram negative bacteria by serial broth dilution method, and the antimicrobial activity was expressed by minimal inhibitory concentration (mic). among fifteen species of bacteria tested, the antimicrobial activity of gl was the most potent against micrococcus luteus (mic, 0.75 mg/ml). to investigate the effects of antimicrobial combinations of gl with four kinds of antibiotics (ampicillin, cefazolin, oxytetracycline and chloramphenicol), the fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici) was determined by checkerboard assay for each strain. the antimicrobial combinations of gl with four antibiotics resulted in additive effect in most instances, synergism in two instances, and antagonism in two instances. synergism was observed when gl was combined with cefazolin against bacillus subtilis and klebsiella oxytoca.
