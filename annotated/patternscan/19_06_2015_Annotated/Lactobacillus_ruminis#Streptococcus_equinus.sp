TI  == changes in faecal bacteria associated with concentrate and forage-only diets fed  to horses in training.
AB  == reasons for performing study: diets rich in readily fermentable carbohydrates, fed traditionally to meet the increased energy requirements of the performance horse, are associated with a number of gastrointestinal disorders that involve disturbances in the intestinal microbiota, however, these changes are poorly understood. objectives: with the long-term objective of improving intestinal health and to increase understanding of the relationship between diet and microbiota, the effect of feeding standardbred horses a high-energy forage-only (f) diet was studied compared to a more traditional forage-concentrate (c) diet on faecal microbiota. methods: diets were fed in a cross-over design to 6 mature  geldings on a scheduled training regime, both periods consisting of 29 days. dna  was extracted from faecal samples collected at 4 time points from each period, bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified and community composition assessed by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism, cloning and sequencing. faecal ph and cultivable lactic acid bacteria (lab) and enterobacteria were also assessed on the final collection day of each period. results: diet f resulted in  a microbial composition that was more stable between sampling periods and had lower counts (p < 0.05) of cultivable lab and specifically members of the streptococcus bovislequinus complex. motile and swarming lactobacillus ruminis was present in all horses on diet c and not in horses on diet f. diet c also resulted in the increase (p < 0.05) in members of clostridiaceae cluster iii and  a concomitant reduction (p < 0.05) in an unknown group of bacteroidales. conclusions and potential relevance: the greater microbial stability and reduction in lab and members of the streptococcus bovis/equinus complex on diet f indicate an opportunity to develop feeding strategies that support equine health  and welfare. novel changes identified in the faecal microbiota that resulted from carbohydrate inclusion merit further investigation.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

TI  == diet influences the ecology of lactic acid bacteria and escherichia coli along the digestive tract of cattle: neural networks and 16s rdna.
AB  == in this manuscript, the authors have sought to gain a better understanding of the interactions between escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from rogossa mrs agar along the digestive tract of grain- and forage-fed cattle.  e. coli from cattle receiving a high-grain diet were more numerous (p<0.05) than  from the high-forage diet and the highest numbers were in the faeces. isolates on rogossa mrs agar were always greater in the high-grain diet (p<0.05) and contained a significant number of lab. a random set of rogossa mrs agar colonies  was selected and artificial neural networks were used to develop a relationship between colony description and species which was validated using sequence analysis (16s rdna). the neural networks correctly predicted species in more than 80 % of cases and was composed, primarily, of lactobacillus vitulinus, lactobacillus ruminis, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus bovis, acidaminococcus fermentans and megasphaera elsdenii. in conjunction with statistical diversity indices, it was demonstrated that diversity in the high-fibre diet was always lower and was a consequence of the dominance of str. bovis. in contrast, the diversity in the high-grain diet was greater (p<0.05) and was a consequence of the decline in str. bovis. these data demonstrate that there is a positive relationship between coliform and lab isolates throughout the digestive tract of cattle, and diet is the major factor regulating bacterial composition.

TI  == effects of lasalocid or monensin on lactate-producing or -using rumen bacteria.
AB  == lasalocid or monensin inhibited most of the lactate-producing rumen bacteria (butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, eubacterium cellulosolvens, e. ruminantium, lachnospira multiparus, lactobacillus ruminis, l. vitulinus, ruminococcus albus,  r. flavefaciens, streptococcus bovis). minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from .38 to 3.0 micrograms/ml. among the lactate producers, those that produce succinate as a major end product (bacteroides, selenomonas, succinimonas, succinivibrio) were not inhibited by lasalocid or monensin. also, none of the major lactate fermenters (anaerovibrio, megasphaera, selenomonas) was inhibited by lasalocid or monensin. veillonella alcalescens was inhibited by 24 micrograms/ml of lasalocid but was resistant to monensin. hence, the reported increase in propionate in lasalocid- or monensin-fed cattle may result from selection for succinate producers and lactate fermenters. lasalocid and monensin  appeared to inhibit selectively the production of l(+), but not d(-) lactic acid. the inhibition of major lactate-producing bacteria (streptococcus and lactobacillus) suggests that lasalocid or monensin may be used to prevent lactic  acidosis in ruminants.
