TI  == identification and genetics of 6-thioguanine secreted by erwinia species and its  interference with the growth of other bacteria.
AB  == we identified a compound in culture supernatants of erwinia species, such as erwinia amylovora, e. pyrifoliae, e. billingiae, e. tasmaniensis, e. persicina and e. rhapontici absorbing at 340 nm, which was associated before with the yellow pigment produced by e. amylovora on media containing copper ions. the compound was purified from e. tasmaniensis strain et1/99 supernatants by chromatography on dowex-1 and dowex-50 columns and identified by hplc/ms and nmr  analysis as 6-thioguanine (6tg). its signal at 167 da matched with the expected molecular mass. by random mutagenesis with minitn5, we obtained mutants defective in the genes for pyrimidine and purine metabolism. a specific gene cluster with ycf genes described by us before, absent in the corresponding region of escherichia coli, was identified in the genome sequence of three erwinia species  and named tgs region for thioguanine synthesis. clones of the tgs gene cluster promoted 6tg synthesis and secretion in e. coli, when the bacteria were grown in  minimal medium supplemented with amino acids. 6tg was bacteriostatic for e. coli  and salmonella typhimurium strains, with cell growth resumed after prolonged incubation. similar results were obtained with p. agglomerans strains. bacteria from the genus pectobacterium were barely and rahnella or gibbsiella species were not inhibited by 6tg. adenine and guanine relieved the toxic effect of 6tg on e.  coli. non-producing strains were fully virulent on host plants. 6tg synthesis may help erwinias to interfere with growth of some microorganisms in the environment.

TI  == phylogenetic position and virulence apparatus of the pear flower necrosis pathogen erwinia piriflorinigrans cfbp 5888t as assessed by comparative genomics.
AB  == erwinia piriflorinigrans is a necrotrophic pathogen of pear reported from spain that destroys flowers but does not progress further into the host. we sequenced the complete genome of the type strain cfbp 5888(t) clarifying its phylogenetic position within the genus erwinia, and indicating a position between its closest  relative, the epiphyte erwinia tasmaniensis and other plant pathogenic erwinia spp. (i.e., the fire blight pathogen e. amylovora and the asian pear pathogen e.  pyrifoliae). common features are the type iii and type vi secretion systems, amylovoran biosynthesis and desferrioxamine production. the e. piriflorinigrans genome also provided the first evidence for production of the siderophore chrysobactin within the genus erwinia sensu stricto, which up to now was mostly associated with phytopathogenic, soft-rot dickeya and pectobacterium species. plasmid pepir37, reported in this strain, is closely related to small plasmids found in the fire blight pathogen e. amylovora and e. pyrifoliae. the genome of e. piriflorinigrans also gives detailed insights in evolutionary genomics of pathoadapted erwinia.

TI  == characterisation of the stbd/e toxin-antitoxin system of pep36, a plasmid of the  plant pathogen erwinia pyrifoliae.
AB  == pep36 is a plasmid ubiquitously present in erwinia pyrifoliae, a pathogen which causes black stem blight of asian pear. pep36 is highly stable in its host, even  in the absence of selective pressure. the plasmid is closely related to pea29, which is widespread in e. amylovora, the causative agent of fire blight of apple  and pear trees. here we report that pep36 possesses a functional hybrid toxin-antitoxin module, stbd/e(pep36), with the toxin showing homology to the rele/pare proteins and the antidote belonging to the phd/yefm antitoxin family. bacteria expressing the stbe(pep36) toxin arrest cell growth and enter a viable but non-culturable stage. however, they maintain their typical cell length and do not show filamentation. pulse-chase experiments revealed that stbe(pep36) acts as a global inhibitor of protein synthesis while it does not interfere with dna and  rna synthesis. the stbd(pep36) antitoxin is capable of neutralising stbe(pep36) toxicity. additional experiments show that the stbd/e(pep36) module can stabilise plasmids at least 20-fold. thus the toxin-antitoxin system may contribute to the  remarkable stability of pep36.

TI  == comparative genomics of japanese erwinia pyrifoliae strain ejp617 with closely related erwinias.
AB  == japanese erwinia pyrifoliae strains cause bacterial shoot blight of pear (bsbp) in japan. the genetics of japanese erwinia remains largely unknown relative to the abundant genomic information available for other erwinia strains. we compared the genome of japanese and korean e. pyrifoliae strains along with those of e. amylovora and e. tasmaniensis. comparisons with the korean e. pyrifoliae strain revealed numerous gene insertions/deletions, rearrangements, and inversions in the central regions of the chromosomes. approximately 80% (2843) of coding dna sequences (cdss) are shared by these two genomes which represent about three-quarters of the genome, and there are about 20% unique cdss. comparative analysis with closely related erwinias showed that 1942 (more than 50%) core open reading frames (orf) are shared by all these strains. in addition to two type iii secretion systems (hrp/dsp and inv/spa), the genome of ejp617 encodes numerous virulence factors, including a type vi secretion system, an exopolysaccharide synthesis cluster, and another protein secretion system present in plant pathogenic erwinia strains. the availability of whole genome sequence should provide a resource to further improve the understanding of pathogenesis in japanese e. pyrifoliae ejp617 and to facilitate evolutionary studies among the species of the genus erwinia.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes discriminate between rubus- and spiraeoideae-infective genotypes of erwinia amylovora.
AB  == comparative genomic analysis revealed differences in the lipopolysaccharide (lps) biosynthesis gene cluster between the rubus-infecting strain atcc baa-2158 and the spiraeoideae-infecting strain cfbp 1430 of erwinia amylovora. these differences corroborate rpob-based phylogenetic clustering of e. amylovora into four different groups and enable the discrimination of spiraeoideae- and rubus-infecting strains. the structure of the differences between the two groups  supports the hypothesis that adaptation to rubus spp. took place after species separation of e. amylovora and e. pyrifoliae that contrasts with a recently proposed scenario, based on crispr data, in which the shift to domesticated apple would have caused an evolutionary bottleneck in the spiraeoideae-infecting strains of e. amylovora which would be a much earlier event. in the core region of the lps biosynthetic gene cluster, spiraeoideae-infecting strains encode three glycosyltransferases and an lps ligase (spiraeoideae-type waal), whereas rubus-infecting strains encode two glycosyltransferases and a different lps ligase (rubus-type waal). these coding domains share little to no homology at the amino acid level between rubus- and spiraeoideae-infecting strains, and this genotypic difference was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis of the associated dna region in 31 rubus- and spiraeoideae-infecting strains. the lps biosynthesis gene cluster may thus be used as a molecular marker to distinguish between rubus- and spiraeoideae-infecting strains of e. amylovora using primers designed in this study.

TI  == differentiation of erwinia amylovora and erwinia pyrifoliae strains with single nucleotide polymorphisms and by synthesis of dihydrophenylalanine.
AB  == fire blight has spread from north america to new zealand, europe, and the mediterranean region. we were able to differentiate strains from various origins  with a novel pcr method. three single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in the erwinia amylovora genome were characteristic of isolates from north america and could distinguish them from isolates from other parts of the world. they were derived from the gale, acrb, and hrpa genes of strains ea273 and ea1/79. these genes were analyzed by conventional pcr (cpcr) and quantitative pcr (qpcr) with differential primer annealing temperatures. north-american e. amylovora strains were further differentiated according to their production of l: -2,5-dihydrophenylalanine (dhp) as tested by growth inhibition of the yeast rhodotorula glutinis. e. amylovora fruit tree (maloideae) and raspberry (rubus) strains were also differentiated by single strand conformational polymorphism analysis. strains from the related species erwinia pyrifoliae isolated in korea and japan were all dhp positive, but were differentiated from each other by snps  in the gale gene. differential pcr is a rapid and simple method to distinguish e. amylovora as well as e. pyrifoliae strains according to their geographical origin.

TI  == expression of lysozymes from erwinia amylovora phages and erwinia genomes and inhibition by a bacterial protein.
AB  == genes coding for lysozyme-inhibiting proteins (ivy) were cloned from the chromosomes of the plant pathogens erwinia amylovora and erwinia pyrifoliae. the  product interfered not only with activity of hen egg white lysozyme, but also with an enzyme from e. amylovora phage phiea1h. we have expressed lysozyme genes  from the genomes of three erwinia species in escherichia coli. the lysozymes expressed from genes of the e. amylovora phages phiea104 and phiea116, erwinia chromosomes and arabidopsis thaliana were not affected by ivy. the enzyme from bacteriophage phiea1h was fused at the n- or c-terminus to other peptides. compared to the intact lysozyme, a his-tag reduced its lytic activity about 10-fold and larger fusion proteins abolished activity completely. specific protease cleavage restored lysozyme activity of a gst-fusion. the bacteriophage-encoded lysozymes were more active than the enzymes from bacterial  chromosomes. viral lyz genes were inserted into a broad-host range vector, and transfer to e. amylovora inhibited cell growth. inserted in the yeast pichia pastoris, the phiea1h-lysozyme was secreted and also inhibited by ivy. here we describe expression of unrelated cloned 'silent' lyz genes from erwinia chromosomes and a novel interference of bacterial ivy proteins with a viral lysozyme.

TI  == identification of erwinia species isolated from apples and pears by differential  pcr.
AB  == many pathogenic and epiphytic bacteria isolated from apples and pears belong to the genus erwinia; these include the species e. amylovora, e. pyrifoliae, e. billingiae, e. persicina, e. rhapontici and e. tasmaniensis. identification and classification of freshly isolated bacterial species often requires tedious taxonomic procedures. to facilitate routine identification of erwinia species, we have developed a pcr method based on species-specific oligonucleotides (ssos) from the sequences of the housekeeping genes reca and gpd. using species-specific primers that we report here, differentiation was done with conventional pcr (cpcr) and quantitative pcr (qpcr) applying two consecutive primer annealing temperatures. the specificity of the primers depends on terminal single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) that are characteristic for the target species. these pcr assays enabled us to distinguish eight erwinia species, as well as to identify new erwinia isolates from plant surfaces. when performed with mixed bacterial cultures, they only detected a single target species. this method is a  novel approach to classify strains within the genus erwinia by pcr and it can be  used to confirm other diagnostic data, especially when specific pcr detection methods are not already available. the method may be applied to classify species  within other bacterial genera.

TI  == variations in the molecular masses of the capsular exopolysaccharides amylovoran, pyrifolan and stewartan.
AB  == erwinia amylovora, causing fire blight of apple, pear and some ornamentals, erwinia pyrifoliae, causing asian pear blight, and pantoea stewartii, causing stewart's wilt of sweet maize, synthesize capsular extracellular polysaccharides  (epss) with a high molecular mass. the epss are virulence factors and form viscous aggregates, which participate in clogging vessels of infected plants and  causing wilting. the sizes of epss produced under different environmental growth  conditions were determined by analysis with large pore hplc columns. their molecular mass of ca. 5 mda, when isolated from agar plates, decreases to ca. 1 mda for e. amylovora amylovoran from freeze-dried supernatants from liquid cultures and to 2 mda for freeze-dried preparations of p. stewartii stewartan. size changes were also found following growth in various other media and for different strains. stewartan, amylovoran and e. pyrifoliae pyrifolan were also shown to be completely degraded by a bacteriophage eps depolymerase.

TI  == functions and origin of plasmids in species that are pathogenic to or epiphytically associated with pome fruit trees.
AB  == the genus erwinia includes plant-associated pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. among them, all species pathogenic to pome fruit trees (e. amylovora, e. pyrifoliae, e. piriflorinigrans, erwinia sp. from japan) cause similar symptoms,  but differ in their degrees of aggressiveness, i.e. in symptoms, host range or both. the presence of plasmids of similar size, in the range of 30 kb, is a common characteristic that they possess. besides, they share some genetic content with high homology in several genes associated with exopolysaccharide production  and hence, with virulence, as well as in some other genes. knowledge of the content of these plasmids and comparative genetic analyses may provide interesting new clues to understanding the origin and evolution of these pathogens and the level of symptoms they produce. furthermore, genetic similarities observed among some of the plasmids (and genomes) from the above indicated pathogenic species and e. tasmaniensis or e. billingiae, which are epiphytic on the same hosts, may reveal associations that could expose the mechanisms of origin of pathogens. a summary of the current information on their  plasmids and the relationships among them is presented here.

TI  == erwinia uzenensis sp. nov., a novel pathogen that affects european pear trees (pyrus communis l.).
AB  == bacteria were isolated from black lesions on shoots of european pear trees (pyrus communis l.) in an orchard in japan. previous characterization of this novel pathogen by phenotypic and genotypic methods suggested that it should belong to the genus erwinia but might not correspond to either erwinia amylovora or erwinia pyrifoliae. here, phylogenetic analyses of the 16s rrna gene, gyrb, and rpod gene sequences indicated that it could not be assigned to any recognized species of the genus erwinia. dna-dna hybridization confirmed that the bacterial strains represented a novel species. the dna g+c contents, the fatty acid profile and phenotypic characteristics resembled those previously reported for members of the genus erwinia. on the basis of these and previous results, the pathogen represents a novel species of the genus erwinia, for which the name erwinia uzenensis sp. nov. (type strain: ypps 951(t) = lmg 25843(t) = ncppb 4475(t)) is proposed.

TI  == detection of erwinia species from the apple and pear flora by mass spectroscopy of whole cells and with novel pcr primers.
AB  == aims: to detect the apple and pear pathogens erwinia amylovora and erwinia pyrifoliae as well as the related epiphytes erwinia tasmaniensis and erwinia billingiae, we created novel pcr primers and also applied them to a series of other plant-associated bacteria as control. to facilitate fast diagnosis, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). methods and results: the pcr primers were deduced from the psts-glms regions, which can include the gene for levansucrase, and also from regions encoding capsular polysaccharide synthesis. all primer combinations were  specific for their associated erwinia species to detect them with conventional pcr, also in mixed cultures from necrotic plant tissue. other primers designed for quantitative pcr with sybr green or together with taqman probes were applied  for real-time detection to determine growth of erw. amylovora, erw. billingiae, erw. pyrifoliae and erw. tasmaniensis in apple blossoms. from whole-cell protein  extracts, profiles were generated using a bruker microflex machine and erwinia strains classified according to a score scheme. conclusions: the designed pcr primers identified the erwinia species unambiguously and can be applied to qualitative and quantitative tests. maldi-tof ms data were in agreement with the  pcr assays. significance and impact of the study: the applied diagnosis methods allow fast and precise monitoring of two pathogenic and two epiphytic erwinia species. they are valuable for population studies with apple and pear flowers and with diseased plant material.

TI  == molecular and physiological properties of bacteriophages from north america and germany affecting the fire blight pathogen erwinia amylovora.
AB  == for possible control of fire blight affecting apple and pear trees, we characterized erwinia amylovora phages from north america and germany. the genome size determined by electron microscopy (em) was confirmed by sequence data and major coat proteins were identified from gel bands by mass spectroscopy. by their morphology from em data, phiea1h and phiea100 were assigned to the podoviridae and phiea104 and phiea116 to the myoviridae. host ranges were essentially confined to e. amylovora, strains of the species erwinia pyrifoliae, e. billingiae and even pantoea stewartii were partially sensitive. the phages phiea1h and phiea100 were dependent on the amylovoran capsule of e. amylovora, phiea104 and phiea116 were not. the myoviridae efficiently lysed their hosts and  protected apple flowers significantly better than the podoviridae against e. amylovora and should be preferred in biocontrol experiments. we have also isolated and partially characterized e. amylovora phages from apple orchards in germany. they belong to the podoviridae or myoviridae with a host range similar to the phages isolated in north america. in em measurements, the genome sizes of  the podoviridae were smaller than the genomes of the myoviridae from north america and from germany, which differed from each other in corresponding nucleotide sequences.

TI  == comparative genomics of erwinia amylovora and related erwinia species-what do we  learn?
AB  == erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of fire blight disease of apples and pears, is one of the most important plant bacterial pathogens with worldwide economic significance. recent reports on the complete or draft genome sequences of four species in the genus erwinia, including e. amylovora, e. pyrifoliae, e. tasmaniensis, and e. billingiae, have provided us near complete genetic information about this pathogen and its closely-related species. this review describes in silico subtractive hybridization-based comparative genomic analyses  of eight genomes currently available, and highlights what we have learned from these comparative analyses, as well as genetic and functional genomic studies. sequence analyses reinforce the assumption that e. amylovora is a relatively homogeneous species and support the current classification scheme of e. amylovora and its related species. the potential evolutionary origin of these erwinia species is also proposed. the current understanding of the pathogen, its virulence mechanism and host specificity from genome sequencing data is summarized. future research directions are also suggested.

TI  == evolutionary insights from erwinia amylovora genomics.
AB  == evolutionary genomics is coming into focus with the recent availability of complete sequences for many bacterial species. a hypothesis on the evolution of virulence factors in the plant pathogen erwinia amylovora, the causative agent of fire blight, was generated using comparative genomics with the genomes e. amylovora, erwinia pyrifoliae and erwinia tasmaniensis. putative virulence factors were mapped to the proposed genealogy of the genus erwinia that is based  on phylogenetic and genomic data. ancestral origin of several virulence factors was identified, including levan biosynthesis, sorbitol metabolism, three t3ss and two t6ss. other factors appeared to have been acquired after divergence of pathogenic species, including a second flagellar gene and two glycosyltransferases involved in amylovoran biosynthesis. e. amylovora singletons include 3 unique t3ss effectors that may explain differential virulence/host ranges. e. amylovora also has a unique t1ss export system, and a unique third t6ss gene cluster. genetic analysis revealed signatures of foreign dna suggesting that horizontal gene transfer is responsible for some of these differential features between the three species.

TI  == genome comparison of the epiphytic bacteria erwinia billingiae and e. tasmaniensis with the pear pathogen e. pyrifoliae.
AB  == background: the genus erwinia includes plant-associated pathogenic and non-pathogenic enterobacteria. important pathogens such as erwinia amylovora, the causative agent of fire blight and e. pyrifoliae causing bacterial shoot blight of pear in asia belong to this genus. the species e. tasmaniensis and e. billingiae are epiphytic bacteria and may represent antagonists for biocontrol of fire blight. the presence of genes that are putatively involved in virulence in e. amylovora and e. pyrifoliae is of special interest for these species in consequence. results: here we provide the complete genome sequences of the pathogenic e. pyrifoliae strain ep1/96 with a size of 4.1 mb and of the non-pathogenic species e. billingiae strain eb661 with a size of 5.4 mb, de novo  determined by conventional sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing techniques. genome comparison reveals large inversions resulting from homologous  recombination events. furthermore, comparison of deduced proteins highlights a relation of e. billingiae strain eb661 to e. tasmaniensis strain et1/99 and a distance to e. pyrifoliae for the overall gene content as well as for the presence of encoded proteins representing virulence factors for the pathogenic species. pathogenicity of e. pyrifoliae is supposed to have evolved by accumulation of potential virulence factors. e. pyrifoliae carries factors for type iii secretion and cell invasion. other genes described as virulence factors  for e. amylovora are involved in the production of exopolysaccharides, the utilization of plant metabolites such as sorbitol and sucrose. some virulence-associated genes of the pathogenic species are present in e. tasmaniensis but mostly absent in e. billingiae. conclusion: the data of the genome analyses correspond to the pathogenic lifestyle of e. pyrifoliae and underlines the epiphytic localization of e. tasmaniensis and e. billingiae as a saprophyte.

TI  == erwinia piriflorinigrans sp. nov., a novel pathogen that causes necrosis of pear  blossoms.
AB  == eight erwinia strains, isolated from necrotic pear blossoms in valencia, spain, were compared with reference strains of erwinia amylovora and erwinia pyrifoliae, both of which are pathogenic to species of pear tree, and to other species of the family enterobacteriaceae using a polyphasic approach. phenotypic analyses clustered the novel isolates into one phenon, distinct from other species of the  genus erwinia, showing that the novel isolates constituted a homogeneous phenotypic group. rep-pcr profiles, pcr products obtained with different pairs of primers and plasmid contents determined by restriction analysis showed differences between the novel strains and reference strains of e. amylovora and e. pyrifoliae. phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna, gpd and reca gene sequences showed that the eight novel strains could not be assigned to any recognized species. on the basis of dna-dna hybridization studies, the novel isolates constituted a single group with relatedness values of 87-100 % to the designated  type strain of the group, cfbp 5888(t). depending on the method used, strain cfbp 5888(t) showed dna-dna relatedness values of between 22.7 and 50 % to strains of  the closely related species e. amylovora and e. tasmaniensis. the dna g+c contents of two of the novel strains, cfbp 5888(t) and cfbp 5883, were 51.1 and 50.5 mol%, respectively. on the basis of these and previous results, the novel isolates represent a novel species of the genus erwinia, for which the name erwinia piriflorinigrans sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is cfbp 5888(t) (=cect 7348(t)).

TI  == complete genome sequence of the fire blight pathogen erwinia pyrifoliae dsm 12163t and comparative genomic insights into plant pathogenicity.
AB  == background: erwinia pyrifoliae is a newly described necrotrophic pathogen, which  causes fire blight on asian (nashi) pear and is geographically restricted to eastern asia. relatively little is known about its genetics compared to the closely related main fire blight pathogen e. amylovora. results: the genome of the type strain of e. pyrifoliae strain dsm 12163t, was sequenced using both 454  and solexa pyrosequencing and annotated. the genome contains a circular chromosome of 4.026 mb and four small plasmids. based on their respective role in virulence in e. amylovora or related organisms, we identified several putative virulence factors, including type iii and type vi secretion systems and their effectors, flagellar genes, sorbitol metabolism, iron uptake determinants, and quorum-sensing components. a deletion in the rpos gene covering the most conserved region of the protein was identified which may contribute to the difference in virulence/host-range compared to e. amylovora. comparative genomics with the pome fruit epiphyte erwinia tasmaniensis et1/99 showed that both species are overall highly similar, although specific differences were identified, for example the presence of some phage gene-containing regions and a high number of putative genomic islands containing transposases in the e. pyrifoliae dsm 12163t  genome. conclusions: the e. pyrifoliae genome is an important addition to the published genome of e. tasmaniensis and the unfinished genome of e. amylovora providing a foundation for re-sequencing additional strains that may shed light on the evolution of the host-range and virulence/pathogenicity of this important  group of plant-associated bacteria.

TI  == a polyphasic approach assigns the pathogenic erwinia strains from diseased pear trees in japan to erwinia pyrifoliae.
AB  == aims: bacterial shoot blight of pear in japan (bsbp) is caused by erwinia strains which were formerly associated with the species erwinia amylovora, the causative  agent of fire blight. the description of erwinia pyrifoliae as a pear pathogen in korea renewed a possible connection of the pear pathogens in both countries. methods and results: nucleotide sequence analysis of the 16s rrna, the house keeping genes gpd and reca, as well as dna-dna hybridization kinetics and microbiological assays place the pear pathogens from japan into the species e. pyrifoliae described as the causative agent of asian pear blight in korea. conclusions: erwinia pyrifoliae strains from korea and the pear pathogenic erwinia strains from japan belong taxonomically into the same species, but show slight divergences in nucleotide sequences used for classification. the allocation is not only supported by microbiological properties, but also by a host range restricted to pear observed before by others. significance and impact  of the study: the data suggest that the bsbp disease observed at the island of hokkaido was not fire blight and unify bsbp in japan with the pear pathogenic species e. pyrifoliae from korea.

TI  == complete genome of the broad-host-range erwinia amylovora phage phiea21-4 and its relationship to salmonella phage felix o1.
AB  == the first complete genome sequence for a myoviridal bacteriophage, phiea21-4, infecting erwinia amylovora, erwinia pyrifoliae, and pantoea agglomerans strains  has been determined. the unique sequence of this terminally redundant, circularly permuted genome is 84,576 bp. the phiea21-4 genome has a gc content of 43.8% and  contains 117 putative protein-coding genes and 26 trna genes. phiea21-4 is the first phage in which a precisely conserved rho-independent terminator has been found dispersed throughout the genome, with 24 copies in all. also notable in the phiea21-4 genome are the presence of trnas with six- and nine-base anticodon loops, the absence of a small packaging terminase subunit, and the presence of nadv, a principle component of the nad(+) salvage pathway, which has been found in only a few phage genomes to date. phiea21-4 is the first reported felix o1-like phage genome; 56% of the predicted phiea21-4 proteins share homology with those of the salmonella phage. apart from this similarity to felix o1, the phiea21-4 genome appears to be substantially different, both globally and locally, from previously reported sequences. a total of 43 of the 117 genes are unique to phiea21-4, and 32 of the felix o1-like genes do not appear in any phage genome sequences other than phiea21-4 and felix o1. n-terminal sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight analysis resulted in the identification of five phiea21-4 genes coding for virion structural proteins, including the major capsid protein.

TI  == duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction reveals competition between erwinia amylovora and e. pyrifoliae on pear blossoms.
AB  == erwinia amylovora and e. pyrifoliae are the causative agents of fire blight and asian pear blight, respectively. the pathogens are closely related, with overlapping host ranges. data are unavailable on the current distribution of e. pyrifoliae and on the interaction between the two species when they are present together on the same host. in this study, a duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) protocol was developed to monitor the population dynamics of e. amylovora and e. pyrifoliae on the surface of bartlett pear blossoms. bacterial cells washed from blossoms were used directly as the pcr template without dna extraction. primers and a probe based on the e. amylovora levansucrase gene detected all e. amylovora strains. all e. pyrifoliae strains, including the japanese erwinia strains previously described as e. amylovora, were detected with a primer and probe combination based on the e. pyrifoliae hrpw gene. disease development and severity were not significantly different in blossoms inoculated  with individual erwinia species or with a mixture of the two species. however, e. amylovora grew to greater population sizes than did e. pyrifoliae in both single  species inoculations and in mixtures, suggesting that e. amylovora has a greater  competitive fitness on bartlett pear blossoms than e. pyrifoliae.

TI  == genetic analysis of a pathogenic erwinia sp. isolated from pear in japan.
AB  == abstract four erwinia strains, originally isolated in japan from pear trees with  bacterial shoot blight symptoms, were analyzed to determine their genetic relationship with erwinia amylovora and e. pyrifoliae. when genomes were characterized with amplified fragment length polymorphism markers and by comparative groel sequence analysis, the japanese erwinia sp. and south korean e. pyrifoliae strains were placed in the same group, which was phylogenetically distinct from a group of 15 strains of e. amylovora. sequencing of the 29,593-bp  plasmid pej30 from erwinia strain ejp556 revealed that this plasmid was nearly identical to plasmid pep36 from e. pyrifoliae and was closely related to the nontransferable ubiquitous plasmid pea29 from e. amylovora. twenty-one presumptive genes and their order in pep36 were highly conserved in pej30; however, transposon tn5394, which was present in pep36, was not found in pej30. short-sequence dna repeats were conserved between pej30 and pep36, and were different from short-sequence repeats in pea29. despite base-pair mismatches, primer pairs used in pea29 polymerase chain reaction assays for e. amylovora amplified plasmid dna from the japanese erwinia ejp556 and ejp562. like e. pyrifoliae and a few strains of e. amylovora, japanese erwinia ejp617 contained plasmids related to e. pyrifoliae cole1-related plasmid pep2.6. based on these genetic analyses, we conclude that the erwinia pathogen of pear in japan is closely related to e. pyrifoliae and that both of these pathogens are demonstrably distinct from e. amylovora.

AB  == the complete genome of the bacterium erwinia tasmaniensis strain et1/99 consisting of a 3.9 mb circular chromosome and five plasmids was sequenced. strain et1/99 represents an epiphytic plant bacterium related to erwinia amylovora and e. pyrifoliae, which are responsible for the important plant diseases fire blight and asian pear shoot blight, respectively. strain et1/99 is  a non-pathogenic bacterium and is thought to compete with these and other bacteria when occupying the same habitat during initial colonization. genome analysis revealed tools for colonization, cellular communication and defence modulation, as well as genes coding for the synthesis of levan and a not detected capsular exopolysaccharide. strain et1/99 may secrete indole-3-acetic acid to increase availability of nutrients provided on plant surfaces. these nutrients are subsequently accessed and metabolized. secretion systems include the hypersensitive response type iii pathway present in many pathogens. differences or missing parts within the virulence-related factors distinguish strain et1/99 from pathogens such as pectobacterium atrosepticum and the related erwinia spp. strain et1/99 completely lacks the sorbitol operon, which may also affect its inability to invade fire blight host plants. erwinia amylovora in contrast depends for virulence on utilization of sorbitol, the dominant carbohydrate in rosaceous plants. the presence of other virulence-associated factors in strain et1/99 indicates the ancestral genomic background of many plant-associated bacteria.

TI  == genetic organization of the hrp genes cluster in erwinia pyrifoliae and characterization of hr active domains in hrpnep protein by mutational analysis.
AB  == the disease-specific (dsp) region and the hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (hrp) genes, including the hrpw, hrpnep, and hrpc operons have previously been sequenced in erwinia pyrifoliae wt3 [shrestha et al. (2005a)]. in this study, the remaining hrp genes, including the hrpc, hrpa, hrps, hrpxy, hrpl  and hrpj operons, were determined. the hrp genes cluster (ca. 38 kb) was comprised of eight transcriptional units and contained nine hrc (hrp conserved) genes. the genetic organization of the hrp/hrc genes and their orientation for the transcriptions were also similar to and collinear with those of e. amylovora, showing > or = 80% homologies. however, orfu1 and orfu2 of unknown functions, present between the hrpa and hrps operons of e. amylovora, were absent in e. pyrifoliae. to determine the hr active domains, several proteins were prepared from truncated fragments of the n-terminal and the c-terminal regions of hrpn(ep) protein of e. pyrifoliae. the proteins prepared from the n-terminal region elicited hr, but not from those of the c-terminal region indicating that hr active domains are located in only n-terminal region of the hrpn(ep) protein. two synthetic oligopeptides produced hr on tobacco confirming presence of two hr active domains in the hrpn(ep). the hr positive n-terminal fragment (hn delta c187) was further narrowed down by deleting c-terminal amino acids and internal amino acids to investigate whether amino acid insertion region have role in faster and stronger hr activity in hrpn(ep) than hrpn(ea). the hrpn(ep) mutant proteins hn delta c187 (d1air), hn delta c187 (d2air) and hn delta c187 (dm41) retained similar hr activation to that of wild-type hrpn(ep). however, the hrpn(ep) mutant protein hn delta c187 (d3air) lacking third amino acid insertion  region (102 to 113 aa) reduced hr when compared to that of wild-type hrpn(ep). reduction in hr elicitation could not be observed when single amino acids at different positions were substituted at third amino acids insertion region. but,  substitution of amino acids at l103r, l106k and l110r showed reduction in hr activity on tobacco suggesting their importance in activation of hr faster in the hrpn(ep) although it requires further detailed analysis.

TI  == transgenic tobacco expressing the hrpn(ep) gene from erwinia pyrifoliae triggers  defense responses against botrytis cinerea.
AB  == hrpn(ep), from the gram-negative pathogen, erwinia pyrifoliae, is a member of the harpin group of proteins, inducing pathogen resistance and hypersensitive cell death in plants. when the hrpn(ep) gene driven by the oscc1 promoter was introduced into tobacco plants via agrobacterium-mediated transformation, their resistance to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen, botrytis cinerea, increased. resistance to b. cinerea was correlated with enhanced induction of sa-dependent genes such as pr-1a, pr2, pr3 and chia5, of ja-dependent genes such as pr-1b, and of genes related to ethylene production, such as nt-efe26, nt-1a1c, ds321, nt-acs1 and nt-acs2. however the expression of npr1, which is thought to be essential for multiple-resistance, did not increase. since the pattern of expression of defense-related genes in hrpn(ep)-expressing tobacco differed from  that in plants expressing hpag(xoo) from xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, these results suggest that different harpins can affect the expression of different defense-related genes, as well as resistance to different plant pathogens.

TI  == autoinducer-2 of the fire blight pathogen erwinia amylovora and other plant-associated bacteria.
AB  == autoinducers are important for cellular communication of bacteria. the luxs gene  has a central role in the synthesis of autoinducer-2 (ai-2). the gene was identified in a shotgun library of erwinia amylovora and primers designed for pcr amplification from bacterial dna. supernatants of several erwinia amylovora strains were assayed for ai-2 activity with a vibrio harveyi mutant and were positive. many other plant-associated bacteria also showed ai-2 activity such as  erwinia pyrifoliae and erwinia tasmaniensis. the luxs genes of several bacteria were cloned, sequenced, and complemented escherichia coli strain dh5alpha and a salmonella typhimurium mutant, both defective in luxs, for synthesis of ai-2. assays to detect ai-2 activity in culture supernatants of several pseudomonas syringae pathovars failed, which may indicate the absence of ai-2 or synthesis of another type. several reporter strains did not detect synthesis of an acyl homoserine lactone (ahl, ai-1) by erwinia amylovora, but confirmed ahl-synthesis  for erwinia carotovora ssp. atroseptica and pantoea stewartii.

TI  == genetic differences between blight-causing erwinia species with differing host specificities, identified by suppression subtractive hybridization.
AB  == pcr-based subtractive hybridization was used to isolate sequences from erwinia amylovora strain ea110, which is pathogenic on apples and pears, that were not present in three closely related strains with differing host specificities: e. amylovora mr1, which is pathogenic only on rubus spp.; erwinia pyrifoliae ep1/96, the causal agent of shoot blight of asian pears; and erwinia sp. strain ejp556, the causal agent of bacterial shoot blight of pear in japan. in total, six subtractive libraries were constructed and analyzed. recovered sequences included type iii secretion components, hypothetical membrane proteins, and atp-binding proteins. in addition, we identified an ea110-specific sequence with homology to  a type iii secretion apparatus component of the insect endosymbiont sodalis glossinidius, as well as an ep1/96-specific sequence with homology to the yersinia pestis effector protein tyrosine phosphatase yoph.

TI  == molecular differentiation of erwinia amylovora strains from north america and of  two asian pear pathogens by analyses of pfge patterns and hrpn genes.
AB  == in order to determine a possible genomic divergence of erwinia amylovora'fruit tree' and raspberry strains from north america, several isolates were differentiated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis, the size of short dna sequence repeats (ssrs) and the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of their hrpn genes. by pfge analysis european strains are highly related, whereas strains from north america were diverse and were further distinguished by the ssr numbers from plasmid pea29. the e. amylovora strains from europe showed identical hrpn sequences in contrast to the american isolates  from fruit trees and raspberry. those were related to each other, but distinguishable by their hrpn patterns. the asian pear pathogens differed in hrpn among each other and from e. amylovora. erwinia pyrifoliae isolates and the erwinia strains from japan were ordered via their hrpn sequences in agreement with the pfge patterns. for all three pathogens, dendrograms from pfge and sequence data indicate an evolutionary diversity within the species in spite of a genetic conservation for parts of the hrpn genes suggesting a long persistence of the asian pear pathogens in korea and japan as well as of fire blight in north america. some of the divergent american e. amylovora isolates share pfge patterns with the relatively uniform european strains.

TI  == genetics of biosynthesis and structure of the capsular exopolysaccharide from the asian pear pathogen erwinia pyrifoliae.
AB  == erwinia pyrifoliae is a novel bacterial pathogen, which causes asian pear blight  and is related to erwinia amylovora, the causative agent of fire blight. e. pyrifoliae produces exopolysaccharide (eps) related to amylovoran in its sugar composition and sugar linkages. this was shown by degradation of the eps with a viral depolymerase, and by methylation analysis and esi/ms. the structure of the  repeating units was confirmed by (1)h-nmr spectra. the eps of e. pyrifoliae carried side chains, which were mainly terminated by acetyl and pyruvyl residues  as found previously for amylovoran. on the other hand, a second side chain with glucose found for up to 65% of the repeating units of amylovoran was completely absent. the nucleotide sequences of five genes of the cps cluster of e. pyrifoliae encoding proteins for eps synthesis were characterized and displayed a high homology with the corresponding ams genes. similar functions of the gene products are assumed. as for ams mutants of e. amylovora, a cpsb mutant of e. pyrifoliae did not synthesize eps and did not produce ooze on slices of immature  pears or symptoms on pear seedlings. the cps mutant was complemented for eps synthesis and virulence on pear slices with a gene cluster of e. amylovora that included amsb.

TI  == relatedness of chromosomal and plasmid dnas of erwinia pyrifoliae and erwinia amylovora.
AB  == the plant pathogen erwinia pyrifoliae has been classified as a separate species from erwinia amylovora based in part on differences in molecular properties. in this study, these and other molecular properties were examined for e. pyrifoliae  and for additional strains of e. amylovora, including strains from brambles (rubus spp.). the nucleotide composition of the internal transcribed spacer (its) region was determined for six of the seven 16s-23s rrna operons detected in these species with a 16s rrna gene probe. each species contained four operons with a trna(glu) gene and two with trna(ile) and trna(ala) genes, and analysis of the operons from five strains of e. amylovora indicated a high degree of its variability among them. one trna(glu)-containing operon from e. pyrifoliae ep1/96 was identical to one in e. amylovora ea110, but three trna(glu) operons and two trna(ile) and trna(ala) operons from e. pyrifoliae contained unique nucleotide changes. when groel sequences were used for species-specific identification, e. pyrifoliae and e. amylovora were the closest phylogenetic relatives among a set of 12 bacterial species. the placement of e. pyrifoliae distinct from e. amylovora corroborated molecular hybridization data indicating low dna-dna similarity between them. determination of the nucleotide sequence of plasmid pep36 from e. pyrifoliae ep1/96 revealed a number of presumptive genes that matched genes previously found in pea29 from e. amylovora and similar organization for the genes and origins of replication. also, pep36 and pea29 were incompatible with clones containing the reciprocal origin regions. finally, the cole1-like plasmid pep2.6 from strain ep1/96 contained sequences found in small plasmids in e. amylovora strains il-5 and ih3-1.

TI  == molecular comparison of pathogenic bacteria from pear trees in japan and the fire blight pathogen erwinia amylovora.
AB  == several strains of the genus erwinia, which were isolated in japan from pear trees with necrotic symptoms that resembled fire blight, and tentatively identified as erwinia amylovora, were reinvestigated for their relationship to the fire blight pathogen. these isolates produced ooze on slices of immature pears and were mucoid on mm2cu agar plates, but did not synthesize levan and did  not give the expected pcr signals with several primer pairs specific for erwinia  amylovora. the isolates tested positive with pcr primers designed to detect the novel pear pathogen erwinia pyrifoliae, which was isolated from nashi pear trees  in south korea. the nucleotide sequence analysis of a dna fragment preceding the  gene cluster for exopolysaccharide synthesis revealed a closer relationship to erwinia pyrifoliae than to erwinia amylovora. plasmid profiles, protein patterns  and genomic dna analysed by pfge after xbai and spei digestion were different than erwinia amylovora. experiments with strains of erwinia amylovora isolated from raspberry (rubus sp.), erwinia mallotivora and enterobacter pyrinus also did not reveal a relationship between these bacteria and the japanese erwinia strains. the latter are not identical to erwinia pyrifoliae, but possess many similar features to this pathogen that causes asian pear blight. it is concluded  that pathogenic bacteria isolated in japan from pear trees with symptoms resembling fire blight are possibly different from erwinia amylovora.

TI  == erwinia pyrifoliae sp. nov., a novel pathogen that affects asian pear trees (pyrus pyrifolia nakai)
AB  == a novel pathogen from asian pears (pyrus pyrifolia nakai) was analysed by sequencing the 16s rdna and the adjacent intergenic region, and the data were compared to related enterobacteriaceae. the 16s rdna of the asian pear pathogen was almost identical with the sequence of erwinia amylovora, in contrast to the 16s-23s rrna intergenic transcribed spacer region of both species. a dendrogram was deduced from determined sequences of the spacer regions including those of several related species such as erwinia amylovora, enterobacter pyrinus, pantoea  stewartii subsp. stewartii and escherichia coli. dendrograms derived from 121 biochemical characteristics including biotype 100 data placed the asian pear pathogen close to erwinia amylovora and more distantly to other members of the species erwinia and to the species pantoea and enterobacter. another dna relatedness study was performed by dna hybridizations and estimation of delta tm  values. the asian pear strains constituted a tight dna hybridization group (89-100%) and were barely related to strains of erwinia amylovora (40-50%) with a delta tm in the range of 5.2-6.8. the g + c content of dna from the novel pathogen is 52 mol%. therefore, it is proposed that strains isolated from asian pears constitute a new species and the name erwinia pyrifoliae is suggested; the  type strain is strain ep 16/96t (= cfbp 4172t = dsm 12163t).
