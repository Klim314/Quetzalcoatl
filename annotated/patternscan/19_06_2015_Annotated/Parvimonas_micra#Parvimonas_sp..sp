TI  == microbial diversity of the supra- and subgingival biofilm of healthy individuals  after brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles.
AB  == nanoparticulate silver has recently been reported as an effective antimicrobial agent. the aim of this clinical study was to investigate the potential changes on the oral microbiota of healthy individuals after controlled brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles. twenty-four healthy participants were enrolled in this investigation and randomly submitted to 3 interventions. all the participants received, in a crossover format, the following toothbrushing interventions: (i) chlorhexidine-coated bristles, (ii) silver-coated bristles, and (iii) conventional toothbrush (control). all the interventions had a duration of 30 days. the dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify up to 43 microbial species colonizing the supra- and subgingival biofilm. the supragingival samples presented higher genome counts than the subgingival samples (p < 0.0001). the total genome counts  from the control group showed the highest values, followed by the silver and chlorhexidine groups (p < 0.0001). after 4 weeks of brushing, the silver-coated and chlorhexidine-coated bristles were capable of reducing or maintaining lower levels of the bacterial counts of the putative periodontal pathogens tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis. other major periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and parvimonas micra, were also detected at lower levels.  the toothbrush bristles impregnated with silver nanoparticles reduced the total and individual genome count in the supra- and subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine was not effective in reducing the total genome counts  in both supra- or subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine reduced the individual genome counts in the supragingival biofilm for most of the target species, including putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == bacteria community study of combined periodontal-endodontic lesions using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing analysis.
AB  == background: the entire microbial population and predominant microflora of root canals (rcs) and adjacent periodontal pockets (pps) from teeth with combined periodontal-endodontic lesions were determined and compared. methods: pooled rc and pp samples were collected from the molars of 20 patients diagnosed with combined periodontal-endodontic lesions. dna was extracted for polymerase chain reaction-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), cloning, and sequence analysis. a coefficient of similarity (cs) was used to determine the similarity of the bacterial profiles from rcs and pps. results: significantly fewer bands were produced by pcr-dgge from rcs (5.9 +/- 1.7) than from pps (8.0 +/- 1.8) (p <0.001). the average cs of the rc and pp samples was 93.81% +/- 10.26%. overall, 60 genera/species were identified by sequencing. of these, the predominant genera in rcs were porphyromonas sp. (13.9%), filifactor sp. (12.5%), and parvimonas sp. (11.1%), similar to the genera obtained from pp samples. in total, 43 genera/species were common to the rc and pp samples. the most prevalent bacteria in both the rc and pp samples were (in descending order) filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the high similarity in the sets of organisms present in both rc and  pp samples in this study suggests that the pocket could be a source of rc infection. the data also demonstrate that combined periodontal-endodontic lesions consist of a diverse and complex microbial community.

TI  == performance evaluation and bacteria analysis of afb-mfc enriched with high-strength synthetic wastewater.
AB  == in order to study the performance and bacterial communities of an anaerobic fluidized bed microbial fuel cell (afb-mfc) system, the 16s rdna gene sequencing  was applied, and high-strength synthetic wastewater was treated by the afb-mfc system. the high-strength synthetic wastewater, in which the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (cod), nitrite nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen were above 19,000, 2,516-3,871 and 927-1,427 mg/l, was treated by the afb-mfc system. the removal efficiency of cod, nitrite nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen reached 70-89,  98 and 98%, while the maximum voltage was 394 mv. the bacteria analysis revealed  the presence of alistipes putredinis, carnobacterium sp., victivallis vadensis, klebsiella pneumoniae, thauera sp., parabacteroides merdae, parvimonas micra, parabacteroides sp., and desulfomicrobium baculatum in the anode chamber. in addition, the klebsiella pneumoniae was observed to have the capability of organic degradation and electricity generation, while the thauera sp. has the capability of denitrification.

TI  == a consortium of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus parasanguinis, and filifactor alocis is present in sites prior to bone loss in a  longitudinal study of localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced localized aggressive periodontitis  (lap) in african-american adolescents has been documented but is poorly understood. two thousand fifty-eight adolescents aged 11 to 17 years were screened for their periodontal status and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in their oral cavity. seventy-one a. actinomycetemcomitans-negative and 63 a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive periodontally healthy subjects were enrolled, sampled, examined, and radiographed yearly for 3 years. gingival and periodontal pocket depth and attachment levels were recorded. disease presentation was characterized by bone loss (bl). subgingival sites were sampled every 6 months to assess (i) the role of a. actinomycetemcomitans in bl and (ii) the association of a. actinomycetemcomitans  and other microbes in their relationships to bl. sixteen of 63 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans developed bl (the other 47 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans had no bl). no a. actinomycetemcomitans-negative subjects developed bl. human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) was used for subgingival microbial assessment. on a subject level, pooled data from a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects who remained healthy had higher prevalences of streptococcus and actinomyces species, while a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects with bl had higher prevalences of parvimonas micra, filifactor alocis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and peptostreptococcus sp. human oral taxon 113 (hot-113). at vulnerable sites, a. actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus parasanguinis, and f. alocis levels were elevated prior to bl. in cases where the three-organism consortium (versus a. actinomycetemcomitans alone) was detected, the specificity for detecting sites of future bl increased from 62% to 99%, with a sensitivity of 89%. we conclude that  detecting the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, s. parasanguinis, and f. alocis together indicates sites of future bl in lap. a synergistic interaction of this consortium in lap causation is possible and is the subject of ongoing research.

TI  == clinical and microbiological results following nonsurgical periodontal therapy with or without local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == objectives: we assessed if adjunct administration of piperacillin/tazobactam added clinical and microbiological treatment benefits. materials and methods: thirty-six subjects (mean age 52.1 years (sd +/- 10.3)) (ns by group) with chronic periodontitis were randomly enrolled receiving subgingival debridement and the local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam (test group) or debridement alone (control group). bleeding on probing (bop), probing pocket depth (ppd), and microbiological counts of 74 species were studied by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization up to month 6 after treatment. results: mean ppd changes between baseline and month 6 in the test and control groups were 1.5  and 1.8 mm, respectively (ns between groups). bop in both groups decreased from about 80 to 40 %. at 4 and 12 weeks, lower counts of the following bacteria were  found in the test group (site level): fusobacterium species, parvimonas micra, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and a composite load of nine pathogens (p < 0.001). at week 26, subjects receiving local antibiotics had a lower prevalence at tested sites for fusobacterium nucleatum sp. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum, p. micra, and t. denticola. conclusions: at 26 weeks, treatment with or without piperacillin/tazobactam resulted in similar bop and ppd improvements. at week 26  and at the subject level, the prevalence of 4/74 pathogens was found at lower counts in the group receiving local antibiotics. clinical relevance: administration of piperacillin/tazobactam reduces the prevalence of fusobacterium, p. micra, and t. denticola to a greater extent than debridement alone but with no short-term differences in ppd or bop.

TI  == effectiveness of three antimicrobial mouthrinses on the disinfection of toothbrushes stored in closed containers: a randomized clinical investigation by  dna checkerboard and culture.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate the efficacy of three antimicrobial solutions on the disinfection of toothbrushes after storage in closed containers. materials and methods: sixteen healthy subjects were enrolled  in this randomized cross-over clinical investigation. the study was conducted in  four phases, in which mouthrinses (chlorhexidine gluconate-based or cetilpiridinium-based) and sterile tap water (control group) were used to individually store used toothbrushes in closed containers during 7 days of toothbrushing. five toothbrushes were used as negative control for bacterial colonisation before contact with oral cavity. conventional culture and dna checkerboard hybridization were used to detect bacterial contamination on the toothbrushes. subsequently, the number of bacterial species on the bristles was estimated by the dna checkerboard method. results: one toothbrush presented bacterial contamination in the negative control test. both culture and dna checkerboard showed positive signals of bacterial contamination in the toothbrushes with no differences in the frequency of detection. the control group showed higher total bacterial counts when compared with the mouthrinse groups. porphyromonas gingivalis had the highest bacterial count followed by parvimonas micra. conclusion: culture and dna checkerboard showed positive signals of bacterial contamination. mouthrinses that contains 0.12% of chlorhexidine gluconate were more effective in reducing bacterial colonisation on the toothbrushes.

TI  == microbiological characterization in children with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize the subgingival microbiota of african-american children with localized aggressive periodontitis (lap). fifty-one children were included. subgingival plaque samples were taken from diseased (dd) and healthy sites (dh) in lap and from healthy sites in hs and hc and analyzed by 16s rrna-based microarrays. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) was the only species found to be both more prevalent (or = 8.3, p = 0.0025)  and abundant (p < 0.01) in dd. filifactor alocis (fa) was also found to be more prevalent in dd (or 2.31, ci 1.06-5.01, p = 0.03). most prevalent species in healthy sites were selenomonas spp, veillonella spp, streptococcus spp, bergeyella sp, and kingella oralis. overall, streptococcus spp, campylobacter gracilis, capnocytophaga granulosa, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and lautropia mirabilis were most abundant in healthy children, while aa, fa, tannerella sp, solobacterium moorei, parvimonas micra, and capnocytophaga sp were most abundant  in lap. based on a comprehensive analysis with 16s rrna-based microarrays, aa was strongly associated and site-specific in lap. in contrast, other species were found to be associated with healthy sites and individuals (clinicaltrials.gov number ct01330719). abbreviations: healthy site in healthy sibling (hs); healthy  site in healthy control child (hc).

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == detection of periodontal pathogens in newborns and children with mixed dentition.
AB  == we report the age-related prevalence of red complex periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, along with four strains of orange complex pathogens. the bacteria present in samples isolated from tongue, cheek, and subgingival sulcus in edentulous newborns and children with mixed dentition were monitored by polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  p. gingivalis was not detected in any site of any subject in the two groups tested. however, t. denticola was not only found in the 6-13 years age group, but also in edentulous newborns at a relatively high prevalence, indicating non-dentition-related colonization by t. denticola. campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra were found in the oral cavity of most subjects belonging to the 6-13 years age group compared to newborns. this suggested a pronounced association between these colonizing bacteria and the presence of teeth. there was also a strong relation between t. denticola and t. forsythia for their prevalence in the subgingival sulcus of the 6-13 years age group (p < 0.0001), but not in the other sites tested, suggesting that the colonization of dentition-related t. forsythia may be associated with the increased prevalence of non-dentition-related t. denticola in the subgingival sulcus. overall, these results suggest that dentition is a key determinant of bacterial colonization, especially orange complex bacteria and the red complex bacterium t. forsythia.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  == the subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. we tested the hypothesis that  the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16s sequencing. smokers demonstrated greater abundance of parvimonas, fusobacterium, campylobacter, bacteroides, and treponema and lower levels of veillonella, neisseria, and streptococcus. several uncultivated peptostreptococci, parvimonas micra, campylobacter gracilis, treponema socranskii, dialister pneumosintes, and tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while veillonella sp. oral clone b2, neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, streptococcus sanguinis, and capnocytophaga sp. clone ah015 were at lower levels. the microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.

TI  == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain  lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a  total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia  and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == murdochiella asaccharolytica gen. nov., sp. nov., a gram-stain-positive, anaerobic coccus isolated from human wound specimens.
AB  == two strains of previously unknown gram-stain-positive, anaerobic, coccus-shaped bacteria from human wound specimens were characterized using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing studies and distinguishable biochemical characteristics demonstrated that these two unknown strains, wal 1855c(t) and wal 2038e, are genotypically homogeneous and constitute a novel lineage within clostridium cluster xiii. there was 13-14 % 16s rrna gene  sequence divergence between the novel strains and the most closely related species, parvimonas micra, finegoldia magna and species of helcococcus. based on  the phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, a novel genus and species, murdochiella asaccharolytica gen. nov., sp. nov., are proposed. strain wal 1855c(t) (=atcc baa-1631(t) =ccug 55976(t)) is the type strain of murdochiella asaccharolytica.

TI  == the effect of a supragingival plaque-control regimen on the subgingival microbiota in smokers and never-smokers: evaluation by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of strict supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microbiota in smokers and never-smokers. research into the impact of supragingival plaque control on the number of subgingival bacteria has resulted in contradictory findings. real-time  polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been suggested as a valid alternative to current microbiologic methods based on bacteria cultures. methods: forty-five subjects with chronic periodontitis were selected. twenty-four of them had never  smoked, and 21 were active smokers. four sites per patient were selected for sampling. supragingival debridement was performed at baseline, and the subjects received weekly instructions on oral hygiene for 180 days. a clinical examination and subgingival plaque sampling were carried out at baseline and at 30, 90, and 180 days. a real-time pcr assay was used to detect and quantify porphyromonas gingivalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas  micros), dialister pneumosintes, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and the total bacteria load (eubacteria) in the subgingival samples. statistical analysis was performed using linear models adjusted for the clustering of observations within individuals. results: smokers and never-smokers exhibited a similar and significant reduction  in total bacteria counts over time. irrespective of smoking status, deep sites consistently harbored greater quantities of total bacteria throughout the study.  higher numbers of the bacteria investigated were associated with bleeding on probing. conclusion: supragingival plaque control markedly reduced subgingival microbiota counts in smokers and never-smokers.

TI  == correlates of periodontal decline and biologic markers in older adults.
AB  == background: there is limited information on infectious and host responses distinguishing older people with or without active periodontitis. this study measured bacterial and serum cytokine and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hscrp) levels in older persons. methods: elders (mean age: 67 years), whose periodontal status had declined most or least (20% worst or 20% best) over 5 years, were enrolled. two years later, they were classified as periodontally declining (active periodontitis [ap]), if they had at least five teeth with probing depth (pd) > or =5 mm, or stable (stable periodontally [sp]), if they did not. groups were compared with respect to demographics, pd, clinical loss of attachment, subgingival bacteria, serum hscrp, interleukin (il)-1beta and -6, and chronic diseases. results: ten ap and 24 sp subjects were identified; 13% of women and 44% of men from the original sample were in the ap group (p <0.05). most asians were sp; most whites and all african americans were classified as having ap (p <0.01). more ap elders had osteoporosis (p <0.01), but the ap and sp groups did not differ with respect to il-1beta and -6 or hscrp. bacterial counts  were higher in the ap group for parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros) (7.7 x 10(5) cells versus 3.8 x 10(5) cells; p <0.05), prevotella intermedia (25.7 x 10(5) cells versus 9.8 x 10(5) cells; p <0.01), tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (16.2 x 10(5) cells versus 8.0 x 10(5) cells; p <0.05), and streptococcus mutans (6.2 x 10(5) cells versus 2.0 x 10(5) cells; p <0.01). three risk factors were most predictive of periodontal decline: pd, osteoporosis, and being white or african american. conclusion: periodontal decline was associated with osteoporosis, ethnicity, pd,  gender, serum hscrp, and levels of four bacterial species.

TI  == comparative analysis of endodontic pathogens using checkerboard hybridization in  relation to culture.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of this study was to detect bacterial species and to  quantify the total number of bacteria from samples of infected root canals before (s1) and after chemo-mechanical preparation using 2% chlorhexidine (chx) gel as auxiliary chemical substance (s2) and after 7 days of intracanal dressing (s3) to compare microbial changes. method: twenty-four teeth were selected for this study. chemo-mechanical preparation was performed using 2% chx gel, then three different intracanal medicaments [m1: ca(oh)(2) paste; m2: 2% chx gel; and m3: ca(oh)(2) paste plus 2% chx gel] were used for 7 days. checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was performed to detect 40 bacterial species. aerobic and anaerobic culture techniques were used to determine the bacterial community by counting the colony-forming units (cfu). results: the species most frequently identified by checkerboard in s1 were: fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, treponema socranskii ssp. socranskii, parvimonas micra and enterococcus faecalis. in s2 and s3 a total of eight different species were identified; and only one of them was gram-positive (e. faecalis). microorganisms were not identified after use of m2 for 7 days. the quantification obtained on agar plates ranged from 4 x 10(5) to 2.6 x 10(6) cfu/ml in s1, mean cfu was reduced by 99.96% in s2, and there was no  statistical difference between the cfu in s2 and s3. conclusion: the antibacterial effect of the mechanical preparation supplemented by the use of an  antibacterial auxiliary substance greatly reduced the microorganisms in the main  root canal.
