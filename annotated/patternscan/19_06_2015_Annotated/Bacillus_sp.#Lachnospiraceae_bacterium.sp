TI  == intestinal microbiota of gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio) and its origin as revealed by 454 pyrosequencing.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota has received increasing attention, as it influences growth, feed conversion, epithelial development, immunity as well as the intrusion of pathogenic microorganisms in the intestinal tract. in this study, pyrosequencing was used to explore the bacterial community of the intestine in gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio), and the origin of these microorganisms. the results disclosed great bacterial diversities in the carp intestines and cultured environments. the gibel carp harbored characteristic intestinal microbiota, where proteobacteria were predominant, followed by firmicutes. the analysis on the 10 most abundant bacterial operational taxonomic units (otus) revealed a majority of firmicutes in the intestinal content (by decreasing order: veilonella sp., lachnospiraceae, lactobacillales, streptococcus sp., and lactobacillus sp.). the second most abundant otu was rothia sp. (actinobacteria). the most likely potential probiotics (lactobacillus sp., and bacillus sp.) and opportunists (aeromonas sp., and acinetobacter sp.) were not much abundant. bacterial community comparisons showed that the intestinal community was closely  related to that of the sediment, indicating the importance of sediment as source  of gut bacteria in gibel carp. however, 37.95 % of the otus detected in feed were retrieved in the intestine, suggesting that food may influence markedly the microbiota of gibel carp, and therefore may be exploited for oral administration  of probiotics.

TI  == oribacterium sinus gen. nov., sp. nov., within the family 'lachnospiraceae' (phylum firmicutes).
AB  == a hitherto unknown anaerobic bacillus isolated from sinus pus in a young child (strain aip 354.02t) was characterized by using phenotypic and genotypic methods. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis indicated that this strain was phylogenetically affiliated with several sequences of cloned 16s rrna gene inserts previously deposited in the public databases. according to their 16s rrna gene sequence similarities, these uncultivated bacteria, together with strain aip 354.02t, formed a separate subgroup belonging to the family 'lachnospiraceae' within the phylum firmicutes. oribacterium gen. nov. is proposed for this group of organisms and oribacterium sinus gen. nov. sp. nov. for strain aip 354.02t (= cip 107991t = ccug 48084t).
