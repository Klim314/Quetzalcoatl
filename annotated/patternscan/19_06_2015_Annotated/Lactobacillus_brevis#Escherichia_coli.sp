TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == construction of a shuttle vector based on the small cryptic plasmid pjy33 from weissella cibaria 33.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid, pjy33, from weissella cibaria 33 was characterized. pjy33 was  2365 bp in size with a gc content of 41.27% and contained two putative open reading frames (orfs). orf1 encoded a putative hypothetical protein of 134 amino  acids. orf2 was 849 bp in size, and its putative translation product exhibited 87% identity with a replication initiation factor from a plasmid from w. cibaria  klc140. a weissella-escherichia coli shuttle vector, pjy33e (6.5 kb, em(r)), was  constructed by ligation of pjy33 with pbluescript ii sk(-) and an erythromycin resistance gene (em(r)). pjy33e replicated in lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella confusa. a  single-stranded dna intermediate was detected from lb. brevis 2.14 harbouring pjy33e, providing evidence for rolling-circle replication of pjy33. most lb. brevis 2.14 cells (85.9%) retained pjy33e after one week of daily culturing in mrs broth without em. an aga gene encoding alpha-galactosidase (alpha-gal) from leuconostoc mesenteroides was successfully expressed in lb. brevis 2.14 using pjy33e, and the highest level of alpha-gal activity (36.13 u/mg protein) was observed when cells were grown on melibiose.

TI  == whole-cell biotransformation systems for reduction of prochiral carbonyl compounds to chiral alcohol in escherichia coli.
AB  == lactobacillus brevis alcohol dehydrogenase (lb-adh) catalyzes reduction of prochiral carbonyl compounds to chiral alcohol and meanwhile consumes its cofactor nadh into nad(+), while the cofactor regeneration can be catalyzed by candida boidinii formate dehydrogenase (cb-fdh). this work presents three different escherichia coli whole-cell biocatalyst systems expressing recombinant  adh/fdh, fdh-lin1-adh and fdh-lin2-adh, respectively, all of which display very high efficacies of prochiral carbonyl conversion with respect to conversion rates and enantiomeric excess values. adh/fdh represents co-expression of lb-adh and cb-fdh under different promoters in a single vector. fusion of lb-adh and cb-fdh  by a linker peptide lin1 (ggggs)(2) or lin2 (eaaak)(2) generates the two bifunctional enzymes fdh-lin1-adh and fdh-lin2-adh, which enable efficient asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones in whole-cell biotransformation.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli with inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by pathogenic bacteria on stainless steel surfaces.
AB  == two hundred and thirty individual clones of microorganisms were recovered from milk tanks and milking machine surfaces at two distinct farms (bejaja city, algeria). of these clones, 130 were identified as lactic acid bacteria (lab). in  addition escherichia coli, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa species were identified in the remaining 100 isolates-spoilage isolate. these isolates were assayed for ability to form biofilms. s. aureus, lactobacillus brevis strains lb1f2, lb14f1 and lb15f1, and lactobacillus pentosus strains lb2f2 and lb3f2 were identified as the best biofilm formers. besides, these lab isolates were able to produce proteinaceous substances with antagonism  against the aforementioned spoilage isolates, when grown in mrs or tsb-ye media.  during the screening, l. pentosus lb3f2 exhibited the highest antibacterial activity when grown in tsb-ye medium at 30 degrees c. additionally, l. pentosus lb3f2 was able to strongly hamper the adhesion of s. aureus sa3 on abiotic surfaces as polystyrene and stainless steel slides. lab isolates did not show any hemolytic activity and all of them were sensitive to different families of antibiotic tested. it should be pointed out that lb3f2 isolate was not cytotoxic  on the intestinal cells but could stimulate their metabolic activity. this report unveiled the potential of lb1f2, lb14f1, lb15f1, lb2f2, and lb3f2 isolates to be  used as natural barrier or competitive exclusion organism in the food processing  sector as well as a positive biofilm forming bacteria.

TI  == characterization and immobilization on nickel-chelated sepharose of a glutamate decarboxylase a from lactobacillus brevis bh2 and its application for production  of gaba.
AB  == a gene encoding glutamate decarboxylase a (gada) from lactobacillus brevis bh2 was expressed in a his-tagged form in escherichia coli cells, and recombinant protein exists as a homodimer consisting of identical subunits of 53 kda. gada was absolutely dependent on the ammonium sulfate concentration for catalytic activity and secondary structure formation. gada was immobilized on the metal affinity resin with an immobilization yield of 95.8%. the ph optima of the immobilized enzyme were identical with those of the free enzyme. however, the optimum temperature for immobilized enzyme was 5 degrees c higher than that for the free enzyme. the immobilized gada retained its relative activity of 41% after 30 reuses of reaction within 30 days and exhibited a half-life of 19 cycles within 19 days. a packed-bed bioreactor with immobilized gada showed a maximum yield of 97.8% gaba from 50 mm l-glutamate in a flow-through system under conditions of ph 4.0 and 55 degrees c.

TI  == directed evolution and mutagenesis of glutamate decarboxylase from lactobacillus  brevis lb85 to broaden the range of its activity toward a near-neutral ph.
AB  == glutamate decarboxylase (gad) transforms l-glutamate into gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) with the consumption of a proton. gad derived from lactic acid bacteria exhibits optimum activity at ph 4.0-5.0 and significantly loses activity at near-neutral ph. to broaden the active range of the gad gadb1 from lactobacillus  brevis lb85 toward a near-neutral ph, irrational design using directed evolution  and rational design using site-specific mutagenesis were performed. for directed  evolution of gadb1, a sensitive high-throughput screening strategy based on a ph  indicator was established. one improved mutant, gadb1(t17i/d294g/q346h), was selected from 800 variants after one round of ep-pcr. it exhibited 3.9- and 25.0-fold increase in activity and catalytic efficiency, respectively at ph 6.0.  through site-specific mutagenesis, several improved mutants were obtained, with gadb1(e312s) being the best one. the combined mutant gadb1(t17i/d294g/e312s/q346h) showed even higher catalytic efficiency, 13.1- and  43.2-fold that of wild-type gadb1 at ph 4.6 and 6.0, respectively. the amount of  gaba produced in gadb1(t17i/d294g/q346h)-, gadb1(e312s)- and gadb1(t17i/d294g/e312s/q346h)-expressing corynebacterium glutamicum atcc 13032 from endogenous l-glutamate increased by 9.6%, 20.3% and 63.9%, respectively. these results indicate that these mutations have beneficial effects on expanding  the active ph range and on gaba biosynthesis, suggesting these gadb1 variants as  potent candidates for gaba production.

TI  == nadph-dependent reductive biotransformation with escherichia coli and its pfka deletion mutant: influence on global gene expression and role of oxygen supply.
AB  == an escherichia coli deltapfka mutant lacking the major phosphofructokinase possesses a partially cyclized pentose phosphate pathway leading to an increased  nadph per glucose ratio. this effect decreases the amount of glucose required for nadph regeneration in reductive biotransformations, such as the conversion of methyl acetoacetate (maa) to (r)-methyl 3-hydroxybutyrate (mhb) by an alcohol dehydrogenase from lactobacillus brevis. here, global transcriptional analyses were performed to study regulatory responses during reductive biotransformation.  dna microarray analysis revealed amongst other things increased expression of soxs, supporting previous results indicating that a high nadph demand contributes to the activation of soxr, the transcriptional activator of soxs. furthermore, several target genes of the arcab two-component system showed a lower mrna level  in the reference strain than in the deltapfka mutant, pointing to an increased qh2 /q ratio in the reference strain. this prompted us to analyze yields and productivities of maa reduction to mhb under different oxygen regimes in a bioreactor. under anaerobic conditions, the specific mhb production rates of both strains were comparable (7.4 +/- 0.2 mmolmhb h(-1) gcdw (-1) ) and lower than under conditions of 15% dissolved oxygen, where those of the reference strain (12.8 mmol h(-1) gcdw (-1) ) and of the deltapfka mutant (11.0 mmol h(-1) gcdw (-1) ) were 73% and 49% higher. while the oxygen transfer rate (otr) of the reference strain increased after the addition of maa, presumably due to the oxidation of the acetate accumulated before maa addition, the otr of the deltapfka strain strongly decreased, indicating a very low respiration rate despite sufficient oxygen supply. the latter effect can likely be attributed to a restricted conversion of nadph into nadh via the soluble transhydrogenase stha, as the enzyme is outcompeted in the presence of maa by the recombinant nadph-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase. the differences in respiration rates can explain the suggested higher arcab activity in the reference strain.

TI  == a dual role of the transcriptional regulator tstr provides insights into cyanide  detoxification in lactobacillus brevis.
AB  == in this study we uncover two genes in lactobacillus brevis atcc 367, tstt and tstr, encoding for a rhodanese and a transcriptional regulator involved in cyanide detoxification. tstt (lvis_0852) belongs to a new class of thiosulphate:cyanide sulphurtransferases. we found that tstr (lvis_0853) modulates both the expression and the activity of the downstream-encoded tstt. the tstr binding site was identified at -1 to +33, from tstr transcriptional start site. emsa revealed that sulphite, a product of the reaction catalysed by tstt, improved the interaction between tstr:p(tstr), while fe(iii) disrupted this interaction. site-directed mutagenesis in tstr identified m64 as a key residue in sulphite recognition, while residues h136-h139-c167-m171 formed a pocket for ferric iron co-ordination. in addition to its role as a transcriptional repressor, tstr is also involved in regulating the thiosulphate:cyanide sulphurtransferase activity of tstt. a threefold increase in tstt activity was observed in the presence of tstr, which was enhanced by the addition of fe(iii).  overexpression of the tstrt operon was found to increase the cyanide tolerance of l. brevis and escherichia coli. the protein-protein interaction between tstr and  tstt described herein represents a novel mechanism for regulation of enzymatic activity by a transcriptional regulator.

TI  == colicin e2 expression in lactobacillus brevis dt24, a vaginal probiotic isolate,  against uropathogenic escherichia coli.
AB  == novel therapeutic approaches are needed to combat the urinary tract infection in  women. during menstruation elevated protein concentration and increase in oxygen  and carbon dioxide concentrations with decrease in vaginal lactobacilli all together contribute to urinary tract infections. lactobacillus species are a predominant member of the vaginal microflora and are critical in the prevention of a number of urogenital diseases. in order to increase antimicrobial potential  of vaginal lactobacilli, bacteriocin colicin e2 which has specific activity against uropathogenic escherichia coli has been overexpressed in vaginal probiotic lactobacillus brevis dt24. recombinant lactobacillus brevis dt24 expressing colicin e2 showed much higher inhibitory activity against uropathogenic escherichia coli than wild type l. brevis dt24 in vitro. efficacy of probiotic lactobacillus brevis dt24 expressing colicin e2 protein is required  for further in vivo evaluation.

TI  == enhanced production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid from glycerol by modulation of glycerol metabolism in recombinant escherichia coli.
AB  == 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-hp) is a valuable biochemical with high potential for  bioplastic manufacturing. the endogenous glycerol metabolism and by-product formation pathway in escherichia coli were modulated to enhance 3-hp production from glycerol. double deletion of glpk and yqhd directed the glycerol flux to 3-hp biosynthesis and reduced the formation of 1,3-propanediol. since 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-hpa), a precursor of 3-hp, is toxic to cell growth, the gene encoding pseudomonas aeruginosa semialdehyde dehydrogenase (psaldh) highly active on 3-hpa was expressed in e. coli. finally, fed-batch culture of recombinant e. coli bl21star(de3) without glpk and yqhd, and expressing lactobacillus brevis dhab-dhar, and p. aeruginosa psaldh resulted in 57.3g/l 3-hp concentration, 1.59g/l-h productivity and 0.88g/g yield. in conclusion, modulation of the glycerol metabolism in combination with enhanced activity of 3-hpa dehydrogenation improved the production of 3-hp from glycerol.

TI  == detection, partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 isolated from freshwater fish: bacteriocin from lb. brevis fptlb3.
AB  == lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 was isolated from freshwater fish, capable of producing bacteriocin that had broad spectrum of inhibition (3200 au/ml) against  escherichia coli mtcc 1563, enterococcus faecalis mtcc 2729, lactobacillus casei  mtcc 1423, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923. the antimicrobial activity of crude supernatant fluid was stable after heating at 121 degrees c for 60 min and declined thereafter. stability of antimicrobial activity was observed at ph range of 2.0 to 8.0. its active principle was proteinaceous in nature since the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not by other non-proteolytic enzymes. mitomycin c and uv light did not affect the activity of the bacteriocin, while chloroform extraction completely destroyed their activity. exposure to surfactant resulted in an increase in titre, except nonidet p-40, which led to total loss of activity. no bacteriocin adsorption was detected at ph 1 to 2, whereas 100% bacteriocin adsorption was found at ph 6.5. based on tricine sds-page the estimated molecular mass of bacteriocin was 54 kda. no plasmid was found to present in the isolate.

TI  == soluble products of escherichia coli induce mitochondrial dysfunction-related sperm membrane lipid peroxidation which is prevented by lactobacilli.
AB  == unidentified soluble factors secreted by e. coli, a frequently isolated microorganism in genitourinary infections, have been reported to inhibit mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsim), motility and vitality of human spermatozoa. here we explore the mechanisms involved in the adverse impact of e.  coli on sperm motility, focusing mainly on sperm mitochondrial function and possible membrane damage induced by mitochondrial-generated reactive oxygen species (ros). furthermore, as lactobacilli, which dominate the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women, have been shown to exert anti-oxidant protective effects on spermatozoa, we also evaluated whether soluble products from these microorganisms could protect spermatozoa against the effects of e. coli. we assessed motility (by computer-aided semen analysis), deltapsim (with jc-1 dye by flow cytometry),  mitochondrial ros generation (with mitosox red dye by flow cytometry) and membrane lipid-peroxidation (with the fluorophore bodipy c11 by flow cytometry) of sperm suspensions exposed to e. coli in the presence and in the absence of a combination of 3 selected strains of lactobacilli (l. brevis, l. salivarius, l. plantarum). a transwell system was used to avoid direct contact between spermatozoa and microorganisms. soluble products of e. coli induced deltapsim loss, mitochondrial generation of ros and membrane lipid-peroxidation, resulting  in motility loss. soluble factors of lactobacilli prevented membrane lipid-peroxidation of e. coli-exposed spermatozoa, thus preserving their motility. in conclusion, sperm motility loss by soluble products of e. coli reflects a mitochondrial dysfunction-related membrane lipid-peroxidation. lactobacilli could protect spermatozoa in the presence of vaginal disorders, by preventing ros-induced membrane damage.

TI  == soxr as a single-cell biosensor for nadph-consuming enzymes in escherichia coli.
AB  == an ultra-high-throughput screening system for nadph-dependent enzymes, such as stereospecific alcohol dehydrogenases, was established. it is based on the [2fe-2s] cluster-containing transcriptional regulator soxr of escherichia coli that activates expression of soxs in the oxidized but not in the reduced state of the cluster. as soxr is kept in its reduced state by nadph-dependent reductases,  an increased nadph demand of the cell counteracts soxr reduction and increases soxs expression. we have taken advantage of these properties by placing the eyfp  gene under the control of the soxs promoter and analyzed the response of e. coli  cells expressing an nadph-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase from lactobacillus brevis (lbadh), which reduces methyl acetoacetate to (r)-methyl 3-hydroxybutyrate. under suitable conditions, the specific fluorescence of the cells correlated with the substrate concentration added and with lbadh enzyme activity, supporting the nadph responsiveness of the sensor. these properties enabled sorting of single cells harboring wild-type lbadh from those with lowered or without lbadh activity by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (facs). in a proof-of-principle application, the system was used successfully to screen a mutant lbadh library for variants showing improved activity with the substrate 4-methyl-2-pentanone.

TI  == beta-glucuronidase from lactobacillus brevis useful for baicalin hydrolysis belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 30.
AB  == baicalin (baicalein 7-o-beta-d-glucuronide) is one of the major flavonoid glucuronides found in traditional herbal medicines. because its aglycone, baicalein, is absorbed more quickly and shows more effective properties than baicalin, the conversion of baicalin into baicalein by beta-glucuronidase (gus) has drawn the attention of researchers. recently, we have found that lactobacillus brevis subsp. coagulans can convert baicalin to baicalein. therefore, we aimed to identify and characterize the converting enzyme from l. brevis subsp. coagulans. first, we purified this enzyme from the cell-free extracts of l. brevis subsp. coagulans and cloned its gene. surprisingly, this enzyme was found to be a gus belonging to glycoside hydrolase (gh) family 30 (designated as lcgus30), and its amino acid sequence has little similarity with any gus belonging to gh families 1, 2, and 79 that have been reported so far. we  then established a high-level expression and simple purification system of the recombinant lcgus30 in escherichia coli. the detailed analysis of the substrate specificity revealed that lcgus30 has strict specificity toward glycon but not toward aglycones. interestingly, lcgus30 prefers baicalin rather than estrone 3-(beta-d-glucuronide), one of the human endogenous steroid hormones. these results indicated that l. brevis subsp. coagulans and lcgus30 should serve as powerful tools for the construction of a safe bioconversion system for baicalin.  in addition, we propose that this novel type of gus forms a new group in subfamily 3 of gh family 30.

TI  == tyrosine decarboxylase from lactobacillus brevis: soluble expression and characterization.
AB  == tyrosine decarboxylase (tdc, ec 4.1.1.25) is an enzyme that catalyzes the decarboxylation of l-tyrosine to produce tyramine and co2. in this study, a 1881-bp tdc gene from lactobacillus brevis was cloned and heterologously expressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). glucose was discovered to play an important role in the soluble expression of rlbtdc. after optimization, recombinant tdc (rlbtdc) was achieved in excellent solubility and a yield of 224mg rlbtdc/l broth. the c-terminal his-tagged rlbtdc was one-step purified with 90% recovery. based on sds-page and gel filtration analysis, rlbtdc is a dimer composed of two identical subunits of approximately 70kda. using l-tyrosine as substrate, the specific activity of rlbtdc was determined to be 133.5u/mg in the  presence of 0.2mm pyridoxal-5'-phosphate at 40 degrees c and ph 5.0. the km and vmax values of rlbtdc were 0.59mm and 147.1mumolmin(-1)mg(-1), respectively. in addition to l-tyrosine, rlbtdc also exhibited decarboxylase activity towards l-dopa. this study has demonstrated, for the first time, the soluble expression of tdc gene from l. brevis in heterologous host.

TI  == xylooligosaccharides from hardwood and cereal xylans produced by a thermostable xylanase as carbon sources for lactobacillus brevis and bifidobacterium adolescentis.
AB  == to compare xylans from forestry with agricultural origins, hardwood xylan (birch) and cereal arabinoxylan (rye) were hydrolyzed using two variants of the xylanase  rmxyn10a, full-length enzyme and catalytic module only, from rhodothermus marinus . cultivations of four selected bacterial species, using the xylooligosaccharide  (xos) containing hydrolysates as carbon source, showed selective growth of lactobacillus brevis dsmz 1264 and bifidobacterium adolescentis atcc 15703. both  strains were confirmed to utilize the xos fraction (dp 2-5), whereas putative arabinoxylooligosaccharides from the rye arabinoxylan hydrolysate were utilized by only b. adolescentis. escherichia coli did not grow, despite its capability to grow on the monosaccharides arabinose and xylose. it was also shown that pediococcus parvulus strain 2.6 utilized neither xylose nor xos for growth. in summary, rmxyn10a or its catalytic module proved suitable for high-temperature hydrolysis of hardwood xylan and cereal arabinoxylan, producing xos that could qualify as prebiotics for use in functional food products.

TI  == design and characterization of an efficient cyp105a1-based whole-cell biocatalyst for the conversion of resin acid diterpenoids in permeabilized escherichia coli.
AB  == cytochrome p450 enzymes exhibit a tremendous potential for biotechnological applications due to their ability to introduce oxygen into non-activated carbon atoms. their catalytic diversity is complemented by a broad substrate range covering many natural compounds. especially the functionalization of terpenoids by p450s becomes increasingly interesting due to the diverse biological effects of these compounds. the bacterial cyp105a1 from streptomyces griseolus was recently identified to carry out a one-step hydroxylation of several abietane-type resin acids. in this work, a whole-cell system for cyp105a1 with its heterologous electron transfer proteins arh1 and etp1(fd) from schizosaccharomyces pombe was designed in escherichia coli jm109 cells. additionally, an enzyme-coupled cofactor regeneration system was integrated by co-expression of alcohol dehydrogenase from lactobacillus brevis. in order to overcome mass transfer limitations of substrate into the cell, different agents were tested towards their permeabilizing activity on the e. coli membrane. the peptide antibiotic polymyxin b proved to be the most effective permeabilizer. after optimising the expression and conversion conditions, the cells were able to completely convert 200 mum of abietic acid into 15-hydroxyabietic acid within 2 h, exhibiting an initial conversion rate of 125 mum/h. these results demonstrate  the high potential of this whole-cell system for the synthesis of functionalized  resin acid diterpenoids.

TI  == biosynthesis of 3-hydroxypropionic acid from glycerol in recombinant escherichia  coli expressing lactobacillus brevis dhab and dhar gene clusters and e. coli k-12 aldh.
AB  == 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-hp) is a value-added chemical for polymer synthesis. for biosynthesis of 3-hp from glycerol, two dhab and dhar clusters encoding glycerol dehydratase and its reactivating factor, respectively, were cloned from  lactobacillus brevis kctc33069 and expressed in escherichia coli. coexpression of dhab and dhar allowed the recombinant e. coli to convert glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde, an intermediate of 3-hp biosynthesis. to produce 3-hp from glycerol, fed-batch fermentation with a two-step feeding strategy was designed to separate the cell growth from the 3-hp production stages. finally, e. coli jhs00947 expressing l .brevis dhab and dhar, and e. coli aldh produced 14.3g/l 3-hp with 0.26 g/l-h productivity, which were 14.6 and 8.53 times higher  than those of the batch culture. in conclusion, overexpression of l. brevis dhab  and dhar clusters and e. coli aldh, and implementation of the two-step feeding strategy enabled recombinant e. coli to convert glycerol to 3-hp efficiently.

TI  == probiotic potential of lactobacillus spp. isolated from brazilian regional ovine  cheese.

AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == production of aromatic compounds by metabolically engineered escherichia coli with an expanded shikimate pathway.
AB  == escherichia coli was metabolically engineered by expanding the shikimate pathway  to generate strains capable of producing six kinds of aromatic compounds, phenyllactic acid, 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid, phenylacetic acid, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 2-phenylethanol, and 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanol, which are used in several fields of industries including pharmaceutical, agrochemical, antibiotic, flavor industries, etc. to generate strains that produce phenyllactic acid and 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid, the lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldha) from cupriavidus necator was introduced into the chromosomes of phenylalanine and tyrosine overproducers, respectively. both the phenylpyruvate decarboxylase gene (ipdc) from azospirillum brasilense and the phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene (feab) from e. coli were introduced into the chromosomes of phenylalanine and tyrosine overproducers to generate phenylacetic acid and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid producers, respectively, whereas ipdc and the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (adhc) from lactobacillus brevis were introduced to generate 2-phenylethanol and 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanol producers,  respectively. expression of the respective introduced genes was controlled by the t7 promoter. while generating the 2-phenylethanol and 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanol  producers, we found that produced phenylacetaldehyde and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde were automatically reduced to 2-phenylethanol and 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanol by endogenous aldehyde reductases in e. coli encoded by the yqhd, yjgb, and yahk genes. cointroduction and cooverexpression of each gene with ipdc in the phenylalanine and tyrosine overproducers enhanced the production of 2-phenylethanol and 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanol from glucose. introduction of the yahk gene yielded the most efficient production of both aromatic alcohols. during the production of 2-phenylethanol, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanol, phenylacetic acid, and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, accumulation of some by-products were observed. deletion of feab, phea, and/or tyra genes from the chromosomes of the constructed strains resulted in increased  desired aromatic compounds with decreased by-products. finally, each of the six constructed strains was able to successfully produce a different aromatic compound as a major product. we show here that six aromatic compounds are able to be produced from renewable resources without supplementing with expensive precursors.

TI  == basic characterization and partial purification of beta-glucosidase from cell-free extracts of oenococcus oeni st81.
AB  == aims: this study was designed to characterize a beta-glucosidase of oenococcus oeni st81, a strain isolated from a spanish wine of the origin appellation ribeira sacra. methods and results: the beta-glucosidase of o. oeni st81 seems to have a periplasmic localization into the cells. this activity was strongly inhibited by gluconic acid, partially inhibited by glucose and not inhibited by fructose, lactate, malate, mannitol or sorbitol. ethanol increased the activity of this enzyme up to 147%. among the several metal ions assayed, only fe(2)(+) (10 mmol l(-)(1)) and cu(2)(+) (5 mmol l(-)(1)) exhibited a partial inhibitory effect (40%). this enzyme was partially purified using a combination of ammonium  sulfate precipitation and chromatographic methods. the single peak because of beta-glucosidase in all chromatographic columns indicates the presence of a single enzyme with an estimated molecular mass of 140 kda. the calculated k(m) and v(max) values for 4-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside were 0.38 mmol l(-)(1) and 5.21 nmol min(-)(1), respectively. the enzyme was stable at ph 5.0 with a value of t(1/2) = 50 days for the crude extract. conclusions: the beta-glucosidase of o. oeni st81 is substantially different from those characterized from other wine-related lactic acid bacteria (lab), such as lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis; however, it appears to be closely related to a beta-glucosidase from o. oeni atcc baa-1163 cloned into escherichia coli. the periplasmic localization of the enzyme together with its high tolerance to ethanol and fructose, the low inhibitory effect of some wine-related compounds on the enzymatic activity and long-term stability of the enzyme could be of interest for winemaking. significance and impact of the study: information regarding a beta-glucosidase from o. oeni st81 is presented. although the release of aroma compounds by lab has been demonstrated, little information exists concerning the responsible enzymes. to our knowledge, this study contains  the first characterization of a native beta-glucosidase purified from crude extracts of o. oeni st81.

TI  == fructooligosaccharides metabolism and effect on bacteriocin production in lactobacillus strains isolated from ensiled corn and molasses.
AB  == fructo- (fos) and galacto-oligosaccharides have been used to promote the growth of probiotics, mainly those from lactobacillus genus. however, only few reports have evaluated the effect of prebiotics on bacteriocins activity and production.  in this work, we characterized the effect of fos supplementation on the growth, lactic and acetic acids production, and antimicrobial activity of crude extracts  obtained from lactobacillus strains isolated from ensiled corn and molasses. seven out of 28 isolated lactobacillus, belonging to lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus brevis, showed antimicrobial activity  against listeria innocua. among them, the strain l. plantarum le5 showed antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes and enteroccocus faecalis;  while the l. plantarum le27 strain showed antimicrobial effect against l. monocytogenes, e. faecalis, escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis. this antimicrobial activity in most of the cases was obtained only after fos supplementation. in summary, these results show the feasibility to increase the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus bacteriocins by supplementing the growth  medium with fos.

TI  == a high-throughput colorimetric assay to measure the activity of glutamate decarboxylase.
AB  == a ph-sensitive colorimetric assay has been established to quantitatively measure  glutamate decarboxylase (gad) activity in bacterial cell extracts using a microplate format. gad catalyzes the irreversible alpha-decarboxylation of l-glutamate to gamma-aminobutyrate. the assay is based on the color change of bromocresol green due to an increase in ph as protons are consumed during the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. bromocresol green was chosen as the indicator because  it has a similar pk(a) to the acetate buffer used. the corresponding absorbance change at 620 nm was recorded with a microplate reader as the reaction proceeded. a difference in the enzyme preparation ph and optimal ph for gad activity of 2.5  did not prevent this method from successfully allowing the determination of reaction kinetic parameters and the detection of improvements in enzymatic activity with a low coefficient of variance. our assay is simple, rapid, requires minimal sample concentration and can be carried out in robotic high-throughput devices used as standard in directed evolution experiments. in addition, it is also applicable to other reactions that involve a change in ph.

TI  == antibiosis of vineyard ecosystem fungi against food-borne microorganisms.
AB  == fermentation extracts from fungi isolated from vineyard ecosystems were tested for antimicrobial activities against a set of test microorganisms, including five food-borne pathogens (staphylococcus aureus ep167, acinetobacter baumannii (clinically isolated), pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, escherichia coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) and candida albicans my1055) and two probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum lch17 and lactobacillus brevis lch23). a total of 182 fungi was grown in eight different media, and the fermentation extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity. a total of 71 fungi produced extracts active against at least one pathogenic microorganism, but not against any probiotic bacteria. the gram-positive bacterium s. aureus ep167 was more susceptible to antimicrobial fungi broth extracts than gram-negative bacteria and pathogenic fungi. identification of active fungi based on internal transcribed spacer rrna sequence analysis revealed that species in the orders pleosporales, hypocreales and xylariales dominated. differences in antimicrobial selectivity were observed  among isolates from the same species. some compounds present in the active extracts were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.  antimicrobial metabolites produced by vineyard ecosystem fungi may potentially limit colonization and spoilage of food products by food-borne pathogens, with minimal effect on probiotic bacteria.

TI  == lactobacillus brevis strain 1e1 administered to piglets through milk supplementation prior to weaning maintains intestinal integrity after the weaning event.
AB  == early colonisation in the gastrointestinal tract by commensal microbes influences the progressive development and maturity of digestive and immune system functionality in the neonate. application of strategically selected direct-fed microbials to neonatal pigs may provide an opportunity to dictate a portion of the intestinal microbial community and exert a beneficial influence on these developmental processes. experiments were conducted to determine the effects of early administration of lactobacillus brevis strain 1e1 to neonatal piglets (n=224) via a milk supplement system on gastrointestinal microbial counts, villous architecture, and immune cell phenotypes during the lactation phase and after weaning. pigs administered the direct-fed microbial had lower escherichia coli counts in the jejunum and ileum (p<0.05), and lower coliform counts in the jejunum compared to unsupplemented pigs (p<0.05). the villous height:crypt depth  ratio was greater in the ileum at 9 days of age when pigs were provided l. brevis 1e1 compared to unsupplemented pigs (p<0.05), as well as in the duodenum of pigs  supplemented with l. brevis 1e1 at 22 days of age (p<0.05). the number of leukocytes expressing cd2 (p<0.05), cd4 (p=0.07) and mhc-ii (p=0.07) was lower in the jejunum of pigs administered l. brevis 1e1 compared to unsupplemented pigs, however direct-fed microbial treatment had no effect on the number of leukocytes  expressing cd8, cd25 or swc3. these data demonstrate that early colonisation of the porcine gastrointestinal tract with l. brevis strain 1e1 during the lactation phase influences the progression of intestinal structure, immune system development, and pathogen establishment, indicating a relationship between early  microbial colonisation and development of intestinal maturity and integrity.

TI  == transcriptional analysis of lactobacillus brevis to n-butanol and ferulic acid stress responses.
AB  == background: the presence of anti-microbial phenolic compounds, such as the model  compound ferulic acid, in biomass hydrolysates pose significant challenges to the widespread use of biomass in conjunction with whole cell biocatalysis or fermentation. currently, these inhibitory compounds must be removed through additional downstream processing or sufficiently diluted to create environments suitable for most industrially important microbial strains. simultaneously, product toxicity must also be overcome to allow for efficient production of next  generation biofuels such as n-butanol, isopropanol, and others from these low cost feedstocks. methodology and principal findings: this study explores the high ferulic acid and n-butanol tolerance in lactobacillus brevis, a lactic acid bacterium often found in fermentation processes, by global transcriptional response analysis. the transcriptional profile of l. brevis reveals that the presence of ferulic acid triggers the expression of currently uncharacterized membrane proteins, possibly in an effort to counteract ferulic acid induced changes in membrane fluidity and ion leakage. in contrast to the ferulic acid stress response, n-butanol challenges to growing cultures primarily induce genes  within the fatty acid synthesis pathway and reduced the proportion of 19:1 cyclopropane fatty acid within the l. brevis membrane. both inhibitors also triggered generalized stress responses. separate attempts to alter flux through the escherichia coli fatty acid synthesis by overexpressing acetyl-coa carboxylase subunits and deleting cyclopropane fatty acid synthase (cfa) both failed to improve n-butanol tolerance in e. coli, indicating that additional components of the stress response are required to confer n-butanol resistance. conclusions: several promising routes for understanding both ferulic acid and n-butanol tolerance have been identified from l. brevis gene expression data. these insights may be used to guide further engineering of model industrial organisms to better tolerate both classes of inhibitors to enable facile production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass.

AB  == the characterisation of 24 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates from nigerian traditional fermented dairy foods, including some cow's intestine isolates, was conducted in order to select isolates for potential use as probiotics. lab isolates were identified by partial sequencing the 16s rrna gene as belonging to  the species lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus brevis and mainly weissella confusa. at the end of a characterisation process, 2 l. paracasei and 2 w. confusa isolates were selected, and their resistance to a simulated gastrointestinal digestion and their ability to adhere to eukaryotic cell lines were assessed. the survival to the simulated gastrointestinal passage was higher  when bacterial suspensions were made in skimmed milk (2.0+/-0.8 log units reduction) or at the simulated gastric juice ph 3 (2.7+/-0.9 log units reduction) than at ph 2.0 (5.5+/-0.7 log units reduction). adhesion of lab to both intestinal and vaginal epithelial models was comparable or higher than that of the reference lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. however, some of the isolates increased the adhesion of the pathogen escherichia coli lmg2092 to ht-29 and hela monolayers. overall, isolates l. paracasei ui14 and w. confusa ui7 are good candidates for further studying potential benefits that support their use as probiotics. this is one of the few articles reporting the characterisation and the probiotic potential of weissella, although more studies are needed in order to establish their safety for potential probiotic applications.

TI  == simultaneous consumption of pentose and hexose sugars: an optimal microbial phenotype for efficient fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass.
AB  == lignocellulosic biomass is an attractive carbon source for bio-based fuel and chemical production; however, its compositional heterogeneity hinders its commercial use. since most microbes possess carbon catabolite repression (ccr), mixed sugars derived from the lignocellulose are consumed sequentially, reducing  the efficacy of the overall process. to overcome this barrier, microbes that exhibit the simultaneous consumption of mixed sugars have been isolated and/or developed and evaluated for the lignocellulosic biomass utilization. specific strains of escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and zymomonas mobilis have been engineered for simultaneous glucose and xylose utilization via mutagenesis or introduction of a xylose metabolic pathway. other microbes, such as lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus buchneri, and candida shehatae possess a relaxed ccr mechanism, showing simultaneous consumption of glucose and xylose. by exploiting ccr-negative phenotypes, various integrated processes have been developed that incorporate both enzyme hydrolysis of lignocellulosic material and mixed sugar fermentation, thereby enabling greater productivity and fermentation  efficacy.

TI  == inactivation of microorganisms in apple juice using an ultraviolet silica-fiber optical device.
AB  == most juices are opaque to ultraviolet (uv) due to the high-suspended solids in them and therefore the conventional uv treatment, generally used for water treatment, cannot be used for treating juices. in order to achieve a high germicidal efficiency of uv processing, an optical device with silica optical fibers for uv light delivery was designed. its suitability for application could  be shown in experiments with escherichia coli, lactobacillus brevis, saccharomyces cerevisiae and naturally contaminating microorganisms as test microorganisms. the thin-film thickness for treating apple juice was optimized. at 2.0-mm film thickness, e. coli and l. brevis were reduced by up to 6 log orders with the uv dose of 23.7 m j/cm(2) and the optical-fiber distribution density of 15 fibers/cm(2), while only about 4-log reduction of s. cerevisiae was achieved under the same condition. naturally contaminating lactic acid bacteria,  enterobacteriaceae and yeasts and moulds in freshly extracted apple juice were reduced to below 10 cfu/ml. these results indicate that this optical device could be used to improve microbial safety and extend shelf-life of apple juice.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of phenolic acids against commensal, probiotic and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == phenolic acids (benzoic, phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids) are the most abundant phenolic structures found in fecal water. as an approach towards the exploration of their action in the gut, this paper reports the antimicrobial activity of thirteen phenolic acids towards escherichia coli, lactobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the growth of e. coli atcc 25922 was inhibited by only four of the phenolic acids tested at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml, whereas pathogenic e. coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) was susceptible to ten of them. the genetically manipulated e. coli lpxc/tolc strain was highly susceptible to phenolic acids. the growth of lactobacilli (lactobacillus paraplantarum lch7, lactobacillus plantarum lch17, lactobacillus fermentum lph1, l. fermentum cect 5716, lactobacillus brevis lch23, and lactobacillus coryniformis cect 5711) and pathogens (s. aureus ep167 and c. albicans my1055) was also inhibited by phenolic acids, but to varying extents. only p. aeruginosa pao1 was not susceptible to any of the phenolic compounds tested. structure-activity relationships of phenolic acids and some of their diet precursors [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] were established, based on multivariate analysis of microbial activities. the antimicrobial properties of phenolic acids reported in this paper might be relevant in vivo.

TI  == towards preparative scale steroid hydroxylation with cytochrome p450 monooxygenase cyp106a2.
AB  == cytochrome p450 monooxygenases are of outstanding interest for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals, due to their ability to hydroxylate c--h bonds mainly in a stereo- and regioselective manner. cyp106a2 from bacillus megaterium atcc 13368, one of only a few known bacterial steroid hydroxylases, enables the oxidation of 3-keto-4-ene steroids mainly at position 15. we expressed this enzyme together with the electron-transfer partners bovine adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase in escherichia coli. additionally an enzyme-coupled cofactor regeneration system was implemented by expressing alcohol dehydrogenase from lactobacillus brevis. by studying the conversion of progesterone and testosterone, the bottlenecks of these p450-catalyzed hydroxylations were identified. substrate transport into the cell and substrate solubility turned out to be crucial for the overall performance. based on these investigations we developed a new concept for cyp106a2-catalyzed steroid hydroxylations by which the productivity of progesterone and testosterone conversion could be increased up to 18-fold to yield an absolute productivity up  to 5.5 g l(-1) d(-1). product extraction with absorber resins allowed the recovery of quantitative amounts of 15beta-oh-progesterone and 15beta-oh-testosterone and also the reuse of the biocatalyst.

AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

AB  == background: the high costs of pyridine nucleotide cofactors have limited the applications of nad(p)-dependent oxidoreductases on an industrial scale. although nad(p)h regeneration systems have been widely studied, nad(p)(+) regeneration, which is required in reactions where the oxidized form of the cofactor is used, has been less well explored, particularly in whole-cell biocatalytic processes. methodology/principal findings: simultaneous overexpression of an nad(+) dependent enzyme and an nad(+) regenerating enzyme (h(2)o producing nadh oxidase  from lactobacillus brevis) in a whole-cell biocatalyst was studied for application in the nad(+)-dependent oxidation system. the whole-cell biocatalyst  with (2r,3r)-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase as the catalyzing enzyme was used to produce (3r)-acetoin, (3s)-acetoin and (2s,3s)-2,3-butanediol. conclusions/significance: a recombinant strain, in which an nad(+) regeneration enzyme was coexpressed, displayed significantly higher biocatalytic efficiency in terms of the production of chiral acetoin and (2s,3s)-2,3-butanediol. the application of this coexpression system to the production of other chiral chemicals could be extended by using different nad(p)-dependent dehydrogenases that require nad(p)(+) for catalysis.

TI  == characterization of a cryptic plasmid pd403 from lactobacillus plantarum and construction of shuttle vectors based on its replicon.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid pd403 was isolated from lactobacillus plantarum d403 derived from fermented dairy products. it was 2,791 bp in size with a g+c content of 37%. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames, orf1 and orf2. orf1 (318 amino acids) was identified as a replication protein (repa). orf2 (137  amino acids) shared 31% similarity with the transcriptional regulator of ralstonia pickettii 12d. functional investigation indicated that orf2 (tra) had the ability of improving the transformation efficiency. the origin of replication was predicted, suggesting that pd403 was a rolling-circle-replication (rcr) plasmid. an escherichia coli/lactobacillus shuttle vector pcd4032 was constructed based on the pd403 replicon, and proved to be successfully transformed into various lactobacilli including lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus brevis. the transformation efficiencies were ranged from 1.3 x 10(2) to 7 x 10(4) transformants per microgram dna. furthermore, an expression vector pcd4033 was developed with the promoter of the lactate dehydrogenase from lactobacillus delbrueckii 11842. the green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a reporter was expressed successfully in various lactobacilli tested, suggesting that the expression vector pcd4033 had the potential to be used as a molecular tool for heterologous gene cloning and expression in lactobacilli.

AB  == the beta-glucuronidase (gus) gene from lactobacillus brevis ro1 was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli gms407. the gus gene was composed of 1812 bp, encoding a 603-amino-acid protein belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase family 2 with three conserved domains. the amino acid similarity was higher than 70% with  the beta-glucuronidases of various microorganisms, yet less than 58% with the beta-glucuronidase of l. gasseri adh. overexpression and purification of the gus  was performed in beta-glucuronidase-deficient e. coli gms407. the purified gus protein was 71 kda and showed 1284 u/mg of specific activity at optimum condition of ph 5.0 and 37 degrees c. at 37 degrees c, the gus remained stable for 80 min at ph values ranging from 5.0 to 8.0. the purified enzyme exhibited a half-life of 1 h at 60 degrees c and more than 2 h at 50 degrees c. when the purified gus was applied to transform baicalin and wogonoside into their corresponding aglycones, 150 microm of baicalin and 125 microm of wogonoside were completely transformed into baicalein and wogonin, respectively, within 3 h.

TI  == the maltodextrin transport system and metabolism in lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and production of novel alpha-glucosides through reverse phosphorolysis by maltose phosphorylase.
AB  == a gene cluster involved in maltodextrin transport and metabolism was identified in the genome of lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, which encoded a maltodextrin-binding protein, three maltodextrin atp-binding cassette transporters and five glycosidases, all under the control of a transcriptional regulator of the laci-galr family. enzymatic properties are described for recombinant maltose phosphorylase (malp) of glycoside hydrolase family 65 (gh65), which is encoded by malp (genbank: aav43670.1) of this gene cluster and produced  in escherichia coli. malp catalyses phosphorolysis of maltose with inversion of the anomeric configuration releasing beta-glucose 1-phosphate (beta-glc 1-p) and  glucose. the broad specificity of the aglycone binding site was demonstrated by products formed in reverse phosphorolysis using various carbohydrate acceptor substrates and beta-glc 1-p as the donor. malp showed strong preference for monosaccharide acceptors with equatorial 3-oh and 4-oh, such as glucose and mannose, and also reacted with 2-deoxy glucosamine and 2-deoxy n-acetyl glucosamine. by contrast, none of the tested di- and trisaccharides served as acceptors. disaccharide yields obtained from 50 mmbeta-glc 1-p and 50 mm glucose, glucosamine, n-acetyl glucosamine, mannose, xylose or l-fucose were 99, 80, 53, 93, 81 and 13%, respectively. product structures were determined by nmr and esi-ms to be alpha-glcp-(1-->4)-glcp (maltose), alpha-glcp-(1-->4)-glcnp (maltosamine), alpha-glcp-(1-->4)-glcnacp (n-acetyl maltosamine), alpha-glcp-(1-->4)-manp, alpha-glcp-(1-->4)-xylp and alpha-glcp-(1-->4)- l-fucp,  the three latter being novel compounds. modelling using l. brevis gh65 as the template and superimposition of acarbose from a complex with thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum gh15 glucoamylase suggested that loop 3 of malp involved in substrate recognition blocked the binding of candidate acceptors larger than monosaccharides.

TI  == bacterial dynamics in model cheese systems, aiming at safety and quality of portuguese-style traditional ewe's cheeses.
AB  == an experiment using model ewe's milk cheeses was designed to characterize microbial interactions that arise in actual raw milk cheese environments. these model cheeses were manufactured according to portuguese artisanal practices, except that the microbial load and biodiversity were fully controlled: single potential pathogens and spoilage bacteria, or a combination thereof, were combined at various initial inoculum levels in sterilized raw ewe's milk with several lactic acid bacteria (lab) normally found in traditional cheeses. viable  microbial counts were monitored throughout a 60-day ripening period. two alternative mathematical approaches were used to fit the experimental data generated in terms of population dynamics: percent of inhibition and d-values. these were able to explain the complex competitive interactions between the contaminant microorganisms and the lab adventitious populations. in general, the  tested lab were less able to inhibit contaminants present in combination and in higher concentrations. lactococcus lactis, with its strong acidifying potential,  was the most effective factor in controlling the unwanted bacterial population, especially single staphylococcus aureus. the two lactobacilli studied, especially lactobacillus brevis, were shown to be less effective; escherichia coli and listeria innocua were the contaminants least inhibited by the lab.

TI  == inhibition of uropathogens by lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy foods and  cow's intestine in western nigeria.
AB  == a total of 96 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from african indigenous fermented products and cow's intestines to study their inhibitory capability against multi-drug-resistant uropathogens. escherichia coli accounted for approximately 45% of isolated uropathogens, followed by staphylococcus spp. (20%). the gram negative uropathogens were highly resistant to quinolones, co-trimoxazole, teicoplanin and some beta-lactams, while the staphylococcus spp.  showed high resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and macrolides. twenty-four lab isolates were selected based on their antimicrobial activity against two uropathogenic staphylococcus aureus strains and bacteriocin production. lab strains showing antimicrobial activity were grouped into smaller  groups through amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). representative strains were identified as weissella spp., enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus brevis through sequencing of 16s rdna. the weissella spp. and l. brevis strains demonstrated remarkable inhibitory activity  against seven strains of gram negative uropathogens. two strains of l. lactis produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance active against lactobacillus sakei. in this study, an unusual high rate of co-trimoxazole, quinolones and macrolides resistance among uropathogens from south west nigeria was discovered.  based on their sensitivity to weissella spp., there is a potential for using these lab as a natural approach for the protection against the uropathogens assayed.

TI  == recombinant s-layer proteins of lactobacillus brevis mediating antibody adhesion  to calf intestine alleviated neonatal diarrhea syndrome.
AB  == a chimeric gene encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) and a s-layer  protein from lactobacillus brevis kctc3102, and/or two copies of the fc-binding z-domain, a synthetic analog of the b-domain of protein a, was constructed and expressed in escherichia coli bl21(de3). the s-layer fusion proteins produced in  a 500-l fermentor were likely to be stable in the range of ph 5 to 8 and 0 degree to 40 degrees . their adhesive property enabled an easy and rapid immobilization  of enzymes or antibodies on solid materials such as plastics, glass, sol-gel films, and intestinal epithelial cells. owing to their affinity towards intestinal cells and immunoglobulin g, the slayer fusion proteins enabled the adhesion of antibodies to human epithelial cells. in addition, feeding a mixture  of the s-layer fusion proteins and antibodies against neonatal calf diarrhea (coronavirus, rotavirus, escherichia coli, and salmonella typhimurium) to hanwoo  calves resulted in 100% prevention of neonatal calf diarrhea syndrome (p<0.01),whereas feeding antibodies only resulted in 56% prevention.

TI  == metabolomics for biotransformations: intracellular redox cofactor analysis and enzyme kinetics offer insight into whole cell processes.
AB  == for redox reactions catalyzed by microbial cells the analysis of involved cofactors is of special interest since the availability of cofactors such as nadh or nadph is often limiting and crucial for the biotransformation efficiency. the  measurement of these cofactors has usually been carried out using spectrophotometric cycling assays. today lc-ms/ms methods have become a valuable  tool for the identification and quantification of intracellular metabolites. this technology has been adapted to measure all four nicotinamide cofactors (nad, nadp, nadh, and nadph) during a whole cell biotransformation process catalyzed by recombinant escherichia coli cells. the cells overexpressing an alcohol dehydrogenase from lactobacillus brevis were used for the reduction of methyl acetoacetate (maa) with substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration by oxidation of 2-propanol. to test the reliability of the measurement the data were evaluated using a process model. this model was derived using the measured concentrations of reactants and cofactors for initiation as well as the kinetic constants from in vitro measurements of the isolated enzyme. this model proves to be highly effective in the process development for a whole cell redox biotransformation in  predicting both the right concentrations of cofactors and reactants in a batch and in a cstr process as well as the right in vivo expression level of the enzyme. moreover, a sensitivity analysis identifies the cofactor regeneration reaction as the limiting step in case for the reduction of maa to the corresponding product (r)-methyl 3-hydroxybutyrate. using the combination of in vitro enzyme kinetic measurements, measurements of cofactors and reactants and an adequate model initiated by intracellular concentrations of all involved reactants and cofactors the whole cell biotransformation process can be understood quantitatively.

TI  == characterization of four plasmids harboured in a lactobacillus brevis strain encoding a novel bacteriocin, brevicin 925a, and construction of a shuttle vector for lactic acid bacteria and escherichia coli.
AB  == in this study we isolated over 250 lactic acid bacteria (lab) candidates from fruit, flowers, vegetables and a fermented food to generate an lab library. one strain, designated 925a, isolated from kimchi (a traditional korean fermented dish made from chinese cabbage) produced a novel type of bacteriocin, brevicin 925a, which is effective against certain lab, including strains of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, bacillus and listeria. strain 925a, identified as lactobacillus brevis, harboured at least four plasmids and we determined the entire nucleotide sequence of each one. the four plasmids were designated plb925a01-04, and have molecular sizes of 1815, 3524, 8881 and 65 037 bp, respectively. we obtained bacteriocin non-producing derivatives by treatment of strain 925a with novobiocin. all of these derivatives, which were susceptible to  their own antibacterial product, lost the largest plasmid, plb925a04, suggesting  that the genes for bacteriocin biosynthesis (breb and brec) and immunity (bree) are located on plb925a04. the partial amino acid sequence of purified brevicin 925a and sequence analysis of plb925a04 showed that breb is the structural gene for brevicin 925a. we constructed a shuttle vector (ples003, 6134 bp) that can replicate in both escherichia coli and lab such as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus hilgardii and enterococcus hirae. to determine the function of gene bree, which displays no significant similarity  to any other sequences in the blast search database, the gene was inserted into ples003. a plb925a04-cured derivative transformed with ples003 carrying bree acquired immunity to brevicin 925a, suggesting that bree encodes an immunity protein.

TI  == identification and characterization of domains responsible for self-assembly and  cell wall binding of the surface layer protein of lactobacillus brevis atcc 8287.
AB  == background: lactobacillus brevis atcc 8287 is covered by a regular surface (s-) layer consisting of a 435 amino acid protein slpa. this protein is completely unrelated in sequence to the previously characterized s-layer proteins of lactobacillus acidophilus group. results: in this work, the self-assembly and cell wall binding domains of slpa were characterized. the c-terminal self-assembly domain encompassed residues 179-435 of mature slpa, as demonstrated by the ability of n-terminally truncated recombinant slpa to form a periodic structure indistinguishable from that formed by full length slpa. furthermore, a  trypsin degradation analysis indicated the existence of a protease resistant c-terminal domain of 214 amino acids. by producing a set of c-terminally truncated recombinant slpa (rslpa) proteins the cell wall binding region was mapped to the n-terminal part of slpa, where the first 145 amino acids of mature  slpa alone were sufficient for binding to isolated cell wall fragments of l. brevis atcc 8287. the binding of full length rslpa to the cell walls was not affected by the treatment of the walls with 5% trichloroacetic acid (tca), indicating that cell wall structures other than teichoic acids are involved, a feature not shared by the lactobacillus acidophilus group s-layer proteins characterized so far. conserved carbohydrate binding motifs were identified in the positively charged n-terminal regions of six lactobacillus brevis s-layer proteins. conclusion: this study identifies slpa as a two-domain protein in which the order of the functional domains is reversed compared to other characterized lactobacillus s-layer proteins, and emphasizes the diversity of potential cell wall receptors despite similar carbohydrate binding sequence motifs in lactobacillus s-layer proteins.

AB  == the microbial diversity within alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the alpujarra mountains (granada, south-east spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community dna. a collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analyses. isolates on man-rogosa and sharpe-agar (mrs), m17-glucose agar and kenner fecal (kf)-agar medium were identified by specific pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. the predominant genus was lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of lb. plantarum and lb. brevis. other lactic-acid bacteria identified were pediococcus urinaequi, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuc. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci enterococcus faecium and e. devriesei. cluster analyses of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. the gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to hafnia alvei species. the microbes occurring in alberquilla cheese were also studied by pcr temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) of the 16s rrna v3 region and partial 16s rrna sequencing of the ttge bands. the results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to lc. lactis, lb. paracasei, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. acidophilus and enterococcus sp. the non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as escherichia coli. all the enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaafm.  on the basis of their antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin b105 and mesenterocin y105, as revealed by pcr techniques.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide production and resistance to nonoxinol-9 in lactobacillus spp.  isolated from the vagina of reproductive-age women.
AB  == lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. however, some species of lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide-producers. women, who usually use intrauterine dispositive (iud) and spermicides such as nonoxinol-9 (n-9) as contraceptive methods, increase the risk of acquiring an urinary tract infection  and a bacterial vaginosis; some studies have demonstrated that these compounds alter the normal vaginal biota. it is known that they inhibit lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1% and that they do not have an effect on the  growth of escherichia coli. it is probable that the presence of nonoxinol-9 affects the ecological balance of the vagina by inhibiting the protector lactobacilli. in this study, we identified lactobacillus acidophilus, l. brevis,  l. crispatus, l. fermentii and l. jensenii as the species most frequently isolated from women. seventy-one hydrogen peroxide-producer strains and 48 strains resistant to the inhibitory effect of nonoxinol-9 were detected. l. brevis showed the highest number of resistant strains.

AB  == adherence of intestinal pathogens, including escherichia coli o157:h7, to human intestinal epithelial cells is a key step in pathogenesis. probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus helveticus r0052 inhibit the adhesion of e. coli o157:h7  to epithelial cells, a process which may be related to specific components of the bacterial surface. surface-layer proteins (slps) are located in a paracrystalline layer outside the bacterial cell wall and are thought to play a role in tissue adherence. however, the ability of s-layer protein extract derived from probiotic bacteria to block adherence of enteric pathogens has not been investigated. human epithelial (hep-2 and t84) cells were treated with s-layer protein extract alone, infected with e. coli o157:h7, or pretreated with s-layer protein extract prior to infection to determine their importance in the inhibition of pathogen adherence. the effects of s-layer protein extracts were characterized by phase-contrast and immunofluorescence microscopy and measurement of the transepithelial electrical resistance of polarized monolayers. pre-treatment of host epithelial cells with s-layer protein extracts prior to e. coli o157:h7 infection decreased pathogen adherence and attaching-effacing lesions in addition to preserving the barrier function of monolayers. these in vitro studies indicate that a non-viable constituent derived from a probiotic strain may prove effective in interrupting the infectious process of an intestinal pathogen.

AB  == nadh oxidase (nox) from lactobacillus brevis is a homotetrameric flavoenzyme composed of 450 amino acids per subunit. the molecular weight of each monomer is  48.8 kda. the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of two equivalents of nadh and reduces one equivalent of oxygen to yield two equivalents of water, without releasing hydrogen peroxide after the reduction of the first equivalent of nadh.  crystals of this protein were grown in the presence of 34% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000, 0.1 m sodium acetate and 0.2 m ammonium sulfate at ph 5.4. they belong to the tetragonal space group p4(3)2(1)2, with unit-cell parameters a = 74.8, b = 95.7, c = 116.9 a, alpha = gamma = 90, beta = 103.8 degrees. the current diffraction limit is 4.0 a. the self-rotation function of the native data set is consistent with a nox tetramer in the asymmetric unit.

TI  == cloning, sequencing and expression of a novel glutamate decarboxylase gene from a newly isolated lactic acid bacterium, lactobacillus brevis opk-3.
AB  == lactobacillus brevis opk-3, having 84.292 mg/l/h of gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) productivity, was isolated from kimchi, a traditional fermented food in korea. a core fragment of glutamate decarboxylase (gad) dna was isolated from the l. brevis opk-3, using primers based on two highly conserved regions of gad. a full-length gad (lbgad) clone was subsequently isolated through rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) pcr. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the open reading frame (orf) consisted of 1401 bases and encoded a protein of 467 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 53.4 kda and a pi of 5.65. the amino acid sequence deduced from lbgad orf showed 83%, 71%, and 60% identity to the lactobacillus plantarum gad, lactococcus lactis gad, and listeria monocytogenes gad sequences, respectively. the lbgad gene was expressed in escherichia coli strain ut481, and the extract of transformed e. coli ut481 contained an induced 53.4 kda protein and had significantly enhanced gad activity.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of kojibiose phosphorylase gene from thermoanaerobacter brockii atcc35047.
AB  == a gene encoding kojibiose phosphorylase was cloned from thermoanaerobacter brockii atcc35047. the kojp gene encodes a polypeptide of 775 amino acid residues. the deduced amino acid sequence was homologous to those of trehalose phosphorylase from t. brockii and maltose phosphorylases from bacillus sp. and lactobacillus brevis with 35%, 29% and 28% identities, respectively. kojibiose phosphorylase was efficiently overexpressed in escherichia coli jm109. the dna sequence of 3956 bp analyzed in this study contains three open reading frames (orfs) downstream of kojp. the four orfs, kojp, koje, kojf, and kojg, form a gene cluster. the amino acid sequences deduced from koje and kojf are similar to those of the n-terminal and c-terminal regions of a sugar-binding periplasmic protein from thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis mb4. furthermore, the amino acid sequence deduced from kojg is similar to that of a permease of the abc-type sugar transport systems from t. tengcongensis mb4. each of three amino acid substitutions, d362n, k614q and e642q, caused a complete loss of kojibiose phosphorylase activity. these results suggest that d362, k614 and e642 play an important role in catalysis. another mutation, d459n, increased k(m) values for kojibiose (7-fold that for the wild type), beta-g1p (11-fold) and glucose (7-fold), whereas k(m) for inorganic phosphate was minimally affected by this mutation, suggesting that d459 may be involved in the binding to saccharides.

TI  == cloning, expression, purification, and analysis of mannitol dehydrogenase gene mtlk from lactobacillus brevis.
AB  == the commercial production of mannitol involves high-pressure hydrogenation of fructose using a nickel catalyst, a costly process. mannitol can be produced through fermentation by microorganisms. currently, a few lactobacillus strains are used to develop an efficient process for mannitol bioproduction; most of the  strains produce mannitol from fructose with other products. an approach toward improving this process would be to genetically engineer lactobacillus strains to  increase fructose-to-mannitol conversion with decreased production of other products. we cloned the gene mtlk encoding mannitol-2-dehydrogenase (ec 1.1.1.67) that catalyzes the conversion of fructose into mannitol from lactobacillus brevis using genomic polymerase chain reaction. the mtlk clone contains 1328 bp of dna sequence including a 1002-bp open reading frame that consisted of 333 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of about 36 kda. the functional mannitol-2-dehydrogenase was produced by overexpressing mtlk via prseta vector in escherichia coli bl21plyss on isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. the fusion protein is able to catalyze the reduction of fructose to mannitol at ph 5.35. similar rates of catalytic reduction were observed using either the nadh or nadph as cofactor under in vitro assay conditions. genetically engineered lactobacillus plantarum tf103 carrying the mtlk gene of l. brevis indicated increased mannitol production from glucose. the evaluation of mixed sugar fermentation and mannitol production by this strain is in progress.

TI  == hepatoprotective effect of lactic acid bacteria, inhibitors of beta-glucuronidase production against intestinal microflora.
AB  == the hepatoprotective activity of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus brevis hy7401, lactobacillus acidophilus csg and bifidobacterium longum hy8001), which inhibited beta-glucuronidase productivity of intestinal microflora, on t-bhp- or  ccl4-induced hepatotoxicity of mice were evaluated. these oral administration of  lactic acid bacteria lowered beta-glucuronidase production of intestinal microflora as well as escherichia coli hgu-3. when lactic acid bacteria at a dose of 0.5 or 2 g (wet weight)/kg was orally administered on ccl4-induced liver injury in mice, these bacteria significantly inhibited the increase of plasma alanine transferase and aspartate transferase activities by 17-57% and 57-66% of  the ccl4 control group, respectively. these lactic acid bacteria also showed the  potent hepatoprotective effect against t-bhp-induced liver injury in mice. the inhibitory effects of these lactic acid bacteria were more potent than that of dimethyl diphenyl bicarboxylate (ddb), which have been used as a commercial hepatoprotective agent. among these lactic acid bacteria, l. acidophilus csg exhibited the most potent hepatoprotective effect. based on these findings, we insist that an inhibitor of beta-glucuronidase production in intestine, such as lactic acid bacteria, may be hepatoprotective.

TI  == enantioselective reduction of carbonyl compounds by whole-cell biotransformation, combining a formate dehydrogenase and a (r)-specific alcohol dehydrogenase.
AB  == a whole-cell biotransformation system for the reduction of prochiral carbonyl compounds, such as methyl acetoacetate, to chiral hydroxy acid derivatives [methyl (r)-3-hydroxy butanoate] was developed in escherichia coli by construction of a recombinant oxidation/reduction cycle. alcohol dehydrogenase from lactobacillus brevis catalyzes a highly regioselective and enantioselective  reduction of several ketones or keto acid derivatives to chiral alcohols or hydroxy acid esters. the adh gene encoding for the alcohol dehydrogenase of l. brevis was expressed in e. coli. as expected, whole cells of the recombinant strain produced only low quantities of methyl (r)-3-hydroxy butanoate from the substrate methyl acetoacetate. therefore, the fdh gene from mycobacterium vaccae  n10, encoding nad+-dependent formate dehydrogenase, was functionally coexpressed. the resulting two-fold recombinant strain exhibited an in vitro catalytic alcohol dehydrogenase activity of 6.5 units mg-1 protein in reducing methyl acetoacetate  to methyl (r)-3-hydroxy butanoate with nadph as the cofactor and 0.7 units mg-1 protein with nadh. the in vitro formate dehydrogenase activity was 1.3 units mg-1 protein. whole resting cells of this strain catalyzed the formation of 40 mm methyl (r)-3-hydroxy butanoate from methyl acetoacetate. the product yield was 100 mol% at a productivity of 200 micromol g-1 (cell dry weight) min-1. in the presence of formate, the intracellular [nadh]/[nad+] ratio of the cells increased seven-fold. thus, the functional overexpression of alcohol dehydrogenase in the presence of formate dehydrogenase was sufficient to enable and sustain the desired reduction reaction via the relatively low specific activity of alcohol dehydrogenase with nadh, instead of nadph, as a cofactor.

TI  == antimicrobial interactions of microbial species involved in the fermentation of cassava dough into agbelima with particular reference to the inhibitory effect of lactic acid bacteria on enteric pathogens.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria, bacillus species and yeasts are involved in the fermentation of cassava dough into agbelima. microbial interactions within and between these groups of microorganisms were investigated in addition to the survival of five enteric pathogens inoculated into agbelima under various conditions. nine out of 10 cultures of lactic acid bacteria isolated at the end of agbelima fermentation showed inhibitory effect against 10 cultures of lactic acid bacteria isolated at the start of fermentation. only 3 out of 10 isolates of bacillus subtilis were inhibited by 10 isolates of lactic acid bacteria tested. no interactions were observed between yeasts and the lactic acid bacteria, whereas three of the bacillus isolates showed inhibitory effects against the yeasts. twelve isolates of lactobacillus plantarum tested inhibited the growth of an isolate each of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus brevis but none tested positive for bacteriocin production. the antimicrobial effect of the lactic acid bacteria was attributed to acid production. in fermenting cassava dough, enteric pathogens survived to different extents depending on ph and their  sensitivity to acids. vibrio cholerae c-230, salmonella typhimurium 9 and salmonella enteritidis 226 were not detectable in 10 g of sample after 4 h when inoculated into the 48-h fermented product, agbelima, whereas shigella dysenteriae 2357t and escherichia coli d2188 were detectable up to 8 h in the product.

TI  == enumeration of bacterial cell numbers by amplified firefly bioluminescence without cultivation.
AB  == we recently developed a novel bioluminescent enzymatic cycling assay for atp and  amp with the concomitant use of firefly luciferase and pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (ppdk), where amp and pyrophosphate produced from atp by firefly luciferase were converted back into atp by ppdk. background luminescence derived  from contaminating atp and amp in the reagent was reduced using adenosine phosphate deaminase which degrades atp, adp, and amp, resulting in constant and highly amplified bioluminescence with low background luminescence. to detect bacterial cells without cultivation, we applied the above bioluminescent enzymatic cycling reagent to rapid microbe detection system. atp spots (0.31-5.0  amol/spot) at the level of a single bacterial cell were detected with 5 min signal integration, signifying that integrated luminescence was amplified 43 times in comparison to traditional atp bioluminescence. consequently, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lactobacillus brevis in  beer were detected without cultivation. significant correlation was observed between the number of signal spots obtained using this novel system and the colony-forming units observed with the conventional colony-counting method (r(2)=0.973).

AB  == a bacterial trehalose phosphorylase (tpase; ec 2.4.1.64) was purified from the culture supernatant of bacillus stearothermophilus sk-1 to apparent homogeneity,  and some properties were investigated. furthermore, a gene from sk-1 responsible  for the tpase was cloned by southern hybridization with a degenerate oligonucleotide probe synthesized on the basis of the n-terminal sequence of the  purified enzyme. the mr of the enzyme was estimated to be 150,000 by gel filtration and 83,000 by sds-page, so the enzyme is likely to be a homodimer. the enzyme had optimum activity at ph 7.0-8.0 or nearby and the optimum temperature was about 75 degrees c. the deduced amino acid sequence of the sk-1 tpase encodes a theoretical protein with a mr of 87,950. alignment of amino acid sequences with a maltose phosphorylase from lactobacillus brevis the crystal structure and active site of which had been analyzed suggested that these two phosphorylases evolved from a common ancestor. the escherichia coli cells harboring the plasmid  containing the cloned tpase gene had about 100 times the activity of sk-1.

TI  == identification by flagellum display of an epithelial cell- and fibronectin-binding function in the slpa surface protein of lactobacillus brevis.
AB  == depletion of the slpa protein from the bacterial surface greatly reduced the adhesion of lactobacillus brevis atcc 8287 to the human intestinal cell lines caco-2 and intestine 407, the endothelial cell line ea-hy926, and the urinary bladder cell line t24, as well as immobilized fibronectin. for functional analysis of the slpa surface protein, different regions of the slpa gene were expressed as internal in-frame fusions in the variable region of the flic(h7) gene of escherichia coli. the resulting chimeric flagella carried inserts up to 275 amino acids long from the mature s-layer protein, which is 435 amino acids in size. the expression of the slpa fragments on the chimeric flagella was assessed  by immunoelectron microscopy and western blotting using anti-slpa antibodies, and their binding to human cells was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. chimeric flagella harboring inserts that represented the n-terminal part of the s-layer protein bound to the epithelial cell lines, whereas the c-terminal part of the s-layer protein did not confer binding on the flagella. the shortest s-layer peptide capable of detectable binding was 81 amino acid residues in size  and represented residues 96 through 176 in the unprocessed s-layer protein. the bacteria and the chimeric flagella did not show detectable binding to erythrocytes, whereas the slpa-expressing atcc 8287 cells as well as the chimeric slpa 96-245/flic flagella bound to immobilized fibronectin. the n-terminal slpa peptide 96-176 or 96-200 fused to flic was not recognized in western blotting or  immunoelectron microscopy by a polyclonal serum raised against the s-layer protein; the antiserum, however, reacted in immunofluorescence with the atcc 8287 cells. in contrast, an antiserum raised against the his-tagged peptide 96-245 of  slpa bound to the hybrid flagella with the n-terminal slpa inserts but did not react with atcc 8287 cells. the results identify the s-layer of l. brevis atcc 8287 as an adhesin with affinity for human epithelial cells and fibronectin and locate the receptor-binding region within a fragment of 81 amino acids in the n-terminal part of the molecule, which in native s-layer seems inaccessible to antibodies.

AB  == a 3-kb region, located downstream of the lactobacillus brevis xyla gene (encoding d-xylose isomerase), was cloned in escherichia coli tg1. the sequence revealed two open reading frames which could code for the d-xylulose kinase gene (xylb) and another gene (xylt) encoding a protein of 457 amino acids with significant similarity to the d-xylose-h+ symporters of e. coli, xyle (57%), and bacillus megaterium, xylt (58%), to the d-xylose-na+ symporter of tetragenococcus halophila, xyle (57%), and to the l-arabinose-h+ symporter of e. coli, arae (60%). the l. brevis xylabt genes showed an arrangement similar to that of the b. megaterium xylabt operon and the t. halophila xylabe operon. southern hybridization performed with the lactobacillus pentosus xylr gene (encoding the d-xylose repressor protein) as a probe revealed the existence of a xylr homologue in l. brevis which is not located with the xyabt locus. the existence of a functional xylr was further suggested by the presence of xylo sequences upstream  of xyla and xylt and by the requirement of d-xylose for the induction of d-xylose isomerase, d-xylulose kinase, and d-xylose transport activities in l. brevis. when l. brevis was cultivated in a mixture of d-glucose and d-xylose, the d-xylose isomerase and d-xylulose kinase activities were reduced fourfold and the d-xylose transport activity was reduced by sixfold, suggesting catabolite repression by d-glucose of d-xylose assimilation. the xylt gene was functionally  expressed in lactobacillus plantarum 80, a strain which lacks proton motive force-linked d-xylose transport activity. the role of the xylt protein was confirmed by the accumulation of d-xylose in l. plantarum 80 cells, and this accumulation was dependent on the proton motive force generated by either malolactic fermentation or by the metabolism of d-glucose. the apparent affinity  constant of xylt for d-xylose was approximately 215 microm, and the maximal initial velocity of transport was 35 nmol/min per mg (dry weight). furthermore, of a number of sugars tested, only 6-deoxy-d-glucose inhibited the transport of d-xylose by xylt competitively, with a ki of 220 microm.

AB  == 1. four experiments with growing broiler chickens were carried out to study the effects of the inclusion in their diets of lupin (lupinus angustifolius) seed meal of e. coli and lactobacilli counts in crop, ileum and caecca at 3 or 4 weeks of age. 2. diets were formulated to contain the same amounts of metabolisable energy (12.55 mj/kg) and protein (210 g/kg). raw whole (heat-untreated) or dehulled sweet (low in alkaloids) lupin seed meal (400 and 320 g/kg respectively) were used to prepare the lupin-based diets, whose protein content was completed with either defatted soyabean meal or casein. 3. final body weight and food intake of chickens fed on whole lupin seed meal diets were lower than controls, but gain: food ratios were not different. however, birds given the diet with dehulled lupin seed meal had similar body weight, food intake and gain: food values as those of controls. 4. while e. coli counts were not affected, lactobacilli numbers were consistently increased compared to controls in all intestinal sections of chickens fed on the whole or dehulled lupin-based diets, irrespective of the age of the birds or the presence of soyabean meal or casein in the diet. the lactobacilli species isolated were: lactobacillus fermentum, l.  acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. brevis. 5. the results suggest that the use of  whole or dehulled sweet lupin seed meal in diets for growing broilers might enhance the growth of lactic acid--fermenting bacteria in the gut.

TI  == high level heterologous protein production in lactococcus and lactobacillus using a new secretion system based on the lactobacillus brevis s-layer signals.
AB  == a secretion cassette, based on the expression and secretion signals of a s-layer  protein (slpa) from lactobacillus brevis, was constructed. e. coli beta-lactamase (bla) was used as the reporter protein to determine the functionality of the s-layer signals for heterologous expression and secretion in lactococcus lactis,  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus casei using a low-copy-number plasmid derived from pgk12. in all hosts tested, the bla gene was expressed under the slpa signals and all bla activity was secreted to the culture medium. the lb. brevis s-layer promoters were very efficiently recognized in l. lactis, lb. brevis and lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. gasseri the slpa promoter region appeared to be recognized at a lower level and in lb. casei the level of transcripts was below the detection limit. the production of bla was mainly restricted to the exponential phase of growth. the highest yield of bla was obtained with l. lactis and lb. brevis. without ph control, substantial degradation of bla occurred during prolonged cultivations with all lactic acid bacteria (lab) tested. when growing l. lactis and lb. brevis under ph control, the bla activity could be stabilized also at the stationary phase. l. lactis produced up to 80 mg/l of bla which to our knowledge  represents the highest amount of a heterologous protein secreted by lab so far. the short production phase implied a very high rate of secretion with a calculated value of 5 x 10(5) bla molecules/cell per h. such a high rate was also observed with lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. brevis the competition between the wild type slpa gene and the secretion construct probably lowered the rate of bla  production. the results obtained indicate wide applicability of the lb. brevis slpa signals for efficient protein production and secretion in lab.

TI  == cloning, purification, and properties of a cofactor-independent glutamate racemase from lactobacillus brevis atcc 8287.
AB  == a glutamate racemase gene of lactobacillus brevis atcc 8287 was cloned into escherichia coli tm93 by the phenotypic complementation of a phosphoenolpyruvate  carboxylase deficiency on minimum agar medium containing d-glutamate. the gene was localized to a 1.4-kb hindiii-ecori dna fragment and the total nucleotide sequence of the fragment was analyzed. the gene has typical promoter and sd sequences which appeared to function in e. coli. the deduced amino acid sequence  of the enzyme had 276 amino acids and the molecular weight was calculated as 29,426. two cysteine residues and their surrounding regions of the enzyme are homologous to those of other cofactor-independent racemases. the glutamate racemase was purified from recombinant e. coli to homogeneity and characterized.  the enzyme required no cofactors for the activity, and retained its activity even in 2 m (300 g/l) l-glutamate.

TI  == cooperative binding of lactose and the phosphorylated phosphocarrier protein hpr(ser-p) to the lactose/h+ symport permease of lactobacillus brevis.
AB  == lactobacillus brevis accumulates lactose and nonmetabolizable lactose analogues via sugar/h+ symport, but addition of glucose to the extracellular medium results in rapid efflux of the free sugar from the cells due to the uncoupling of sugar transport from proton transport. by using vesicles of l. brevis cells, we recently showed that these regulatory/effects could be attributed to the metabolite-activated atp-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of serine-46 in the phosphocarrier protein hpr [hpr(ser-p)] of the phosphotransferase system and that a mutant form of hpr with the serine-46-->aspartate replacement ([s46d]hpr) is apparently locked in the seryl phosphorylated conformation. we here demonstrate that [s46d]hpr binds directly to inside-out membrane vesicles of l. brevis that contain the lactose permease. sugar substrates of the permease markedly and specifically stimulate binding of [s46d]hpr to the membranes while certain transport inhibitors such as n-ethylmaleimide block binding. the ph dependency for binding follows that for transport. wild-type hpr and the [s46a]hpr mutant protein did not appreciably compete with [s46d]hpr for binding to the permease. these results provide evidence for the direct interaction of hpr(ser-p) with an allosteric site on the  lactose/proton symporter of l. brevis for the purpose of regulating sugar accumulation in response to the metabolic needs of the cell.

TI  == atp-dependent phosphorylation of serine-46 in the phosphocarrier protein hpr regulates lactose/h+ symport in lactobacillus brevis.
AB  == lactobacillus brevis takes up lactose and the nonmetabolizable lactose analogue thiomethyl beta-galactoside (tmg) by a permease-catalyzed lactose/h+ symport mechanism. earlier studies have shown that tmg, previously accumulated in l. brevis cells, rapidly effluxes from the cells upon addition of glucose, and that  glucose inhibits further uptake of tmg. we have developed a vesicular system to analyze this regulatory mechanism and have used electroporation to shock proteins and membrane-impermeant metabolites into the vesicles. uptake of tmg was dependent on an energy source, effectively provided by intravesicular atp or extravesicular arginine. tmg uptake into these vesicles was not inhibited, and preaccumulated tmg did not efflux from them upon addition of glucose. intravesicular but not extravesicular wild-type phosphocarrier protein hpr of bacillus subtilis restored regulation. glucose could be replaced by intravesicular (but not extravesicular) fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, gluconate 6-phosphate, or 2-phosphoglycerate, but not by other phosphorylated metabolites,  in agreement with the allosteric activating effects of these compounds on hpr(ser) kinase measured in vitro. intravesicular serine-46-->alanine mutant hpr  cold not promote regulation of lactose permease activity when electroporated into the vesicles with or without glucose or the various phosphorylated metabolites, but the serine-46-->aspartate mutant hpr promoted regulation, even in the absence of glucose or a metabolite. hpr(ser-p) appears to convert the lactose/h+ symporter into a sugar uniporter. these results establish that hpr serine phosphorylation by the atp-dependent metabolite-activated hpr kinase regulates lactose permease activity in l. brevis. a direct allosteric mechanism is proposed.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured indian milk product ('dahi').
AB  == neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, bacillus brevis, bacillus circulans, bacillus coagulans, bacillus laterosporus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. the effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3)  cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by  the agar incorporation method. neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. this study indicated  the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of  foods.

TI  == incompatibility of lactobacillus vectors with replicons derived from small cryptic lactobacillus plasmids and segregational instability of the introduced vectors.
AB  == three new lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. the shuttle vector plp3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from lactobacillus pentosus md353, an erythromycin resistance gene from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pe194, and puc19 as a replicon for escherichia coli. the vectors plpe317 and plpe323, which do not contain e. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pe194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from l. pentosus md353, respectively. these vectors and the shuttle vector plp825 (m. posno, r. j. leer, j. m. m. van rijn, b. c. lokman, and p. h. pouwels, p. 397-401, in a. t. ganesan and j. a. hoch, ed., genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into lactobacillus casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, and l. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of dna. plasmid dna analysis of l. pentosus md353 transformants revealed that the introduction of plp3537 or plpe323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. remarkably, plpe317 could only be introduced into an l. pentosus md353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb  plasmid. the curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. however, plpe323 is stable in three of four lactobacillus strains tested so far.

TI  == the deconjugation ability of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids in the blind loop syndrome with high 14co2 excretion--using the breath analysis technique and thin-layer chromatography.
AB  == five patients with blind loop syndrome (billroth ii) were examined by measuring 14co2 specific activity of expired breath samples taken at intervals after a meal containing glycine-1-14c cholate. the 5 patients tested showed a marked increase  of 14co2 specific activity. furthermore, the ability of deconjugation of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids in the efferent loop of these patients was tested by thin layer chromatography. the bacterial species identified from the samples were as follows: enterococcus, lactobacillus (l) buchneri, l. bifidus, l. brevis, eubacterium (e) lentum, bacteroides (b) vulgaricus, b. filamentosum, corynebacterium (c) granulosum, escherichia (e) coli, staphylococcus (s) epidermidis, and aerobacter (a) aerogenes. these species of bacteria, except e. coli and a. aerogenes, showed the deconjugation ability by which conjugated bile  acids in ox gall was hydrolyzed. administration of chloramphenicol (1g per day for 14 days orally divided doses) to the 5 patients reduced 14co2 specific activity significantly. on the other hand, 9 healthy men (control subjects) who were tested showed a flat curve, and 8 of the 9 had no growth of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids. the remaining healthy man showed an overgrowth  of e. coli and pseudomonas (p) aeruginosa, but the species did not have the ability of deconjugation. thus, we concluded that the patients with blind loop syndrome(billroth ii) had the bacterial overgrowth in the efferent loop that contained species with deconjugation ability, and, as a result the bacterial overgrowth contributed to causing abnormalities (increased deconjugation) in the  metabolism of bile acids in the small intestine. when the concentration of conjugated bile acids in the small intestine was reduced to levels below the critical micellar concentration by several factors, fat malabsorption and subsequent steatorrhea were induced (1,-4). furthermore, h. fromm and a. f. hofmann presented in vivo that the patients with blind loop syndrome had fat malabsorption and the patients who had a high 14co2 output after oral administration of glycine-1-14c cholate showed a low 14co2 output after oral administration of antibiotic drug (5,6). however, there has been no report on the deconjugation ability of bile acids of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids  in the efferent loop of patients with billroth ii who had positive breath tests.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  == various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (tk; ec 2.7.1.21). taking the specific tk activity of escherichia coli k12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific tk activities. in the gram-positive cocci, staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of strep. pyogenes (29%). neisseria sicca, a gram-negative coccus, lacked tk. gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (bacillus, 13-51%; clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of b. megaterium (2%) and c. difficile (1-3%). among the gram-positive asporogenous rods, listeria monocytogenes and six species of lactobacillus (especially l. brevis, l. buchneri and l. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. lactis and l. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). of the species of pseudomonas studied, most  lacked tk but ps. fluorescens and ps. maltophilia had significant tk activity (15-53%). of the gram-negative facultative anaerobes, vibrio lacked tk, while enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella (148-1120%), escherichia (59-141%), klebsiella (78-299%) and serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'pr. rettgerella' (307%). propionibacterium and bifidobacterium and related organisms other than streptomyces, nocardia, rhodococcus, corynebacterium and mycobacterium lacked tk. the seven species of candida tested, and cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked tk.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == a study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. groups of germfree akr mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: streptococcus faecalis. lactobacillus brevis. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and torulopsis sp. all species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of e. coli or p. aeruginosa. the presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the  colonization of p. aeruginosa and not of e. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.

TI  == biosynthesis of diacetyl in bacteria and yeast.
AB  == both diacetyl and acetoin were produced by cell-free extracts and cultures of pseudomonas fluorescens, aerobacter aerogenes, lactobacillus brevis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae 299, whereas only acetoin was produced by cell-free extracts and cultures of streptococcus lactis, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, and s. cerevisiae strains 513 and 522. cell-free extracts that produced diacetyl did not produce it from acetoin; they produced it from pyruvate, but only if acetyl-coenzyme a was was added to the reaction mixtures. production of diacetyl by s. cerevisiae 299 was prevented by valine, inhibited by sodium arsenite, and stimulated by pantothenic acid. valine did not prevent the production of acetoin. e. coli and the three strains of s. cerevisiae did not decarboxylate alpha-acetolactate but did use acetaldehyde in the production of acetoin from pyruvate. the other organisms produced acetoin from pyruvate via alpha-acetolactate.
