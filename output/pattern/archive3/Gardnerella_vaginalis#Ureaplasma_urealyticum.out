plants traditionally used individually and in combination to treat sexually transmitted infections in northern maputaland, south africa: antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity.
ethnopharmacological relevance: although medicinal plants are used extensively to treat sexually transmitted infections (stis) in rural northern maputaland, kwazulu-natal, the efficacy and safety of these plants have not previously been evaluated. aim of study: a study was designed to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity profiles of a selection (individual plants and selected combinations) of traditionally used plants in this study area. materials and methods: aqueous and organic (dichloromethane: methanol, 1:1) extracts were prepared. antimicrobial activity was assessed using the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assay against the sti associated pathogens; candida albicans atcc 10231, ureaplasma urealyticum clinical strain, oligella ureolytica atcc 43534, trichomonas vaginalis clinical strain, gardnerella vaginalis atcc 14018 and neisseria gonorrhoeae atcc 19424. for the combination study, interactions were assessed using the fractional inhibitory concentration (sigmafic). the plant species were assessed for safety using the 3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazol-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-2h-tetrazolium bromide (mtt) cellular viability assay on the human embryonic kidney epithelial (graham, hek-293) cell line. results: for the antimicrobial studies, u. urealyticum was the most sensitive of the six test organisms, with the aqueous extract of ranunculus multifidus (0.02mg/ml) and the organic extract of peltophorum africanum (0.04mg/ml) being the most antimicrobially active plant species studied. sclerocarya birrea was found to have the broadest spectrum of activity (mean mic of 0.89mg/ml). the only plant species to exhibit some degree of cytotoxicity against the kidney epithelial cell line was kigelia africana (100microg/ml), with 22% and 16% cell death for the aqueous and organic extracts, respectively. of the 13 combinations studied, several synergistic combinations were evident, the most prominent being the combination of albizia adianthifolia and trichilia dregeana (aqueous extract) with an sigmafic value of 0.15 against o. ureolytica. synergistic interactions were observed regardless of the ratio of the aqueous mixtures of the two plants. syzygium cordatum and s. birrea (aqueous extract) was also a combination of interest, demonstrating synergistic (sigmafic=0.42) interactions against o. ureolytica. this combination, however, also displayed some cytotoxicity towards the human epithelial cell line. conclusion: this study demonstrated that anecdotal evidence of plant use does not always correlate with in vitro activity. furthermore, the toxicological profiling is of utmost importance as if not combined in its correct ratio can lead to potential adverse effects.
[prevalence of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections among high-risk patients attending a free anonymous hiv-screening center].
introduction: the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections among patients attending an anonymous hiv screening center. patients and methods: this prospective study was performed in the hiv screening center of university hospital in reims (france) from may 1997 to december 1997. the inclusion criteria were the asymptomatic clinical presentation and the presence of risk factors for sexually transmitted infections referring to who criteria. the methods included clinical examination after application of acetic acid and urethral and endocervical swabs to identify:neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, gardnerella vaginalis, trichomonas vaginalis in specific culture. treponema pallidum and hiv-1 infection were both detected by enzym linked immuno sorbent assay (elisa). results: one hundred and one patients (62 men and 39 women) were included in the study. their mean age was 27 +/- 4 years. risk factors for sexually transmitted infections were: multiple sexual partners 81 p. 100; homo or bisexuality 16 p. 100; intravenous drug use 3 p. 100. the sexually transmitted infections were: hiv-1 infection 1 p. 100;ureaplasma urealyticum 25 p. 100; genital warts 5 p. 100;chlamydia trachomatis 3 p. 100; gardnerella vaginalis 3 p. 100; mycoplasma hominis 2 p. 100; treponema pallidum 0 p. 100; neisseria gonorrhoeae 0 p. 100; trichomonas vaginalis 0 p. 100. the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections was significantly higher among women (p<0.05). discussion: classical sexually transmitted infections and hiv infection were rarely detected in this study; but prevalence of other sexually transmitted infections (genital warts, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum) was high. ureaplasma urealyticum is considered as a possible pathogenic agent in pregnant women (preterm delivery, decrease of birth weight, chorioamniotitis). these results suggest that other than sexually transmitted infections in high risk patients attending a hiv screening center other sexually transmitted infections should also be systematically screened for.
[epidemiological factors and vaginal flora changes in vaginal bacteriosis (bacterial vaginosis)].
background: the aim of this study was to know the modifications of the vaginal bacterial flora that occurs in bacterial vaginosis and to know the involvement of these microorganisms and the influence of several epidemiologic factors in the etiology of this disease. methods: we studied, by using semiquantitative cultures and glc, vaginal washings from 50 healthy women and 50 women with bacterial vaginosis. results: the most remarkable results were the high sensitivity of amsel's criteria and their good correlation with glc. women with bacterial vaginosis showed a great increase of cfus/ml of gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum and several species of anaerobic bacteria, and an important decrease of the amounts of aerobic lactobacilli. the main epidemiologic factor among those that were studied was the use of iuds. conclusions: the appearance of bacterial vaginosis is associated with the increase of the amounts of g. vaginalis, bacteroides or related genera (prevotella, porphyromonas), and probably m. hominis and u. urealyticum, also being associated to a decrease of the amounts of aerobic lactobacilli. these facts are probably related with alteration in the ecologic relationship lactobacilli/g. vaginalis/anaerobic bacteria.
a review of the in-vitro activity of roxithromycin against genital pathogens.
the in-vitro activity of roxithromycin against neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, treponema pallidum, gardnerella vaginalis and haemophilus ducreyi is reviewed. roxithromycin demonstrated equivalent activity to erythromycin against n. gonorrhoeae, c. trachomatis, m. hominis, u. urealyticum, g. vaginalis and h. ducreyi. in a rabbit model for syphilis, potentially useful activity against t. pallidum has been demonstrated.
