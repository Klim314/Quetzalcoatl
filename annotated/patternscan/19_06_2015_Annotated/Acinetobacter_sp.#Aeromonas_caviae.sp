TI  == the in-vitro antibacterial effects of organic salts, chemical disinfectants and antibiotics against pathogens of black disease in fairy shrimp of thailand.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of organic salts, chemical disinfectants and antibiotics were evaluated on cultures of aeromonas hydrophila c03, aeromonas sobria c26, a. sobria c29, aeromonas caviae c24 and acinetobacter sp. sh-94b, the pathogens that cause black disease found in fairy shrimps (streptocephalus sirindhornae sanoamuang et al. (2000) and branchinella thailandensis sanoamuang,  saengphan & murugan) of thailand. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of organic salts (sodium chloride and potassium chloride) and antibiotics (oxytetracycline dihydrate, streptomycin sulphate, kanamycin monosulphate, chloramphenicol and ampicillin) were determined using the agar-dilution method. the effect of chemical disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide) was evaluated by exposing bacteria to different concentrations of these chemicals for different periods of time. interestingly, all strains were intrinsically resistant to 0.25-3% sodium chloride and potassium chloride. the effect of sodium hypochlorite was greater than that of chlorine dioxide, and 5-20 mug ml(-1) of sodium hypochlorite was sufficient to inhibit the growth of these bacteria, but the exposure time varied, depending on the bacterial species. of the antibiotics  tested, chloramphenicol and oxytetracycline dihydrate completely inhibited the selected strains. chloramphenicol showed the highest antibacterial effect against all pathogenic species--the mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) ranged from 0.8 to 3.1 mug ml(-1) from 3.1 to 6.25 mug ml(-1), respectively. to achieve control of black disease during cultivation of fairy shrimp, data derived from this study can be used as a basis for further toxicity tests in vivo.

TI  == air-dust-borne associations of phototrophic and hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms: promising consortia in volatile hydrocarbon bioremediation.
AB  == aquatic and terrestrial associations of phototrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms active in hydrocarbon bioremediation have been described earlier.  the question arises: do similar consortia also occur in the atmosphere? dust samples at the height of 15 m were collected from kuwait city air, and analyzed microbiologically for phototrophic and heterotrophic hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms, which were subsequently characterized according to their 16s rrna gene sequences. the hydrocarbon utilization potential of the heterotrophs alone,  and in association with the phototrophic partners, was measured quantitatively. the chlorophyte gloeotila sp. and the two cyanobacteria nostoc commune and leptolyngbya thermalis were found associated with dust, and (for comparison) the  cynobacteria leptolyngbya sp. and acaryochloris sp. were isolated from coastal water. all phototrophic cultures harbored oil vapor-utilizing bacteria in the magnitude of 10(5) g(-1). each phototrophic culture had its unique oil-utilizing  bacteria; however, the bacterial composition in leptolyngbya cultures from air and water was similar. the hydrocarbon-utilizing bacteria were affiliated with acinetobacter sp., aeromonas caviae, alcanivorax jadensis, bacillus asahii, bacillus pumilus, marinobacter aquaeolei, paenibacillus sp., and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. the nonaxenic cultures, when used as inocula in batch cultures, attenuated crude oil in light and dark, and in the presence of antibiotics and absence of nitrogenous compounds. aqueous and diethyl ether extracts from the phototrophic cultures enhanced the growth of the pertinent oil-utilizing bacteria in batch cultures, with oil vapor as a sole carbon source. it was concluded that  the airborne microbial associations may be effective in bioremediating atmospheric hydrocarbon pollutants in situ. like the aquatic and terrestrial habitats, the atmosphere contains dust-borne associations of phototrophic and heterotrophic hydrocarbon-utilizing bacteria that are active in hydrocarbon attenuation.

TI  == comparison of the antimicrobial tolerance of oxytetracycline-resistant heterotrophic bacteria isolated from hospital sewage and freshwater fishfarm water in belgium.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between antimicrobial tolerance and taxonomic diversity among the culturable oxytetracycline-resistant  (ot(r)) heterotrophic bacterial population in two belgian aquatic sites receiving wastewater either from human medicine or from aquaculture. the study of ot(r) heterotrophs and mesophilic aeromonas spp. allowed comparison of tolerance data at the intergenus as well as at the intragenus level. in total, 354 independently obtained ot(r) isolates were subjected to antimicrobial tolerance testing and identified by glc analysis of their cellular fatty acid methyl esters (fames), by api 20e profiling and/or by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (faflp) dna fingerprinting. in general, ot(r) hospital heterotrophs displayed a higher frequency (84%) of ampicillin (amp) tolerance compared to the ot(r) heterotrophs from the freshwater fishfarm site (22%). fame results indicated that this effect was linked to the predominance of intrinsically ampicillin-resistant  ot(r) aeromonas strains over representatives of acinetobacter and escherichia coli within the hospital strain set. among the ot(r) mesophilic aeromonas strain  set, the global tolerance profiles of the two sites only differed in a higher number of kanamycin (kan) -tolerant strains (43%) for hospital aeromonads in comparison with the fishfarm aeromonads (8%). to some extent, this finding was correlated with the specific presence of aeromonas caviae dna hybridisation group (hg) 4. collectively, these results suggest that the profiles for amp and kan tolerance observed in both sites arose from taxonomic differences in the culturable ot(r) bacterial population at the generic or subgeneric level. in addition, our identification data also revealed that enterobacter sp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and a. veronii biovar sobria hg8 may be considered  potential indicator organisms to assess microbial tolerance in various compartments of the aquatic environment.
