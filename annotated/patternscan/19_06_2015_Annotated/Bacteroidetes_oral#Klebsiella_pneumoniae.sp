TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp.), fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. streptococcus spp. (including s.  pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have also been reported. gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are arachnia, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. therapy includes maintenance  of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. the choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx  may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.

TI  == oral colonization of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci in irradiated, dentate, xerostomic individuals.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the oral colonization of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci in head- and neck-irradiated, dentate, xerostomic individuals. subjects were recruited from a  nasopharyngeal carcinoma clinic and were segregated into group a: <60 years (n=25, 48+/-6 years, 5+/-5 years post-irradiation) and group b: >or=60 years (n=8, 67+/-4 years, 2+/-2 years post-irradiation) and were compared with age- and sex-matched normal individuals, group c: <60 years (n=20, 44+/-12 years) and group d: >or=60 years (n=10, 70+/-3 years). selective culture of the oral rinse samples was carried out to isolate, quantify and speciate (using api 20e kit) aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci recovery. all test subjects were put under comprehensive oral and preventive care for 3 months, and 12 group a and 5 group b subjects were recalled for reassessment of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci colonization. all identical isolates, pre- and post-hygienic care, were phenotypically (vitek, hazelwood, ma and antibiogram profile) and genotypically (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) evaluated. the aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci isolated from the first round oral rinse samples included: acinetobacter, neisseria, chryseomonas, flavimonas, pseudomonas, citrobacter, enterobacter, escherichia, klebsiella, flavobacterium and weeksella species. the  aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci isolation rate was high for irradiated individuals, and they were 64/25% and 100/80% for groups  a/c and b/d, respectively. recovery of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae in oral  rinse samples were found to be significantly more prevalent in the irradiated subjects (groups a and b). enterobacteriaceae were more frequently isolated from  oral rinse samples of aged irradiated subjects (group b vs d, p<0.05), where the  quantity of citrobacter freundii (colony-forming units/ml oral rinse) was also significantly elevated. the isolation rate of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci after hygienic care remained unchanged; 3 of 12 and  3 of 5 of the recalled subjects from groups a and b, respectively, harbored same  aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci species. however, only two pairs of k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, sequentially isolated from same patients in group b, were found to be identical by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. this may be due to reinfection of the microbes from the same source or permanent colonization. in conclusion, irradiation-induced xerostomia seems to favor frequent, repeated, transient intraoral colonization of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci.

TI  == the predominant microflora of the palatal mucosa in an elderly island population.
AB  == the prevalence and microbiology of macrophotographically documented denture stomatitis were studied in denture wearers participating in an interdisciplinary  health-monitoring project (koster health project) on the koster islands, sweden.  upper dentures were used by 26.6% of the adult population, and 59.2% of the denture wearers had stomatitis. denture stomatitis type i was identified as sialadenitis. the more severe forms of denture stomatitis (types ii and iii) demonstrated increased recovery of microorganisms in the palatal mucosa in addition to sialadenitis. only one proband showed increased growth of fungi. hemophilus spp. and bacteroides spp. were the predominating microorganisms in stomatitis types ii and iii. shifts in the normal oral flora are suggested to be  an important factor for the development of denture stomatitis. it is concluded that bacterial colonization on the palatal mucosa may play an important role in denture stomatitis in this relatively healthy population.

TI  == microbial aspects of failing osseointegrated dental implants in humans.
AB  == the subgingival microflora of 18 failing implants were examined for pathogenic periodontal microorganisms. peptostreptococcus micros was recovered from 6 failing implants, wolinella recta from 6, fusobacterium species from 5, candida albicans from 5, and bacteroides intermedius from 4. enteric rods or pseudomonads constituted a significant part of the microflora in 5 failing implants. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, nonpigmented bacteroides species, capnocytophage species, and staphylococci were detected in a few implant failures. the present study showed that a complex microflora comprising oral as well as primarily non oral organisms, and bacteria as well as yeasts, can be associated with failing implants. this great diversity in microbial composition and antimicrobial susceptibility among "peri-implantitis" isolates suggest that antimicrobial therapies for implant failures should not be implemented without a  prior comprehensive microbiological analysis.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == vein reconstruction of a mycotic internal carotid aneurysm.
AB  == carotid aneurysms are an extremely rare entity; mycotic carotid aneurysms are even more uncommon. most articles in the past have advocated ligation as treatment of mycotic carotid aneurysms due to the dangers of graft placement in an infected field. unfortunately, stroke occurs in many patients so treated. as the cerebral complications were so high, bypass using autogenous vein and fine monofilament polypropylene sutures is attractive. this technique was used in a patient having a mycotic carotid aneurysm who was referred to the vascular service of the shands teaching hospital. pre- and postoperative antibiotics, resection of the aneurysm, anastomosis in a noninfected area, and long-term oral  antibiotics were felt to be other important aspects of the patient's treatment. this individual is well one year after operation without neurological sequelae. this case suggests that if strict operative and therapeutic guidelines are observed, bypass with autogenous vein is a feasible operative alternative in patients having mycotic carotid aneurysms. the risk of this procedure must be carefully weighed against the devastating neurological sequellae that might result with ligation.
