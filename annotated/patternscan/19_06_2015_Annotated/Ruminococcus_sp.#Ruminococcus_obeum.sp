TI  == blautia faecis sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == a strictly anoxic, gram-stain-positive, non-motile blautia-like bacterium, designated strain m25(t), was isolated from a human faecal sample. strain m25(t)  was negative for both catalase and oxidase activity, utilized carbohydrates as fermentable substrates, produced lactate and acetate as the major end products of glucose fermentation in pyg medium, and had a dna g+c content of 41.6 mol%. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that strain m25(t) was closely related to ruminococcus obeum atcc 29174(t) (96.40 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity) and blautia glucerasea hfth-1(t) (96.17 %) within the family lachnospiraceae. straight-chain saturated and monounsaturated cellular fatty acids were also detected, the majority being c(14 : 0), c(16 : 0) and c(16 : 0) dimethyl acetal acids. based on the phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics presented in this study, strain m25(t) represents a novel species within the genus blautia for which the name blautia faecis sp. nov. is proposed.  the type strain is m25(t) ( = kctc 5980(t) = jcm 17205(t)).

TI  == isolation of a novel bacterium, blautia glucerasei sp. nov., hydrolyzing plant glucosylceramide to ceramide.
AB  == a bacterial strain that is capable of hydrolyzing plant glucosylceramide (glucer) was newly isolated from dog feces. the novel strain, designated as strain hfth-1(t), hydrolyzed plant glucer with a variety of chemical structures, but did not hydrolyze glucosylsphingosine, lactosylceramide, or monosialoganglioside gm(3), indicating that strain hfth-1(t) produces glucer-specific glucosylceramidase. strain hfth-1(t) was gram-positive, anaerobic, oval-spore-forming, rod-shaped, lecithinase-negative, and lipase-negative. it fermented a wide variety of carbohydrates and produced mainly acetate, formate, and lactate from glucose. the g + c content of its dna was 40.7 mol%. the phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna sequence revealed that strain hfth-1(t) is placed in the clostridial rrna cluster xiva, with ruminococcus obeum as the nearest relative. pairwise comparison revealed approximately 5.0% sequence divergence between strain hfth-1(t) and the type strain of r. obeum. on the basis of its phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic divergence, it is proposed that the hitherto unknown rod-shaped bacterial strain hfth-1(t) (= dsm 22028(t) = nbrc 104932(t)) should be placed in the genus blautia as a novel species, blautia glucerasei sp. nov, the only currently known isolate of the species.

TI  == reclassification of clostridium coccoides, ruminococcus hansenii, ruminococcus hydrogenotrophicus, ruminococcus luti, ruminococcus productus and ruminococcus schinkii as blautia coccoides gen. nov., comb. nov., blautia hansenii comb. nov., blautia hydrogenotrophica comb. nov., blautia luti comb. nov., blautia producta comb. nov., blautia schinkii comb. nov. and description of blautia wexlerae sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on 15 isolates of an unidentified gram-positive, anaerobic, non-sporulating coccobacillus-shaped bacterium isolated from human faeces. the novel organisms were catalase-negative, indole-negative and produced acetate and succinate as end products of metabolism. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing demonstrated that the 15 isolates were highly related to each other and formed a hitherto unknown subline within the clostridial rrna cluster xiva. the novel isolates formed a robust phylogenetic group with a number of organisms which included clostridium coccoides, ruminococcus luti, ruminococcus obeum and a number of other misclassified ruminococci. on the basis of these studies, a novel genus, blautia gen. nov., is  proposed. it is suggested that clostridium coccoides, ruminococcus hansenii, ruminococcus hydrogenotrophicus, ruminococcus luti, ruminococcus productus, and ruminococcus schinkii are transferred to this genus as blautia coccoides gen. nov., comb. nov., blautia hansenii comb. nov., blautia hydrogenotrophica comb. nov., blautia luti comb. nov., blautia producta comb. nov. and blautia schinkii comb. nov. one of the new isolates, the hitherto unknown coccus-shaped bacterial  strain wal 14507t (=atcc baa-1564t=dsm 19850t) is proposed as representing the type strain of a novel species, blautia wexlerae sp. nov.

TI  == molecular analyses of the intestinal microbiota of chimpanzees in the wild and in captivity.
AB  == little information is available regarding the intestinal bacteria of chimpanzees  in the wild, due to the technical difficulties of studying intestinal bacteria in the field. in this study, molecular-based bacterial analyses were performed to overcome this difficulty because polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based methods, such as temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge) and amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), of the bacterial 16s rrna gene can be applied to ethanol-fixed fecal samples. the common presence of bacteria belonging to the  clostridium rrna sub-group xiva, such as ruminococcus obeum and eubacterium sp.,  was indicated for bossou wild chimpanzees by ardra. tgge on partial 16s rdna followed by hierarchical clustering analysis showed a systematic difference in the composition of intestinal microbiota between wild and captive chimpanzees. however, several tgge bands commonly shared by wild and captured chimpanzees were excised, and their sequences were obtained. they were suggested to be the clostridium leptum subgroup bacteria, lactobacillus gasseri-like bacterium, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum- or b. catenulatum-like bacterium. these may be considered as common intestinal bacteria for chimpanzees, and may be transmitted  vertically over generations.

TI  == effects of long-term ingestion of difructose anhydride iii (dfa iii) on intestinal bacteria and bile acid metabolism in humans.
AB  == changes in the intestinal microbiota of 10 human subjects with long-term ingestion of 3 g/d difructose anhydride iii (dfa iii; 4 persons, 2 months; 3 persons, 6 months; and 3 persons, 12 months) were examined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). according to the answers to questionnaires, the subjects were divided into two groups (constipated and normal). the dgge profile  was different for every individual and each subject had unique profiles of intestinal microbiota. in the dgge profiles of constipated subjects, the intensities of bands related to bacteroides spp. increased. moreover, the dfa iii-assimilating bacteria, ruminococcus sp. were isolated from subjects who ingested dfa iii for 12 months. these strains showed 95% similarity of their 16s  rdna sequences with that of ruminococcus obeum atcc 29174(t) (x85101) and produced large amounts of acetic acid. dfa iii ingestion for 2 months tended to increase total organic acids in feces, and tended to decrease fecal ph and the secondary bile acid (sba) ratio in total bile acids. the sba ratio in total bile  acids corresponded to fecal ph. the production of sba was decreased by low ph in  vitro. these results indicated that dfa iii ingestion in humans tended to lower intestinal ph, inhibited bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation activities and also tended to decrease the sba ratios in total bile acids. moreover, as another cause for the decrease in the sba ratio in total bile acids, it was suggested that the  number of bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating bacteria were decreased by dfa iii ingestion.

TI  == ruminococcus luti sp. nov., isolated from a human faecal sample.
AB  == a strain of an unidentified strictly anoxic, gram-postive, non-motile ruminococcus-like bacterium was isolated from a human faecal sample. the organism used carbohydrates as fermentable substrates, produced acetate, succinate, and hydrogen as the major products of glucose metabolism, and possessed a g + c content of 43.3 mol%. the morphological and biochemical characteristics of the organism were consistent with its assignment to the genus ruminococcus but it did not correspond to any recognized species of this genus. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing showed the unidentified bacterium represents a previously unrecognised sub-line within the clostridium coccoides rrna group of organisms. the nearest relative of the unknown bacterium corresponded to ruminococcus obeum but a 16s rrna sequence divergence value of >3% demonstrated it represents a different species. based on the presented findings a new species, ruminococcus luti, is described. the type strain of ruminococcus luti is binix(t) (dsm 14534t, ccug 45635t).
