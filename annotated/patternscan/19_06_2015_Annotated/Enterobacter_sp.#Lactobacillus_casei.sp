TI  == a sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium bacillus sp. yas 1 strain.
AB  == bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. the present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as bacillus sp. yas 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. a sequential statistical approach (plackett-burman and box-behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (bac yas 1) production. using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in bac yas 1 level (470 au/ml arbitrary units against erwinia amylovora). bac yas 1  showed activity over a wide range of ph (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees c). a wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of bac yas 1 against the human pathogens (clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus sp., proteus sp., klebsiella sp., and salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (e. amylovora), and the food spoiler  (listeria innocua) was demonstrated. on top and above, bac yas 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. lactis, and l. reuteri). promising characteristics of bac yas 1 prompt  its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.

TI  == study of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus strains as probiotics on multi drug resistant (mdr) bacteria isolated from urinary tract infections (utis).
AB  == objective(s): urinary tract infection (uti) caused by bacteria is one of the most frequent infections in human population. inappropriate use of antibiotics, often  leads to appearance of drug resistance in bacteria. however, use of probiotic bacteria has been suggested as a partial replacement. this study was aimed to assess the antagonistic effects of lactobacillus standard strains against bacteria isolated from uti infections. materials and methods: among 600 samples;  those with >/=10,000 cfu/ml were selected as uti positive samples. enterococcus sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and escherichia coli were found the most prevalent uti causative agents. all isolates were screened for multi drug resistance and subjected to the antimicrobial effects of three lactobacillus strains by using microplate technique and the mics amounts were determined. in order to verify the origin of antibiotic resistance of isolates, plasmid curing using ethidium bromide and acridine orange was carried out. results: no antagonistic activity in lactobacilli suspension was detected against test on enterococcus and enterobacter strains and k. pneumoniae, which were resistant to  most antibiotics. however, an inhibitory effect was observed for e. coli which were resistant to 8-9 antibiotics. in addition, l. casei was determined to be the most effective probiotic. results from replica plating suggested one of the plasmids could be related to the gene responsible for ampicillin resistance. conclusion: treatment of e. coli with probiotic suspension was not effective on inhibition of the plasmid carrying hypothetical ampicillin resistant gene. moreover, the plasmid profiles obtained from probiotic-treated isolates were identical to untreated isolates.

TI  == effects of feeding premature infants with lactobacillus gg on gut fermentation.
AB  == the study aimed to find out whether gut colonisation of premature babies with a probiotic, lactobacillus gg, modified enteric carbohydrate fermentation. twenty preterm infants were randomised to receive lactobacillus gg 10(8) colony forming  units twice a day for two weeks or to a control group. faecal short chain fatty acids (scfas), ethanol, and urinary 2,3-butanediol, were measured in parallel with microbiological studies. lactobacillus gg colonised nine babies. from 1-28 days of age faecal scfas did not differ significantly from controls. median and ranges were (treated and controls, respectively): acetic acid: 173 (trace-799), 166 (trace-700); propionic acid: 44 (trace-169), 37 (11-229); butyric acid: 31 (5-107), 37 (2-118) mumol/g dry weight. ethanol was detected in more faecal samples from treated babies (65% v 37%), and at higher concentration (6.3 (trace-40) v 3.3 (0.6-8.8; one 229) mumol/g). 2,3-butanediol was found in 66% of  urine samples from treated babies and 58% from controls. on 83% of these occasions klebsiella sp, enterobacter sp, or serratia sp were cultured from faeces. lactobacillus gg had no obvious adverse effects on nutritionally important scfas. the small increase in ethanol excretion is unlikely to have clinical significance.

TI  == [effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  == bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains,  the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, streptococcus sanguis, s. saprophyticus, s. faecalis, escherichia coli, micrococcus flavus, actinomyces viscosus, veillonella sp., enterobacter liquefaciens, yersinia enterocolitica. lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. proteus vulgaris, y. enterocolitica and chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. the yeasts endomyces lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, rhodotorula mucilaginosa and cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. the kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did  not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.

TI  == the effects of temperature and growth rate on the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in bacterial lipids.
AB  == the effects of temperature and growth rate on the fatty acid composition of the extractable lipids of four mesophilic and three psychotrophic bacteria were examined. two of the mesophiles (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) increased the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in their lipids with decreasing temperature over their whole growth temperature range. the other mesophiles (enterobacter aerogenes and lactobacillus casei) increased the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids with decreasing temperature only over the lower half of their growth temperature ranges. the psychrotrophs pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter sp. had a constant proportion of unsaturated acids over the lower half of their growth temperature range, while the psychotrophic lactobacillus sp. showed no consistent change in its unsaturated fatty acid composition with temperature. all species showed some variation of unsaturated fatty acid composition with growth rate at the highest and lowest growth temperatures, although such variations were small in some species (ent. aerogenes and lactobacillus sp.).
