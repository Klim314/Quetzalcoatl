TI  == [solitary actinomycotic brain abscess: case report].
AB  == actinomycotic brain abscess is a rare condition with uncertain clinical features. here we report the case of a 66-year-old immune-competent woman with an actinomycotic brain abscess who presented with sensory aphasia and mild right hemiparesis. she had no febrile episode or headache. moreover, she did not have any periodontal or oto-rhino-laryngological disease, and the results of laboratory tests were normal. a computed tomography scan showed an irregular, low-density area in the left parietal lobe. subsequent magnetic resonance imaging showed low-signal intensity in a t1 weighted image, high-signal intensity in a t2 weighted image, and mixed intensity on a diffusion weighted image. thallium-201 chloride scintigraphy showed definite accumulation of thallium in the lesion and  the patient's condition gradually deteriorated. ten days after gadolinium administration, a t1 weighted image showed a multi- lobulated irregular mass in the left parietal lobe. the patient subsequently underwent craniotomy and evacuation of the yellowish abscess. gram staining of the tissue showed the presence of gram-positive filamentous rods, and abscess cultures were positive for actinomyces and prevotella disiens. the abscess resolved after treatment with a high dose of intravenous penicillin g (24 million units/day) for 8 weeks, followed by an oral dose of amoxicillin for 4 months. the patient was discharged  with a rudimentary limitation of the visual field.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
