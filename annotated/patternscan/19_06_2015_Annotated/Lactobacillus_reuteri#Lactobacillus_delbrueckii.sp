TI  == diversity and functional characterization of lactobacillus spp. isolated throughout the ripening of a hard cheese.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the lactobacillus spp. intra- and inter- species diversity in a piedmont hard cheese made of raw milk without thermal treatment and without addition of industrial starter, and to perform a first screening for potential functional properties. a total of 586 isolates were collected during the cheese production and identified by means of molecular methods: three hundred and four were identified as lactobacillus rhamnosus, two hundred and forty as lactobacillus helveticus, twenty six as lactobacillus fermentum, eleven as lactobacillus delbrueckii, three as lactobacillus pontis, and two as lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus reuteri, respectively. a high  genetic heterogeneity was detected by using the repetitive bacterial dna element  fingerprinting (rep-pcr) with the use of (gtg)5 primer resulting in eight clusters of l. helveticus and sixteen clusters in the case of l. rhamnosus. most  of isolates showed a high auto-aggregation property, low hydrophobicity values, and a general low survival to simulated digestion process. however, sixteen isolates showed promising functional characteristics.

TI  == probiotic viability and storage stability of yogurts and fermented milks prepared with several mixtures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == currently, the food industry wants to expand the range of probiotic yogurts but each probiotic bacteria offers different and specific health benefits. little information exists on the influence of probiotic strains on physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of yogurts and fermented milks. six probiotic yogurts or fermented milks and 1 control yogurt were prepared, and we evaluated several physicochemical properties (ph, titratable acidity, texture, color, and syneresis), microbial viability of starter cultures (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) and probiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus reuteri) during fermentation and storage (35 d at 5 degrees c), as well as sensory preference among them. decreases in ph (0.17 to 0.50 units) and increases in titratable acidity (0.09 to 0.29%) were observed during storage. only the yogurt  with s. thermophilus, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and l. reuteri differed in  firmness. no differences in adhesiveness were determined among the tested yogurts, fermented milks, and the control. syneresis was in the range of 45 to 58%. no changes in color during storage were observed and no color differences were detected among the evaluated fermented milk products. counts of s. thermophilus decreased from 1.8 to 3.5 log during storage. counts of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus also decreased in probiotic yogurts and varied from 30 to 50% of initial population. probiotic bacteria also lost viability throughout storage, although the 3 probiotic fermented milks maintained counts >/= 10(7)cfu/ml for 3 wk. probiotic bacteria had variable viability in yogurts, maintaining counts of l. acidophilus >/= 10(7) cfu/ml for 35 d, of l. casei for 7d, and of l. reuteri for 14 d. we found no significant sensory preference among  the 6 probiotic yogurts and fermented milks or the control. however, the yogurt and fermented milk made with l. casei were better accepted. this study presents relevant information on physicochemical, sensory, and microbial properties of probiotic yogurts and fermented milks, which could guide the dairy industry in developing new probiotic products.

TI  == antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of biosurfactant produced by lactobacilli isolates, biofilm formation and aggregation ability.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of biosurfactant extracted from ten lactobacilli species isolated from egyptian dairy products. the produced biosurfactants showed distinct antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activities against several pathogenic microorganisms. furthermore,  lactobacilli isolates were studied for biofilm formation and lactic acid production in different growth media. all lactobacilli isolates produced biofilm  on polystyrene surface in all media tested to different degrees. l. acidophilus showed the highest biofilm formation in rogosa medium. however, the highest lactic acid production was recorded by l. brevis (39.63 g/l), followed by l. reuteri (33.32 g/l) in mrs medium. evaluation based on in vitro studies including auto-aggregation and co-aggregation with three pathogenic bacterial strains was further analyzed. all lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 51.12% to 78.17% assessed at 5 h of incubation). the lactobacilli isolates co-aggregate with the tested bacterial strains to different degrees; among them l. delbrueckii showed the highest scores of co-aggregation with candida albicans atc70014, reaching 59.37%. the aggregation ability exhibited by  the isolated lactobacilli, together with the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties observed for their biosurfactants, opens future prospects for their use against microorganisms responsible for diseases and infections and as effective probiotic strains.

TI  == animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. pyrosequencing targeting the 16s rrna gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (otus) to the genus/species level. among lactic acid bacteria (lab), streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. all rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (uht) milk as shown by ph and total titratable acidity (tta). presumptive lab isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at  the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing. only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. the phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. all strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. all isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid ph drop in milk,  but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. this work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of lab, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.

TI  == molecular identification of lactobacillus spp. associated with puba, a brazilian  fermented cassava food.
AB  == puba or carima is a brazilian staple food obtained by spontaneous submerged fermentation of cassava roots. a total of 116 lactobacilli and three cocci isolates from 20 commercial puba samples were recovered on de man, rogosa and sharpe agar (mrs); they were characterized for their antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens and identified taxonomically by classical and molecular methods. in all samples, lactic acid bacteria were recovered as the dominant microbiota (7.86 +/- 0.41 log10 cfu/g). 16s-23s rrna ardra pattern assigned 116 isolates to the lactobacillus genus, represented by the species lactobacillus fermentum (59 isolates), lactobacillus delbrueckii (18 isolates), lactobacillus casei (9 isolates), lactobacillus reuteri (6 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (3 isolates), lactobacillus gasseri (2 isolates), lactobacillus nagelii (1 isolate), and lactobacillus plantarum group (18 isolates). reca gene-multiplex pcr analysis revealed that l. plantarum group isolates belonged to lactobacillus plantarum (15 isolates) and lactobacillus paraplantarum (3 isolates). genomic diversity was investigated by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence)-based pcr using the primer eric2 (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus). the lactobacillus isolates exhibited genetic heterogeneity and species-specific fingerprint patterns. all the isolates showed antagonistic activity against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria tested. this antibacterial effect was attributed to acid production, except in the cases of three isolates that apparently produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. this study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of lactobacillus spp. of puba.

TI  == species-specific quantification of probiotic lactobacilli in yoghurt by quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli strains with probiotic effects have been widely used in dairy  products such as yoghurts as well as in food additives and pharmaceuticals. despite their successful commercial application, the current species identification and quantification methods of the genus lactobacillus are time-consuming and labour-intensive. methods and results: to fulfil the requirements of a robust quality management, we have developed a quantitative real-time pcr assay based on the heat shock protein 60 gene (hsp60) for accurate  identification and quantification of five commercially important lactobacillus species. the developed assay allows an unambiguous species-specific detection of  the species lact. acidophilus, lact. brevis, lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lact. helveticus and lact. reuteri from bacterial cultures as well as directly from dairy products for instance yoghurt. conclusions: with the assay, we were able to specifically detect lactobacilli strains down to 10(5) cfu ml(-1) directly from yoghurt, which is a sufficient detection limit as commercial products usually contain 10(6) -10(12) cfu ml(-1) of probiotic strains. significance and impact of the study: the real-time pcr assay developed here might become a convenient tool enabling an accurate, fast and sensitive detection of probiotic lactobacilli commercially used in food.

TI  == faecal d/l lactate ratio is a metabolic signature of microbiota imbalance in patients with short bowel syndrome.
AB  == our objective was to understand the functional link between the composition of faecal microbiota and the clinical characteristics of adults with short bowel syndrome (sbs). sixteen patients suffering from type ii sbs were included in the  study. they displayed a total oral intake of 2661+/-1005 kcal/day with superior sugar absorption (83+/-12%) than protein (42+/-13%) or fat (39+/-26%). these patients displayed a marked dysbiosis in faecal microbiota, with a predominance of lactobacillus/leuconostoc group, while clostridium and bacteroides were under-represented. each patient exhibited a diverse lactic acid bacteria composition (l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. mucosae), displaying specific d and l-lactate production profiles in vitro. of 16 patients, 9/16 (56%) accumulated lactates in  their faecal samples, from 2 to 110 mm of d-lactate and from 2 to 80 mm of l-lactate. the presence of lactates in faeces (56% patients) was used to define the lactate-accumulator group (la), while absence of faecal lactates (44% patients) defines the non lactate-accumulator group (nla). the la group had a lower plasma hco3(-) concentration (17.1+/-2.8 mm) than the nla group (22.8+/-4.6 mm), indicating that la and nla groups are clinically relevant sub-types. two patients, belonging to the la group and who particularly accumulated faecal d-lactate, were at risk of d-encephalopathic reactions. furthermore, all patients of the nla group and those accumulating preferentially l isoform in the la group  had never developed d-acidosis. the d/l faecal lactate ratio seems to be the most relevant index for a higher d-encephalopathy risk, rather than d- and l-lactate faecal concentrations per se. testing criteria that take into account hco3(-) value, total faecal lactate and the faecal d/l lactate ratio may become useful tools for identifying sbs patients at risk for d-encephalopathy.

TI  == the dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == screening of biofilm formation by beneficial vaginal lactobacilli and influence of culture media components.
AB  == aims: to assess the ability of vaginal lactobacilli to form biofilm under different culture conditions and to determine the relationship between their growth and the capability of biofilm formation by selected strains. methods and results: fifteen lactobacillus strains from human vagina were tested for biofilm  formation by crystal violet staining. only lactobacillus rhamnosus centro de referencia para lactobacilos culture collection (crl) 1332, lact. reuteri crl 1324 and lact. delbrueckii crl 1510 were able to grow and form biofilm in culture media without tween 80. however, lact. gasseri crl 1263 (a non-biofilm-forming strain) did not grow in these media. scanning electron microscopy showed that lact. rhamnosus crl 1332 and lact. reuteri crl 1324 formed a highly structured biofilm, but only lact. reuteri crl 1324 showed a high amount of extracellular material in medium without tween. conclusions: biofilm formation was significantly influenced by the strain, culture medium, inoculum concentration, microbial growth and chemical nature of the support used for the assay. significance and impacts of the study: the results allow the selection of biofilm-forming vaginal lactobacillus strains and the conditions and factors that affect this phenomenon.

TI  == lactobacilli differently regulate expression and secretion of cxcl8 in urothelial cells.
AB  == modulation of the immune response is an established feature of certain lactobacilli. cxcl8 is an inflammatory chemokine released by the urinary tract mucosa after contact with uropathogenic escherichia coli during urinary tract infection and is crucial for proper infiltration of immune cells. nevertheless, persistently high levels of cxcl8 are associated with pathogenicity and malignancy. in this study, we tested twelve lactobacillus strains for their ability to influence cxcl8 release from urothelial cells. we evaluated how strains from different lactobacillus species could regulate cxcl8 in human 5637 urothelial cells, either resting cells or cells concomitantly challenged with heat-killed e. coli. a majority of the tested species altered cxcl8 release from  the urothelial cells after 24 hours of stimulation. most species increased cxcl8  release, whereas a few lactobacilli efficiently suppressed cxcl8 secretion from e. coli-challenged cells. while strong cxcl8 modulators such as lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus delbrueckii were unable to degrade cxcl8 in the extracellular environment, effects on il8 transcription were evident for selected lactobacilli. although il8 transcription was affected by lactobacilli, the influence on mrna transcript did not correlate to the impact on cxcl8 release. phylogenetic analysis based on a 16s rrna dendrogram of the tested lactobacilli and their effect on cxcl8 revealed some linkage to specific lactobacillus groups. testing the immunomodulatory nature of lactobacilli can prove important when selecting new probiotic microbes. moreover, we believe that phylogenetic and phenotypic similarities could be used to analyse the traits governing such modulation.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == manufacture of fior di latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == this work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to fior di latte (high-moisture cow milk mozzarella) cheese. first, 18 probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus reuteri were screened. resistance to heating (65 or  55 degrees c for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. adaptation at 42 degrees c for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees c for 10 min of  all probiotic lactobacilli. heat-adapted l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 227.4 min) and l. paracasei bgp1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival  under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for  the manufacture of fior di latte cheese. two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. as determined by random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and 16s rrna gene analyses, the cell density of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 in chemically or biologically acidified fior di latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and  sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of fior di latte cheeses.

TI  == effect of kynurenic acid on the viability of probiotics in vitro.
AB  == probiotics are bacteria that are commercially available as dietary supplements. one of the important properties of probiotics is their ability to survive in the  intestine. recent evidence has identified kynurenic acid (kyna) as a bactericidal constituent of intestinal fluid. these data led us to study the influence of kyna on the viability of selected probiotics. we found that kyna supported the growth  of bacteria in the probiotics acidolac (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium) and lakcid forte (lactobacillus rhamnosus) or retarded the growth of bacteria from the acidolac, biogaia (lactobacillus reuteri protectis),  dicoflor (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg), lacium (lactobacillus plantarum) and trilac (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) probiotics depending on its concentration. kyna did not affect the viability of bacteria from the probiotic linex (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12). our results suggest a potential role of kyna in the regulation of bacterial growth in the digestive system.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == effect of size, quaternary structure and translational error on the static and dynamic heterogeneity of beta-galactosidase and measurement of electrophoretic dynamic heterogeneity.
AB  == single enzyme molecule assays were performed using capillary electrophoresis-based protocols on beta-galactosidase from lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus helveticus and bacillus circulans. the enzyme was found to show static heterogeneity with respect to catalytic rate and the variance in rate increased with protein size. this is consistent with the proposal that random errors in translation may be an important underlying component of enzyme heterogeneity. additionally these enzymes were found to show static heterogeneity with respect to electrophoretic mobility. comparison of wild-type and rpsl e. coli beta-galactosidase expressed in the presence and absence of streptomycin suggested that increases in error do  not result in detectable increases in the dynamic heterogeneity of activity with  increasing temperature. finally, a method was developed to measure the dynamic heterogeneity in electrophoretic mobility.

TI  == lactobacillus hayakitensis, l. equigenerosi and l. equi, predominant lactobacilli in the intestinal flora of healthy thoroughbreds.
AB  == to detect the predominant lactobacilli in the intestinal flora of healthy thoroughbreds, we isolated lactobacilli from the feces of nine thoroughbreds (five males and four females; 0-15-year-old). the isolated lactobacilli comprise  17 species (37 strains), and they were classified into five groups: lactobacillus salivarius (6 species), l. reuteri (6 species), lactobacillus delbrueckii (3 species), l. buchneri (1 species) and l. vitulinus (1 species). on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequences, we identified 3 other phylogenetic relatives belonging to the genus lactobacillus. these results suggest that the intestinal flora of thoroughbreds may comprise many species of the genus lactobacillus. polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analyses of the 340-bp fragments of the 16s rrna genes from the same nine fecal samples showed that l. hayakitensis, l. equigenerosi and l. equi are contained in all the samples, suggesting that these species are predominant lactobacilli in the intestinal flora of thoroughbreds.

TI  == volatile sulfur compounds produced by probiotic bacteria in the presence of cysteine or methionine.
AB  == aims: to investigate the abilities of various probiotic bacteria to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) relevant to food flavour and aroma. methods and  results: probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus plantarum 299v, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri atcc55730 and l. reuteri br11), lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc4797, l. plantarum atcc14917 and  lactococcus lactis mg1363 were incubated with either cysteine or methionine. volatile compounds were captured, identified and quantified using a sensitive solid-phase microextraction (spme) technique combined with gas chromatography coupled to a pulsed flame photometric detector (spme/gc/pfpd). several vscs were  identified including h(2)s, methanethiol, dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide. the vsc profiles varied substantially for different strains of l. plantarum and l. reuteri and it was found that l. reuteri atcc55730 and l.  lactis mg1363 produced the lowest levels of vscs (p < 0.05). levels of vscs generated by bacteria were found to be equivalent to, or higher than, that found  in commercial cheeses. conclusions: several probiotic strains are able to generate considerable levels of vscs and substantial variations in vsc generating potential exists between different strains from the same species. significance and importance of the study: this study demonstrates that probiotic bacteria are  able to efficiently generate important flavour and aroma compounds and therefore  has implications for the development of probiotic containing foods.

TI  == evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
AB  == to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of  the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method  under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.

AB  == we determined the maximum ph that allows growth (phmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. high alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of lactobacillus casei, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. curvatus,  l. pentosus, and l. plantarum that originated from plant material, with phmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. among these, l. casei nric 1917 and l. paracasei subsp. tolerans nric 1940 showed the highest phmax, at 8.9. digestive tract isolates of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. dairy isolates of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and l. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. measurement of the internal ph of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (deltaph) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-ph ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. thus, the reversed deltaph did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. however, the deltaph contributed to alkali tolerance, as the phmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates deltaph. although neutral external-ph values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance,  substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a ph range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr analysis of fecal lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

TI  == lactobacillus gastricus sp. nov., lactobacillus antri sp. nov., lactobacillus kalixensis sp. nov. and lactobacillus ultunensis sp. nov., isolated from human stomach mucosa.
AB  == in an attempt to study the composition of the lactobacillus flora from mucosa of  human stomach, 16s rrna gene sequences of 129 isolates were analysed. for 15 of these, the results differed significantly from known sequences, and additional tests were performed to determine whether these isolates represented as yet unrecognized species. phenotypic and genetic characteristics revealed that these  isolates represented four novel lactobacillus species. two belong to the lactobacillus reuteri and the other two to the lactobacillus delbrueckii subgroup of lactobacillus. the names lactobacillus gastricus sp. nov., lactobacillus antri sp. nov., lactobacillus kalixensis sp. nov. and lactobacillus ultunensis sp. nov. are proposed, with the respective type strains kx156a7t (=lmg 22113t=dsm 16045t=ccug 48454t), kx146a4t (=lmg 22111t=dsm 16041t=ccug 48456t), kx127a2t (=lmg 22115t=dsm 16043t=ccug 48459t) and kx146c1t (=lmg 22117t=dsm 16047t=ccug 48460t).

TI  == rapid identification of probiotic lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16s rrna through 23s  rrna.
AB  == this study aimed to develop a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primer set for the identification of seven probiotic lactobacillus species such as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the primer set, comprising of seven specific and two conserved primers, was derived from the integrated sequences of 16s and 23s rrna  genes and their rrna intergenic spacer region of each species. it was able to identify the seven target species with 93.6% accuracy, which exceeds that of the  general biochemical methods. the phylogenetic analyses, using 16s rdna sequences  of the probiotic isolates, also provided further support that the results from the multiplex pcr assay were trustworthy. taken together, we suggest that the multiplex primer set is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of seven lactobacillus species.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri crl1098 produces cobalamin.
AB  == we found that lactobacillus reuteri crl1098, a lactic acid bacterium isolated from sourdough, is able to produce cobalamin. the sugar-glycerol cofermentation in vitamin b(12)-free medium showed that this strain was able to reduce glycerol  through a well-known cobalamin-dependent reaction with the formation of 1,3-propanediol as a final product. the cell extract of l. reuteri corrected the  coenzyme b12 requirement of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis atcc 7830 and allowed the growth of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (mete cbib) and escherichia coli (mete) in minimal medium. preliminary genetic studies of cobalamin biosynthesis genes from l. reuteri allowed the identification of cob genes which encode the coba, cbij, and cbik enzymes involved in the cobalamin pathway. the cobamide produced by l. reuteri, isolated in its cyanide form by using reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, showed a uv-visible spectrum identical to that of standard cyanocobalamin (vitamin b12).

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == screening of probiotic activities of forty-seven strains of lactobacillus spp. by in vitro techniques and evaluation of the colonization ability of five selected strains in humans.
AB  == the probiotic potential of 47 selected strains of lactobacillus spp. was investigated. the strains were examined for resistance to ph 2.5 and 0.3% oxgall, adhesion to caco-2 cells, and antimicrobial activities against enteric pathogenic bacteria in model systems. from the results obtained in vitro, five strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus 19070-2, l. reuteri dsm 12246, l. rhamnosus lgg, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis chcc 2329, and l. casei subsp. alactus chcc 3137, were  selected for in vivo studies. the daily consumption by 12 healthy volunteers of two doses of 10(10) freeze-dried bacteria of the selected strains for 18 days was followed by a washout period of 17 days. fecal samples were taken at days 0 and 18 and during the washout period at days 5 and 11. lactobacillus isolates were initially identified by api 50chl and internal transcribed spacer pcr, and their  identities were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis in combination with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. among the tested strains, l. rhamnosus 19070-2, l. reuteri dsm 12246, and l. rhamnosus lgg were identified most frequently in fecal samples; they were found in 10, 8, and 7 of the 12 samples tested during the intervention period, respectively, whereas reisolations were less frequent in the washout period. the bacteria were reisolated in concentrations from 10(5) to  10(8) cells/g of feces. survival and reisolation of the bacteria in vivo appeared to be linked to ph tolerance, adhesion, and antimicrobial properties in vitro.

TI  == antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  == seven lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). they were identified as l. plantarum (3 strains), l. delbrueckii (1 strain), l. brevis (2 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. casei (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and l. acidophilus (1 strain). bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii and l. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. the bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using enterococcus faecalis as indicator. while catalase treatment, ph changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees c had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase k resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. a reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.

TI  == electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases, a new tool for bacterial species identification: application to 10 lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing sds-page could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. for that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of  lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. brevis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. plantarum, l. sake, l. curvatus and l. reuteri. within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular  weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such  as l. sake and l. curvatus, or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, gave a different pattern. interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. the sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of l. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of  5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single  colony. finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two carnobacterium species. in conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.

TI  == the formation of biogenic amines by fermentation organisms.
AB  == a total of 523 strains representing 35 species related to food fermentation organisms of practical importance were investigated for their potential for formation of biogenic amines (ba). the investigation was performed with resting cells in phosphate buffer (ph 5.5) and the formation of the following bas was followed: putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, tyramine and 2-phenylethylamine. no  potential was observed in species of lactococcus, leuconostoc, pediococcus, streptococcus and several lactobacillus spp., such as l. pentosus and l. sake. a  remarkable potential to form ba was observed in strains of carnobacteria, lactobacillus buchneri, l. curvatus, l. reuteri, staphylococcus carnosus and, to  a lesser extent, in l. alimentarius, l. brevis, l. bavaricus, l. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, micrococcus spp. and s. piscifermentans. in well known species with a practical function in the fermentation of dairy products, wine or cabbage a potential was observed for few strains only. in view of their role as starters in food fermentation, or their potential use in protective cultures and as probiotics, ba formation by the organisms has to be taken into consideration by selecting appropriate strains.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.

TI  == an introduction to rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus is mainly found in the intestinal tract of healthy humans and animals as well as in fermenting vegetables or plant materials, such as silage. it has a moderate diffusion in meat products and is rarely found in wines and beers. on the other hand, rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria are largely used in the preparation of a variety of foods and feed products. as starter cultures, they are omnipresent in cheeses and dairy manufacturing. specific fermentation processes have been developed in order to encourage the growth of the desired species, some of which are fastidious organisms such as l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, l. helveticus and l. sanfrancisco. in addition, a promising and interesting perspective is the use of rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria, primarily  l. acidophilus, l. reuteri and l. salivarius as probiotic starters to preserve the natural biological equilibrium of the intestinal tract.
