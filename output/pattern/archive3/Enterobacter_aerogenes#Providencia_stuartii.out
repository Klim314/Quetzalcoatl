[antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. ipm had significantly high activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii and pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. in a comparative study on activities of ipm against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, p. mirabilis or a. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among staphylococcus aureus, cns, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa.
