TI  == antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  == rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. high concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic50, 0.06 microgram/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 0.25 microgram/ml). rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting bacteroides bivius-disiens, gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., and mobiluncus spp. strains (all mics < or = 1 microgram/ml). strains of haemophilus  ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. however, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were  rifaximin resistant, for example, candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, trichomonas vaginalis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to  rifamycin resistance.

TI  == a new look at the diagnosis of infection of the urinary tract and its adjacent structures.
AB  == the criterion enunciated by kass for interpreting the quantitative examination of urine is critically reappraised. the role of organisms other than those of the aerobic bowel flora, especially fastidious organisms, in urinary tract infections is discussed in detail. clinical microbiologists are urged to pay more attention  to the bacteriological examination of urine and to play a greater part in the diagnosis and treatment of infections of the urinary tract and its adjacent structures.
