TI  == microbial inhibition of oral epithelial wound recovery: potential role for quorum sensing molecules?
AB  == awareness of the impact of microbiota in both health and disease is growing. using a new in vitro oral mucosa co-culture model, we recently showed a clear inhibition of epithelial wound healing in the presence of an oral microbial community. in this paper, we have used the same model in combination with specific oral microbial species to obtain a better insight into the role of the oral microbiota in wound healing. monocultures of klebsiella oxytoca and lactobacillus salivarius significantly inhibited wound healing with ~20%, whereas streptococcus mitis and s. oralis enhanced the healing process with ~15% in 24 h. yet, neither s. oralis or s. mitis were able to counteract the inhibitory effects from k. oxytoca on wound healing. other tested microbial species had no effect on wound healing. apart from this species-dependency, the inhibitory effect on wound healing depended on a microbial threshold concentration. further mechanistic experiments with k. oxytoca excluded different microbial factors and hypothesized that quorum sensing molecules might play a role in the inter-kingdom signalling during wound healing. these results are important for the development of new strategies for the management of (infected) wounds and ulcerations.

TI  == colostrum of healthy slovenian mothers: microbiota composition and bacteriocin gene prevalence.
AB  == microbial communities inhabiting the breast milk microenvironment are essential in supporting mammary gland health in lactating women and in providing gut-colonizing bacterial 'inoculum' for their infants' gastro-intestinal development. bacterial dna was extracted from colostrum samples of 45 healthy slovenian mothers. characteristics of the communities in the samples were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) coupled with denaturing gradient gel  electrophoresis (dgge) and by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr). pcr screening for the prevalence of bacteriocin genes was performed on dna of culturable and total colostrum bacteria. dgge profiling revealed the presence of staphylococcus  and gemella in most of the samples and exposed 4 clusters based on the abundance  of 3 bands: staphylococcus epidermidis/gemella, streptococcus oralis/pneumonia and streptococcus salivarius. bacilli represented the largest proportion of the communities. high prevalence in samples at relatively low quantities was confirmed by qpcr for enterobacteria (100%), clostridia (95.6%), bacteroides-prevotella group (62.2%) and bifidobacteria (53.3%). bacterial quantities (genome equivalents ml-1) varied greatly among the samples; staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococci varied in the range of 4 logs, streptococci and all bacteria varied in the range of 2 logs, and other researched groups varied in the range of 1 log. the quantity of most bacterial groups was correlated with the amount of all bacteria. the majority of the genus staphylococcus was represented by the species staphylococcus epidermidis (on average 61%), and their abundances were linearly correlated. determinants of salivaricin a, salivaricin b, streptin and cytolysin were found in single samples. this work provides knowledge on the colostrum microbial community composition of healthy lactating slovenian mothers and reports bacteriocin gene prevalence.

TI  == transduction of the streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(a) and tet(o), to other streptococcus species.
AB  == phim46.1 - streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(a) and tet(o), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (m phenotype) and tetracycline -  is widespread in s. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among s. pyogenes isolates, but no information  is available about its transferability to other streptococcus species. we thus investigated phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of  different streptococcus species. transductants were obtained from recipients of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus suis. retransfer was always achieved, and from s. suis to s. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. in transductants phim46.1  retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin c, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. the transductants shared the same phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved rna uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. no transfer occurred to recipients of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. a largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in s. suis. the s. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene  atl.

TI  == infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking: a systematic review of reported cases: management, visual outcome, and treatment proposed.
AB  == abstract aim: to describe the infectious complications and the group of pathogens involved in the infection following corneal crosslinking, the visual outcome, and the treatment proposed. methods: a medline (national library of medicine, bethesda, md, usa) search from october 2000 to october 2013 was performed to identify all articles describing infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking treatment. nineteen articles were selected. ten articles reported infectious complications of corneal crosslinking treatment were included. nine articles were excluded, because seven described sterile keratitis, one article was in german, and one reported general complication without describing the infection complication. results: a total number of infections reported included 10 eyes. the infectious keratitis was associated with bacteria in five eyes (50%): gram-positive bacteria in three eyes (30%) (staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus and streptococcus salivarius plus s. oralis, respectively) and gram-negative bacteria in two eyes (20%) (e. coli; p. aeruginosa); there was herpes virus in two eyes, fungus in two eyes (fusarium and microsporidia) (20%),  and acanthamoeba in one eye (10%). conclusions: only 10 cases of infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking are published. the most virulent pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa and acanthamoeba. less virulent organisms were escherichia coli and s. epidermidis. two cases of herpes keratitis were described, suggesting the possibility of systemic antiviral prophylaxis before corneal crosslinking treatment. the most common risk factor of infections identified was postoperative incorrect patient behavior.

TI  == molecular identification and antibiotic resistant bacteria isolated from primary  dentition infections.
AB  == background: bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a health problem in many parts of the world. the aim of this study was to identify bacteria from dental infections and determine bacterial resistance to antibiotics used in dental care  in the primary dentition. methods: this cross-sectional study comprised 60 children who presented for dental treatment for active dental infections in the primary dentition. samples from dental infections were collected and bacteria were identified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. bacterial resistance to antibiotics was determined by colony forming units on agar plates containing amoxicillin, clindamycin and amoxillicin-clavulanic acid (a-ca) tested at 8 mug/ml or 16 mug/ml. results: clindamycin in both concentrations tested (8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml) showed the highest bacterial resistance (85.9%), followed by amoxicillin (43.7%) and a-ca (12.0%). all comparisons among the three antibiotics used in the study exhibited statistical significance (p = <0.05) in both concentrations tested (8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml), and under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. the most prevalent resistant species identified by pcr in primary dentition infections were: streptococcus oralis and prevotella intermedia (75.0%); treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis (48.3%); streptococcus  mutans (45.0%); campylobacter rectus; and streptococcus salivarius (40%). conclusions: this study demonstrated that a-ca exhibited the lowest bacterial resistance for clinical isolates in primary dentition infections.

TI  == using color histograms and spa-lda to classify bacteria.
AB  == in this work, a new approach is proposed to verify the differentiating characteristics of five bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, and staphylococcus aureus) by using digital images obtained with a simple webcam and variable selection by the  successive projections algorithm associated with linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda). in this sense, color histograms in the red-green-blue (rgb), hue-saturation-value (hsv), and grayscale channels and their combinations were used as input data, and statistically evaluated by using different multivariate classifiers (soft independent modeling by class analogy (simca), principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis (pca-lda), partial least squares  discriminant analysis (pls-da) and successive projections algorithm-linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda)). the bacteria strains were cultivated in a nutritive blood agar base layer for 24 h by following the brazilian pharmacopoeia, maintaining the status of cell growth and the nature of nutrient solutions under the same conditions. the best result in classification was obtained by using rgb and spa-lda, which reached 94 and 100 % of classification accuracy in the training and test sets, respectively. this result is extremely positive from the viewpoint of routine clinical analyses, because it avoids bacterial identification based on phenotypic identification of the causative organism using gram staining, culture, and biochemical proofs. therefore, the proposed method presents inherent advantages, promoting a simpler, faster, and low-cost alternative for bacterial identification.

TI  == molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old tunisian children.
AB  == the occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old tunisian children was investigated. samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). genomic dna was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. all samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic dna collected from carious lesions. other prevalent species were candida spp (63%), streptococcus salivarius (59%) and streptococcus oralis (42%). the frequency of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. frequency of porphyromonas endodontali, actinomyces radicidentis and treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. pcr analysis of genomic dna detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. in addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (s.  mutans, s. salivarius, l. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.

TI  == the influence of a glucosyltransferase, encoded by gtfp, on biofilm formation by  streptococcus sanguinis in a dual-species model.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is an early colonizer of tooth surfaces and forms biofilms with other species of microorganisms. in vitro, s. sanguinis produces water-soluble glucans from sucrose and releases them into the culture supernatant; however, the role played by these glucans in biofilm formation is unclear. the present study examined both the effect of glucans on biofilm formation by s. sanguinis and the proportion of this bacterial species within the biofilms. inactivation of the gtfp gene, annotated as glucosyltransferase in the  s. sanguinis genome database, caused a marked reduction in the amount of water-soluble glucans in the culture supernatant, but not in the amount of water-insoluble glucans expressed on the bacterial cell surface. scanning electron microscopy revealed that wild-type s. sanguinis, but not the gtfp-deficient mutant, produced large amounts of sticky material in the presence  of 1% (w/v) sucrose. in addition, biofilm production by wild-type bacteria was greater than that by the mutant strain. by contrast, co-culture of mutant bacteria with streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. anginosus, or s. salivarius showed that inactivating the gtfp gene had little effect on the amount of biofilm produced. furthermore, inactivating the gtfp gene did not greatly alter the proportion of s. sanguinis in the biofilms formed by the co-cultures. thus, despite the role of s. sanguinis glucosyltransferase in formation of water-soluble glucans and biofilms in monoculture, the functional gene contributed little to biofilms in co-culture experiments.

TI  == effective oral health in infective endocarditis: efficacy of high-street mouthwashes against the viridans group streptococci.
AB  == aim: recent uk national institute for health and clinical excellence guidelines state that there is no longer a need for oral antibiotic prophylaxis in patients  undergoing dental procedures who are at risk of infective endocarditis (ie), and  advocate the importance of maintaining good oral health. as viridans group streptococci (vgs) are common etiological agents of ie and inhabitants of the mouth, the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of common high-street mouthwashes against four classes of vgs organisms (salivarius, mitis, anginosus, and mutans groupings). methods: the survival of vgs, streptococcus gordonii (national collection of type cultures [nctc] 7865), streptococcus intermedius (nctc 11324), streptococcus mutans (nctc 10449), streptococcus oralis (nctc 11427), streptococcus pneumoniae (nctc 7465, nctc 7978, & american type culture collection 49619) and streptococcus salivarius (nctc 8618) was assessed in vitro following treatment of approximately 10(7) c.f.u. in planktonic state with four mouthwashes. results: no organisms were culturable following 1-min exposure, and were not recovered following non-selective enrichment following incubation in brain heart infusion broth supplemented with 0.8% (w/v) yeast extract. conclusions: these data indicate that such mouthwashes are able to completely kill vgs organisms tested in planktonic solution, where their use would promote good oral hygiene in patients at risk of ie.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB  == objective: to develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria  at small or large radiographical lesions. materials and methods: the patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). a risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. results: fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). an increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at  large abscess lesions was observed for prevotella (p.) oralis, p. buccae, p. oris, p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus (strep.) anginosus group. an increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for strep. salivarius, strep. parasanguis, strep. anginosus group, capnocytophaga spp., neisseria (n.) sicca, neisseria spp., staphylococcus (staph.) aureus, p. intermedia, p. buccae, prevotella spp. and p. melaninogenica. conclusions: the radiography-based score suggests that certain prevotella spp., f. nucleatum and strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, neisseria spp., capnocytophaga spp., staph. aureus and prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.

TI  == phenotypic diversity of multicellular filamentation in oral streptococci.
AB  == filamentous multicellular bacteria are among the most ancient multicellular organisms. they inhabit a great variety of environments and are present in the human body, including the oral cavity. beside the selective advantages related to the larger size achieved through filamentation, the development of multicellular  bacteria can be also driven by simple ecological factors such as birth and death  rates at the cellular level. in order to extend earlier results obtained in aquatic species, we investigate the filamentation process of four different strains of oral streptococci, namely s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. oralis and s. anginosus. the results indicate differences in the capacities of different streptococcus species to form filaments, manifested in terms of length and the time-scale of filament elongation. the filamentation pattern of these oral streptococci resembles that of aquatic bacteria, whereby filaments reach a peak length during exponential growth and become short when the population reaches a steady state. hence, this study validates that multicellularity can be an emergent property of filamentous bacteria of different ecological niches, and that phenotypic differences in filamentation can occur within species of the same genus, in this case oral streptococci. moreover, given the role that specific oral streptococci can play in the etiology of oral diseases, these results can possibly open new perspectives in the study of the virulence properties of these  species.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of herbal extracts on streptococcus mutans and normal oral  streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is associated with dental caries. a cariogenic biofilm, in particular, has been studied extensively for its role in the formation of dental  caries. herbal extracts such as cudrania tricuspidata, sophora flavescens, ginkgo biloba, and betula schmidtii have been used as a folk remedy for treating diseases. the purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial activity of herbal extracts against normal oral streptococci, planktonic and biofilm of s. mutans. streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguinis, and s. mutans were cultivated with brain heart infusion broth and susceptibility assay for the herbal extracts was performed according to the protocol of clinical and laboratory standard institute. also, s. mutans biofilm was formed on a polystyrene 12-well plate and  8-well chamber glass slip using bhi broth containing 2% sucrose and 1% mannose after conditioning the plate and the glass slip with unstimulated saliva. the biofilm was treated with the herbal extracts in various concentrations and inoculated on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar plate for enumeration of viable s. mutans by counting colony forming units. planktonic s. mutans showed susceptibility to all of the extracts and s. mutans biofilm exhibited the highest level of sensitivity for the extracts of s. flavescens. the normal oral streptococci exhibited a weak susceptibility in comparison to s. mutans. s. oralis, however, was resistant to all of the extracts. in conclusion, the extract of s. flavescens may be a potential candidate for prevention and management of dental caries.

TI  == multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing excessive acetaldehyde production from ethanol by oral streptococci.
AB  == ethanol consumption and poor oral hygiene are risk factors for oral and oesophageal cancers. although oral streptococci have been found to produce excessive acetaldehyde from ethanol, little is known about the mechanism by which this carcinogen is produced. by screening 52 strains of diverse oral streptococcal species, we identified streptococcus gordonii v2016 that produced the most acetaldehyde from ethanol. we then constructed gene deletion mutants in  this strain and analysed them for alcohol and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases by zymograms. the results showed that s. gordonii v2016 expressed three primary alcohol dehydrogenases, adha, adhb and adhe, which all oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde, but their preferred substrates were 1-propanol, 1-butanol and ethanol, respectively. two additional dehydrogenases, s-adha and tdha, were identified with specificities to the secondary alcohol 2-propanol and threonine,  respectively, but not to ethanol. s. gordonii v2016 did not show a detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase even though its adhe gene encodes a putative bifunctional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase. mutants with adhe deletion showed greater tolerance to ethanol in comparison with the wild-type and mutant with adha or adhb deletion, indicating that adhe is the major alcohol dehydrogenase in s. gordonii. analysis of 19 additional strains of s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis showed expressions of up to three alcohol dehydrogenases, but none showed detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, except one strain that showed a novel aldh. therefore, expression  of multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase may contribute to excessive production of acetaldehyde from ethanol by certain oral streptococci.

TI  == early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  == the development of high-level daptomycin resistance (hldr; mic of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (vgs) isolates. our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of hldr after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of vgs and streptococcus bovis; to determine whether hldr also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain s. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of hldr in vitro and in vivo. in vitro  studies were performed with 114 vgs strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 streptococcus bovis strains  isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. hldr was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of s. mitis isolates, 47% of  s. oralis isolates, and 13% of s. sanguis isolates. in our experimental model, hldr was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h  and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. in vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against s. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the mic and prevented the development of hldr.  in vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented hldr in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. in conclusion, hldr develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of hldr in most cases.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of the synthetic peptide lys-a1 against oral streptococci.
AB  == the peptide lys-[trp(6)]-hy-a1 (lys-a1) is a synthetic derivative of the peptide  hy-a1, initially isolated from the frog species hypsiboas albopunctatus. according to previous research, it is a molecule with broad antimicrobial activity. the objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity  of the synthetic peptide lys-a1 (kifgaiwplalgalknlik-nh2) on the planktonic and biofilm growth of oral bacteria. the methods used to evaluate antimicrobial activity include the following: determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) in microtiter plates for growth in suspension and quantification of biomass by crystal violet staining and counting of colony forming units for biofilm growth. the microorganisms streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were grown in brain heart infusion broth at 37 degrees c under atmospheric pressure with 10% co2. the peptide was solubilized in 0.1% acetic acid (v/v) at various concentrations (500-1.9 mug ml(-1)). chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% was used as the positive control, and bhi culture medium was used as the negative control. the tested peptide demonstrated a remarkable antimicrobial effect, inhibiting the planktonic and biofilm growth of all strains tested, even at low concentrations. thus, the peptide lys-a1 is an important source for potential antimicrobial agents, especially for the control and prevention of microbial biofilms, which is one of the most important factors in cariogenic processes.

TI  == protective mechanisms of respiratory tract streptococci against streptococcus pyogenes biofilm formation and epithelial cell infection.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci [gas]) encounter many streptococcal  species of the physiological microbial biome when entering the upper respiratory  tract of humans, leading to the question how gas interact with these bacteria in  order to establish themselves at this anatomic site and initiate infection. here  we show that s. oralis and s. salivarius in direct contact assays inhibit growth  of gas in a strain-specific manner and that s. salivarius, most likely via bacteriocin secretion, also exerts this effect in transwell experiments. utilizing scanning electron microscopy documentation, we identified the tested strains as potent biofilm producers except for gas m49. in mixed-species biofilms, s. salivarius dominated the gas strains, while s. oralis acted as initial colonizer, building the bottom layer in mixed biofilms and thereby allowing even gas m49 to form substantial biofilms on top. with the exception of  s. oralis, artificial saliva reduced single-species biofilms and allowed gas to dominate in mixed biofilms, although the overall two-layer structure was unchanged. when covered by s. oralis and s. salivarius biofilms, epithelial cells were protected from gas adherence, internalization, and cytotoxic effects. apparently, these species can have probiotic effects. the use of affymetrix array technology to assess hep-2 cell transcription levels revealed modest changes after exposure to s. oralis and s. salivarius biofilms which could explain some of the protective effects against gas attack. in summary, our study revealed a protection effect of respiratory tract bacteria against an important airway pathogen and allowed a first in vitro insight into local environmental processes  after gas enter the respiratory tract.

AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == a novel formulation effective in killing oral biofilm bacteria.
AB  == objective: to determine if a novel formulation is effective in killing oral biofilm streptococci in vitro and in vivo. methods: efficacy of 0.5% levulinic acid and 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) in killing streptococcus gordonii ch1, streptococcus gordonii dl1, streptococcus mitis nctc10712, streptococcus oralis ks32ar, streptococcus mutans bm71, and streptococcus mutans gs5 in their biofilm form was measured in vitro, using microtiter plates and subsequent counts on mitis-salivarius agar plates. the safety and efficacy in vivo were evaluated using a mouse model. results: our anti-microbial formulation completely eliminated all the biofilm streptococcal species tested within 30 seconds (a reduction of 10(7) cfu/ml), whereas the positive control listerine only demonstrated moderate reduction in vitro. application of the formulation twice a  day for 7 days in the murine oral cavity resulted in significantly more reduction of established s. gordonii dl1 oral biofilm bacteria than listerine. the formulation did not cause any adverse effect in the murine oral cavity within a 2-week period. conclusions: we have demonstrated that the novel mouth rinse exhibits high efficacy in killing oral bacteria in their biofilm forms, results in no adverse effect in vivo, and contains alcohol-free components.

TI  == uv-c-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

TI  == influence of orthodontic treatment on oral streptococci.
AB  == objective of this study is to evaluate the changes of the oral microbial flora, concentrating on the oral streptococci, after the first 3 and 6 months of orthodontic treatment. materials and methods: 40 patients, aged 7-17, that presented for orthodontic treatment between april and september 2010 in the department of orthodontics and dento-facial orthopedics of "carol davila" university of medicine and pharmacy, bucharest have been selected. according to the protocol, coronary and subgingival plaque was collected from the dental surface before starting any orthodontic treatment (t0), 3 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t1) and 6 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t2). the samples were studied in cantacuzino national institute of research-development for microbiology and immunology [isolation on columbia agar  with 5% sheep blood, identification on morphotinctorial, growth and biochemical characteristics using api 20 strep (biomerieux)]. bacterial concentration (colony-forming units/sample = cfu/sample) for the aerobic and anaerobic flora was calculated by the serial dilution method of counting bacteria. results: 106 strains of oral streptococci were isolated from dental plaque, belonging to 6 species (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus acidominimus),  37 strains of oral streptococci in patients from group i (t0), 40 strains from group ii (t1) and 29 strains of oral streptococci from group iii (t2). after 3 months (t1) the aerobic bacteria percentage, detected at a concentration between  10(5) and 10(6), increased from 30 to 38.2%. the percentage of patients with a bacterial concentration higher than 10(6) cfu/sample increased from 5% to 8.8%. the samples colected at t2 (patients examined after 6 months of orthodonic treatment) presented a lower bacterial concentration, as compared to group ii (t1). the most common isolated species of streptococci were s. salivarius, s. oralis and s. mutans (37.5%, 22.5% and 10%), whose frequency increased after 3 months of treatment to 41.14%, 32.3% and respectively 14.4%, returning after 6 months of treatment at values similar to those recorded before beginning the orthodontic treatment. conclusions: presence of orthodontic appliances may produce a transitory increase of bacterial concentration (cfu/sample) and isolation rate of oral streptococci, returning to the level prior to the application of these devices after a time interval of several months.

TI  == molecular characterisation of the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr)  of the parc gene locus in viridans-group streptococci.
AB  == forty-eight isolates of viridans-group streptococci (vgs) from adults and children in the community are examined for their resistance to ciprofloxacin phenotypically by determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). in addition, the parc gene locus is amplified and sequenced in all isolates and mutations noted. overall, 44 vgs organisms were found to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin by the broth microdilution method, and the remaining four strains had intermediate susceptibility. reduced mics were observed with intermediate strains when reserpine was added to the broth, inhibiting any efflux activity. overall, the effect of adding reserpine to the broth medium was to add one doubling dilution to the mic in the case of streptococcus mitis, s. oralis and s. salivarius, as well as to increase the mic by two doubling dilutions in two of the three s. parasanguinis isolates. amino acid sequence analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr) of the parc gene locus showed good correlation to the phenotypic resistance to ciprofloxacin, where no confirmed mutation conferring quinolone resistance was found. eleven amino acid positions showed discordance with s. pneumoniae r6 and eight (s52, f55, s58, n91, e135, k137, f141 and s167) were common in the vgs species examined. in addition, minor  substitutions were found at three positions (d51, t54 and v86). in conclusion, this study demonstrates the low occurrence of ciprofloxacin resistance in a population of vgs isolated from the community. in addition, several silent mutations were noted in vgs organisms without any increase in mic against ciprofloxacin.

TI  == erythromycin and penicillin resistance mechanisms among viridans group streptococci isolated from blood cultures of adult patients with underlying diseases.
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate the species distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility and erythromycin-penicillin resistance mechanisms of viridans streptococci (vgs) isolates from blood cultures of adult patients with underlying diseases. fifty vgs blood culture isolates were screened for their antibiotic susceptibilities against penicillin g, erythromycin and tetracycline by e-test. clindamycin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, levofloxacin, linezolid and vancomycin  susceptibility were performed by broth microdilution method. erythromycin and penicillin resistance genotypes, ermb and mefa/e, pbp1a, pbp2b and pbp2x are amplified using pcr method. the clinical isolates included streptococcus mitis (n. 19), s.oralis (n. 13), s.sanguinis, s.parasanguinis (n. 6, each), s.salivarius, s.vestibularis (n. 2, each), s.constellatus, s.sobrinus (n. 1, each). the percentage resistance against erythromycin and penicillin was 36% and  30%, respectively. the genotypic carriage rate of erythromycin resistance genes were: 56% ermb, 28% mefe, 8% ermb+mefe. penicillin-resistant isolates carried pbp2b (33.3%) and pbp2x (20%) genes. twenty-four vgs isolates were recovered from patients with cancer. s.mitis and s.oralis predominated among patients with cancer who had erythromycin and penicillin resistance isolates. the importance of classical antimicrobial agents like penicillin and erythromycin warrants the continuous surveillance of invasive vgs isolates and can guide better treatment options especially in patients with underlying diseases.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular methods used for identification of oral streptococci and related microorganisms.
AB  == the oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. the oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. the 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by vitek system using gram-positive identification cards. species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for pcr identification of isolates. sequencing of 16s rrna was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. vitek system identified a number of 11 strains as s. mitis/oralis,  12 strains as s. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as s. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3  strains as s. salivarius, 3 strains as s. plurianimalium, 1 strain as s. cristatus and 1 strain as s. alactolyticus, respectively. the pcr system targeting gtf genes was able to identify s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. gordonii strains. sequence of 16s rrna discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides. many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.

TI  == invasion of human aortic endothelial cells by oral viridans group streptococci and induction of inflammatory cytokine production.
AB  == oral viridans group streptococci are the major commensal bacteria of the supragingival oral biofilm and have been detected in human atheromatous plaque. atherosclerosis involves an ongoing inflammatory response, reportedly involving chronic infection caused by multiple pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the invasion of human aortic endothelial cells (haecs) by oral viridans group streptococci and the subsequent cytokine production by viable invaded haecs. the invasion of haecs by bacteria was examined using antibiotic protection assays and was visualized by confocal scanning laser microscopy. the inhibitory effects of catalase and cytochalasin d on the invasion of haecs were also examined. the production of cytokines by invaded or infected haecs was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and a real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used to evaluate the expression of cytokine messenger rna. the oral streptococci tested were capable of invading haecs. the number of invasive bacteria increased with the length of the co-culture period. after a certain co-culture period, some organisms were cytotoxic to the haecs. catalase and cytochalasin d inhibited the invasion of haecs by the organism. haecs invaded by streptococcus mutans xc, streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis), streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558 and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419 produced more cytokine(s) (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) than non-invaded haecs. the haecs invaded by s. mutans xc produced the largest amounts of cytokines, and the messenger rna expression of cytokines by invaded haecs increased markedly compared with that by non-invaded haecs. these results suggest that oral streptococci may participate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == [classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. they reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. they can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. the diagnosis of vgs are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (sanguinis, mitis, mutans, salivarius, anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16s rrna sequencing. since streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. genetic exchange between streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and s.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. these mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. the cultivation of vgs usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. vgs are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. the last step in the laboratory diagnosis of vgs is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. in this review article, classification of vgs, similarities between s.pneumoniae and mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of vgs have been discussed.

AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

AB  == objectives: although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within cf airways has not yet been examined. we therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. methods: erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (vgs) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and vgs [n = 84; i.e. streptococcus salivarius  (n = 30), streptococcus mitis (n = 17), streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), streptococcus oralis (n = 10), streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), streptococcus infantis (n = 3), streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult cf patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for  at least the previous 7 months. results: almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. the majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(b) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(a) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(e) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(b) and mef(e) genes simultaneously  in 11/99 (11.1%). these results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in vgs in adult cf patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. conclusions: long-term treatment with azithromycin in cf patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal vgs, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.

TI  == polymicrobial keratitis after a collagen cross-linking procedure with postoperative use of a contact lens: a case report.
AB  == purpose: : to report a case of polymicrobial keratitis caused by streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. in a  patient who underwent collagen cross-linking for keratoconus. method: : case report. result: : a 32-year-old male presented with a 1-day history of a painful  red eye, occurring 3 days after he had undergone a collagen cross-linking with riboflavin and uv-a on his left eye for keratoconus. he admitted to removing his  bandage contact lens and cleaning it in his mouth before reapplying it in his eye. on presentation, a severe keratitis with an 8-mm epithelial defect and 360-degree ring infiltrate was found. culture results from his contact lens were  positive for s. salivarius and s. oralis, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. were grown from his corneal scrapings. conclusions: : collagen cross-linking  is a promising procedure for the treatment of progressive keratoconus with minimal reported side effects. however, the possibility of a secondary infection  after the procedure exists because the patient is subjected to epithelial debridement and the application of a soft contact lens. the role of the uv light  on the immune mechanisms of the cornea and its effect on corneal wound healing warrant further investigation.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of caesalpinia ferrea martius fruits against oral pathogens.
AB  == aim: in the amazon region of brazil, the fruits of caesalpinia ferrea martius (brazilian ironwood) are widely used as an antimicrobial and healing medicine in  many situations including oral infections. this study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of caesalpinia ferrea martius fruit extract against oral pathogens. materials and methods: polyphenols estimation and spectral analysis ((1)h nmr) of the methanol extract were carried out. the microorganisms candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis and lactobacillus casei were tested using the microdilution method for planktonic cells (mic) and a multispecies biofilm model. chlorhexidine was used as positive  control. results: polyphenols in the extract were estimated at 7.3% and (1)h nmr  analysis revealed hydroxy phenols and methoxilated compounds. mic values for candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis and lactobacillus casei were 25.0, 40.0, 66.0, 100.0, 66.0 microg/ml, respectively. for the biofilm assay, chlorhexidine and plant extract showed no growth at 10(-4) and 10(-5) microbial dilution, respectively. at 10(-4) and 10(-5) the growth values (mean+/-sd) of the negative controls (dmso and saline solution) for streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sp. and candida albicans were 8.1+/-0.7, 7.0+/-0.6 and 5.9+/-0.9 x 10(6)cfu, respectively. conclusion: caesalpinia ferrea fruit extract can inhibit in vitro growth of oral pathogens in planktonic and biofilm models supporting its use for oral infections.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant nonhemolytic streptococci on the basis of sequence analysis of 16s-23s intergenic spacer region and partial gdh gene.
AB  == nonhemolytic streptococci (nhs) cause serious infections, such as endocarditis and septicemia. many conventional phenotypic methods are insufficient for the identification of bacteria in this group to the species level. genetic analysis has revealed that single-gene analysis is insufficient for the identification of  all species in this group of bacteria. the aim of the present study was to establish a method based on sequence analysis of the 16s-23s intergenic spacer (its) region and the partial gdh gene to identify clinical relevant nhs to the species level. sequence analysis of the its region was performed with 57 nhs reference or clinical strains. satisfactory identification to the species level was achieved for 14/19 nhs species included in this study on the basis of sequence analysis of the its region. streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis obtained the expected taxon as the best taxon match, but there was a short maximum score distance to the next best match (distance, <10). streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae could not be unambiguously discriminated by sequence analysis of the its region, as was also proven by phylogenetic analysis. these five species could be identified to the group level only by its sequence analysis. partial gdh sequence analysis was  applied to the 11 s. oralis strains, the 11 s. mitis strains, and the 17 s. pneumoniae strains. all except one strain achieved a satisfactory identification  to the species level. a phylogenetic algorithm based on the analysis of partial gdh gene sequences revealed three distinct clusters. we suggest that sequence analysis of the combination of the its region and the partial gdh gene can be used in the reference laboratory for the species-level identification of nhs.

TI  == phylogenetic analyses and detection of viridans streptococci based on sequences and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the rod shape-determining protein  gene.
AB  == background: population analysis of viridans streptococci is important because these species are associated with dental caries, bacteremia, and subacute endocarditis, in addition to being important members of the human oral commensal  microbiota. design: in this study, we phylogenetically analyzed the rod shape-determining protein gene (roda), which is associated with cellular morphology, cell division, and sensitivity for antibiotics, and demonstrated that the diversity of the roda gene is sufficient to identify viridans streptococci at the species level. moreover, we developed a more convenient denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) method based on the diversity of the roda gene (roda-dgge) for detecting nine dominant streptococcal species in human saliva, namely, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus vestibularis,  streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. results: this roda-dgge method proved useful in detecting viridans streptococci without cultivation, isolation, and phenotypic characterization. conclusion: analysis of the oral microbiota by roda-dgge offers a higher resolution than the  conventional dgge using 16s rdna and may be an alternative in the microbial diagnosis of streptococcal infection.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == heritability of oral microbial species in caries-active and caries-free twins.
AB  == oral microbes that colonize in the mouths of humans contribute to disease susceptibility, but it is unclear if host genetic factors mediate colonization. we therefore tested the hypothesis that the levels at which oral microbes colonize in the mouth are heritable. dental plaque biofilms were sampled from intact tooth surfaces of 118 caries-free twins. an additional 86 caries-active twins were sampled for plaque from carious lesions and intact tooth surfaces. using a reverse capture checkerboard assay the relative abundance of 82 bacterial species was determined. an integrative computational predictive model determined  microbial abundance patterns of microbial species in caries-free twins as compared to caries-active twins. heritability estimates were calculated for the relative microbial abundance levels of the microbial species in both groups. the  levels of 10 species were significantly different in healthy individuals than in  caries-active individuals, including, a. defectiva, s. parasanguinis, s. mitis/oralis, s. sanguinis, s. cristatus, s. salivarius, streptococcus sp. clone  ch016, g. morbillorum and g. haemolysans. moderate to high heritability estimates were found for these species (h(2) = 56%-80%, p < .0001). similarity of the overall oral microbial flora was also evident in caries-free twins from multivariate distance matrix regression analysis. it appears that genetic and/or  familial factors significantly contribute to the colonization of oral beneficial  species in twins.

AB  == mdpb, 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide, was tested for its ability to  inhibit the growth of organisms associated with active root caries lesions and to modify the growth characteristics of these organisms at sub-mics. mics and mbcs of mdpb for independent isolates (n=5) of the following taxa: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces gerensceriae, actinomyces odontolyticus, lactobacillus spp., and candida albicans were determined, and the effects at sub-mic on microbial growth kinetics were assessed. all isolates were sensitive to inhibition by mdpb. the median mics and mbcs of mdpb for these organisms were  in the range of 3.13 to 25.0 microg/ml and 6.25 to 50.0 microg/ml, respectively.  as for the influence of ph, inhibition was sensitive to acidic ph. even at sub-mics, the growth of all strains, measured as cell yield and doubling time, was significantly reduced. based on the results of this study, mdpb exhibited the potential to inhibit the growth of microbiota associated with active root caries  lesions.

TI  == discrepancy in antimicrobial susceptibility test results obtained for oral streptococci with the etest and agar dilution.
AB  == a total of 270 viridans group streptococci (vs) isolated from healthy children, identified to the species level, were tested for their susceptibilities to penicillin, imipenem, erythromycin, and vancomycin. a total of 270 isolates and 1,080 organism-antibiotic combinations were evaluated. the overall susceptibility rates of all isolates obtained by the etest (et) versus agar dilution (ad) were 60.4% versus 61.8% for penicillin, 63.8% versus 63.9% for erythromycin, 90.6% versus 96% for vancomycin, and 99.1% versus 96.0% for imipenem, respectively. major discrepancies occurred in the testing of the susceptibility of streptococcus mutans to vancomycin, with 59.5% (et) versus 100% (ad), followed by s. salivarius, with 84.1% versus 100%; s. oralis, with 82.1% versus 96.4%; and s. mitis, with 90% versus 100%, respectively. there were also differences in the rates of susceptibility of s. mutans, 66.5% (et) versus 85.1% (ad), and s. intermedius, 82.9% versus 72.1%, respectively, to penicillin. general agreement between the results of et and ad was obtained for 973 organism-antibiotic combinations out of 1,080 antibiotic combinations, i.e., 90.1%. very major errors were found for 6.8% of isolates, and major errors were found for 3.2% of isolates; the minor errors were negligible. agreement between the results of the  two methods was 98.7% for penicillin, 94.6% for vancomycin, 96.9% for imipenem, and 99.9% for erythromycin. the highest rate of very major errors was for vancomycin, at 5.4%. the et appears to be as efficient as ad for susceptibility testing of vs, except for vancomycin, where very major errors in the results were relatively high.

AB  == viridans group streptococci including streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly s. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. tigecycline (gar-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with  a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. the studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and fewer  strains of s. gallolyticus (98 strains) and streptococcus mutans (50 strains). these strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted  by clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/ml for tigecycline per us food and drug administration). penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (s. sanguis) to 98% (s. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was  also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for s. gallolyticus. in conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and s. gallolyticus with an overall mic90 at < or = 0.06 microg/ml; the highest mic was only 0.25 microg/ml.

TI  == viridans streptococci isolated by culture from blood of cancer patients: clinical and microbiologic analysis of 50 cases.
AB  == clinical and microbiologic studies of 50 cases of viridans streptococcal bacteremia in cancer patients were performed. the bacteria were identified to species level by sequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene. at least nine streptococcus spp. were found, including s. mitis (25 strains, 50.0% of 50); currently unnamed streptococcus spp. (11 strains); s. parasanguis (five strains); s. anginosus (three strains); s. salivarius (two strains); and one strain each of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus, and s. vestibularis. there were no s. oralis strains. among 11 antibiotics of nine classes tested, no resistance to vancomycin, linezolid, or quinupristin-dalfopristin was seen. resistance to penicillin (mic, 4 to 12 mug/ml) was noted only among s. mitis strains (28.0%, 7/25) and not non-s. mitis strains (0/25) (p = 0.004). significantly more s. mitis strains than non-s. mitis strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones and to > or =3 classes of antibiotics. isolation of quinolone-resistant organisms was associated with the prior usage of quinolones (p = 0.002). quantitative blood cultures showed that the strains resistant to levofloxacin or gatifloxacin were associated with higher colony counts than were their corresponding nonresistant strains. the young and elderly patients also had higher levels of bacteremia caused predominantly by s. mitis. septic shock was present in 17 (34.0% of 50) patients, and 13 of those cases were caused by s. mitis (p = 0.007). these results suggest that s. mitis is the most common cause of viridans streptococcal  bacteremia in cancer patients and is more resistant to antibiotics than other species.

TI  == the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  == some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. streptococcus mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus fermentans, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, actinomyces naeslundi, a. israelii, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto columbia  agar with haemin and vitamin k and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. the resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. the red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. all colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. the green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, f. nucleatum and s. sobrinus. the red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) p. intermedia, a. naeslundi, a. israelii, l. fermentans, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. with all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. we conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator  of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.

TI  == differentiation of mutans streptococci by intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == it is difficult to distinguish mutans streptococci on the species level, and even more so on the subspecies level. intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) (icm) was applied to reference strains of five of the species of the mutans group (streptococcus criceti, streptococcus downei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus ratti, streptococcus sobrinus), nonmutans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis), and  177 mutans streptococci isolated from saliva of 10 children. from the analysis of the reference strains, readily distinguishable icm mass spectra were obtained for the different species. based on multivariate statistical analysis, a correct and  unambiguous assignment was made of the spectra of 159 isolated mutans streptococci to s. mutans and 16 isolates to s. sobrinus. two isolates were sorted out and were identified by sequencing of their 16s rrna genes as streptococcus anginosus. in addition, icm indicated a misclassification for some  reference strains (aht, v 100 and e 49) and re-classified aht and e 49 as s. ratti and v 100 as s. sobrinus. this was confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing. based  on a statistical similarity analysis of the spectra of reference strains and a quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of icm, the isolates identified as either s. mutans or s. sobrinus were phenotyped on the subspecies level. in the population of the clinical isolates, 14 unambiguously different s. mutans and three different s. sobrinus phenotypes were detected. icm proved to be a powerful tool for a differentiation of mutans streptococci down to the subspecies level.

TI  == luxs-based signaling affects streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is implicated as a major etiological agent in human dental caries, and one of the important virulence properties of this organism is its ability to form biofilms (dental plaque) on tooth surfaces. we examined the role  of autoinducer-2 (ai-2) on s. mutans biofilm formation by constructing a gs-5 luxs-null mutant. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant in 0.5% sucrose defined medium was found to be markedly attenuated compared to the wild type. scanning electron microscopy also revealed that biofilms of the luxs mutant formed larger  clumps in sucrose medium compared to the parental strain. therefore, the expression of glucosyltransferase genes was examined and the gtfb and gtfc genes, but not the gtfd gene, in the luxs mutant were upregulated in the mid-log growth  phase. furthermore, we developed a novel two-compartment system to monitor ai-2 production by oral streptococci and periodontopathic bacteria. the biofilm defect of the luxs mutant was complemented by strains of s. gordonii, s. sobrinus, and s. anginosus; however, it was not complemented by s. oralis, s. salivarius, or s. sanguinis. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant was also complemented by porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 but not  by a p. gingivalis luxs mutant. these results suggest that the regulation of the  glucosyltransferase genes required for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation is regulated by ai-2. furthermore, these results provide further confirmation of previous proposals that quorum sensing via ai-2 may play a significant role in oral biofilm formation.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

AB  == the relationship between microflora, eruption status and caries status in the first permanent molar of young children was investigated in 177 children aged 6-7 years. a significantly greater proportion of fully erupted teeth were classified  as sound and plaque-free compared to partially erupted teeth. fully erupted teeth yielded greater numbers and proportions of mutans streptococci compared with significantly greater numbers and proportions of actinomyces israelii in partially erupted teeth. logistical regression analysis showed significant associations between white spot lesions in partially erupted teeth and increased  numbers of streptococcus oralis, mutans streptococci and streptococcus salivarius whereas the presence of actinomyces naeslundii was associated with health. significantly greater numbers and proportions of s. oralis and s. salivarius were isolated from partially erupted teeth with white spot lesions whereas streptococcus mutans was isolated in significantly greater numbers and proportions from fully erupted molars with white spots. this study suggests that  organisms other than mutans streptococci are associated with caries development in erupting permanent molar teeth.

AB  == the feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna (rdna) intergenic spacer (its) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (vs) was evaluated. the its regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of vs were amplified by pcr and sequenced. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis,  s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the its lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. the intraspecies similarity scores for the its sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for s. gordonii strains.  the interspecies similarity scores for the its sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. phylogenetic analysis of the its regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of vs is not parallel to that of the 16s rrna genes. one  hundred six clinical isolates of vs were identified by the rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux vitek, marcy l'etoile, france) and by its sequencing, and the  level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their its sequences. the accuracy of using its sequencing for identification of vs was verified by 16s rdna sequencing for all strains except strains of s. oralis and s. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16s rdna sequences. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by its sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of vs.

TI  == pcr detection and identification of oral streptococci in saliva samples using gtf genes.
AB  == oral streptococci are major constituents of dental plaque, and their prevalence is implicated in various pathologies. therefore, accurate identification of oral  streptococci would be valuable for studies of cariogenic plaque and for diagnostic use in infective endocarditis. many oral streptococci possess glucosyltransferase enzymes that synthesize glucan, which is an obligate component of dental plaque. we established a rapid and precise method to identify oral streptococci by pcr using the species-specific region from the glucosyltransferase gene. with the species-specific primers, streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, s. oralis, and s. gordonii could be successfully distinguished. further, we developed a simple method to extract the bacterial dna from saliva. using the resultant dna as a template, the proposed pcr detection was performed. their distribution was in accord with results of conventional biochemical tests. these findings indicate that the present pcr method is useful for the analysis of oral streptococci and can be successfully used in clinical applications to identify pathogenic bacteria associated with oral infectious disease and/or endocarditis.

AB  == the presence of erm genes conferring constitutive and inducible resistance, as well as that of the mefa gene conferring only constitutive resistance, was investigated using pcr in 70 erythromycin resistant (mic>or=1 mg/l) strains of viridans group streptococci (vgs) (18 streptococcus mitis biotype 1, 16 s. mitis  biotype 2, 15 s. oralis, 12 s. salivarius and nine s. sanguis) isolated from the  oropharynx of healthy greek children. all of the 56 isolates belonging to resistance phenotype m harbored the mefa gene. all of the 14 isolates constitutively resistant to macrolides and lincosamides (phenotype cr) harbored the ermb gene. co-presence of both genes was not observed, whereas class a erm gene (previously known as ermtr) was not detected. our results are consistent with a possible role of vgs as a reservoir of resistance genes now prevalent in pathogenic species of streptococci.

TI  == viridans streptococcus bacteremia in children on chemotherapy for cancer: an underestimated problem.
AB  == the authors discuss the morbidity associated with viridans streptococcus bacteremia, and its implications on the choice of antibiotics used as prophylaxis and treatment. they retrospectively studied the case notes of 38 children who were being treated for various malignant conditions in their unit and developed 40 episodes of bacteremia with viridans streptococci between october 1995 and january 1999. viridans streptococci were the third commonest blood culture isolate during this period, after coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus. the majority of the isolates were streptococcus mitis (55%). others were s. sanguis (25%), s. oralis (12.5%), s. salivarius (5%), and s. acidominimus (2.5%). twenty-five percent of the patients had been treated with regimens that included cytosine arabinoside, 60% were receiving prophylactic co-trimoxazole, and 87.5% were neutropenic. thirty percent of patients had abnormal chest x-rays, and 15% were hypotensive; 2 patients required admission to the intensive care unit. initial antibiotic therapy was changed because of failure of clinical response in 60% of cases, despite the infecting organism being sensitive in vitro. this study confirms the importance of viridans streptococci as a cause of bacteremia in pediatric hematology and oncology patients, leading to significant morbidity. further work is required to establish the optimal treatment for viridans streptococcus bacteremia.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == classification of oral streptococci by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with direct activity stain for glycosyltransferases.
AB  == thirty eight strains of oral streptococci were divided into six types by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de) followed by glycosyltransferase (glt)  activity stain: type 1, streptococcus mutans; type 2, streptococcus rattus; type  3, streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus downei; type 4, streptococcus cricetus; type 5, streptococcus salivarius; and type 6, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii. in types 1, 2 and 5, two glucosyltransferases synthesizing water-insoluble (gtf-i) and water-soluble glucans (gtf-s) and a fructosyltransferase (ftf) were detected. in types 3 and 4, gtf-i and two gtf-ss were detected. only one gtf-s was detected in type 6. the 2-de patterns for these six types were clearly distinguished from each other based on the kind, number and location of glts in gel.

TI  == invasion and killing of human endothelial cells by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == colonization of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci can result in infective endocarditis and possibly atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. we investigated the ability of  selected oral streptococci to infect monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) in 50% human plasma and to produce cytotoxicity. planktonic streptococcus gordonii ch1 killed huvec over a 5-h period by peroxidogenesis (alpha-hemolysin) and by acidogenesis but not by production of protein exotoxins. huvec were protected fully by addition of supplemental buffers and bovine liver catalase to the culture medium. streptococci were also found to  invade huvec by an endocytic mechanism that was dependent on polymerization of actin microfilaments and on a functional cytoskeleton, as indicated by inhibition with cytochalasin d and nocodazole. electron microscopy revealed streptococci attached to huvec surfaces via numerous fibrillar structures and bacteria in membrane-encased cytoplasmic vacuoles. following invasion by s. gordonii ch1, huvec monolayers showed 63% cell lysis over 4 h, releasing 64% of the total intracellular bacteria into the culture medium; however, the bacteria did not multiply during this time. the ability to invade huvec was exhibited by selected  strains of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. mutans, s. mitis, and s. oralis but only weakly by s. salivarius. comparison of isogenic pairs of s. gordonii revealed a requirement for several surface proteins for maximum host cell invasion: glucosyltransferase, the sialic acid-binding protein hsa, and the hydrophobicity/coaggregation proteins csha and cshb. deletion of genes for the antigen i/ii adhesins, sspa and sspb, did not affect invasion. we hypothesize that peroxidogenesis and invasion of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci are integral events in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and atherosclerosis.

TI  == inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  == background: monoclonal (ktmab) and recombinant (ktscfv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. ktmab and ktscfv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and s. mutans in particular. in this study, the activity of ktmab and ktscfv against s. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by ktmab of dental colonization by s. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. materials and  methods: ktscfv and ktmab were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay against a serotype c strain of s. mutans, and other oral streptococci (s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius). an ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish ktmab potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by s. mutans and other oral streptococci. results: ktmab and ktscfv kill in vitro s. mutans and other oral streptococci. ktmab inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by s. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. conclusions: killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.

TI  == establishment of streptococci in the upper respiratory tract: longitudinal changes in the mouth and nasopharynx up to 2 years of age.
AB  == as part of a series of longitudinal studies on the development of the indigenous  microflora of the upper respiratory tract, the establishment of streptococci in the oral cavity and nasopharynx and iga1 protease production by the early streptococcal flora was examined in 50 healthy caucasian infants at the ages of 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. in the oral cavity, streptococci were found in all infants on every sampling occasion, streptococcus mitis biovar 1 being the main finding in each age group. s. salivarius and s. mitis biovar 2 reached their highest prevalence during the first year of life, whereas the prevalence of s. oralis and s. sanguis showed no significant increase before 12 months of age. salivary streptococci mainly consisted of the above-mentioned species during the  follow-up period. in contrast to the oral cavity, no stable colonisation pattern  was observed for viridans streptococci in the nasopharynx. s. mitis biovar 1 and  s. pneumoniae, a traditional respiratory pathogen, were the principal streptococcal species among nasopharyngeal isolates. iga1 protease production by  early streptococci was common in infancy. among the oral streptococcal microflora, s. mitis biovar 1 (especially during the first year of life) and s. oralis and s. sanguis constituted the main species responsible for this enzyme activity. in the nasopharynx, iga1 protease was produced by s. mitis biovar 1, s. oralis and s. pneumoniae. in conclusion, streptococcal colonisation differs in these two close habitats in the upper respiratory tract.

AB  == the full-length sequences of the groesl genes (also known as cpn10/60) of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordonii, and  streptococcus sanguis and the near full-length sequence of the groesl genes of streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius were determined. the lengths of the groes genes from the 10 species listed above ranged from 282 to 288 bp, and the full-length sequences of groel determined for  4 species (s. anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. sanguis) revealed that each was 1,623 bp. the intergenic region (spacer) between the groes and groel genes varies in size (15 to 111 bp) and sequence between species. the variation of the groes sequences among the species tested was greater (62.1 to 95.1% nucleotide sequence identities) than that of the groel sequences (77.2 to 95.2% nucleotide sequence identities). phylogenetic analysis of the groes and groel genes yielded evolutionary trees similar to the tree constructed by use of  the 16s rrna gene. the intraspecies variation of the spacer was minimal for clinical isolates of some species. the groesl sequence data provide an additional parameter for identification of viridans group streptococcal species.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

TI  == the galu gene of streptococcus pneumoniae that codes for a udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase is highly polymorphic and suitable for molecular typing and phylogenetic studies.
AB  == the enzyme utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, udpg:pp) is synthesized by practically all organisms, although prokaryotic udpg:pps are evolutionarily unrelated to the eukaryotic counterparts. the primary structure of prokaryotic udpg:pps is well conserved, although little  information exists on the polymorphism of the genes coding for these enzymes. it  has been reported that the galu gene encoding the streptococcus pneumoniae udpg:pp is absolutely required for the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide,  a sine qua non prerequisite for virulence. a 594 bp fragment covering 66% of the  galu gene from 37 pneumococcal isolates and the type strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sobrinus has been amplified by pcr and sequenced. up to 21 different alleles were found in s. pneumoniae. they possess a mosaic-like structure and belong to, at least, two evolutionarily distinct families that show a sequence divergence of 15-20%. in spite of its marked polymorphism, phylogenetic relationships among pneumococcal strains deduced from the galu gene matched those previously established by using alternative approaches. comparison of the pneumococcal galu alleles with those from other streptococci indicated the existence of a complex network of genetic interchange. the galu gene represents an informative marker to be used alone or in conjunction with other molecular typing methods.

TI  == genotypic heterogeneity of streptococcus oralis and distinct aciduric subpopulations in human dental plaque.
AB  == the genotypic heterogeneity of streptococcus oralis isolated from the oral cavity was investigated using repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr. unrelated subjects  harbored unique genotypes, with numerous genotypes being isolated from an individual. s. oralis is the predominant aciduric bacterium isolated from noncarious tooth sites. genotypic comparison of the aciduric populations isolated at ph 5.2 with those isolated from mitis-salivarius agar (msa) (ph 7.0) indicated that the aciduric populations were genotypically distinct in the majority of subjects (chi(2) = 13.09; p = 0.0031). neither the aciduric nor the msa-isolated  strains were stable, with no strains isolated at baseline being isolated 4 or 12  weeks later in the majority of subjects. the basis of this instability is unknown but is similar to that reported for streptococcus mitis. examination of s. oralis strains isolated from cohabiting couples demonstrated that in three of five couples, genotypically identical strains were isolated from both partners and this was confirmed by using salmonella enteritidis repetitive element pcr and enterobacterial pcr typing. these data provide further evidence of the physiological and genotypic heterogeneity of non-mutans streptococci. the demonstration of distinct aciduric populations of s. oralis implies that the role of these and other non-mutans streptococci in the caries process requires reevaluation.

TI  == isolation of bacteria from cervical lymph nodes in patients with oral cancer.
AB  == thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. all 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent  extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection)  with free flap reconstruction. a total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. bacterial translocation was found more  often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional  lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). as the gingival carcinoma group includes more t4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved  nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. oral streptococci (streptococcus intermedius, strep. constellatus, strep. oralis, strep. mitis, strep. sanguis, strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. aerobic enteric bacteria (enterococcus, escherichia, klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. among the anaerobic bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer  might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain  the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.

TI  == molecular relationships and antimicrobial susceptibilities of viridans group streptococci isolated from blood of neutropenic cancer patients.
AB  == from january 1995 to may 1998, 57 episodes of bacteremia due to viridans group streptococci were identified in 50 febrile neutropenic patients with hematologic  malignancies. four patients experienced two separate episodes of streptococcal bacteremia, and one patient had four separate episodes of streptococcal bacteremia. strains were identified to species level as streptococcus mitis (n =  37), streptococcus oralis (n = 19), and streptococcus salivarius (n = 1). epidemiologic relatedness of these strains was studied by using pcr-based fingerprinting with m13 and eric-2 primers and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with restriction enzyme smai. all strains that were isolated from different patients exhibited unique fingerprint patterns, thus suggesting that viridans group streptococcal bacteremia usually derives from an endogenous source. cross-transmission of strains between patients could not be established. four s.  mitis isolates recovered during four separate bacteremic episodes in a single patient had identical fingerprint patterns. susceptibility testing was carried out by broth microdilution technique according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. the mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited were (in milligrams per liter) as follows: 0. 5 (penicillin), 0.5 (amoxicillin), 0.25 (cefotaxime), 2 (chloramphenicol), 4 (erythromycin), 0.5 (clindamycin), >/=32 (tetracycline), >/=32 (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), 4 (ciprofloxacin), 0.5 (sparfloxacin), 0.5 (vancomycin), 0.25 (teicoplanin), and 1  (quinupristin-dalfopristin). high-level penicillin resistance (mic, >/=4 mg/liter) was found in one isolate only, but intermediate penicillin resistance was noted in 11 isolates (19%). resistance rates to other drugs were as follows:  7% (amoxicillin), 4% (cefotaxime), 4% (chloramphenicol), 32% (erythromycin), 9% (clindamycin), 39% (tetracycline), 68% (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), 23% (ciprofloxacin), 0% (sparfloxacin), 0% (vancomycin), 0% (teicoplanin), and 0% (quinupristin-dalfopristin).

TI  == effect of low-molecular-weight chitosans on the adhesive properties of oral streptococci.
AB  == it was previously shown that a low-molecular-weight chitosan and its derivatives  n-carboxymethyl chitosan and imidazolyl chitosan inhibit streptococcus mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite. the ability of the same molecules to interfere with adhesive properties of other oral streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis) was tested. when saliva-coated or -uncoated hydroxyapatite beads were treated with n-carboxymethyl chitosan, a reduction varying from 60% to 98% depending on strains was observed. low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan did not have any effect. growth in n-carboxymethyl chitosan-supplemented medium (final concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 micrograms.ml-1) caused a dose related reduction in the adsorption of all strains to hydroxyapatite and in their affinity towards xylene. no effect was observed with low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan. in contrast to what observed with s. mutans, the three polysaccharides did not affect detachment from hydroxyapatite beads and adherence to cheek epithelial cells of the other streptococci. these results suggest that low-molecular-weight chitosans and/or imidazolyl chitosan, selectively affecting s. mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite, may be very interesting as potential anti-dental caries agents.

AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

TI  == speciation of presumptive viridans streptococci from early onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == twenty isolates resembling viridans streptococci, 16 from blood and four from gastric aspirates, from 17 cases of early onset neonatal sepsis were identified by the api20 strep, rapid id 32 strep and conventional tests plus hydrolysis of methylumbelliferyl glycoside substrates. nineteen of the isolates were identified as species of viridans streptococci and one as a leuconostoc sp. ten of the isolates were streptococcus oralis, three s. mitis biotype 1, two s. mitis biotype 2 and one each of s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius and s. intermedius. the rapid id 32 strep and conventional plus methylumbelliferyl tests gave the same species identity for 17 of the isolates. s. intermedius was identified by the rapid id 32 strep as s. constellatus and s. salivarius as s. equinus, with s. salivarius at lower probability. the api20 strep failed to identify s. vestibularis and identified s. salivarius as s. defectivus. the absence of certain critical tests, including urea hydrolysis, does not allow the  api20 strep to identify all the currently recognised species of viridans steptococci. the species distribution was unexpected and the incidence of s. oralis and other viridans streptococci in vaginal swabs from prenatal patients is being investigated further.

TI  == [2 cases of iatrogenic oral streptococcal infection: meningitis and spondylodiscitis].
AB  == introduction: the multiplication of invasive spine investigations for either diagnostic or therapeutical purposes increases the risk for iatrogenic infections. we report two cases of iatrogenic infections, one case of meningitidis and one case of spondylodiscitis due to streptococcus viridans. exegesis: the two cases included a 42-year-old male patient presenting with spondylodiscitis due to streptococcus oralis following nucleolysis for discal node and a 51-year-old female patient with purulent meningitidis due to streptococcus salivarius following hysteroscopy with spinal anesthesia. according to the disease chronology and bacterial results, iatrogenesis was evidenced. the  streptococci originate from the patient's skin or from the operators' endobuccal  flora. conclusion: simple aseptic rules, including wearing a surgical mask during any spinal tap, would definitely avoid iatrogenic infections.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of viridans group streptococci in taiwan with an emphasis on the high rates of resistance to penicillin and macrolides in streptococcus oralis.
AB  == the in-vitro susceptibilities of 13 antimicrobial agents were determined for 207  isolates of viridans group streptococci recovered from patients with significant  infections in taiwan during 1995 and 1997. variable degrees of susceptibility existed among nine species. high-level penicillin resistance (mic > or = 4.0 mg/l) was found most frequently in streptococcus oralis (35%), followed by streptococcus mitis (20%) and streptococcus salivarius (8%). however, s. salivarius showed the lowest rate of susceptibility to penicillin (50%). macrolide resistance also occurred most frequently in s. oralis isolates (55%) but in none of streptococcus mutans. penicillin and macrolides tended to be less  active against isolates recovered from non-invasive sites than against those isolated from invasive sites. imipenem was the most active beta-lactam against penicillin-resistant isolates. ofloxacin, vancomycin and teicoplanin showed good  in-vitro activity against all isolates, with mic90s of 2, 1 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. none of these isolates displayed high-level resistance to gentamicin and most isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol. these results indicate the species-related variability of susceptibility, especially to penicillin, macrolides and tetracycline. in addition to s. mitis, s. oralis also  displayed high rates of resistance to penicillin and macrolides. the difference in susceptibilities between species of viridans streptococci indicates the importance of accurate identification and the need for continuing surveillance of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == mutacin production by streptococcus mutans may promote transmission of bacteria from mother to child.
AB  == the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances, mutacins, by mutans streptococci varies among isolates. to find if the degree of mutacin activity of  an isolate was related to its transmission between mother and her child, 19 mothers and their 18-month- to 3-year-old children were sampled for their oral mutans streptococci. in addition, the stability of mutacin activity was studied with isolates from the mothers and with isolates from five unrelated 5-year-old children in 5- to 7-year follow-up studies. a total of 145 oral mutans streptococcal isolates were serotyped by immunodiffusion, ribotyped, and mutacin  typed by the stab culture technique. mutacin was produced by 88% of the strains against more than 1 of the 14 indicator strains, representing mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus mutans  isolates showed more inhibitory activity than did streptococcus sobrinus isolates. identical ribotypes had similar mutacin activity profiles within a subject, initially and in the follow-up studies, in all but two cases. the mothers harbored a total of 37 different mutans streptococcal ribotypes. six children were negative for mutans streptococci. transmission was probable in 9 of 20 mother-child pairs on the basis of the presence of identical strains, as determined by ribotyping and bacteriocin (mutacin) typing. s. mutans strains shared between a mother and her child showed a broader spectrum of inhibitory activity than did nontransmitted strains. in conclusion, the mutacin activity of  clinical isolates is reasonably stable, and this virulence factor seems to be of  clinical importance in early colonization by s. mutans.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == in vivo binding of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp (identical to gcdfp-15) to oral and non-oral bacteria detection and identification of ep-gp binding species.
AB  == extra parotid glycoprotein (ep-gp) is a glycoprotein isolated from human saliva,  having homologues in several other body fluids. the biological role of ep-gp and  its homologues is unknown. recently, ep-gp was shown to bind in vitro to the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb. in contrast, no binding to a number of other oral microorganisms could be demonstrated. in the present study we have determined whether binding of ep-gp to bacteria occurs in vivo in saliva and in other ep-gp containing body fluids. therefore the presence of ep-gp on bacteria in vivo was determined by analyzing oral, skin and ear floras by confocal fluoresence microscopy using specific antibodies. about 12% of the in vivo oral flora had ep-gp present on their surface, while approximately 5% of the bacteria  from ear canal or skin was positive for ep-gp. iga was detected on approximately  65% of the salivary bacteria, whereas the high-molecular weight mucin (mg1) and cystatin c were not detectable on any oral bacterium. using a replica-plate assay, a number of ep-gp binding strains in saliva were isolated and identified as gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorium, streptococcus acidominimus, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus parasanguis. bacteria from the ear canal and skin bacteria were identified as staphylococcus hominis. it is concluded that ep-gp is selectively bound in vivo to several oral  and non-oral bacterial species.

TI  == experimental salivary pellicles formed on titanium surfaces mediate adhesion of streptococci.
AB  == the goal of this study was to characterize salivary components of titanium pellicles and to determine how experimental pellicles affect adhesion of several  strains of streptococci to titanium surfaces. titanium experimental pellicles were formed by incubation of fresh human parotid or human submandibular-sublingual saliva on pure titanium beads. pellicle was recovered from the beads using sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer and was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting to identify adsorbed salivary components. streptococcus anginosus, s. oralis, and s. salivarius recovered from in vivo titanium plaque and five reference strains of streptococci were used in adhesion assays to titanium beads with and without experimental salivary pellicles. the experimental pellicle formed on titanium was found to be composed of selected proteins from human parotid and human submandibular-sublingual saliva. salivary alpha-amylase and proline-rich proteins were found in all experimental pellicles, while siga, high-molecular weight mucin, and proline-rich glycoproteins were detected in one of the experimental pellicles examined. adhesion of fresh isolates and reference stains of s. anginosus, s. oralis, and s. salivarius to saliva-coated titanium was reduced compared to that of titanium without saliva coating. however, adhesion of laboratory strains of s. gordonii and s. sanguis was found to be significantly greater to experimental pellicles of human submandibular-sublingual saliva than was the adhesion of the fresh isolates, suggesting that streptococci-colonizing implant surfaces may be inherently less adhesive than other bacterial strains. this study found that salivary pellicles are selectively formed on titanium and mediate in vitro adhesion of streptococci.

AB  == scanning electron (sem) microscopy of epoxy replicas made from dental impressions has shown that in buccal gingival recession the root surfaces are devoid of cementum, leaving the dentin exposed. in this study replication techniques were applied to correlate the micromorphology of the buccocervical region with early streptococcal attachment. the subjects were 27 healthy young adults. the buccocervical surfaces of all the premolars were meticulously cleaned. the subjects fasted for 2 h before impression-taking. replicas were made from impressions in hydrophilic a-silicone, and streptococcal attachment was visualized by light microscopy of mitis-salivarius agar replicas incubated anaerobically for 48 h. the surface micromorphology was documented by sem of corresponding epoxy replicas. colonization only 2 h after cleaning was very sparse. sites with healthy or inflamed gingivae had markedly different colonization patterns in the sulcular region. in 4 subjects with a total of 12 sites where gingival recession, undetected clinically, was disclosed by sem, representative colonies were retrieved and identified microbiologically to species level. two healthy sites per subject were also sampled. streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus were identified from eight sites with exposed root dentin. s. oralis predominated on the enamel surfaces. the method offers a valuable complement to in situ and in vitro microbiologic studies of exposed dentin and a  novel technique for sampling clinical isolates of streptococci.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.

TI  == the resistance and adaptation of selected oral bacteria to mercury and its impact on their growth.
AB  == selected strains of oral streptococcus and actinomyces have been tested for their ability to grow in the presence of mercury. strains were tested for growth on a semi-defined medium with low mercury-binding characteristics. sensitivities were  initially measured on agar plates, and subsequently, selected strains were grown  in broth so that the impact of mercury on the growth characteristics could be determined. streptococci were more resistant to mercury (5 micrograms/ml to 40 micrograms/ml) than actinomyces (< 5 micrograms/ml to 30 micrograms/ml). the most resistant streptococci included s. mitis biovar 1, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and one strain of s. mutans, all of which grew on agar with 40 micrograms/ml of mercury. two other s. mutans strains were more sensitive, being inhibited by 10 and 20 micrograms/ml mercury. the most resistant actinomyces was a. naeslundii genospecies 1 (atcc12104), which grew on medium with 30 micrograms/ml mercury; two strains of actinomyces were completely inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml. mercury  caused increased lag times and reduced cell density in broth cultures. enrichment cultures of samples of human dental plaque showed that streptococci were the most resistant organisms that could be cultured on the medium and that these strains could adapt to relatively high mercury concentrations. s. oralis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most resistant organisms isolated from enriched cultures, growing in broth media with 65 micrograms/ml mercury. mercury was bound to cell walls and cell cytoplasm of streptococci grown in the presence of mercury.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == recently published taxonomic studies of viridans streptococci have resulted in several changes in the nomenclature and definition of oral streptococcal species. with this background, the ecology of streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavities was reinvestigated. the results based on the examination of 1426 streptococcal isolates confirmed and extended earlier findings. apart from mature supragingival plaque, which contained a mixture of all orally encountered streptococci, each site showed a characteristic streptococcal flora. initial dental plaque formation is primarily associated with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1  and streptococcus oralis. our investigation showed that s. sanguis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most prominent streptococci, also on buccal mucosa. in contrast, s. oralis was almost exclusively found in initial dental plaque. streptococcus gordonii, formerly part of s. sanguis, was found in small numbers on the oropharyngeal mucosa and in mature supragingival plaque. the dorsum of the tongue was dominated by s. mitis biovar 2 and streptococcus salivarius, the latter of which was predominant also on the pharyngeal mucosa. streptococcus anginosus was by far the most predominant streptococcus in subgingival plaque. immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease-producing streptococci were primarily isolated  from initial dental plaque and from the buccal mucosa. this lends further support to the concept of iga1 proteases being important for the ability of streptococci  to evade the local immune defence during their initial colonization of certain oral surfaces.

TI  == mutacin activity of strains isolated from children with varying levels of mutants streptococci and caries.
AB  == a total of 157 isolates of mutants streptococci from plaque and saliva of 94 children were studied for their serotypes, mutacin production, frequency and spectrum of activity. of these isolates 71% were identified as serotype c and 22% as serotype e. serotypes f, d and g, and one untypable strain made up about 7% of the isolates. more than one serotype was found in 13% of the children. mutacin was produced by 83% of the isolates against one or more of the 14 indicator strains representing mutants streptococci. streptococcus sanguis, strep. oralis,  strep. gordonii, strep. salivarius and strep. pyogenes. isolates that had a broad inhibitory spectrum also produced larger inhibition zones than isolates that inhibited fewer strains. when evaluating the effect of mutacin in vivo on plaque  ecology, it was found that the counts of mutans streptococci or the proportion of mutans streptococci in the total streptococcal count of plaque did not differ between plaques containing strains that produced much mutacin and those with little production. the findings also failed to reveal an association between caries experience and mutacin activity.

TI  == ability to bind salivary alpha-amylase discriminates certain viridans group streptococcal species.
AB  == a collection of 144 viridans group streptococcal strains recently characterized as part of a taxonomic study was examined for the ability to bind salivary alpha-amylase. this property was found in most strains of streptococcus gordonii  and streptococcus mitis and in occasional strains of streptococcus anginosus and  streptococcus salivarius. in contrast, all strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus vestibularis, and streptococcus mutans lacked alpha-amylase-binding capacity. a rapid and easy assay described in this paper may be an important supplementary test for identification of oral streptococci.

TI  == sialidase activity of the "streptococcus milleri group" and other viridans group  streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci were examined for the production of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid in a simple and rapid (15-min) assay. sialidase was produced by all strains of streptococcus oralis and s. intermedius and by a majority of s. mitis strains. s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s.  gordonii, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, "s. parasanguis," and the "tufted fibril group" were uniformly negative. sialidase production may be a useful characteristic to assist in the identification of viridans group streptococci.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with candida albicans.
AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

TI  == cohesion between oral streptococci and neisseria pharyngis on saliva-coated glass, in the presence and absence of sucrose.
AB  == ten strains of oral streptococci, comprising nine species, were screened for their in vitro cohesive interactions with a freshly isolated strain of neisseria  pharyngis. strains of mutans streptococci, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus mitis were able  to cohere with n. pharyngis cells attached to a salivary pellicle adsorbed to glass. the cohesion was either due to coaggregation between the different genera  or modification of the salivary pellicle by n. pharyngis mw2. s. sanguis ii and streptococcus oralis strains could not cohere with the n. pharyngis strain. extracellular polysaccharide formed from sucrose was found to mediate cohesion between certain strains of mutans streptococci or s. oralis and n. pharyngis mw2.

TI  == comparison of the initial streptococcal microflora on dental enamel in caries-active and in caries-inactive individuals.
AB  == this study compared the initial (4 h) microflora on enamel in 7 caries-active and in 7 caries-inactive adolescents. in both groups the microflora was dominated by  streptococci which comprised 61 and 78% (median values) of the total viable counts in caries-active and caries-inactive individuals, respectively (p less than 0.01). identification of a total of 700 streptococcal isolates according to  a recently revised classification showed that the predominant streptococci belonged to the species streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1, and streptococcus sanguis. early plaque from caries-inactive individuals differed from that of caries-active individuals by significantly higher proportions of s.  sanguis (p less than 0.05) and iga1 protease producing streptococci (p less than  0.05). in caries-active individuals, there was a tendency to elevated levels of s. mitis biovar 1 (p less than 0.10). in addition, caries-active individuals were colonized by significantly higher numbers of mutans streptococci on the enamel surfaces (p less than 0.01). however, in both groups streptococcus mutans (serotype c) comprised less than or equal to 2% of the early streptococcal flora. streptococcus gordonii, s. mitis biovar 2, and streptococcus salivarius were present in low proportions and did not show differences in distribution that could be related to caries activity. the observed differences in the composition  of the early streptococcal microflora may be a factor that governs the eventual cariogenic potential of dental plaque.

TI  == adherence of oral streptococci to composite resin restorative materials.
AB  == the frequency of oral streptococcal bacterial isolates detected on composite resin squares attached to maxillary first molars in 12 volunteers was 62.1 per cent. these cocci consisted of streptococcus mitior (52.8 per cent), s. sanguis (20.2 per cent), s. oralis (8.6 per cent), s. salivarius (1.0 per cent) and s. anginosus (0.3 per cent). an electron microscopic study of these organisms labelled with [3h]thymidine for in vitro adhesiveness to the resin revealed that  s. mitior was the most adhesive, and that its pronounced adhesiveness is associated with its characteristic extracellular ultrastructure.

TI  == partial characterisation of the inhibitory substances produced by streptococcus oralis and related species.
AB  == the production of inhibitory substances was sought by deferred antagonism. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, but no detectable bacteriocin.  actinomycetes and neisseria pharyngis were particularly susceptible to the lethal action of hydrogen peroxide. streptococcus milleri produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocin-like substances. s. oralis strains were inhibited by the bacteriocin-like products of strains of streptococcus bovis, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius. inhibition was due neither to complete bacteriophage nor to fermentation end-products. extracellular polysaccharides formed during growth could not protect sensitive strains from the effect of hydrogen peroxide or bacteriocin-like substances.

TI  == microbiology of the early colonization of human enamel and root surfaces in vivo.
AB  == this study describes the predominant early microflora on human teeth on the basis of microbiologic identification of 1742 fresh isolates. the isolates were obtained from four dental students who carried test pieces of enamel and root surface in the oral cavity for 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. during the experimental periods oral hygiene was discontinued. under equal conditions root surfaces were  more heavily colonized than were enamel surfaces. however, the composition of the microbiota was the same. within the first 24 h the microflora was dominated by streptococci and gram-positive pleomorphic rods. s. sanguis contributed only 6-18% of the early colonizers whereas s. mitis and s. oralis varied between 24-42% and 1-27% (mean values), respectively. the relative proportion of s. oralis increased significantly within the observation period while the proportion of s. salivarius and arginine-positive s. mitis showed a declining tendency. actinomyces species adsorbed to the tooth surfaces within the first 4 h but did not increase their relative proportions until after 8-12 h, possibly due to a long doubling time. in one individual, encapsulated bacteria resembling stomatococcus mucilaginosus were observed among the early colonizers. the time-dependent shifts in the bacterial populations within 24 h corroborate parallel ultrastructural findings.

TI  == a simple method for determining extracellular polysaccharide-producing ability of oral streptococci.
AB  == a simple method is described for determining the types of extracellular polysaccharides produced by oral streptococci. the method yields quantitative results in which the amount of polysaccharides produced is normalised with respect to dna. results correlate well with previously published data for oral streptococci, except in the case of streptococcus oralis for which there is no previously published data. all species within the mutans group produced both soluble and insoluble glucan; while soluble fructan was only produced by strains  of streptococcus rattus and streptococcus mutans. the major extracellular polysaccharide produced by streptococcus salivarius was soluble fructan, although some strains produced soluble and insoluble glucan. most streptococcus sanguis strains produced soluble and insoluble glucan. soluble fructan was produced by some strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis. the latter also produced soluble and insoluble glucan. no detectable extracellular polysaccharide was elaborated by streptococcus milleri, streptococcus faecalis or streptococcus lactis.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
