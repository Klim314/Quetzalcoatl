TI  == effects of copper supplement on growth and viability of strains used as starters  and adjunct cultures for emmental cheese manufacture.
AB  == aims: to determine the effects of supplemented copper (cu2+) on growth and viability of strains used as starters and adjunct cultures for emmental cheese manufacture. methods and results: thirteen strains belonging to lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus or propionibacterium freudenreichii species were exposed to various  copper concentrations in the proper growth medium at relevant growth temperatures, and the effects of supplemented copper on bacterial growth and cell viability were determined by optical density and ph measurements, also by platings. among the species considered, l. delbrueckii was the most copper resistant and s. thermophilus the most sensitive to copper. anaerobic conditions  increased this sensitivity significantly. there was also a considerable amount of variation in copper resistance at strain level. conclusions: copper resistance is both a species- and strain-dependent property and may reflect variability in copper-binding capacities by cell wall components among species and strains. in addition, the chemical state of copper may be involved. significance and impact of the study: this study revealed that copper resistance is a highly variable property among starter and adjunct strains, and this variability should be considered when strains are selected for emmental cheese manufacture.

TI  == conjugated linoleic acid content and organoleptic attributes of fermented milk products produced with probiotic bacteria.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria on the formation of conjugated linoleic acid (cla), microbial growth, and organoleptic attributes (acidity, texture, and flavor) of fermented milk products was determined. four probiotic bacteria, lactobacillus rhamnosus, propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 56, p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 51, and p. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii 23, were evaluated individually or in coculture with traditional yogurt cultures  (lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp.  thermophilus). the lipid source was hydrolyzed soy oil. l. rhamnosus, in coculture with yogurt culture, resulted in the highest content of cla. growth and cla formation of propionibacteria were enhanced in the presence of yogurt cultures. texture and flavor attributes of fermented milks produced with propionibacteria were significantly different than the fermented milks processed  with yogurt cultures. the fermented milks processed with probiotic bacteria in coculture with yogurt cultures demonstrated similar acidity, texture, and flavor  as the fermented milk produced with yogurt cultures.

TI  == jenseniin g, a heat-stable bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium jensenii p126.
AB  == the genus propionibacterium includes cutaneous species typically found on human skin and the dairy or classical species (propionibacterium freudenreichii, p. jensenii, p. thoenii, and p. acidipropionici) used industrially for the production of swiss cheese and propionic acid. grinstead (1989, m.s. thesis, iowa state university, ames) has previously observed that some dairy propionibacteria  inhibit other species in the classical grouping. we further investigated the inhibitor(s) produced by p. jensenii p126 (atcc 4872). an antagonist(s) from anaerobic agar cultures of p126 strongly inhibited two closely related strains of propionibacteria, p. acidipropionici p5 and p. jensenii p54, and lactobacillus bulgaricus ncdo 1489, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis atcc 4797, lactococcus cremoris ncdo 799, and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis c2. the inhibitor, designated jenseniin g, was active at ph 7.0; inactivated by treatment with pronase e, proteinase k, and type 14 protease; insensitive to catalase; and  stable to freezing, cold storage (4 degrees c, 3 days), and heat (100 degrees c,  15 min). classification of the inhibitor as a bacteriocin is supported by its proteinaceous nature and its bactericidal activity against l. delbrueckii subsp.  lactis atcc 4797. the lack of detectable plasmids suggests a chromosomal location for the determinant(s) of jenseniin g.
