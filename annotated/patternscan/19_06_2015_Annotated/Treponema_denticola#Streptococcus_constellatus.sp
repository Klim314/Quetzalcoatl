TI  == molecular detection of in-vivo microbial contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: knowing the microbiota that colonizes orthodontic appliances is important for planning strategies and implementing specific preventive measures during treatment. the purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate in vivo the  contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets with 40 dna probes for different bacterial species by using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cddh) technique. methods: eighteen patients, 11 to 29 years of age having fixed orthodontic treatment, were enrolled in the study. each subject had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to different premolars in a randomized manner. after 30  days, the brackets were removed and processed for analysis by cddh. data on bacterial contamination were analyzed descriptively and with the kruskal-wallis and dunn post tests (alpha = 0.05). forty microbial species (cariogenic microorganisms, bacteria of the purple, yellow, green, orange complexes, "red complex +treponema socranskii," and the cluster of actinomyces) were assessed. results: most bacterial species were present in all subjects, except for streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus, tannerella forsythia, t socranskii, and lactobacillus acidophillus (94.4%), propionibacterium acnes i and eubacterium nodatum (88.9%), and treponema denticola (77.8%). among the cariogenic microorganisms, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were found in larger numbers than l acidophillus and lactobacillus casei (p <0.001). the periodontal pathogens of the orange complex were detected in larger numbers than those of the "red complex +t socranskii" (p <0.0001). among the bacteria not associated with specific pathologies, veillonella parvula (purple complex) was the most frequently detected strain (p <0.0001). the numbers of yellow and green  complex bacteria and the cluster of actinomyces were similar (p >0.05). conclusions: metallic brackets in use for 1 month were multi-colonized by several bacterial species, including cariogenic microorganisms and periodontal pathogens, reinforcing the need for meticulous oral hygiene and additional preventive measures to maintain oral health in orthodontic patients.

TI  == microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. methods: ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period  of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. subsequently, a period of 21 days of  washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella parvula. the mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and p. melaninogenica. conclusion: the tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a  role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.

TI  == microarrays complement culture methods for identification of bacteria in endodontic infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the microbial composition of necrotic root canals using culture methods and microarray technology. twenty uniradicular  teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical bone loss and with no previous endodontic treatment were selected for this study. for molecular diagnosis a dna  chip with 20 different species-specific, 16s-rdna-directed catcher probes was used. the microorganisms most frequently detected by the dna chip were: micromonas micros, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, veillonella parvula, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces odontolyticus, and streptococcus constellatus. as expected, additional important bacterial taxa were found by culture analysis, but microorganisms such as t. forsythia and t. denticola could not be identified. in  conclusion, microarrays may provide significant additional information regarding  the endodontic microbiota by detecting bacterial species that are otherwise difficult or impossible to culture.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == microbiological parameters associated with il-1 gene polymorphisms in periodontitis patients.
AB  == background, aims: polymorphisms in the cluster of il-1 genes have been significantly associated with the severity of adult periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to compare microbiological parameters in il-1 genotype negative and positive adult subjects with a range of periodontitis severities. method: the study included 108 subjects in good general health. clinical parameters were recorded at 6 sites/tooth excluding 3rd molars and included: plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment  level. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal surface of  up to 28 teeth in each subject (mean 25.3) providing a total of 2736 samples. the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in each sample using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. fingerstick blood samples were collected for il-1a (+4845) and il-1b (+3954) genotyping using pcr-based methods. results: the proportion of  il-1 genotype positive subjects that exhibited mean counts of specific subgingival species above selected thresholds was significantly higher than the proportion of genotype negative subjects. prominent among species that were detected at higher levels in genotype positive subjects were members of the "red" and "orange" complexes and included: bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola,  the fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, fusobacterium periodonticum, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter showae and streptococcus constellatus. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus gordonii and 3 capnocytophaga species were also detected more frequently at high numbers in genotype positive subjects. significantly higher mean counts of b. forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, the f. nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum, campylobacter rectus, c. showae, eubacterium nodatum, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius  were detected at periodontal pockets >6 mm in subjects who were genotype positive when compared with genotype negative subjects. the increase was due to increased  numbers of cells of these species rather than a major shift in proportion. conclusion: the data suggest that genotype positive subjects more frequently had  higher levels of "red" and "orange" complex species that are known to be strongly associated with measures of periodontal inflammation.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.
