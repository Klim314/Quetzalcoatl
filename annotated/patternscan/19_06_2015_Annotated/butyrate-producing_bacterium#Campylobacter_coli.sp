TI  == effect of oral administration of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens mdt-1 on experimental  enterocolitis in mice.
AB  == butyrivibrio fibrisolvens mdt-1, a butyrate-producing strain, was evaluated for use as a probiotic to prevent enterocolitis. oral administration of the mdt-1 strain (10(9) cfu/dose) alleviated the symptoms of colitis (including body weight loss, diarrhea, bloody stool, organic disorder, and mucosal damage) that are induced in mice drinking water that contains 3.0% dextran sulfate sodium. in addition, myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity levels in colonic tissue were reduced, suggesting that mdt-1 mitigates bowel inflammation. the addition of mdt-1 culture supernatant inhibited the growth of nine clinical isolates of campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli that could potentially cause enterocolitis. infection of mice with c. coli 11580-3, one of the isolates inhibited by mdt-1 in vitro, resulted in diarrhea, mucosal damage, increased mpo activity levels in colonic tissue, increased numbers of c. coli in the cecum, and decreased body weight gain. however, administration of mdt-1 to mice, prior to and during c. coli infection, reduced these effects. these results suggest that campylobacter-induced enterocolitis can be alleviated by using b. fibrisolvens as a probiotic.
