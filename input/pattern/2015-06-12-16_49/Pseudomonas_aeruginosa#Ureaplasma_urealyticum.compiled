TI  - Comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the National Institutes of Health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - We examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. The following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a Croatian translation of the NiH CPSI questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and Stamey localization technique). Patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in Croatia. An infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), Trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), Enterococcus in 36 (19%) and Escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. In the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: Ureaplasma urealyticum, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by E. coli and Enterococcus (p<0.001). Clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by C. trachomatis, Enterococcus and E. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by T. vaginalis.
TI  - A novel diagnostic tool for detecting neonatal infections using multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In newborns with infections, it is necessary to detect various pathogens rapidly and accurately, because the infections are often fatal when diagnosis is delayed. However, no diagnostic tools that rapidly detect pathogens causing neonatal infectious diseases are available. OBJECTIVES: To establish a rapid diagnostic tool using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect 8 major pathogens that often cause neonatal infections, including Group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Ureaplasma urealyticum, herpes simplex virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Candida albicans, and to validate this tool in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). METHODS: One hundred and thirty clinical samples were obtained from newborns with any infectious signs or histories. DNA was extracted from these samples and multiplex PCR was performed with a mixture of 8 primer pairs, all designed to amplify pathogenic DNA and produce different sizes of amplicons. Seventy-seven samples with suspicion of bacterial infections were also examined by bacterial culture to evaluate the accuracy of the multiplex PCR results. RESULTS: Six of the 8 pathogens could be rapidly detected by our multiplex PCR method, within 3.5-4.5 h. These positive results led us to immediately diagnose and select proper drugs against each pathogen. In comparison with culture results, our test characteristics were as follows: specificity: 93%, negative predictive value: 96%, and concordance rate: 90%. CONCLUSIONS: We have established and validated a rapid diagnostic tool for detecting pathogens using multiplex PCR, which may be useful for the confirmed diagnosis of neonatal infections in the NICU.
TI  - Rapid one step detection of pathogenic bacteria in urine with sexually transmitted disease (STD) and prostatitis patient by multiplex PCR assay (mPCR).
AB  - We developed a multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay to simultaneously detect Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Corynebacterium spp. and seudomona aeruginosa. This method employs a single tube and multiple specific primers which yield 200, 281, 346, 423, 542, and 1,427 bp PCR products, respectively. All the PCR products were easily detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and were sequenced to confirm the specificity of the reactions. To test this method, DNA extracted from urine samples was collected from 96 sexually transmitted disease or prostatitis patients at a local hospital clinical center, and were subjected to the mPCR assay. The resulting amplicons were cloned and sequenced to exactly match the sequences of known pathogenic isolates. N. gonorrhoeae and Corynebacterium spp. were the most frequently observed pathogens found in the STDs and prostatitis patients, respectively. Unexpectedly, P. aeruginosa was also detected in some of the STD and prostatitis samples. More than one pathogen species was found in 10% and 80.7% of STD and prostatitis samples, respectively, indicating that STD and prostatitis patients may have other undiagnosed and associates. The sensitivity of the assay was determined by sing purified DNA from six pathogenic laboratory strains and revealed that this technique could detect pathogenic DNA at concentrations ranging from 0.018 to 1.899 pg/ul. Moreover, the specificities of this assay were found to be highly efficient. Thus, this mPCR assay may be useful for the rapid diagnosis of causative infectious STDs and prostatitis. useful for the infectious STDs and prostatitis.
TI  - Canine cathelicidin (K9CATH): gene cloning, expression, and biochemical activity  of a novel pro-myeloid antimicrobial peptide.
AB  - Cathelicidins, a group of cationic peptides found in leukocytes and epithelial cells, play a central role in the early innate immune defense against infection. Although these host defense peptides have been reported in several mammalian species, including primates, no cathelicidins have been identified in carnivores. Here we report the cloning, tissue expression and biological activity of a novel canine cathelicidin (K9CATH). The full-length cDNA sequence of K9CATH encodes a predicted 172 amino acid pre-propeptide that is 60-70% similar to other mammalian cathelicidins. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the 38 aa mature K9CATH peptide was present in neutrophil granule contents. Synthetic K9CATH displayed broad antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus; MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) 0.5 and 50 microM, respectively), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis; MICs 1.25 microM, Salmonella serotype Enteritidis; MIC 0.5 microM, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; MIC 0.06 microM), and yeast (Candida albicans; MIC 12.5-50 microM). K9CATH demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against Ureaplasma canigenitalium, and lower activity against Ureaplasma urealyticum (MIC 0.06 and 50 microM, respectively). Similar to its ovine congener SMAP-29, K9CATH possesses salt-independent antimicrobial activity and LPS binding capacity. K9CATH displayed minimal hemolytic activity against human, dog and chicken erythrocytes. The potency and broad antimicrobial activity of K9CATH suggest that this peptide may act as a fundamental contributor to the innate immune responses in this carnivore species.
TI  - The role of unusual pathogens in prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - A total of 1442 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis were examined over  a 4-year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic", Zagreb, Croatia. An infectious aetiology was determined in 1070 (74.2%) patients. In 561 of 1070 (52.4%) patients the inflammatory finding (>10 WBC/hpf) was found in expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) or voided bladder urine (VB(3)). Normal, <10 WBCs/hpf was found in 362 of 536 (67.5%) patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB(3), in 51 of 151 (33.8%) patients with isolated Trichomonas vaginalis and in 40 of 72 (55.6%) patients with isolated Ureaplasma urealyticum. Escherichia coli was the causative pathogen in 95, Enterococcus in 68, Proteus mirabilis in 37, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 16, Streptococcus agalactiae in 19, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection. In patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) caused by E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, E. or S. agalactiae, an inflammatory finding was regularly found in EPS or VB(3).
TI  - Ofloxacin. A reappraisal of its use in the management of genitourinary tract infections.
AB  - Ofloxacin is an established fluoroquinolone agent which achieves good concentrations in genitourinary tract tissues and fluids. It has good in vitro activity against most Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and Haemophilus ducreyi, intermediate activity against Ureaplasma urealyticum and most enterococci, but limited or no in vitro activity against enterococci, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and many anaerobes. However, high concentrations achieved in the urine ensure its activity against most urinary tract pathogens. Ofloxacin demonstrates consistent efficacy in a broad range of urinary tract infections, achieving bacteriological response rates in excess of 80% in uncomplicated and 70% in complicated infections. The efficacy of ofloxacin was similar to that of all comparators tested including other fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Ofloxacin is also effective as a single-dose regimen in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea, as a 7-day regimen in uncomplicated C. trachomatis infections, and as monotherapy in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Again, ofloxacin demonstrated similar efficacy to alternative treatments in each type of infection. The availability of an intravenous formulation and near-complete oral bioavailability allow ofloxacin to be administered as a sequential regimen without loss of activity. The tolerability and drug interaction profile of ofloxacin is consistent with that of other fluoroquinolones. The most commonly reported adverse events with ofloxacin are gastrointestinal, neurological and dermatological. It was associated with a lower incidence of photosensitivity and tendinitis and higher incidence of some neurological events than some other fluoroquinolones. Ofloxacin seems to have a lower propensity to interact with xanthines than other fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSION: ofloxacin has established efficacy in the treatment of a wide variety of urinary tract infections, although, like other fluoroquinolones, it should be used rationally to preserve its activity. Currently, ofloxacin also holds an important place among fluoroquinolones in the treatment of C. trachomatis infections and uncomplicated PID, although its acceptance as monotherapy in PID is likely to depend on clarification of the causative role of anaerobic pathogens in this infection.
TI  - Newly documented antimicrobial activity of quinolones.
AB  - The improved antimicrobial activity of newer fluoroquinolones and novel applications recently found for the drugs already marketed are reviewed. Several new compounds are more active against gram-positive bacteria than the presently marketed fluoroquinolones. WIN 57273, the most potent compound in vitro on a weight basis, is 16 to 128 times more active than ciprofloxacin against various staphylococci, streptococci, Enterococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus spp. BMY 40062, PD 117558, PD 127391, sparfloxacin, temafloxacin and tosufloxacin also show enhanced in vitro efficacy against these species. These drugs also possess increased activity against various anaerobes, notably Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and the Bacteroides fragilis group. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rapidly growing mycobacteria other than Mycobacterium chelonae, and Mycobacterium leprae are often susceptible to quinolones displaying bactericidal activity which is potentially useful for curing difficult-to-treat mycobacteriosis. In addition, a number of new products, notably those containing a cyclopropyl group, are more active than reference fluoroquinolones against Mycobacterium leprae. Sparfloxacin, BMY 40062 and WIN 57273 compare favorably with older fluoroquinolones in the killing of intracellular Legionella spp., and several of the newer compounds have greater antichlamydial potency. Improved antibacterial activity has also been found against Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas maltophilia. By contrast, the newer quinolones have similar or less activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. Recently, pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were found to be active against protozoa, including Plasmodium spp., Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania donovani, but not against Toxoplasma gondii. In the near future, more specific research testing unusual pathogens may lead to the identification of quinolones with more selective activity.
TI  - [Comparative bacteriological and chemical analysis of kidney calculi. Apropos of  135 cases].
AB  - The formation of some urinary tract stones (struvite stones) is known to be related to infection by urease-possessing microorganisms, such as Proteus sp. and some other bacteria. Ureaplasma urealyticum, a genital mycoplasma, contains also urease and is predominantly located in the urogenital tract. Its significance in the production of human urinary stones has not yet been elucidated. In this study, 135 human calculi obtained by surgery were analysed chemically and were cultured for the presence of conventional bacteria and U. urealyticum, 51 were ammonium magnesium phosphate stones and contained Proteus (27), E. coli (4), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Streptococcus D (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Corynebacterium (1), Candida albicans (1). U. urealyticum was isolated in one patient, from two different calculi (left and right) taken after an interval of fifteen days. Different bacteria were isolated from other calculi (oxalate, uric acid). This findings suggest that Ureaplasma urealyticum should be looked for in struvite calculi.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Aetiology of acute epididymitis.
AB  - 24 patients with acute epididymitis were examined and underwent urethral and urine cultures for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Ureaplasma urealyticum, herpes-simplex virus, Chlamydia trachomatis, cytomegalovirus, and gram-negative aerobic bacteria. The results suggest that in young men the sexually transmitted organisms which cause urethritis (N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and possibly U. urealyticum) may also lead to acute epididymitis, whereas in older men coliforms and Pseudomonas are the predominant causes of epididymitis.
