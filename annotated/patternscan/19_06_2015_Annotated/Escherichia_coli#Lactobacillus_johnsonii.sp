TI  == effects of lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus reuteri on gut barrier function and heat shock proteins in intestinal porcine epithelial cells.
AB  == heat shock proteins (hsps) are a set of highly conserved proteins that can serve  as intestinal gate keepers in gut homeostasis. here, effects of a probiotic, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), and two novel porcine isolates, lactobacillus johnsonii strain p47-hy and lactobacillus reuteri strain p43-huv, on cytoprotective hsp expression and gut barrier function, were investigated in a porcine ipec-j2 intestinal epithelial cell line model. the ipec-j2 cells polarized on a permeable filter exhibited villus-like cell phenotype with development of apical microvilli. western blot analysis detected hsp expression in ipec-j2 and revealed that l. johnsonii and l. reuteri strains were able to significantly induce hsp27, despite high basal expression in ipec-j2, whereas lgg did not. for hsp72, only the supernatant of l. reuteri induced the expression, which was comparable to the heat shock treatment, which indicated that hsp72 expression was more stimulus specific. the protective effect of lactobacilli was  further studied in ipec-j2 under an enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) challenge. etec caused intestinal barrier destruction, as reflected by loss of cell-cell contact, reduced ipec-j2 cell viability and transepithelial electrical  resistance, and disruption of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1. in contrast, the l. reuteri treatment substantially counteracted these detrimental effects and preserved the barrier function. l. johnsonii and lgg also achieved barrier protection, partly by directly inhibiting etec attachment. together, the  results indicate that specific strains of lactobacillus can enhance gut barrier function through cytoprotective hsp induction and fortify the cell protection against etec challenge through tight junction protein modulation and direct interaction with pathogens.

TI  == a highly acid-resistant novel strain of lactobacillus johnsonii no. 1088 has antibacterial activity, including that against helicobacter pylori, and inhibits  gastrin-mediated acid production in mice.
AB  == a novel strain of lactobacillus johnsonii no. 1088 was isolated from the gastric  juice of a healthy japanese male volunteer, and characterized for its effectiveness in the stomach environment. lactobacillus johnsonii no. 1088 was found to have the strongest acid resistance among several lactobacilli examined (>10% of cells survived at ph 1.0 after 2 h), and such a high acid resistance property was a specific characteristic of this strain of l. johnsonii. when cultured with various virulent bacteria, l. johnsonii no. 1088 inhibited the growth of helicobacter pylori, escherichia coli o-157, salmonella typhimurium, and clostridium difficile, in which case its effectiveness was more potent than that of a type strain of l. johnsonii, jcm2012. in addition to its effect in vitro, l. johnsonii no. 1088 inhibited the growth of h. pylori in human intestinal microbiota-associated mice in both its live and lyophilized forms. moreover, l. johnsonii no. 1088 suppressed gastric acid secretion in mice via decreasing the number of gastrin-positive cells in the stomach. these results taken together suggest that l. johnsonii no. 1088 is a unique lactobacillus having properties beneficial for supporting h. pylori eradication by triple therapy including the use of a proton pump inhibitor (ppi) and also for prophylaxis of gastroesophageal reflux disease possibly caused after h. pylori eradication as a side effect of ppi.

TI  == effects of the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 on selected lactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria in co-culture.
AB  == enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 is used as a probiotic for piglets and has been  shown to modify the porcine intestinal microbiota. however, the mode of action of this probiotic modification is still unclear. one possible explanation is the direct growth inhibiting or stimulating effect of the probiotic on other indigenous bacteria. therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the growth interactions of the probiotic with different indigenous porcine bacteria in vitro. reference strains were cultivated with the probiotic e. faecium strain  ncimb10415 (sf68) in a checkerboard assay with 102 to 105 cells/ml inoculum per strain. growth kinetics were recorded for 8 h and used to determine specific growth of the co-cultures. additionally, total dna was extracted from the co-cultures at the end of the incubation to verify which strain in the co-culture was affected. co-cultivation with eight enterococcus spp. tester strains showed strain-specific growth differences. three of four e. faecium strains were not influenced by the probiotic strain. pcr results showed reduced growth of the probiotic strain in co-culture with e. faecium dsm 6177. three of four enterococcus faecalis strains showed reduced specific growth in co-culture with the probiotic strain. however, e. faecalis dsm 20478 impaired growth of the probiotic e. faecium strain. the growth of lactobacillus johnsonii dsm 10533 and  lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016 was enhanced in co-culture with the probiotic strain, but co-cultivations with lactobacillus mucosae dsm13345 or lactobacillus  amylovorus dsm10533 showed no differences. co-cultures with the probiotic e. faecium showed no impact on the growth rate of four different enterobacterial reference strains (2 strains of salmonella enterica and 2 strains of escherichia  coli), but pcr results showed reduced cell numbers for a pathogenic e. coli isolate at higher concentration of the probiotic strain. as the in vitro effect of the probiotic e. faecium on enterococci was strain specific and the growth of  certain lactobacillus spp. was enhanced by the probiotic, these results indicate  a direct effect of the probiotic on certain members of the porcine gastro intestinal microbiota.

TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the mucin-adhesion ability and probiotic potential of lactobacillus mucosae lm1.
AB  == aims: in this report, we characterized the probiotic potential of lactobacillus mucosae lm1, focusing on its in vitro mucin-adhesion abilities. methods and results: screening assays were used to evaluate lm1. previous studies on lact. mucosae species have been performed, but few have examined the ability of this species to adhere to and colonize the intestinal mucosa. thus, adhesion, aggregation and pathogen inhibition assays of lm1 along with microbial adhesion to solvents (mats) assay were carried out in comparison with another putative probiotic, lactobacillus johnsonii pf01, and the commercial strain, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. based on mats assay, the cell surfaces of the lactobacilli strains  were found to be hydrophobic and highly electron-donating, but the average hydropathy (gravy) index of predicted surface-exposed proteins in the lm1 genome  indicated that most were hydrophilic. lm1 showed the highest adhesion, aggregation and hydrophobicity among the strains tested and significantly inhibited the adhesion of escherichia coli k88 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium kccm 40253. correlations among adhesion, aggregation and hydrophobicity, as well as between coaggregation and displacement of e. coli, were observed. conclusions: increased adhesion may not always correlate with increased pathogen inhibition due to various strain-specific mechanisms. nevertheless, lm1 has promising probiotic properties that can be explored further using a genomics approach. significance and impact of the study: our data on adhesion of lm1 strain showed a significant correlation between adhesion, hydrophobicity of cell surface and autoaggregation. this study gives basic knowledge for the elucidation of the adhesion mechanism of lactobacillus sp. and  prediction of its adherence in specific host models.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == expression and delivery of an endolysin to combat clostridium perfringens.
AB  == clostridium perfringens is a cause for increasing concern due to its responsibility for severe infections both in humans and animals, especially poultry. to find new control strategies to treat c. perfringens infection, we investigated the activity and delivery of a bacteriophage endolysin. we identified a new endolysin, designated cp25l, which shows similarity to an n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase domain and is distinct from other c. perfringens endolysins whose activity has been demonstrated in vitro. the cp25l gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the gene product demonstrated lytic activity against all 25 c. perfringens strains tested. the probiotic strain lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 was engineered to deliver the endolysin to the gastrointestinal tract. the integration of the nisrk two-component regulatory system from the lactococcus lactis nisin a biosynthesis  operon into the chromosome of l. johnsonii allowed constitutive expression of the endolysin under the control of the nisa promoter (p nisa ), while the use of a signal peptide (slpmod) led to successful secretion of the active endolysin to the surrounding media. the high specificity and activity of the endolysin suggest that it may be developed as an effective tool to enhance the control of c. perfringens by l. johnsonii in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == molecular cloning, characterization and comparison of bile salt hydrolases from lactobacillus johnsonii pf01.
AB  == aims: to clone, characterize and compare the bile salt hydrolase (bsh) genes of lactobacillus johnsonii pf01. methods and results: the bsh genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using specific oligonucleotide primers, and the products were inserted into the pet21b expression vector. escherichia coli blr (de3) cells were transformed with pet21b vectors containing the bsh genes and induced using 0.1 mmol l(-1) isopropylthiolgalactopyranoside. the overexpressed bsh enzymes were purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (ni(2+) -nta) agarose column and their activities characterized. bsh a hydrolysed tauro-conjugated bile salts optimally at ph 5.0 and 55 degrees c, whereas bsh c hydrolysed glyco-conjugated bile salts optimally at ph 5.0 and 70 degrees c. the  enzymes had no preferential activities towards a specific cholyl moiety. conclusions: bsh enzymes vary in their substrate specificities and characteristics to broaden its activity. despite the lack of conservation in their putative substrate-binding sites, these remain functional through motif conservation. significance and impact of the study: this is to our knowledge the  first report of isolation of bsh enzymes from a single strain, showing hydrolase  activity towards either glyco-conjugated or tauro-conjugated bile salts. future structural homology studies and site-directed mutagenesis of sites associated with substrate specificity may elucidate specificities of bsh enzymes.

TI  == probiotics in the management of inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review of intervention studies in adult patients.
AB  == introduction: mounting evidence suggests an important role for the intestinal microbiota in the chronic mucosal inflammation that occurs in inflammatory bowel  disease (ibd), and novel molecular approaches have further identified a dysbiosis in these patients. several mechanisms of action of probiotic products that may interfere with possible aetiological factors in ibd have been postulated. objective: our objective was to discuss the rationale for probiotics in ibd and to systematically review clinical intervention studies with probiotics in the management of ibd in adults. methods: a systematic search was performed in pubmed up to 1 october 2011, using defined keywords. only full-text papers in the english language addressing clinical outcomes in adult patients were included. the 41 eligible studies were categorized on disease type (ulcerative colitis [uc] with/without an ileo-anal pouch and crohn's disease [cd]) and disease activity. pooled odds ratios were only calculated per probiotic for a specific patient group when more than one randomized controlled trial was available. results: well designed randomized controlled trials supporting the application of probiotics in the management of ibd are still limited. meta-analyses could only be performed for a limited number of studies revealing overall risk ratios of 2.70 (95% ci 0.47, 15.33) for inducing remission in active uc with bifido-fermented milk versus placebo or no additive treatment (n = 2); 1.88 (95% ci 0.96, 3.67) for inducing remission in active uc with vsl#3 versus placebo (n = 2); 1.08 (95% ci 0.86, 1.37) for preventing relapses in inactive uc with escherichia coli nissle 1917 versus standard treatment (n = 3); 0.17 (95% ci 0.09, 0.33) for preventing relapses in inactive uc/ileo-anal pouch anastomosis (ipaa) patients with vsl#3 versus placebo; 1.21 (95% ci 0.57, 2.57) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in inactive cd with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg versus placebo (n = 2); and 0.93 (95% ci 0.63, 1.38) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in inactive cd with lactobacillus johnsonii versus placebo (n = 2). conclusion: further well designed studies based on intention-to-treat analyses by several independent research groups are still warranted to support the promising results for e. coli nissle in inactive uc and the multispecies product vsl#3 in active uc and inactive pouch patients. so far, no evidence is available to support the use of probiotics in cd. future studies should focus on specific disease subtypes and disease location. further insight into the aetiology of ibd and the mechanisms of probiotic strains will aid in selecting probiotic strains for specific disease entities and disease locations.

TI  == individual and co-operative roles of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the killing activity of enteric strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 against enteric, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated pathogens.
AB  == the mechanism underlying the killing activity of lactobacillus strains against bacterial pathogens appears to be multifactorial. here, we investigate the respective contributions of hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid in killing bacterial pathogens associated with the human vagina, urinary tract or intestine  by two hydrogen peroxide-producing strains. in co-culture, the human intestinal strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and human vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 strains killed enteric salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344, vaginal gardnerella vaginalis dsm 4944 and urinary tract escherichia coli cft073 pathogens. the cell-free culture supernatants (cfcss) produced the same reduction in sl1344, dsm 4944 and cft073 viability, whereas isolated bacteria had no effect. the killing activity of cfcss was heat-stable. in the presence of dulbecco's modified eagle's minimum essential medium inhibiting the lactic acid-dependent killing activity, cfcss were less effective at killing of the pathogens. catalase-treated cfcss displayed a strong decreased activity. tested alone, hydrogen peroxide triggered a concentration-dependent killing activity against all three pathogens. lactic acid alone developed a killing activity only  at concentrations higher than that present in cfcss. in the presence of lactic acid at a concentration present in lactobacillus cfcss, hydrogen peroxide displayed enhanced killing activity. collectively, these results demonstrate that for hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus strains, the main metabolites of lactobacillus, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, act co-operatively to kill enteric, vaginosis-associated and uropathogenic pathogens.

TI  == the first alpha-1,3-glucosidase from bacterial origin belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 31.
AB  == genome analysis of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc533 has been recently completed. one of its annotated genes, lj0569, encodes the protein having the conserved domain of glycoside hydrolase family 31. its homolog gene (ljag31) in l. johnsonii nbrc13952 was cloned and expressed using an escherichia coli expression system, resulting in poor production of recombinant ljag31 protein due to inclusion body formation. production of soluble recombinant ljag31 was improved with high concentration of nacl in medium, possible endogenous chaperone induction by benzyl alcohol, and over-expression of groes-groel chaperones. recombinant ljag31 was an alpha-glucosidase with broad substrate specificity toward both homogeneous and heterogeneous substrates. this enzyme displayed higher specificity (in terms of k(cat)/k(m)) toward nigerose, maltulose, and kojibiose than other natural substrates having an alpha-glucosidic linkage at the non-reducing end, which suggests that these sugars are candidates for prebiotics  contributing to the growth of l. johnsonii. to our knowledge, ljag31 is the first bacterial alpha-1,3-glucosidase to be characterized with a high k(cat)/k(m) value for nigerose [alpha-d-glcp-(1 --> 3)-d-glcp]. transglucosylation of 4-nitrophenyl alpha-d-glucopyranoside produced two 4-nitrophenyl disaccharides (4-nitrophenyl alpha-nigeroside and 4-nitrophenyl alpha-isomaltoside). these hydrolysis and transglucosylation properties of ljag31 are different from those of mold (acremonium implicatum) alpha-1,3-glucosidase of glycoside hydrolase family 31.

TI  == a mesocosm of lactobacillus johnsonii, bifidobacterium longum, and escherichia coli in the mouse gut.
AB  == the relative contribution of competition and cooperation at the microbe-microbe level is not well understood for the bacteria constituting the gut microbiota. the high number and variability of human gut commensals have hampered the analysis. to get some insight into the question how so many different bacterial species can coexist in the mammalian gut, we studied the interaction between three human gut commensals (escherichia coli k-12, lactobacillus johnsonii ncc533, and bifidobacterium longum ncc2705) in the intestine of gnotobiotic mice. the bacterial titers and their anatomical distribution were studied in the colonized mice. l. johnsonii achieved the highest cell counts in the stomach, while b. longum dominated the colon. the colon was also the intestinal location in which b. longum displayed the highest number of expressed genes, followed by the cecum and the small intestine. addition of further bacterial strains led to strikingly different results. a lactobacillus paracasei strain coexisted, while a second b. longum strain was excluded from the system. notably, this strain lacked an operon involved in the degradation, import, and metabolism of mannosylated glycans. subsequent introduction of the e. coli nissle strain resulted in the elimination of l. johnsonii ncc533 and e. coli k-12, while b. longum ncc2705 showed a transient decrease in population size, demonstrating the dynamic nature  of microbe-microbe interactions. the study of such simple interacting bacterial systems might help to derive some basic rules governing microbial ecology within  the mammalian gut.

TI  == the role of prophage for genome diversification within a clonal lineage of lactobacillus johnsonii: characterization of the defective prophage lj771.
AB  == two independent isolates of the gut commensal lactobacillus johnsonii were sequenced. these isolates belonged to the same clonal lineage and differed mainly by a 40.8-kb prophage, lj771, belonging to the sfi11 phage lineage. lj771 shares  close dna sequence identity with lactobacillus gasseri prophages. lj771 coexists  as an integrated prophage and excised circular phage dna, but phage dna packaged  into extracellular phage particles was not detected. between the phage lysin gene and attr a likely maze ("antitoxin")/pemk ("toxin") gene cassette was detected in lj771 but not in the l. gasseri prophages. expressed pemk could be cloned in escherichia coli only together with the maze gene. lj771 was shown to be highly stable and could be cured only by coexpression of maze from a plasmid. the prophage was integrated into the methionine sulfoxide reductase gene (msra) and complemented the 5' end of this gene, creating a protein with a slightly altered  n-terminal sequence. the two l. johnsonii strains had identical in vitro growth and in vivo gut persistence phenotypes. also, in an isogenic background, the presence of the prophage resulted in no growth disadvantage.

TI  == enolases from gram-positive bacterial pathogens and commensal lactobacilli share  functional similarity in virulence-associated traits.
AB  == enolase occurs as a cytoplasmic and a surface-associated protein in bacteria. enolases of the bacterial pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus, as well as of the commensal lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus johnsonii, were purified as his(6)-fusion proteins from recombinant escherichia coli. the fusion proteins were compared for putative virulence-associated functions, i.e., binding of human plasminogen, enhancement of plasminogen activation by human plasminogen activators, as well as binding to immobilized laminin, fibronectin and collagens. the individual enolases showed varying efficiencies in these functions. in particular, highly and equally effective interactions with plasminogen and laminin were seen with lactobacillar and staphylococcal enolases.

TI  == differential inflammatory mediator response in vitro from murine macrophages to lactobacilli and pathogenic intestinal bacteria.
AB  == chronic active colitis (including inflammatory bowel disease - ibd) is maintained by a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators. certain intestinal bacterial strains  may induce colitis, whereas some strains (e.g. lactobacillus spp.) show a protective effect in colitis owing to their anti-inflammatory activity. in this study, we have examined the production of selected inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ros), nitric oxide (no) and the expression of haeme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) by murine peritoneal macrophages stimulated in vitro by the intestinal bacterial strains, isolated from mice with colitis. lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus reuteri, l. johnsonii, l. animalis/murinus) and two potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis) induced the production of substantial amounts of cytokines with a strain specific profile. despite some interstrain differences, all lactobacilli induced production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-10(high), il-6(low), il-12p70(low)). conversely, e. faecalis and e. coli induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines (tnf-alpha, il-12p70), the cytokines essential for chronic ibd. macrophages released comparably substantial amounts of ros in response to all lactobacillus strains tested, while e. coli and e. faecalis ability to induce generation of ros was negligible. in contrast to ros, the production of no/no(2) (-) by macrophages activated with all bacterial strains tested was similar. moreover, for the first time, it has been shown that intestinal bacteria differed in their ability to induce expression of ho-1, a stress-inducible enzyme with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. the beneficial immunoregulatory properties of candidate probiotic bacteria for the treatment of ibd are discussed.

TI  == adhesive and chemokine stimulatory properties of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains.
AB  == five lactobacillus plantarum strains and two lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from african traditionally fermented milk products or children's  feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. the relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to ht29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the l. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to ht29 cells. four l. plantarum and two l. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to ht29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. the two l. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the  intestinal pathogens listeria monocytogenes scott a, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028. the l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with ht29 cells in a strain-dependent way. these two potential probiotic strains  also significantly increased interleukin-8 (il-8) chemokine production by ht29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as il-1, il-6, il-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta), did not occur. altogether, our results suggested that l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii bfe 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains.

TI  == the effect of calcium ions on adhesion and competitive exclusion of lactobacillus ssp. and e. coli o138.
AB  == the adhesion abilities of 11 strains of lactobacillus were determined in vitro using the ipec-j2 cell line as a model system. bacteria cultures included the probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri atcc 55730, l. johnsonii ncc 533 and l. reuteri dsm 12246, and new isolates of lactobacillus ssp. adhesion was quantified by scintillation counting of radiolabelled bound bacteria. the highest adhesion of 38%, was determined for l. reuteri dsm 12246 followed by l. plantarum q47 with an adhesion level of 24%. other strains showed moderate to low binding of less than 16%. competitive adhesion experiments on ipec-j2 cells demonstrated  that strongly adhesive strains, as l. reuteri dsm 12246 and l. plantarum q47, significantly reduced the attachment of the less adhesive strains, such as l. rhamnosus gg and l. johnsonii ncc 533, both under condition of co-incubation and  in displacement assays, indicating that bacteria may share the same binding sites for attachment to intestinal cells. furthermore, it was revealed that calcium ions significantly increased the binding of tested lactobacilli to ipec-j2 cells; and therefore, added calcium may be useful in enhancing the adhesion of normally  weakly adhesive probiotic cultures. in contrast, no significant change in adhesion of lactobacilli was observed in the presence of mg and zn ions. displacement assays performed with pathogenic e. coli o138 showed that all tested lactobacillus strains reduced the attachment of e. coli o138 to ipec-j2 by more than 2-fold both in the presence and the absence of calcium ions. the strains of  lactobacillus did not differ significantly in the extent of their inhibition of e. coli o138 adhesion, indicating that the reduced adhesion of e. coli o138 was due to steric hindrance of the binding sites rather than to specific interactions.

AB  == oral infection of susceptible mice with toxoplasma gondii results in th1-type immunopathology in the ileum. we investigated gut flora changes during ileitis and determined contributions of gut bacteria to intestinal inflammation. analysis of the intestinal microflora revealed that ileitis was accompanied by increasing  bacterial load, decreasing species diversity, and bacterial translocation. gram-negative bacteria identified as escherichia coli and bacteroides/prevotella  spp. accumulated in inflamed ileum at high concentrations. prophylactic or therapeutic administration of ciprofloxacin and/or metronidazole ameliorated ileal immunopathology and reduced intestinal no and ifn-gamma levels. most strikingly, gnotobiotic mice in which cultivable gut bacteria were removed by quintuple antibiotic treatment did not develop ileitis after toxoplasma gondii infection. a reduction in total numbers of lymphocytes was observed in the lamina propria of specific pathogen-free (spf), but not gnotobiotic, mice upon development of ileitis. relative numbers of cd4(+) t cells did not differ in naive vs infected gnotobiotic or spf mice, but infected spf mice showed a significant increase in the frequencies of activated cd4(+) t cells compared with gnotobiotic mice. furthermore, recolonization with total gut flora, e. coli, or bacteroides/prevotella spp., but not lactobacillus johnsonii, induced immunopathology in gnotobiotic mice. animals recolonized with e. coli and/or total gut flora, but not l. johnsonii, showed elevated ileal no and/or ifn-gamma  levels. in conclusion, gram-negative bacteria, i.e., e. coli, aggravate pathogen-induced intestinal th1-type immunopathology. thus, pathogen-induced acute ileitis may prove useful to study bacteria-host interactions in small intestinal inflammation and to test novel therapies based on modulation of gut flora.

TI  == groel of lactobacillus johnsonii la1 (ncc 533) is cell surface associated: potential role in interactions with the host and the gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori.
AB  == heat shock proteins of the groel or hsp60 class are highly conserved proteins essential to all living organisms. even though groel proteins are classically considered intracellular proteins, they have been found at the surface of several mucosal pathogens and have been implicated in cell attachment and immune modulation. the purpose of the present study was to investigate the groel protein of a gram-positive probiotic bacterium, lactobacillus johnsonii la1 (ncc 533). its presence at the bacterial surface was demonstrated using a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and could be detected in bacterial spent culture medium by immunoblotting. to assess binding of la1 groel to mucins and intestinal epithelial cells, the la1 groel protein was expressed in escherichia coli. we report here that la1 recombinant groel (rgroel) binds to mucins and epithelial cells and that this binding is ph dependent. immunomodulation studies  showed that la1 rgroel stimulates interleukin-8 secretion in macrophages and ht29 cells in a cd14-dependent mechanism. this property is common to rgroel from other gram-positive bacteria but not to the rgroel of the gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori. in addition, la1 rgroel mediates the aggregation of h. pylori but not that of other intestinal pathogens. our in vitro results suggest that groel proteins from la1 and other lactic acid bacteria might play a role in gastrointestinal homeostasis due to their ability to bind to components of the gastrointestinal mucosa and to aggregate h. pylori.

TI  == identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from lactobacillus fermentum br11.
AB  == screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole lactobacillus fermentum br11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kda protein. analysis of the 3010-bp dna insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (orfs). one orf encodes lysa,  a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages lj928 and lj965 from lactobacillus johnsonii and lp1 and lp2 from  lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phiadh. the immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated orf downstream of lysa which has similarity to glutamyl-trna synthetases. the n-terminus of lysa has sequence similarity with n-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the c-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial sh3b domains. c-terminal bacterial  sh3b domains were identified in the majority of lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. lysa was expressed in escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different lactobacillus species and against lactococcus lactis, streptococci and  staphylococcus aureus. it was found that lysa is 2 and 8000 times more active against l. fermentum than l. lactis and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.

TI  == expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  == in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant  enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid,  psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the  gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == cbst2 from lactobacillus johnsonii 100-100 is a transport protein of the major facilitator superfamily that facilitates bile acid antiport.
AB  == we previously identified two conjugated bile acid transporters, cbst1 and cbst2,  in lactobacillus johnsonii 100-100 and lactobacillus acidophilus ks-13 that are gene duplicates encoded in tandem with a conjugated bile salt hydrolase (bsh) [elkins and savage, j. bacteriol. 180:4344-4349, 1998; elkins et al., microbiology 147: 3403-3412, 2001]. cbst2 from 100-100 was shown to increase taurocholic acid (tca) uptake in escherichia coli; however, higher levels were achieved when an extracellular factor (ef) from 100-100 was present in the assay  medium (spent medium from 100-100, ph 4.2). we continued this study here to determine the role of ef in this transport system. kinetic studies revealed that  the previously observed cbst2- and ef-mediated tca accumulation is rapid (< 15 s) but not saturable, suggesting that ef is limiting. in addition, uptake of tca by  e. coli expressing cbst2 was insensitive to ionophores, 2,4-dinitrophenol and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and thus, is independent of the proton  motive force. since bsh converts [24-(14)c]tca to [24-(14)c]cholic acid (ca), we  measured net radiolabel uptake in e. coli cells expressing transporter(s) and bsh. interestingly, such cells accumulated less 14c radiolabel (by approximately  half) than cells expressing cbst2 alone. these data can be explained if ca diffuses out of e. coli through the transporter(s). we, therefore, added exogenous, unlabeled ca to ef-spent media, which under our assay conditions, performed similarly to ef+ culture supernatant in tca and ca uptake assays. thus, unlabeled ca (a protonated, neutral lipophile) can partition directly into e. coli cells especially at low ph. these findings were validated in uptake assays with [3h]tca, which yields [3h]taurine (a hydrophilic moiety) upon hydrolysis by  the bsh. amounts of cell-associated 3h radiolabel remained similar in cells expressing cbst2 and bsh versus cells expressing only cbst2, both of which were higher than in cells expressing bsh alone. our data support a hypothesis that these transporters, which comprise a new subfamily of the major facilitator superfamily, facilitate antiport of tca and ca.

TI  == in vivo characterization of lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 for use as a defined competitive exclusion agent against bacterial pathogens in poultry.
AB  == aims: to test the efficacy of lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 in reducing the colonization and shedding of salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis, escherichia coli o78:k80 and clostridium perfringens in poultry. methods and results: specific pathogen-free chicks (1 day old) were dosed with a single oral  inoculum of 1x10(9) cfu. lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 and 24 h later were challenged in separate experiments with s. enteritidis (s1400, nalr) and e. coli  o78:k80 (ec34195, nalr). there were no significant effects against s. enteritidis whereas colonization of the small intestine by e. coli o78:k80 was reduced significantly. both s. enteritidis and e. coli colonized the caeca and colon to levels equivalent to control birds and there was no reduction in shedding as assessed by a semi-quantitative cloacal swabbing technique. specific pathogen-free chicks (20 day old) were dosed with a single oral inoculum of 1x10(9) cfu l. johnsonii fi9785 and 24 h later were challenged with c. perfringens. a single oral dose of l. johnsonii fi9785 was sufficient to suppress all aspects of colonization and persistence of c. perfringens. conclusions: lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 may be given to poultry for use as a competitive exclusion agent to control c. perfringens. significance and impact of the study:  lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 may be a valuable tool to control the endemic disease of necrotic enteritis, thereby reducing economic losses associated with reduced use of antimicrobials in the poultry industry.

TI  == binding of extracellular matrix molecules by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to investigate extracellular matrix (ecm) and mucin binding of selected bacterial isolates with probiotic features in comparison with commercially used probiotic bacteria. methods and results: ecm molecules were immobilized in microtitre plates (mucin and fetuin) or on the surface of latex beads. porcine mucin was bound by all 13 probiotic strains tested with important inter-strain differences; however, fetuin binding was similar (weak) for all 14 strains tested. strongly positive (three) binding of bovine fibrinogen was expressed by strains from fermented food (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota and l. johnsonii la1) as well as by l. casei l.c., lactobacillus sp. 2i3 and by l. plantarum lp. the other strains expressed moderate (2) or weakly positive (1) binding of bovine fibrinogen. strongly positive (3) binding of porcine fibronectin was observed only with two strains; however, all other strains also bound this molecule. bovine lactoferrin was bound to a higher extent than transferrins. significance and impact of the study: some  animal strains (at least l. casei l.c. and lactobacillus sp. 2i3) are comparable  with the commercially used strains with respect to their ecm binding ability. as  this feature is important for probiotic bacteria to be able to colonize intestine, these strains should be considered for their wider use in fermented feed (or probiotic preparations) for animals.

TI  == lipoteichoic acids from lactobacillus johnsonii strain la1 and lactobacillus acidophilus strain la10 antagonize the responsiveness of human intestinal epithelial ht29 cells to lipopolysaccharide and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == intestinal epithelial cells (iecs) respond to lipopolysaccharide (lps) from gram-negative bacteria in the presence of the soluble form of cd14 (scd14), a major endotoxin receptor. since scd14 is also known to interact with gram-positive bacteria and their components, we looked at whether scd14 could mediate their effects on human iecs. to this end, we examined the production of proinflammatory cytokines following exposure of the iecs to specific gram-positive bacteria or their lipoteichoic acids (ltas) in the absence and presence of human milk as a source of scd14. in contrast to lps from escherichia  coli or salmonella enteritidis, neither the gram-positive bacteria lactobacillus  johnsonii strain la1 and lactobacillus acidophilus strain la10 nor their ltas stimulated iecs, even in the presence of scd14. however, both ltas inhibited the  scd14-mediated lps responsiveness of iecs. we have previously hypothesized that scd14 in human milk is a means by which the neonate gauges the bacterial load in  the intestinal lumen and liberates protective proinflammatory cytokines from iecs. the present observations suggest that gram-positive organisms, via their ltas, temper this response and prevent an exaggerated inflammatory response.

TI  == non-pathogenic bacteria elicit a differential cytokine response by intestinal epithelial cell/leucocyte co-cultures.
AB  == background and aim: intestinal epithelial cells (iec) are thought to participate  in the mucosal defence against bacteria and in the regulation of mucosal tissue homeostasis. reactivity of iec to bacterial signals may depend on interactions with immunocompetent cells. to address the question of whether non-pathogenic bacteria modify the immune response of the intestinal epithelium, we co-cultivated enterocyte-like caco-2 cells with human blood leucocytes in separate compartments of transwell cultures. methods: caco-2/pbmc co-cultures were stimulated with non-pathogenic bacteria and enteropathogenic escherichia coli. expression of tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), interleukin (il)-1beta, il-8, monocyte chemoattracting protein 1 (mcp-1), and il-10 was studied by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (cytokine secretion) and by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. results: challenge of caco-2 cells with non-pathogenic e coli and lactobacillus sakei induced expression of il-8, mcp-1, il-1beta, and tnf-alpha mrna in the presence of underlying leucocytes. leucocyte sensitised caco-2 cells produced tnf-alpha and il-1beta whereas il-10 was exclusively secreted by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. caco-2 cells alone remained hyporesponsive to the bacterial challenge. lactobacillus johnsonii, an intestinal isolate, showed reduced potential to induce proinflammatory cytokines but increased transforming growth factor beta mrna in leucocyte sensitised caco-2 cells. tnf-alpha was identified as one of the early mediators involved in cellular cross talk. in the presence of leucocytes, discriminative activation of caco-2 cells was observed between enteropathogenic e coli and non-pathogenic bacteria. conclusion: the differential recognition of non-pathogenic bacteria by caco-2 cells required the presence of underlying leucocytes. these results strengthen the hypothesis that bacterial signalling at the mucosal surface is dependent on a network of cellular interactions.

TI  == activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by nonpathogenic bacteria  in vitro: evidence of nk cells as primary targets.
AB  == the interaction of commensal bacteria with immunocompetent cells may occur in definite compartments of the mucosal immune system, as limited translocation through the epithelial barrier cannot be excluded. in this study the stimulation  of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified lymphocyte subsets by nonpathogenic gram-positive lactobacilli (lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus sakei) and gram-negative escherichia coli was investigated. the various bacterial strains induced a differential cytokine pattern. whereas l. johnsonii and l. sakei strongly induced gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) and interleukin-12 (il-12), e. coli and lipopolysaccharide (lps) preferentially induced il-10 after 16 h of stimulation. expression of activation antigens cd69 and cd25 was observed on (cd3(-) cd56(+)) natural killer (nk) cells after stimulation of total human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. all bacteria mediated the proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the strongest proliferative response was observed with l. johnsonii. purified cd4(+), cd8(+), and cd19(+) lymphocyte subsets were not activated upon bacterial stimulation but showed normal response to a mitogenic stimulus. in contrast, purified nk cells upregulated the il-2ralpha chain (cd25) and underwent proliferation when stimulated by l. johnsonii. e. coli and lps were less effective in inducing proliferation. expression of cd25 or secretion of ifn-gamma from purified nk cells was significantly increased in the presence of bacterially primed macrophages, indicating that full activation required both bacterium- and  cell contact-based signals derived from accessory cells.

TI  == d-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhd) inactivation and resulting metabolic effects  in the lactobacillus johnsonii strains la1 and n312.
AB  == lactobacillus johnsonii la1, a probiotic bacterium with demonstrated health effects, grows in milk, where it ferments lactose to d- and l-lactate in a 60:40% ratio. the d-lactate dehydrogenase (d-ldh) gene (ldhd) of this strain was isolated, and an in vitro-truncated copy of that gene was used to inactivate the  genomic copy in two strains, la1 and n312, by gene replacement. for that, an 8-bp deletion was generated within the cloned ldhd gene to inactivate its function. the plasmid containing the altered ldhd was transferred to l. johnsonii via conjugative comobilization with lactococcus lactis carrying pambeta1. crossover integrations of the plasmid at the genomic ldhd site were selected, and appropriate resolution of the cointegrate structures resulted in mutants that had lost the plasmid and in which the original ldhd was replaced by the truncated copy. these mutants completely lacked d-ldh activity. nevertheless, the lower remaining l-ldh activity of the cells was sufficient to reroute most of the accumulating pyruvate to l-lactate. only a marginal increase in production of the secondary end products acetaldehyde, diacetyl, and acetoin was observed. it can be concluded that in l. johnsonii d- and l-ldh are present in substantial excess  for their role to eliminate pyruvate and regenerate nad(+) and that accumulated pyruvate is therefore not easily redirected in high amounts to secondary metabolic routes.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a fermented milk product containing lactobacillus johnsonii la1 (formerly known as lactobacillus acidophilus la1) on the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy adult volunteers. furthermore, we sought to define the effective doses of the bacteria, examine the effect on respiratory burst activity, and, finally, examine the contribution made by the starter culture to the biological effects. volunteers were randomly distributed among three groups; each subject received one pot (150 ml) of fermented milk each day for 3 wk. the first two groups received a freshly prepared product fermented by streptococcus thermophilus (group a) alone or s. thermophilus and 10(7) cfu/ml l. johnsonii la1 (group b). group c received a product stored for a period of 21 to 28 d and that contained s. thermophilus and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. johnsonii la1. ingestion of l. johnsonii la1 did not significantly increase fecal lactobacilli counts. however, l. johnsonii la1 was able to survive intestinal transit and was only recovered from  the feces of the volunteers of groups b and c. the fermented base alone showed a  weak effect on respiratory burst but not on phagocytic activity. however, the product containing 10(7) cfu/ml l. johnsonii la1 significantly enhanced both functions. the product containing 10(6) cfu/ml of l. johnsonii la1 had no significant effect on either function. these results suggest that fecal persistence may not necessarily reflect in vivo colonization and may not be a prerequisite for all forms of immune reactivity.

TI  == identification of genes encoding conjugated bile salt hydrolase and transport in  lactobacillus johnsonii 100-100.
AB  == cytosolic extracts of lactobacillus johnsonii 100-100 (previously reported as lactobacillus sp. strain 100-100) contain four heterotrimeric isozymes composed of two peptides, alpha and beta, with conjugated bile salt hydrolase (bsh) activity. we now report cloning, from the genome of strain 100-100, a 2,977-bp dna segment that expresses bsh activity in escherichia coli. the sequencing of this segment showed that it contained one complete and two partial open reading frames (orfs). the 3' partial orf (927 nucleotides) was predicted by blast and confirmed with 5' and 3' deletions to be a bsh gene. thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr was used to extend and complete the 948-nucleotide sequence of the bsh gene 3' of the cloned segment. the predicted amino acid sequence of the 5' partial orf (651 nucleotides) was about 80% similar to the c-terminal half of the largest, complete orf (1,353 nucleotides), and these two putative proteins were similar to several amine, multidrug resistance, and sugar transport proteins of the major facilitator superfamily. e. coli dh5alpha cells transformed with a construct containing these orfs, in concert with an extracellular factor produced by strain 100-100, demonstrated levels of uptake of [14c]taurocholic acid that were increased as much as threefold over control levels. [14c]cholic acid was taken up in similar amounts by strain dh5alpha psporti (control) and dh5alpha p2000 (transport clones). these findings support a hypothesis that the orfs are conjugated bile salt transport genes which may be arranged in an operon with bsh  genes.

TI  == positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
AB  == lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned  the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.

TI  == molecular analysis of the lactacin f operon.
AB  == lactacin f is a nonlantibiotic, heat-stable, peptide bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus johnsonii vpi11088. molecular analysis of the lactacin f dna region characterized a small operon that codes for three open reading frames, designated lafa, lafx, and orfz. the peptide encoded by lafa, the lactacin f structural gene, was compared with various peptide bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria, and similarities were identified in the amino and carboxy termini of the propeptides. site-directed mutagenesis of the lafa precursor at the two glycine residues in positions -1 and -2 defined an essential motif for processing of mature lactacin f. the involvement of the peptides encoded by lafx and orfz in bacteriocin expression was investigated by subcloning various fragments from the  lactacin f region into the shuttle vector pgkv210. in addition to lafa, expression of lafx is essential to lactacin f activity. the lactacin f operon resembles the genetic organization of lactococcin m. although no function has been assigned to orfz by genetic analysis, both peptide z and the lactococcin m immunity protein are predicted to be integral membrane proteins with four putative transmembrane segments. lactacin f activity, defined by bactericidal action on lactobacillus delbrueckii, is dependent on the expression of two genes, lafa and lafx.
