TI  == nitazoxanide inhibits biofilm formation by staphylococcus epidermidis by blocking accumulation on surfaces.
AB  == coagulase-negative species of staphylococcus are often associated with opportunistic hospital-acquired infections that arise from the colonization of indwelling catheters. here we show that the antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide (ntz) and its active metabolite, tizoxanide (tiz), are inhibitory to the growth of staphylococcus epidermidis and other staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, under aerobic and microaerobic conditions (mics, 8 to 16 microg/ml). at sub-mic levels, ntz and tiz also inhibited biofilm production under static conditions by strains of s. epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus with a 50% inhibitory concentration of approximately 2.5 microg/ml (8 microm). the 5-nitro group was required for biological activity, and a hydrophilic derivative of ntz (amix) also inhibited biofilm formation. ntz did not disperse the existing biofilm but did block further accumulation. sub-mics of ntz had no effect on primary attachment to surfaces at either 4 or 37 degrees c. the inhibitory action of ntz and tiz, but not vancomycin, on biofilm production could be reversed by the addition of zinc salts (2.5 to 40 microm) but not other metals, suggesting that ntz might target the zinc-dependent accumulation-associated protein (aap) that mediates accumulation on surfaces. however, neither ntz nor tiz formed chelation complexes with zinc salts, based on spectrophotometric and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses, and addition of excess zinc to ntz-grown bacteria (apo-aap) did not restore the accumulation phenotype. our studies suggest that sub-mic levels of ntz may affect the assembly or function of cell structures associated with the biofilm phenotype.

TI  == in vitro activities of rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32  times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than  methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428  had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.

TI  == mechanisms of action of quinolones against staphylococci and relationship with their in vitro bactericidal activity.
AB  == ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin exhibited mechanism a (requires cell division as well as bacterial protein and rna synthesis to kill bacteria) and c (active against nondividing bacteria but requires protein and rna synthesis) against the  reference strain staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, yet only mechanism a was exhibited by these fluoroquinolones when tested against three clinical isolates:  s. aureus sa-215, staphylococcus epidermidis se-81 and staphylococcus haemolyticus sx-1. on the contrary, fleroxacin exerted mechanism a and c against  the three clinical isolates but only mechanism a against the reference strain. ofloxacin displayed mechanism a against s. epidermidis se-81, mechanism a and c against s. haemolyticus and mechanism a and b (active against nondividing bacteria and does not require protein and rna synthesis) against the two s. aureus tested. sparfloxacin showed mechanism a and c against the four staphylococcus species studied, and temafloxacin was the only fluoroquinolone tested that exhibited mechanism a and b against the four bacterial strains assayed. no correlation was found between the in vitro bactericidal activity (expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration and optimal bactericidal concentration) and the mechanisms of action exhibited by these fluoroquinolones.

TI  == synergistic hemolytic activity of staphylococcus lugdunensis is mediated by three peptides encoded by a non-agr genetic locus.
AB  == some strains of the coagulase-negative staphylococcus lugdunensis produce a synergistic hemolytic activity (slush), phenotypically similar to the delta-hemolysin of s. aureus. reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography of supernatants from s. lugdunensis 307 yielded three late-eluting peaks of 3.5 kda with synergistic hemolytic activity. a degenerate oligonucleotide probe was designed from partial amino acid sequences of the 23-amino-acid (aa) tryptic fragments from one of the three peaks and hybridized to a single 2.8-kb hindiii chromosomal fragment. the relevant portion of this fragment was cloned by pcr, and sequencing showed the presence of three related open reading frames (orfs), slush-a, slush-b, and slush-c, preceded by an unrelated short potentially coding  sequence (orf-x), cotranscribed on a polycistronic 838-nucleotide mrna. the amino acid sequences of the peptides from the three peaks align perfectly with the predicted sequences from the three slush orfs (peak i = slush-b; peak ii = slush-c; peak iii = slush-a). these three peptides are closely related (amino acid homology, >76%) and do not show significant homology to s. aureus delta-hemolysin but do resemble a salmonella typhimurium invasin and the "gonococcal growth inhibitor," a bacteriocin secreted by staphylococcus haemolyticus. the predicted orf-x gene product is a 24-aa peptide with no homology to the slush peptides.

TI  == biomaterial-associated staphylococcal peritoneal infections in a neutropaenic mouse model.
AB  == adhesion of staphylococcal cells to polyethylene with end point-attached heparin  was quantified by bioluminescence. staphylococcus epidermidis 3380 and the slime-producing s. epidermidis rp12 adhered to the highest extent, and s. lugdunensis 2342 to the least extent. preincubation of the polymer with dialysis  fluid reduced adhesion of s. epidermidis 3380 and rp12 but enhanced that of s. aureus, and preadsorption of the surface with fibronectin decreased subsequent adhesion of s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus strains. when staphylococci were grown in the presence of a biomaterial their ability to activate peritoneal cells was decreased. the bactericidal activity was impaired, whereas ingestion of opsonized coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) strains was unaffected. with s.  epidermidis rp12 the presence of biomaterial did not influence either phagocytosis or bactericidal effect of peritoneal cells. after intra-peritoneal challenge with staphylococcal strains, the organ uptake of s. aureus cowan 1 was  increased in normal mice whereas immunosuppressed mice died. cns strains increased mainly in the peritoneal cavity of immunosuppressed mice. the uptake of bacteria in liver and kidneys was increased with s. epidermidis 3380, s. lugdunensis 2343 and s. schleiferi 667-88. generally, cns strains persisted in the peritoneal cavity of both normal and immunosuppressed mice. these data indicate that host defense mechanisms, mainly polymorphonuclear neutrophils, fail to eliminate cns infections in the peritoneum, and that initial adhesion to an implanted biomaterial may be of lesser importance in the peritoneal cavity than in e.g. catheter-associated infections. there are strain-specific virulence factors of bacteria, and slime producing strains evade the host defense mechanisms more efficiently than non-slime producing strains.

TI  == vitronectin and type-i collagen binding by staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  == binding of 125i-labelled type-i collagen and 125i-labelled vitronectin (human serum spreading factor or s-protein) was studied using staphylococcus aureus and  coagulase-negative staphylococci of different species. binding of collagen and vitronectin was time dependent for s. aureus isp 546, and s. haemolyticus e 2498/86. co-operative binding of vitronectin and collagen by staphylococcal cells was demonstrated. binding to s. haemolyticus e 2498/86 was more rapid and was enhanced in vitronectin/collagen mixtures than for either protein separately. furthermore, pre-incubation of staphylococcal cells with unlabelled collagen enhanced vitronectin binding. when cells of s. haemolyticus e 2498/86 were treated with pronase e, proteinase k, subtilopeptidase a or trypsin, vitronectin-binding was decreased by 50% or more, whereas collagen-binding was protease resistant. for the strains of s. aureus tested, both vitronectin and collagen binding were found to be protease sensitive. type-i collagen peptides inhibited collagen-binding to s. haemolyticus e 2498/86, whereas vitronectin-binding was not affected perhaps indicating different receptors for these proteins. the binding of both collagen and vitronectin was shown to be reversible, since bound 125i-collagen and 125i-vitronectin were displaced after adding excess of the homologous protein.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in nosocomial isolates of staphylococcus haemolyticus.
AB  == staphylococcus haemolyticus is frequently cultured from hospitalized patients and is characterized by resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. we found that s. haemolyticus represented 70 of 524 (13%) coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates identified by the clinical microbiology laboratories of two hospitals over 2 months. s. haemolyticus isolates were recovered from wounds (44%), urine (26%), blood (10%), and other sources (20%). all s. haemolyticus isolates were tested for susceptibility to six antimicrobial agents; 77% were resistant to three or more agents, and 41% were resistant to five or six agents. in addition,  among 47 multiply resistant isolates, high mics (greater than or equal to 6.25 micrograms/ml) of vancomycin (62% of isolates) and teicoplanin (91% of isolates)  were found. dna probes which were derived from s. epidermidis or s. aureus and which contained sequences associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents were used to detect specific genes in the total cellular and plasmid dnas of 10 resistant s. haemolyticus isolates. resistance gene probes and the numbers of resistant isolates hybridizing were as follows: methicillin, 10 of 10; gentamicin, 9 of 10; erythromycin, 7 of 10; and trimethoprim, 0 of 10. genes for  resistance to methicillin were found only in chromosomal locations, genes for resistance to gentamicin were found in both chromosomal and plasmid locations, and genes for resistance to erythromycin were found in plasmid locations only. with the exception of trimethoprim resistance determinants, similar genes were found among concurrently isolated multiply resistant s. epidermidis isolates from our hospitals. s. haemolyticus is a potentially important nosocomial species which readily acquires antimicrobial resistance genes and which shares, to some extent, in a common gene pool with s. epidermidis.
