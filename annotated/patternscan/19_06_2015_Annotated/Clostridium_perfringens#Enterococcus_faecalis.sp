TI  == anaerobic bacteria grow within candida albicans biofilms and induce biofilm formation in suspension cultures.
AB  == the human microbiome contains diverse microorganisms, which share and compete for the same environmental niches. a major microbial growth form in the human body is the biofilm state, where tightly packed bacterial, archaeal, and fungal cells must cooperate and/or compete for resources in order to survive. we examined mixed biofilms composed of the major fungal species of the gut microbiome, candida albicans, and each of five prevalent bacterial gastrointestinal inhabitants: bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. we observed that biofilms formed by c. albicans provide a hypoxic microenvironment that supports the growth of two anaerobic bacteria, even when cultured in ambient oxic conditions that are normally toxic to the bacteria. we also found that coculture with bacteria in biofilms induces massive gene expression changes in c. albicans, including upregulation of wor1, which encodes a transcription regulator that controls a phenotypic switch in c. albicans, from the "white" cell type to the "opaque" cell type. finally, we observed that in suspension cultures, c. perfringens induces aggregation of c. albicans into "mini-biofilms," which allow c. perfringens cells to survive in a normally toxic environment. this work indicates that bacteria and c. albicans interactions modulate the local chemistry of their environment in multiple ways to create niches favorable to their growth and survival.

TI  == essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of angelica archangelica l.  (apiaceae) roots.
AB  == in this paper, the chemical composition and the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of angelica archangelica l. (apiaceae) roots from central italy were analyzed. the major constituents of the oil were alpha-pinene (21.3%), delta-3-carene (16.5%), limonene (16.4%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.7%). the oil shows a good antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, eubacterium limosum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of 0.25, 0.25, 0.13, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50% v/v, respectively. a weaker antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli-very useful in the intestinal microflora-has also been shown with mic values >4.0% v/v.

TI  == synergistic antibacterial effect of honey and herba ocimi basilici against some bacterial pathogens.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the combination of different honey brands and methanolic fraction of herba ocimi basilici using agar well diffusion assay. methods: the antibacterial activity was determined against thirteen pathogenic bacterial clinical isolates including six gram negative (klebsiella pneumonia, pseudomonas aeroginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, salmonella typhimirium, xanthomonas campestris) and six gram positive strains (enterococcus faecalis faecalis, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens type c, clostridium perfringens type d, clostridium chauvoei). agar well diffusion method was used while zones of inhibition were measured with vernier scale. results: at higher concentration, all the honey brands showed good to significant activity. the highest activity was observed for hamdard brand honey (27.60 +/- 0.40) against enterococcus faecalis. conclusion: these results revealed that combinations of plant extracts  of herba ocimi basilici with honey can be used for the development of potent and  novel antibacterial agents.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == technological properties of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from pico cheese an artisanal cow's milk cheese.
AB  == aim: evaluate technologically relevant properties from bacteriocin-producing strains to use as starter/adjunct cultures in cheese making. methods and results: eight isolates obtained from pico cheese produced in azores (portugal) were found to produce bacteriocins against listeria monocytogenes and three isolates against clostridium perfringens. they were identified as lactococcus lactis and enterococcus faecalis and submitted to technological tests: growth at different conditions of temperature and salt, acid production, proteolysis, lipolysis, coexistence, enzymatic profile and autolytic capacity. safety evaluation was performed by evaluating haemolytic, gelatinase and dnase activity, resistance to  antibiotics and the presence of virulence genes. some isolates presented good technological features such as high autolytic activity, acid and diacetyl production. lactococcus lactis was negative for all virulence genes tested and inhibit the growth of all lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates. enterococci were positive for the presence of some virulence genes, but none of the isolates were  classified as resistant to important antibiotics. conclusions: the bacteriocin-producing lc. lactis present good potential for application in food as adjunct culture in cheese production. the study also reveals good technological features for some enterococcus isolates. significance and impact of the study: bacteriocin-producing strains presented important technological properties to be exploited as new adjunct culture for the dairy industry, influencing flavour development and improve safety.

TI  == bio-preservation of ground beef meat by enterococcus faecalis cect7121.
AB  == meat and particularly ground beef is frequently associated with food poisoning episodes and breeches in food safety. the main goal of this research was to evaluate the bactericide effect of the probiotic enterococcus faecalis cect7121,  against different pathogens as: escherichia coli o157:h7, staphylococcus aureus,  clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes, inoculated in ground beef meat. three studies were performed to evaluate the inhibition of e. faecalis cect7121 on ground beef meat samples inoculated with pathogens: study i: samples  (100 g meat) were inoculated with pathogens (10(3) cfu/g)) and e. faecalis cect7121 (10(4) cfu/g) simultaneously. study ii: samples were inoculated with e.  faecalis cect7121 24 h before the pathogens. study iii: e. faecalis cect7121were  inoculated 24 h after pathogens. the viable counts were performed at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h post-inoculation. the simultaneous inoculation of e. faecalis cect7121 with e. coli o157:h7 strains resulted in the absence of viable counts of bacteria at 72 h post-treatment. however, when the probiotic was added 24 h before and 24  h after the pathogen e. coli o157:h7, viable cells were not detected at 24 h and  48 h post-treatment, respectively. consistently, neither s. aureus nor cl. perfringens viable bacteria were detected at 48 h in whole assays when inoculated with e. faecalis cect7121. the same trend than described before was obtained after applying the 3 models assayed for l. monocytogenes. the current assays demonstrated the bactericide activity of e. faecalis cect7121 strain on bacterial pathogens in ground beef meat.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish (armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and clostridium perfringens. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method.  the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the itcs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative  anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a mbc of 1.25 mg/ml, against c. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against f. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. these results suggest that the itcs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.

TI  == identification of pathogen bacteria and protozoa in treated urban wastewaters discharged in the ebro river (spain): water reuse possibilities.
AB  == the aim of this research work is to identify the presence of pathogens, bacteria  and protozoa, in different treated urban wastewaters and to relate biological pollution with the processes used in wastewater treatment plants. a study of the  possibilities for water reuse is carried out taking into account bacterial and parasite composition. the analysed bacteria and protozoa are: enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens  (spore), salmonella spp., legionella spp., helminths eggs, giardia, cryptosporidium spp. and free-living amoebae (fla). the selected municipal wastewater treatment plants (mwtps) are located in navarra (spain) and the main difference between them is the use of natural lagoons as tertiary treatment in some plants. the results concerning bacteriological identification showed contamination of mainly faecal origin, and the use of natural lagoons as tertiary treatment in some mwtps produced an important disinfection effect. moreover, pathogen parasites such as giardia and cryptosporidium were not detected in the samples studied although fla were identified in all cases.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of aerial parts and ripe fruits of echinophora spinosa (apiaceae) from italy.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils obtained from the flowering aerial parts and ripe fruits of echinophora spinosa l. (apiaceae) from central italy were analyzed by gc/ms. the major constituents of the oil from the aerial parts were beta-phellandrene (34.7%), myristicin (16.5%), delta3-carene (12.6%), alpha-pinene (6.7%) and alpha-phellandrene (6.2%), and of the oil from the ripe fruits p-cymene (50.2%), myristicin (15.3%), alpha-pinene (15.1%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.1%). the two oils showed good antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, eubacterium limosum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and candida albicans with mic values respectively of 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50%, v/v, and 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 2.25, 0.50%, v/v, for aerial parts and ripe fruits respectively. a less significant antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, very important in the intestinal microflora, was also detected, with mic values higher than 4.0%, v/v.

TI  == targeting agr- and agr-like quorum sensing systems for development of common therapeutics to treat multiple gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  == invasive infection by the gram-positive pathogen staphylococcus aureus is controlled by a four gene operon, agr that encodes a quorum sensing system for the regulation of virulence. while agr has been well studied in s. aureus, the contribution of agr homologues and analogues in other gram-positive pathogens is  just beginning to be understood. intriguingly, other significant human pathogens, including clostridium perfringens, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis contain agr or analogues linked to virulence. moreover, other significant human gram-positive pathogens use peptide based quorum sensing systems to establish or maintain infection. the potential for commonality in aspects of these signaling systems across different species raises the prospect of identifying therapeutics that could target multiple pathogens. here, we review the status of research into these agr homologues, analogues, and other peptide based quorum sensing systems in gram-positive pathogens as well as the potential  for identifying common pathways and signaling mechanisms for therapeutic discovery.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar  diffusion method. the essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and  gram-negative strains (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for most essential oils examined, s. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while p. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. in general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.

TI  == effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  == the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term  consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats  operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a  48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations  at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.

TI  == longitudinal analyses of gut mucosal microbiotas in ulcerative colitis in relation to patient age and disease severity and duration.
AB  == bacteria belonging to the normal colonic microbiota are associated with the etiology of ulcerative colitis (uc). although several mucosal species have been implicated in the disease process, the organisms and mechanisms involved are unknown. the aim of this investigation was to characterize mucosal biofilm communities over time and to determine the relationship of these bacteria to patient age and disease severity and duration. multiple rectal biopsy specimens were taken from 33 patients with active uc over a period of 1 year. real-time pcr was used to quantify mucosal bacteria in uc patients compared to 18 noninflammatory bowel disease controls, and the relationship between indicators of disease severity and bacterial colonization was evaluated by linear regression analysis. significant differences were detected in bacterial populations on the uc mucosa and in the control group, which varied over the study period. high clinical activity indices (cai) and sigmoidoscopy scores (ss) were associated with enterobacteria, desulfovibrios, type e clostridium perfringens, and enterococcus faecalis, whereas the reverse was true for clostridium butyricum, ruminococcus albus, and eubacterium rectale. lactobacillus and bifidobacterium numbers were linked with low cai. only e. rectale and clostridium clostridioforme had a high age dependence. these findings demonstrated that longitudinal variations in mucosal bacterial populations occur in uc and that bacterial community structure is related to disease severity.

TI  == the effect of glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro.
AB  == the use of glyphosate modifies the environment which stresses the living microorganisms. the aim of the present study was to determine the real impact of  glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro. the presented results evidence that the highly pathogenic bacteria as salmonella entritidis, salmonella gallinarum, salmonella typhimurium, clostridium perfringens and clostridium botulinum are highly resistant to glyphosate. however, most of beneficial bacteria as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, bacillus badius, bifidobacterium adolescentis and lactobacillus spp. were found to be moderate to highly susceptible. also campylobacter spp. were found to be susceptible to glyphosate. a reduction of beneficial bacteria in the  gastrointestinal tract microbiota by ingestion of glyphosate could disturb the normal gut bacterial community. also, the toxicity of glyphosate to the most prevalent enterococcus spp. could be a significant predisposing factor that is associated with the increase in c. botulinum-mediated diseases by suppressing the antagonistic effect of these bacteria on clostridia.

TI  == the 2.5 a structure of the enterococcus conjugation protein tram resembles virb8  type iv secretion proteins.
AB  == conjugative plasmid transfer is the most important means of spreading antibiotic  resistance and virulence genes among bacteria and therefore presents a serious threat to human health. the process requires direct cell-cell contact made possible by a multiprotein complex that spans cellular membranes and serves as a  channel for macromolecular secretion. thus far, well studied conjugative type iv  secretion systems (t4ss) are of gram-negative (g-) origin. although many medically relevant pathogens (e.g., enterococci, staphylococci, and streptococci) are gram-positive (g+), their conjugation systems have received little attention. this study provides structural information for the transfer protein tram of the g+ broad host range enterococcus conjugative plasmid pip501. immunolocalization demonstrated that the protein localizes to the cell wall. we then used opsonophagocytosis as a novel tool to verify that tram was exposed on the cell surface. in these assays, antibodies generated to tram recruited macrophages and  enabled killing of pip501 harboring enteroccocus faecalis cells. the crystal structure of the c-terminal, surface-exposed domain of tram was determined to 2.5 a resolution. the structure, molecular dynamics, and cross-linking studies indicated that a tram trimer acts as the biological unit. despite the absence of  sequence-based similarity, tram unexpectedly displayed a fold similar to the t4ss virb8 proteins from agrobacterium tumefaciens and brucella suis (g-) and to the transfer protein tcpc from clostridium perfringens plasmid pcw3 (g+). based on the alignments of secondary structure elements of virb8-like proteins from mobile genetic elements and chromosomally encoded t4ss from g+ and g- bacteria, we propose a new classification scheme of virb8-like proteins.

TI  == phytochemical profiles of volatile constituents from centaurea ragusina leaves and flowers and their antimicrobial effects.
AB  == the volatile oils obtained from the leaves and flowers of the croatian endemic plant centaurea ragusina l. were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. the chemical compositions, determined by gc and gc-ms, were complex, with sesquiterpenes the most abundant class of compound. nonterpene hydrocarbons were  also identified in high quantities, while acids and ketones were found in high quantities only in the leaf volatile oil. aldehydes, alcohols, esters and other compounds were identified in lower quantities. antimicrobial effects of the volatile samples were investigated by using the disc diffusion and microdilution  assays. they were found to inhibit a wide range of bacteria and fungi, causing in vitro growth inhibition at a concentration of 250 microg/ml. the volatile oils displayed great antibacterial potential with mic values ranging from 16 to 128 microg/ml against the gram-positive bacteria bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, and lesser activity against the gram-negative bacteria cronobacter sakazakii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as fungal strains (mic  = 32-128 microg/ml).

TI  == reversible monensin adaptation in enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium perfringens of cattle origin: potential impact on human food safety.
AB  == objectives: to determine the stability/reversibility and mechanism of monensin adaptation in monensin-treated cattle isolates compared with reference bacterial  isolates, exposed in vitro to high monensin concentrations. methods: we evaluated the potential for cattle-origin strains of clostridium perfringens, enterococcus  faecium and enterococcus faecalis exposed to monensin in vivo (in vivo monensin-exposed isolates) to maintain or achieve the ability to grow in the presence of high monensin concentrations (in vitro monensin-adapted isolates). twenty-one consecutive subcultures of the in vitro monensin-adapted strains were  performed, and monensin mics were determined for the 3rd, 7th, 14th and 21st subcultures (subcultured isolates). sds-page and transmission electron microscopy (tem) were used to determine protein expression and visualize extracellular morphology changes. results: monensin-non-exposed isolates did not display monensin adaptation during in vitro monensin exposure. in contrast, in vivo monensin-exposed isolates displayed monensin adaptation enabling growth at 32x mic. upon consecutive subculturing, monensin mics returned to baseline, or one dilution above, for the monensin-adapted strains. sds-page identified overexpression of a 14 kda protein (c. perfringens) and a 20.5 kda protein (e. faecium and e. faecalis) in the monensin-adapted isolates. tem demonstrated that  in vitro monensin-adapted strains had a significantly thicker cell wall or glycocalyx compared with in vivo monensin-exposed or subcultured isolates. conclusions: in vivo monensin-exposed isolates of c. perfringens, e. faecium and  e. faecalis have the ability to grow in the presence of high monensin concentrations in vitro. this is associated with an increased thickening of the cell wall or glycocalyx that is reversible upon serial passage, suggesting a phenotypically expressed, but not genetically stable, trait.

TI  == evaluation of impact of exposure of sudan azo dyes and their metabolites on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == sudan azo dyes are banned for food usage in most countries, but they are illegally used to maintain or enhance the color of food products due to low cost, bright staining, and wide availability of the dyes. in this report, we examined the toxic effects of these azo dyes and their potential reduction metabolites on  11 prevalent human intestinal bacterial strains. among the tested bacteria, cell  growth of 2, 3, 5, 5, and 1 strains was inhibited by sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red, respectively. at the tested concentration of 100 mum, sudan i and ii inhibited growth of clostridium perfringens and lactobacillus rhamnosus with decrease of growth rates from 14 to 47%. sudan ii also affected growth of enterococcus faecalis. growth of bifidobacterium catenulatum, c. perfringens, e.  faecalis, escherichia coli, and peptostreptococcus magnus was affected by sudan iii and iv with decrease in growth rates from 11 to 67%. c. perfringens was the only strain in which growth was affected by para red with 47 and 26% growth decreases at 6 and 10 h, respectively. 1-amino-2-naphthol, a common metabolite of the dyes, was capable of inhibiting growth of most of the tested bacteria with inhibition rates from 8 to 46%. however, the other metabolites of the dyes had no effect on growth of the bacterial strains. the dyes and their metabolites had less effect on cell viability than on cell growth of the tested bacterial strains. clostridium indolis and clostridium ramosum were the only two strains with about a 10 % decrease in cell viability in the presence of sudan azo dyes. the present results suggested that sudan azo dyes and their metabolites potentially affect the human intestinal bacterial ecology by selectively inhibiting some bacterial species, which may have an adverse effect on human health.

TI  == bacterial monocultures, propionate, butyrate and h2o2 modulate the expression, secretion and structure of the fasting-induced adipose factor in gut epithelial cell lines.
AB  == previous research showed that an intestinal microbial community represses the fasting-induced adipose factor (fiaf) in the gut epithelium, thereby increasing fat storage in the host. this study was designed to investigate the overall effect of different bacterial species and metabolites on fiaf in intestinal (caco-2, ht-29 and hct-116) and hepatic (hepg2) cancer cell lines. first, we showed that fiaf was present in different isoforms, and secreted as n-glycosylated proteins, exclusively at the basal side of the cell monolayer. second, co-incubation of cell lines with bacterial monocultures and metabolites altered both fiaf production and isoform appearance. propionate and/or butyrate treatment increased fiaf expression and cleavage in all tested cell lines. in contrast, different bacteria induced cell line-specific fiaf modulation. clostridium perfringens induced fiaf isoform changes in caco-2 cells. enterococcus faecalis and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron treatment resulted in cell line-specific fiaf increases, whereas escherichia coli significantly decreased fiaf expression in hct-116 cells. treatment with h(2) o(2) and peroxide-producing e. faecalis strains induced fiaf isoform changes in caco-2 cells. since bacteria  and bacterial metabolites alter both fiaf production and isoform appearance, further investigation may reveal an important role for bacteria in fiaf-regulated physiological processes, such as cell differentiation and fat metabolism.

TI  == intestinal microbiota was assessed in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis b virus infection. intestinal microbiota of hbv cirrhotic patients.
AB  == to unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis b virus (hbv), chronic hepatitis b, decompensated hbv cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative pcr and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and clostridium perfringens in fecal crude dna and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. data analysis indicated that 16s rrna gene copy numbers for faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of hbv cirrhotic patients. the bifidobacteria/enterobacteriaceae (b/e) ratio, which may  indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 +/- 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 +/- 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis b to  0.64 +/- 0.09 in patients with decompensated hbv cirrhosis (for all, p < 0.01). this suggests that b/e ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. the data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. fecal secretory iga and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in decompensated hbv cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance.

AB  == the fsrabdc signal transduction system is a major virulence regulator in enterococcus faecalis. the fsrc sensor histidine kinase, upon activation by the gelatinase biosynthesis-activating pheromone (gbap) peptide encoded by the fsrbd  genes, phosphorylates the fsra response regulator required for the transcription  of the fsrbdc and the gele-spre genes from the fsrb promoter and the gele promoter, respectively. fsra belongs to the lyttr family of proteins, which includes other virulence regulators, such as agra of staphylococcus aureus, algr  of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and virr of clostridium perfringens. the lyttr dna-binding domain that characterizes these proteins generally binds to two imperfect direct repeats separated by a number of bases that place the repeats on the same face of the dna helix. in this study, we demonstrated that fsra also binds to two imperfect direct repeats separated by 13 bp, based on the consensus  sequence of fsra, t/at/caa/gggaa/g, which is consistent with the binding characteristics of lyttr domains.

TI  == standardized comparison of antiseptic efficacy of triclosan, pvp-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide and chlorhexidine digluconate.
AB  == background: this study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial  efficacy of the antiseptics pvp-iodine, triclosan, chlorhexidine, octenidine and  polyhexanide used for pre-surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, wounds and mucous membranes based on internationally accepted standards. methods: mics and mbcs were determined in accordance with din 58940-7 and 58940-8 using staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus), streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, haemophilus influenzae and candida albicans. the microbicidal efficacy was determined in accordance with din en 1040 and 1275 using s. aureus,  p. aeruginosa and c. albicans. results: for chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide, mic(48) and mbc(24) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/l. maximum values for triclosan ranged from 256 to 512 mg/l, with an efficacy gap against p. aeruginosa, while the maximum values of pvp-iodine were 1024 mg/l, with a gap against s. pneumoniae. comparing the minimal effective concentrations, octenidine was most effective. after 1 min, only octenidine and pvp-iodine fulfil the requirements for antiseptics. conclusions: tests under standardized and harmonized conditions help to choose the most efficacious agent. when a prolonged contact time is feasible, ranking of agents would be polyhexanide = octenidine >  chlorhexidine > triclosan > pvp-iodine. this is consistent with the recommendations for antisepsis of acute wounds. polyhexanide seems to be preferable for chronic wounds due to its higher tolerability. if an immediate effect is required, ranking would be octenidine = pvp-iodine>> polyhexanide > chlorhexidine > triclosan.

TI  == dead-end hollow-fiber ultrafiltration for recovery of diverse microbes from water.
AB  == dead-end ultrafiltration (deuf) is an alternative approach to tangential-flow hollow-fiber ultrafiltration that can be readily employed under field conditions  to recover microbes from water. the hydraulics of deuf and microbe recovery for a new deuf method were investigated using 100-liter tap water samples. pressure, flow rate, and temperature were investigated using four hollow-fiber ultrafilter  types. based on hydraulic performance, the asahi kasei rexeed 25s ultrafilter was selected for microbe recovery experiments. microbe recovery experiments were performed using ms2 bacteriophage, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens spores, and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. microbes were recovered from ultrafilters by backflushing using a surfactant solution. average flow rates were 2.1 liters/min for 100-liter water samples having turbidities of 0.28 to 4.3 nephelometric turbidity units (ntu), and no evidence of appreciable filter clogging was observed. the deuf average recovery efficiencies for each study analyte in tap water were as follows: for e. faecalis, 93% +/- 16%; for ms2, 57%  +/- 7.7%; for c. perfringens spores, 94% +/- 22%; and for c. parvum, 87% +/- 18%. average microbe recoveries for tap water amended with surface water (average turbidity = 4.3 ntu) were as follows: for e. faecalis, 78% +/- 12%; for ms2, 73%  +/- 13%; for c. perfringens, 57% +/- 21%; and for c. parvum, 83% +/- 21%. these data demonstrate that deuf is an effective method for recovering diverse microbes from water and should be a useful tool for field-based environmental investigations.

AB  == background: resistant gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. this work investigated the efficacy of ap-cect7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of enterococcus faecalis cect7121) against various pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. methods: strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard  antibiotic treatments. inhibitory activity of ap-cect7121 was assessed using the  agar-well diffusion method. the most resistant isolates from each species screened (enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis,staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. results: these bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant s. aureus and c. perfringens: viable counts for c. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. conclusions: ap-cect7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.

TI  == case of clostridium perfringens bacteremia after routine colonoscopy and polypectomy.
AB  == bacteremia is an uncommon complication after polypectomy and colonoscopy. we report one of the first cases of clostridium perfringens bacteremia after polypectomy. our patient was a four years old boy with congenital polyposis, who  underwent colonoscopy and polypectomy without complication. approximately 12h later he developed a fever and tachycardia with no other clinical symptoms. his blood cultures grew out penicillin susceptible c. perfringens and enterococcus faecalis. he responded to antibiotic therapy and remained clinically asymptomatic for the duration of his course. there are a few reports of bacteremia after routine polypectomy, but no reported cases of c. perfringens bacteremia in the pediatric population. clostridial sp. bacteremia can be fatal with devastating consequences if appropriate antibiotics and/or surgical debridement are delayed.  polymicrobial infection, as illustrated in our patient, is also common and can be a poor prognostic risk factor. therefore, for patients with a history of polypectomy and new onset fever, anaerobic infections should be considered and empiric antibiotic therapy should include coverage for these organisms.

TI  == screening escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and clostridium perfringens as indicator organisms in evaluating pathogen-reducing capacity in biogas plants.
AB  == this study was conducted to identify an indicator organism(s) in evaluating the pathogen-reducing capacity of biogas plants. fresh cow manure containing 10(4) to 10(5) colony forming unit (cfu) per milliliter of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis along with an inoculated clostridium perfringens strain were exposed to 37 degrees c for 15 days, 55 degrees c for 48 h, and 70 degrees c for 24 h. c. perfringens was the most heat-resistant organism followed by e. faecalis, while e. coli was the most heat-sensitive organism. e. coli was reduced below detection limit at all temperatures with log(10) reductions of 4.94 (10 s), 4.37 (40 min), and 2.6 (5 days) at 70 degrees c, 55 degrees c, and 37 degrees c,  respectively. maximum log(10) reductions for e. faecalis were 1.77 at 70 degrees  c (1 day), 1.7 at 55 degrees c (2 days) and 3.13 at 37 degrees c (15 days). for c. perfringens, maximum log(10) reduction at 37 degrees c was 1.35 log(10) units  (15 days) compared to less than 1 unit at 55 and 70 degrees c. modeling results showed that e. faecalis and c. perfringens had higher amount of heat-resistant fraction than e. coli. thus, e. faecalis and c. perfringens can be used as indicator organisms to evaluate pathogen-reducing capacity in biogas plants at high temperatures of 55 degrees c and 70 degrees c while at 37 degrees c e. coli  could also be included as indicator organism.

AB  == aims: to determine if environmental clostridium perfringens carry antibiotic resistance genes and if the genes are mobile. methods and results: clostridium perfringens from water, soil and sewage (2003-2006) were screened for the tetracycline and macrolide resistance genes previously described in animal and human c. perfringens [erm(b), erm(q), teta(p), tetb(p) and tet(m) genes] and the  macrolide resistance mef(a) gene. of the 160 isolates, 108 (67.5%) carried > or =1 of the six antibiotic resistance gene(s). the teta(p), tetb(p) and tet(m) genes were in 53%, 22% and 8%, and the erm(b), erm(q) and mef(a) genes in 26%, 1% and 18% of the isolates, respectively. the mef(a) gene and flanking regions were  sequenced. the tet(m), erm(b), erm(q) and mef(a) genes transfer independently from c. perfringens donors to the enterococcus faecalis recipient. conclusions: six resistance genes were found in the environmental c. perfringens with the most common being the teta(p) gene and the erm(q) gene the least common. significance  and impact of the study: this is the first time conjugal transfer of macrolide resistance genes and/or the tet(m) gene from c. perfringens has been demonstrated. the data presented supports the hypothesis that antibiotic-resistant environmental c. perfringens are capable of acting as reservoirs for these antibiotic resistance genes.

TI  == novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases with broader substrate specificity.
AB  == in an effort to identify novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases (endo-alpha-galnacases), four potential genes were cloned. three of the expressed proteins engef from enterococcus faecalis, engpa from propionibacterium acnes, and engcp from clostridium perfringens were purified and characterized. their substrate specificity was investigated and compared to the commercially available endo-alpha-galnacases from streptococcus pneumoniae (engsp) and alcaligenes sp. (engal). all enzymes were incubated with various synthetic substrates, and natural glycoproteins and the released sugars were detected by colorimetric assay and thin layer chromatography analysis. the core 1 disaccharide gal beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was the most rapidly hydrolyzed substrate by all enzymes tested. engef exhibited the highest k(cat) for this substrate. engef and engpa were also able to fully hydrolyze the core 3 disaccharide glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp. this is the first report of endo-alpha-galnacases engef and engpa acting on core 3 in addition to core 1 o-glycans. interestingly, there were no significant differences in transglycosylation activities when gal beta 1,3galnac  alpha 1pnp or glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was incubated with various 1-alkanols in the presence of the endo-alpha-galnacases tested in this work.

AB  == objectives: to study the role of qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins (prps) from several gram-positive species with quinolone resistance in vitro. methods: a pcr-based strategy was used to clone and express genes coding for qnr-like prps in enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, bacillus cereus and b. subtilis in escherichia coli dh10b. mic values of nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones were determined for reference strains and e. coli dh10b harbouring recombinant plasmids containing genes coding for prps. results: amino acid identity of qnr-like prps in gram-positive strains compared with that of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants qnra1, qnrb1 and qnrs1 was in the range of 16%  to 22%. recombinant plasmids coding for qnr-like prps conferred reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (in the range of 0.016 to 0.064 mg/l for ciprofloxacin) and nalidixic acid (from 6 to 12 mg/l), depending on the antimicrobial agent and prp. the prp from b. subtilis showed no protective effect. conclusions: the prps analysed conferred a reduced susceptibility phenotype in e. coli; the data provide further evidence of the possible roles in  quinolone resistance of prps from different gram-positive species. these gram-positive species may constitute a reservoir for qnr-like quinolone resistance proteins.

AB  == we used terminal restriction fragment polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis to assess (1) stability of the fecal microbiota in dogs living in environments characterized by varying degrees of exposure to factors that might alter the microbiota and (2) changes in the microbiota associated with acute episodes of diarrhea. results showed that the healthy canine gi tract harbors potential enteric pathogens. dogs living in an environment providing minimal exposure to factors that might alter the microbiota had similar microbiotas; the microbiotas  of dogs kept in more variable environments were more variable. substantial changes in the microbiota occurred during diarrheic episodes, including increased levels of clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. when diet and medications of a dog having a previously stable microbiota were changed repeatedly, the microbiota also changed repeatedly. temporal trend analysis showed directional changes in the microbiota after perturbation, a return to the starting condition, and then fluctuating changes over time.

TI  == [epidemiology and treatment of acute prostatitis after prostatic biopsy].
AB  == objective: acute prostatitis is the main complication of prostatic biopsies (pb)  and sometimes requires hospitalisation and appropriate antibiotic therapy. this study evaluated the pathogens responsible and proposes a statistically adapted empirical antibiotic therapy. patients and methods: this retrospective (from 2000 to 2006) two-centre study included 17 patients hospitalised for acute prostatitis after pb in a series of 1,216 biopsies. bacteriological documentation was based on urine cultures, blood cultures, identification of bacteria and antibiotic susceptibility testing. results: all patients received prophylactic antibiotics with a single dose of systemic fluoroquinolone at least 1 h before pb. bacterial  identification was possible in fourteen cases: e. coli (nine cases), proteus mirabilis (one case), klebsiella pneumoniae (one case), enterococcus faecalis (one case), staphylococcus spp (one case), clostridium perfringens (one case). only urine culture was positive in 6 cases (35%), only blood culture was positive in 3 cases (17%), and urine cultures and blood cultures were positive and concordant in 5 cases (29%). a high rate of resistance of e. coli to fluoroquinolones was observed in 88% of cases and to cotrimoxazole in 77% of cases. however, the strain was susceptible to second and third generation cephalosporins (2gc and 3gc) and amikacin in 100% of cases. prostatitis was associated with epididymo-orchitis (3 cases), acute urinary retention (4 cases) and infective endocarditis (1 case). conclusions: identification of the micro-organism responsible for acute prostatitis after biopsy requires a combination of blood cultures and urine cultures. empirical antibiotic therapy is based on the use of 2gc or 3gc, alone or in combination with amikacin depending on the severity of the clinical features.

TI  == multistate evaluation of an ultrafiltration-based procedure for simultaneous recovery of enteric microbes in 100-liter tap water samples.
AB  == ultrafiltration (uf) is increasingly being recognized as a potentially effective  procedure for concentrating and recovering microbes from large volumes of water and treated wastewater. because of their very small pore sizes, uf membranes are  capable of simultaneously concentrating viruses, bacteria, and parasites based on size exclusion. in this study, a uf-based water sampling procedure was used to simultaneously recover representatives of these three microbial classes seeded into 100-liter samples of tap water collected from eight cities covering six hydrologic areas of the united states. the uf-based procedure included hollow-fiber uf as the primary step for concentrating microbes and then used membrane filtration for bacterial culture assays, immunomagnetic separation for parasite recovery and quantification, and centrifugal uf for secondary concentration of viruses. water samples were tested for nine water quality parameters to investigate whether water quality data correlated with measured recovery efficiencies and molecular detection levels. average total method recovery efficiencies were 71, 97, 120, 110, and 91% for phix174 bacteriophage, ms2 bacteriophage, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens spores, and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, respectively. real-time pcr and reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) for seeded microbes and controls indicated that tap water quality could affect the analytical performance of molecular amplification  assays, although no specific water quality parameter was found to correlate with  reduced pcr or rt-pcr performance.

TI  == a second tylosin resistance determinant, erm b, in arcanobacterium pyogenes.
AB  == arcanobacterium pyogenes, a common inhabitant of the mucosal surfaces of livestock, is also a pathogen associated with a variety of infections. in livestock, a. pyogenes is exposed to antimicrobial agents used for prophylaxis and therapy, notably tylosin, a macrolide used extensively for the prevention of  liver abscessation in feedlot cattle in the united states. many, but not all, tylosin-resistant a. pyogenes isolates carry erm(x), suggesting the presence of other determinants of tylosin resistance. oligonucleotide primers designed for conserved regions of erm(b), erm(c), and erm(t) were used to amplify a 404-bp fragment from a tylosin-resistant a. pyogenes isolate, ox-7. dna sequencing revealed that the pcr product was 100% identical to erm(b) genes, and the erm(b)  gene region was cloned in escherichia coli. the a. pyogenes erm b determinant had the most dna identity with an erm b determinant carried by the clostridium perfringens plasmid pip402. however, the a. pyogenes determinant lacked direct repeat dr1 and contained a deletion in dr2. flanking the a. pyogenes erm(b) gene  were partial and entire genes similar to those found on the enterococcus faecalis multiresistance plasmid pre25. this novel architecture suggests that the erm(b) element may have arisen by recombination of two distinct genetic elements. ten of 32 tylosin-resistant isolates carried erm(b), as determined by dna hybridization, and all 10 isolates carried a similar element. insertion of the element was site  specific, as pcr and southern blotting analysis revealed that the erm(b) element  was inserted into orfy, a gene of unknown function. however, in three strains, this insertion resulted in a partial duplication of orfy.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

AB  == fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) is a technique that has been used  over the years in chemical analysis for the identification of substances and is one that may be applied to the characterisation of microorganisms. the marked tendency of brucella towards variation in the smooth rough phase, together with the laboriousness and risk involved in the methods used in their identification,  make their classification difficult. we studied the type strains of the different species and biovars of brucella and 11 isolates of human origin of brucella melitensis, six corresponding to biovar 1, one to biovar 2 and five to biovar 3.  the results of linear discriminant analysis performed using the data provide an above 95% likelihood of correct classification, over half of which are in fact above 99% for the vast majority of brucella strains. only one case of b. melitensis biovar 1 has been incorrectly classified. the rest of the microorganisms studied (staphylococcus aureus, strteptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and pseudomonas aeruginosa) have been classified correctly in all cases to a likelihood of over 80%. in the graphic representation of the analysis, a grouping of these can be seen in clusters, which include the different species. one of these comprises b.  melitensis, another brucella abortus, and another wider one is made up of brucella suis. the brucella canis, brucella ovis and brucella neotomae strains appear separate from the previously described groups.

TI  == quantitative determination of bile salt hydrolase activity in bacteria isolated from the small intestine of chickens.
AB  == a quantitative assay based on high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of  bile salts and bacterial protein determination was established for investigating  bile salt hydrolase (bsh) activity in bacteria isolated from the small intestine  of chickens. bacteria were isolated using various media and were subsequently grouped according to cell morphology, fermentation profile, and 16s ribosomal dna sequence. representative isolates from each bacterial group were assayed for bsh  activity. the isolates differed in bsh activity with respect to the state of growth and preculturing with and without taurochenodeoxycholate. the highest levels of bsh activity were found with enterococcus faecium and clostridium perfringens.

TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  == linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

TI  == comparison of tn5397 from clostridium difficile, tn916 from enterococcus faecalis and the cw459tet(m) element from clostridium perfringens shows that they have similar conjugation regions but different insertion and excision modules.
AB  == comparative analysis of the conjugative transposons tn5397 from clostridium difficile and tn916 from enterococcus faecalis, and the cw459tet(m) element from  clostridium perfringens, has revealed that these tetracycline-resistance elements are closely related. all three elements contain the tet(m) resistance gene and have sequence similarity throughout their central region. however, they have very different integration/excision modules. instead of the int and xis genes that are found in tn916, tn5397 has a large resolvase gene, tndx. the c. perfringens element encodes the putative int459 protein, which is a member of the integrase family of site-specific recombinases but is not closely related to int from tn916. based on these studies it is concluded that the clostridial elements have  a modular genetic organization and were derived independently from distinct mobile genetic elements.

TI  == bactericidal properties of the chloroform fraction from rhizomes of aristolochia  paucinervis pomel.
AB  == the deffated chloroform fraction (aprc) obtained from the rhizomes of aristolochia paucinervis pomel (aristolochiaceae) has a high bacteriostatic activity against bacterial strains like clostridium perfringens atcc 13124 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212. here, we report the bactericidal activity of aprc against both strains which was evaluated by using time-to kill assays. the results showed that aprc produced an intense time-dependent bactericidal effect against c. perfringens, achieving over a 24 h-period a 5log10-unit decrease in cfu/ml at a concentration > or =1.25 x mic. in contrast, when tested against e. faecalis, aprc exhibited a concentration-dependent killing activity at concentrations of 1.25 x mic and 2.5 x mic, yielding to a decrease of 1.5 and 2.5log10-unit in cfu/ml at 4 h, respectively. however, substantial regrowth of e. faecalis occurred within 24 h. ultrastructural alterations were observed for both exposed microorganisms by scanning and transmission electron microscopy.

TI  == gene transfer to clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319.
AB  == although much is known about the bacterial cellulosome and its various protein components, their contributions to bacterial growth on cellulose and the process  of cellulolysis in vivo cannot currently be assessed. to remedy this, the authors have developed gene transfer techniques for clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319. firstly, transfer of tn1545 has been obtained using an enterococcus faecalis donor. secondly, incp-mediated conjugative mobilization of plasmids from escherichia coli donors has also been achieved. the yield of transconjugants in both cases was low and was probably limited by the suboptimal growth conditions that must of necessity be employed for the co-culture of oligotrophic c. cellulolyticum with copiotrophic donors. a restriction endonuclease was detected  in crude extracts of c. cellulolyticum. this enzyme, named cce:i, is an isoschizomer of msp:i (hpa:ii). electro-transformation was employed to establish  plasmids containing the replication functions of pamss1 (en. faecalis), pim13 (bacillus subtilis), pcb102 (clostridium butyricum), pip404 (clostridium perfringens) and pwv01 (lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris) in c. cellulolyticum. transformants were only obtained if the dna was appropriately methylated on the external c of the sequence 5'-ccgg-3' using either bsu:fi methylase in vivo or msp:i methylase in vitro. plasmids based on the pamss1 and pim13 replicons were more stably maintained than one based on the pcb102 replicon. selection of transformants on solid medium led to low apparent transformation efficiencies (approx. 10(2) transformants per microg dna) which might, in part, reflect the low plating efficiency of the organism. selection of transformants in liquid medium led to a higher apparent yield of transformants (between 10(5) and 10(7) transformants per microg dna). the methods developed here will pave the way for functional analysis of the various cellulosome components in vivo.

TI  == linezolid.
AB  == linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent that acts by inhibiting the initiation of bacterial protein synthesis. cross-resistance between linezolid and other inhibitors of protein synthesis has not been demonstrated. linezolid has a  wide spectrum of activity against gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. anerobes such as clostridium spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and prevotella spp. are also susceptible to linezolid. linezolid is bacteriostatic against most susceptible organisms but displays bactericidal activity against some strains of pneumococci, bacteroides fragilis and c. perfringens. in clinical trials involving hospitalised patients with skin/soft tissue infections (predominantly s. aureus), intravenous/oral linezolid (up to 1250 mg mg/day) produced clinical success in >83% of individuals. in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, success rates were >94%. preliminary clinical data also indicate that twice daily intravenous/oral linezolid 600 mg is as effective as intravenous vancomycin 1 g in the treatment of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia and in those with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci. moreover, linezolid 600 mg twice daily produced >85% clinical/microbiological cure in vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections. linezolid is generally well tolerated and gastrointestinal disturbances are the most commonly occurring adverse events. no clinical evidence of adverse reactions as a result of monoamine oxidase inhibition has been reported.

TI  == quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. the combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), drug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus spp. the combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including moraxella catarrhalis, legioniella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against e. faecalis. the  combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. as for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against e. faecium. in patients with methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) or vref infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5  mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with vref infections. quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall  incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome p450 3a4 and therefore has  the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. conclusions: quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. in serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. however, in vref or unresponsive mrsa infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.

TI  == antibacterial activity of aristolochia paucinervis pomel.
AB  == several fractions of the methanolic extract of the rhizome or the leaves of aristolochia paucinervis pomel were screened for antibacterial activity using the agar dilution method against fourteen reference bacterial strains. only three fractions (defatted chloroformic rhizome fraction: aprc, rhizome ethyl acetate fraction: apre and leaf chloroform fraction: aplc) showed an activity against at  least one of the microorganisms tested. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determination showed that aprc was the most active against clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis. the high bacteriostatic activity of aprc was confirmed by its  mic determination against clinical strains of c. perfringens (n = 32), c. difficile (n = 31), and e. faecalis (n = 22). results of this study suggest the potential interest of this highly active fraction and support the use of a. paucinervis pomel in moroccan traditional medicine to treat skin and soft-tissue  infections, especially gas gangrene and intestinal diseases.

AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.

TI  == isolation of alpha-toxin, theta-toxin and kappa-toxin mutants of clostridium perfringens by tn916 mutagenesis.
AB  == clostridium perfringens is the causative agent of clostridial myonecrosis or gas  gangrene and mediates infection and disease by producing numerous extracellular toxins, including alpha-toxin, theta-toxin and kappa-toxin. tn916-mutagenesis was used to isolate mutants defective in their ability to produce either alpha-toxin  or theta-toxin. nine independently derived mutants were isolated. in four of these mutants tn916 had inserted at sites located 193 bp or 198 bp upstream of the theta-toxin structural gene, pfoa. four mutants contained large deletions, three in regions which encompassed the theta-toxin structural and regulatory genes pfoa and pfor, respectively, and the kappa-toxin structural gene, cola, and one in a region encompassing the alpha-toxin structural gene, plc. these mutants  should prove to be invaluable for further genetic studies aimed at determining the role of these toxins in virulence.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem, was studied in comparison with other beta-lactam antimicrobials against 711 recent clinical isolates including gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. mic data showed that faropenem was active against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (mics <  or = 4 mg/l), with reduced activity against serratia spp. (mic90 = 32 mg/l). in common with its comparators, faropenem had weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic > 128 mg/l). faropenem was active against staphylococci, although for mrsa mics were raised (mic90 = 2 mg/l) compared with those for mssa (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l). faropenem was also found to be  active against streptococci, neisseria spp., enterococcus faecalis and beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and  moraxella catarrhalis. of the anaerobic bacteria studied, faropenem was most active against peptostreptococci and clostridium perfringens (mic90 < or = 1 mg/l) and bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 4 mg/l). an increase in inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu raised faropenem mics for morganella morganii from 0.06-1 mg/l to 2-4 mg/l and for mrsa from 0.25-2 mg/l to 8 mg/l (a similar increase was not observed for mssa). the mics of faropenem were not affected by the presence of either 20% or 70% (v/v) serum. mics for faropenem to 11 well characterized beta-lactamase producers were similar to those of non-producers. in hydrolysis studies, faropenem was shown to be highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases,  including tem-1, shv-1, the extended spectrum beta-lactamases, tem-3 and tem-9, and the beta-lactamase produced by staphylococcus aureus (nctc 11561).

TI  == bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on latex and silicone t-tubes in relation to bacterial contamination of bile.
AB  == background: t-tube-related bacteriobilia causes infectious complications and obstruction. to prevent these, the choice of t-tube material may be of importance. methods: transected common bile ducts (cbds) of 17 piglets were sutured over latex or silicone t-tubes, or without a t-tube. results: after 6 weeks bacteriobilia was found in all of 12 cbds with and in 1 of 5 cbds without a t-tube (p < 0.05). by scanning electron microscopy (sem) four of five latex and none of five silicone t-tubes had bacterial biofilms (p < 0.05). all tubes remained patent. segments of t-tubes were incubated with five different bacterial strains. sonication and sem showed that 0.1-1.1% of 10(7) colony-forming units of inoculum adhered to t-tubes. two to six times more bacteria adhered to latex than to silicone (p < 0.05). conclusions: silicone offers better long-term patency than latex. less infectious complications occur if t-tubes are omitted.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == the closely related ermb-ermam genes from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis (pam beta 1), and streptococcus agalactiae (pip501) are flanked by variants of a directly repeated sequence.
AB  == the clostridium perfringens macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b resistance gene, ermbp, was sequenced and shown to be identical to the ermb-ermam gene from  the promiscuous enterococcus faecalis plasmid pam beta 1 and to have at least 98% nucleotide sequence identity to other ermb-ermam genes. flanking the ermbp structural gene were almost identical directly repeated 1,341-bp sequences (dr1 and dr2). these repeats potentially encoded a 298 (or 284)-amino-acid protein that had sequence similarity to chromosomal and plasmid partitioning proteins. the pam beta 1 and streptococcus agalactiae (pip501) erm determinants appeared to have dr2 but had similar internal 973- or 956-bp deletions in dr1, respectively.  some of the other ermb-ermam class determinants had small portions of dr1, but none had complete copies. it is postulated that the c. perfringens ermbp determinant was derived from an enterococcal or streptococcal determinant that had complete copies of both dr1 and dr2.

TI  == bioavailability and bacterial degradation of rectally administered 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine.
AB  == 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (cda) is a new drug for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia and other lymphoproliferative diseases. it is generally administered as  a continuous intravenous infusion during 5-7 days. the oral bioavailability is only 50%. the bioavailability after rectal administration was investigated in two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. five milligrams per square metre was  given i.v. as a 2-h infusion and 24 h later the same dose was administered rectally in a gel formulation. the mean bioavailability was only 21% due to deglycosylation of cda to 2-chloroadenine (cade). to further elucidate the factors which are important for the rectal availability of cda, the in vitro stability of cda in bacterial cultures was tested. clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli as well as whole feces rapidly deglycosylated cda to cade while  bacteroides fragilis, enterococcus faecalis as well as saliva only degraded cda slowly or not at all. it is concluded that, due to bacterial degradation, rectal  administration of cda has no advantage over oral administration.

TI  == growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  == the initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". in the present study, the csh of 133 strains of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, group a streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus magnus, and of 8 candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% co2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate csh, i.e., they aggregated in  0.01-2 m ammonium sulfate. when the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher  csh, and 44 strains the same csh as after growth without serum. the csh of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and pdm  agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% co2 atmosphere. the highest csh was expressed after growth in 5% co2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 c, 20 min) serum. the reduced surface tension obtained in 5% co2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of csh.

TI  == detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  == forty bacteriocin-producing (bac+) lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. of the 40 bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). by direct plating, bac+ lab were detected at levels up to 2.4 x  10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. the bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, sds-page protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; sds-page proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique bac+ isolates. bac+ lab included enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus curvatus, lb. delbrueckii, lb. plantarum, lactococcus lactis, and pediococcus acidilactici. lb. curvatus (four strains) and lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus. some lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine gram-positive genera. lb. curvatus fs47 and fs65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees c; however, lc. lactis fs56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. the high incidence of bac+ lab detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of bac+ lab that occur as natural contaminants. these data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.

TI  == effect of hyperbaric oxygen and surgery on experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene.
AB  == an experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene rat model was developed and the therapeutic effect of surgery was compared to the combined effect of surgery and  hyperbaric oxygen (hbo). the infection was caused by an intramuscular injection of a mixture of bacteria including clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. the mortality, morbidity and wound healing were assessed during a follow-up of 2 weeks. the mortality of the control rats was 60%, with rats treated with surgery alone 35% and the combined treatment group 20% (ns). in the combined treatment group, 84.4% of the survivors healed completely; the corresponding figure in the surgery group was 15.4% (p < 0.001).  in experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene the addition of hbo to surgery reduces morbidity and improves wound healing but does not reduce mortality statistically significantly.

TI  == characterization of tn1546, a tn3-related transposon conferring glycopeptide resistance by synthesis of depsipeptide peptidoglycan precursors in enterococcus  faecium bm4147.
AB  == sequence determination of the flanking regions of the vancomycin resistance van gene cluster carried by pip816 in enterococcus faecium bm4147 revealed similarity to transposons of the tn3 family. imperfect inverted repeats (36 of 38 bp) delineated a 10,851-bp element designated tn1546. the 4-kb region located upstream from the vanr gene contained two open reading frames (orf) transcribed in opposite directions. the deduced amino acid sequence of orf1 (988 residues) displayed, respectively, 56 and 42% identity to those of the transposases of tn4430 from bacillus thuringiensis and of tn917 from enterococcus faecalis. the product of orf2 (191 residues) was related to the resolvase of tn917 (33% amino acid identity) and to the res protein (48%) of plasmid pip404 from clostridium perfringens. tn1546 transposed consecutively in escherichia coli from plasmid puc18 into pox38 and from pox38 into various sites of pbr329. transposition was replicative, led to the formation of cointegrates, and produced a 5-bp duplication at the target site. southern hybridization and dna amplification revealed the presence of tn1546-related elements in enterococci highly resistant  to glycopeptides. analysis of sequences surrounding these elements indicated that transposition plays a role in dissemination of the van gene cluster among replicons of human clinical isolates of e. faecium.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == bacteria and gallstone nucleation.
AB  == this preliminary study reports for the first time that there might be a possible  association between bacteria and the aetiology of some cholesterol calculi. the gall-bladder biles from 225 cholecystectomy patients underwent bacteriological and microscopic study. cholesterol calculi from 13 patients (10.2%) were observed to be associated with gall-bladder bile profusely infected with at least one bacterial species that was shown to possess beta-glucuronidase activity, an enzyme that is thought to promote calcium bilirubinate precipitation in bile. concomitantly, the associated gall-bladder bile was 'high' in calcium bilirubinate precipitation and the precipitate was also detected in the centre of the gallstones. moreover, in approximately half of these patients (six of 13), the cholesterol gallstones' nuclear areas also contained calcium palmitate, which is also thought to be due to bacterial activity. the results also support the hypothesis that bacteria with active beta-glucuronidase (for example, escherichia coli) can significantly influence the aetiology of brown pigment gallstones. in contrast, bacteria were observed to have no role in black pigment gallstone formation, as their associated gall-bladder biles were always observed to be sterile.

TI  == pathogenicity of enterococci in a rat model of fecal peritonitis.
AB  == the pathogenicity of enterococci in intraabdominal sepsis has not been clarified. therefore, fecal-type peritonitis was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of barium sulfate along with a bacterial inoculum consisting of escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and clostridium perfringens with or without streptococcus faecalis. mortality at 19 d and characteristics of intraabdominal abscesses in survivors at 19 d were analyzed. the presence of s. faecalis in the original inoculum was significantly associated with death or large (greater than 20 mm) abscess formation when these two end points were examined together. s. faecalis may synergize with other bacteria in intraabdominal sepsis to augment morbidity and possibly mortality.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

TI  == ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole.
AB  == ciprofloxacin has a reduced activity against anaerobic pathogens. therefore, a combination of ciprofloxacin with an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, such as metronidazole, seems to be interesting for the treatment of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections. high metronidazole concentrations (10 mg/l or 40 mg/l) neither affected the bactericidal efficacy of ciprofloxacin on aerobic pathogens, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, nor on the anaerobic pathogens clostridium  perfringens and clostridium difficile, as demonstrated by kill-kinetic curves. the same high concentrations, as well as lower therapeutically achievable concentration (2 mg/l or 5 mg/l) of metronidazole in combination with ciprofloxacin were slightly more potent for the tested clostridia than ciprofloxacin or metronidazole alone.

TI  == contribution of the microflora to proteolysis in the human large intestine.
AB  == protease activities in human ileal effluent were approximately 20-fold greater than in normal faeces. comparative studies with faeces from a person who did not  have a pancreas suggested that a substantial proportion of the proteolytic activity in normal faeces was of bacterial origin. thimerosal, iodoacetate, edta  and cysteine significantly inhibited proteolysis in faeces, but not in small intestinal contents, showing that cysteine and metalloproteases were produced by  bacteria in the large gut. these results, together with results from studies using p-nitroanilide substrates, demonstrated that faecal proteolysis was both qualitatively and quantitatively different from that in the small intestine. studies with pure cultures of proteolytic gut bacteria indicated that the cell-bound proteases of bacteroides fragilis-type organisms were likely to contribute significantly towards proteolytic activity associated with the washed  cell fraction and washed particulate fraction of faeces. extracellular proteases  were formed by streptococcus faecalis st6, propionibacterium acnes p6, clostridium perfringens c16, cl. bifermentans c21 and cl. sporogenes c25. inhibition results suggested that these bacteria, and similar organisms, may be partly responsible for the extracellular proteolytic activity found in the cell-free supernatant fraction of faeces.

TI  == effect of infection with eimeria tenella upon the cecal bacterial population in monoflora chickens.
AB  == monoflora chickens were established at 2 days of age by an oral inoculation with  one of six species of bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, or streptococcus faecalis) and were infected with eimeria tenella (5 x 10(4) oocysts per bird) 2 days later. there were two experimental groups for each bacterium: birds infected with bacteria alone and birds infected with a combination of bacteria and e. tenella. seven days after e. tenella infection, counts of b. thermophilum in the cecal contents were significantly lower for e. tenella-infected birds than for those infected by b. thermophilum alone, whereas  10 days after e. tenella infection, counts were higher for e. tennella-infected birds. the population of l. acidophilus in the cecal contents of the e. tenella-infected chickens 10 days after inoculation was significantly greater than that in uninfected chickens. no significant differences were observed between the numbers of b. vulgatus, c. perfringens, and s. faecalis in cecal contents of groups with and without e. tenella infections.

TI  == an evaluation of various working practices in shops selling raw and cooked meats.
AB  == three groups of premises (butchers' shops, supermarkets and general dealers) which sell raw and cooked meats were compared. salmonellas were not detected, but escherichia coli, and to a lesser degree staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus  faecalis, were widely distributed in all three groups of premises. contamination  of hands, towels and nail brushes was related to poor working practices. the presence of e. coli or str. faecalis on slicing machines was associated with contamination of meat samples. a number of wiping cloths were heavily contaminated with e. coli, and many also contained clostridium perfringens. fewer premises provided written cleaning plans, and in many cases staff did not receive an adequate training in food hygiene. the use of disinfectants as part of the cleaning process did not necessarily reduce the level of bacterial contamination. in general there was poor correlation between microbiological results and a visual inspection made by an environmental health officer. the possible reasons for this finding are discussed.

TI  == the efficacy of pefloxacin in comparison to gentamicin in the treatment of experimentally induced peritonitis in rats.
AB  == a reproducible experimental model of intra-abdominal infections in rats has been  devised in order to stimulate intra-abdominal sepsis in patients. pre-operatively, the rats were fed with lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal flora to one similar to that of humans. a 1 cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. the intestine was then divided at  each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-to-end anastomosis. the segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. this experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of pefloxacin alone and in combination with metronidazole with the combination gentamicin and metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. seventy per cent of the untreated animals died within two days. within three days 40% of the animals  receiving pefloxacin died. animals treated with pefloxacin plus metronidazole or  gentamicin plus metronidazole had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. only 5% of these animals died. thus the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole seems to be as successful as gentamicin plus metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == [problems of maintaining hygienic and microbiological quality standards in the production of foodstuffs, particularly those of vegetable origin. second report:  demands regarding hygiene and microbiology-theory is useless without practice (author's transl)].
AB  == many legal regulations exist on the hygienic-microbiological properties of food products. the 'lander-speiseeisverordnungen' (county ice cream regulations), the  'diat-verordnung' (dietary regulation) and the 'trinkwasser-verordnung' (regulation on potable water) are examples for the frequent inadequacies inherent in these regulations. caution is indicated against any new proposals for the establishment of additional hygienic-microbiological regulations without sufficient practice-related reasoning unless a revision and improvement of inadequate, already existing regulations has been carried out. practicable procedures have to be prepared not only to maintain the hygiene in catering facilities, but also for the evaluation of food products and raw materials according to hygienic-microbiological criteria: although commonly assumed, the 'microbe counts' alone are not sufficient for the determination of the hygienic conditions. therefore, inspite of all the weak points inherent in quality control procedures - e. g. possible sick, co-workers, only random sample control of raw material supplies - such adapted systems (good manufacturing practice) have to be enforced with special emphasis on the economy of the control expenditure, interdisciplinary aspects, governmental control and consumer information. examples from literature and own experience demonstrate that the importance of the 'fecal indicators' for the judgement of 'hygienic conditions' in food production are rather limited and a correct evaluation only by 'bacterial plate counts' is not possible due to the variation of germ density within one sample. microbiological investigations of food products according to statistic rules require such an expenditure that they cannot generally be used as routine control procedures. a possible documentation is shown which allows - even without statistic investigations, at least retrospectively - the preparation of a survey  on the microbiological properties of raw materials generally available on the market and which makes it possible to recognize and reject any unqualified microbiological limiting value requirements.

AB  == the survival of pure cultures of escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens, and vibrio parahaemolyticus under simulated deep-sea conditions of low temperature (4 c), seawater, and hydrostatic pressures ranging  from 1 to 1,000 atm was determined over a period exceeding 300 h. the viability of e. coli and total aerobic bacteria in seawater-diluted raw sewage subjected to these deep-sea conditions was also measured. there was a greater survival of both e. coli and s. faecalis at 250 and 500 atm than at 1 atm at 4 c. s. faecalis was  quite insensitive to 1,000 atm, whereas with e. coli there was a 10-fold die-off  per 50-h exposure to 1,000 atm. in contrast, v. parahaemolyticus and c. perfringens were quite sensitive to pressures exceeding 250 atm, and with both of these species there was a total loss of viability of approximately 10(8) cells per ml within 100 h at 1,000 arm and within 200 h at 500 atm. the viability of the naturally occurring fecal coliforms in sewage exposed to moderate pressures at 4 c was found to be similar to the survival patterns demonstrated with pure cultures of e. coli. the total numbers of aerobic bacteria in these sewage samples, however, stabilized at 500 and 1,000 atm after 100 h, and at 1 and 250 atm there was significant growth of sewage-associated bacteria, which apparently  utilized the organic compounds in the seawater-diluted sewage samples. a preliminary classification of some of these bacteria indicated that approximately 90% (160 isolates) of the organisms that survived over a 400-h exposure to 500 and 1,000 atm were arthrobacter/corynebacterium species, and the representative organisms capable of growing at 1 and 250 atm in seawater at 4 c were gram-positive cellulose digesters and an unidentified gram-negative coccus. the significance of these results with respect to the contamination of the deep ocean with human pathogens and the possibility of sewage-associated microorganisms growing and competing with indigenous marine microbial flora in situ is discussed.

AB  == comparisons of the starch-gel patterns of uninoculated aseptic control samples from rabbit and pig muscle with similar samples inoculated and incubated with clostridium perfringens, salmonella enteritidis, achromobacter liquefaciens, and  kurthia zopfii were made. results indicated that c. perfringens caused extensive  alteration in the proteins or enzymes, or both, of the sarcoplasmic fraction of porcine muscle, whereas s. enteritidis and s. faecalis caused complete breakdown  of only myoglobin. neither a. liquefaciens nor k. zopfii showed any measurable amount of proteolysis in the sarcoplasmic fraction from pig muscle. although some of the bands in the starch-gel pattern of rabbit muscle decreased in size and intensity of staining, complete proteolysis of any protein fraction was absent for all test organisms. the disc-gel patterns of the 8 m urea-soluble proteins showed that c. perfringens caused extensive proteolysis in pig muscle and a lesser extent of proteolysis in rabbit muscle. none of the other organisms utilized in this study had any measurable effect upon the urea-soluble proteins.  in addition, a simple procedure for aseptic isolation of muscle samples for studying meat spoilage is outlined. results indicate that careful sanitation and  cleanliness will give suitable samples for meat spoilage investigations.

TI  == the biohydrogenation of alpha-linolenic acid and oleic acid by rumen micro-organisms.
AB  == 1. alpha-[u-(14)c]linolenic acid was incubated with the rumen contents of sheep and the metabolic products were characterized by thin-layer chromatography, gas-liquid chromatography and absorption spectroscopy in the ultraviolet and infrared. 2. a tentative scheme for the biohydrogenation route to stearic acid is presented. the main pathway is through diconjugated cis-cis-cis-octadecatrienoic  acid, non-conjugated trans-cis (cis-trans)-octadecadienoic acid and trans-octadecenoic acid, but other pathways are apparent. 3. washed rumen micro-organisms possessed only a limited capacity to hydrogenate alpha-linolenic  acid and oleic acid but the rate was greatly stimulated by a factor(s) present in the supernatant rumen liquor. 4. pure cultures of clostridium perfringens, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and a coliform organism isolated from sheep faeces possessed negligible ability to hydrogenate unsaturated fatty acids  compared with a mixed population of rumen micro-organisms. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens slowly converted linoleic acid into octadecenoic acid.

TI  == rearing of germfree and monocontaminated chicks in rigid plastic isolators.
AB  == a plexiglas isolator for rearing germfree vertebrates is described. plastic components were precut and finished by a plexiglas supplier. this equipment is relatively inexpensive; moreover, neither special facilities nor skills are required in their construction. advantages of this type of isolator are: readily  dismantled for cleaning, durable, excellent visibility of the interior, and minimal maintenance. in 30 separate groups of animals, 27 of these yielded germfree chicks. many of these chicks were reared germfree for 4 weeks; and several were maintained for about 2 months, without microbial contamination. pure cultures of candida albicans, streptococcus faecalis, and clostridium perfringens were established as monocontaminations in the intestinal tracts of chickens. in contrast, alcaligenes faecalis atcc 9220 failed to grow in the gut of chicks, following peroral administration of this organism. all chicks described were employed on other experiments, and were killed for various assays at times specified.
