TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == uv-c-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular methods used for identification of oral streptococci and related microorganisms.
AB  == the oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. the oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. the 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by vitek system using gram-positive identification cards. species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for pcr identification of isolates. sequencing of 16s rrna was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. vitek system identified a number of 11 strains as s. mitis/oralis,  12 strains as s. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as s. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3  strains as s. salivarius, 3 strains as s. plurianimalium, 1 strain as s. cristatus and 1 strain as s. alactolyticus, respectively. the pcr system targeting gtf genes was able to identify s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. gordonii strains. sequence of 16s rrna discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides. many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) including streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult cf patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates  of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these  isolates to belong to 12 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis,  s. cristatus, s. gordonii, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis. the most frequently vgs organism isolated was s. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by s. mitis (36/190; 19%), s. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), s. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), s. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), s. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), s. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), s. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), s. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), s. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), s. australis (1/190; 0.5%), s. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and s. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). all, but four, patients harboured at least one vgs species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. there was no clonality at the subspecies level employing eric rapd pcr. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. overall, resistance to penicillin with all vgs was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. with regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which  equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. in addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-cf population comprising 12 individuals (50 vgs isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. in comparison, 8% and 38% of vgs isolates from non-cf individuals were resistant by  disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. none of the non-cf vgs organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.

TI  == molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(b) and mef(a)] in streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == objectives: although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within cf airways has not yet been examined. we therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. methods: erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (vgs) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and vgs [n = 84; i.e. streptococcus salivarius  (n = 30), streptococcus mitis (n = 17), streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), streptococcus oralis (n = 10), streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), streptococcus infantis (n = 3), streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult cf patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for  at least the previous 7 months. results: almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. the majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(b) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(a) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(e) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(b) and mef(e) genes simultaneously  in 11/99 (11.1%). these results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in vgs in adult cf patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. conclusions: long-term treatment with azithromycin in cf patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal vgs, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.

TI  == heritability of oral microbial species in caries-active and caries-free twins.
AB  == oral microbes that colonize in the mouths of humans contribute to disease susceptibility, but it is unclear if host genetic factors mediate colonization. we therefore tested the hypothesis that the levels at which oral microbes colonize in the mouth are heritable. dental plaque biofilms were sampled from intact tooth surfaces of 118 caries-free twins. an additional 86 caries-active twins were sampled for plaque from carious lesions and intact tooth surfaces. using a reverse capture checkerboard assay the relative abundance of 82 bacterial species was determined. an integrative computational predictive model determined  microbial abundance patterns of microbial species in caries-free twins as compared to caries-active twins. heritability estimates were calculated for the relative microbial abundance levels of the microbial species in both groups. the  levels of 10 species were significantly different in healthy individuals than in  caries-active individuals, including, a. defectiva, s. parasanguinis, s. mitis/oralis, s. sanguinis, s. cristatus, s. salivarius, streptococcus sp. clone  ch016, g. morbillorum and g. haemolysans. moderate to high heritability estimates were found for these species (h(2) = 56%-80%, p < .0001). similarity of the overall oral microbial flora was also evident in caries-free twins from multivariate distance matrix regression analysis. it appears that genetic and/or  familial factors significantly contribute to the colonization of oral beneficial  species in twins.

TI  == relationship between the ability of oral streptococci to interact with platelet glycoprotein ibalpha and with the salivary low-molecular-weight mucin, mg2.
AB  == the oral streptococci streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis are common aetiological agents of infective endocarditis, and their ability to adhere to and induce the aggregation of platelets is thought to be a virulence trait. the platelet glycoprotein gpibalpha has been implicated  as the adhesion receptor for s. sanguinis and s. gordonii, but it is not known if this is the case for s. oralis and other species. the aim of this study was to determine the gpibalpha-interactive capability of a range of oral streptococci and to determine the relationship between this capability and their ability to interact with the salivary constituents that they would encounter in their normal habitat. all platelet-adhesive s. sanguinis strains and most s. gordonii strains  adhered in a gpibalpha-dependent manner, but strains of s. oralis, streptococcus  cristatus, streptococcus parasanguinis and streptococcus mitis had no direct affinity for platelets. those strains that were able to bind gpibalpha also bound to the low-molecular-weight submandibular salivary mucin, mg2, and this interaction was sialic acid-dependent. the data suggest that s. sanguinis and s.  gordonii may be efficient colonizers of platelet vegetations because of their adaptation to recognize sialylated salivary mucins. in contrast, s. oralis does not interact with platelets and so is likely to colonize vegetations through an as yet unidentified mechanism.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15  species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr  products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and  by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna  patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis,  streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.
