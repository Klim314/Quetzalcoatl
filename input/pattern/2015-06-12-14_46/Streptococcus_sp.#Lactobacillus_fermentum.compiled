TI  - Screening of Probiotic Candidates in Human Oral Bacteria for the Prevention of Dental Disease.
AB  - The oral cavity in healthy subjects has a well-balanced microbiota that consists  of more than 700 species. However, a disturbance of this balance, with an increase of harmful microbes and a decrease of beneficial microbes, causes oral disorders such as periodontal disease or dental caries. Nowadays, probiotics are expected to confer oral health benefits by modulating the oral microbiota. This study screened new probiotic candidates with potential oral health benefits and no harmful effects on the oral cavity. We screened 14 lactobacillus strains and 36 streptococcus strains out of 896 oral isolates derived from healthy subjects. These bacteria did not produce volatile sulfur compounds or water-insoluble glucan, had higher antibacterial activity against periodontal bacteria, and had higher adherence activity to oral epithelial cells or salivary-coated hydroxyapatite in vitro. We then evaluated the risk of primary cariogenicity and infective endocarditis of the selected oral isolates. As a result, Lactobacillus crispatus YIT 12319, Lactobacillus fermentum YIT 12320, Lactobacillus gasseri YIT 12321, and Streptococcus mitis YIT 12322 were selected because they showed no cariogenic potential in an artificial mouth system and a lower risk of experimental infective endocarditis in a rat model. These candidates are expected as new probiotics with potential oral health benefits and no adverse effects on general health.
TI  - An assessment of adhesion, aggregation and surface charges of Lactobacillus strains derived from the human oral cavity.
AB  - There is limited information concerning the adhesion and aggregation of human oral lactobacilli. In this study, the adhesion of 10 Lactobacillus species was investigated using H357 oral keratinocyte cells as an in vitro model for oral mucosa. Coaggregation with the representative oral pathogen, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, and the physicochemical cell properties was also evaluated. The results demonstrated significant variations in adhesion (42-96%) and aggregation (autoaggregation, 14-95%; coaggregation, 19-65%). All strains showed a high affinity for chloroform, and most strains had a moderate-to-high hydrophobicity. All strains, except Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus gasseri, showed a moderate affinity for ethyl acetate. There was a strong association of autoaggregation with coaggregation (rs = 0.883, P < 0.001). The highest mean for autoaggregation (74%) and coaggregation (47%) belonged to the Lact. gasseri strains. Correlations between the adhesion and surface characteristics and aggregation were observed among the Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus paracasei strains; however, there was a variation in the strains properties within and between species. This study indicated that the Lact. gasseri, Lact. fermentum, and Lact. paracasei strains might be potential probiotics for the human oral cavity given their desirable properties. It should also be emphasized that a selective process for probiotic strains is required. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Adhesion to host tissues and bacterial aggregation (auto- and coaggregation) are the highly important criteria for selecting strains with probiotic potential. These abilities are commonly involved with surface-charged characteristics. This is the first study to investigate the oral Lactobacillus species using an oral keratinocyte cell line. Significant results were found for the correlations between the adhesion and surface charge characteristics and for aggregation among certain strains of Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus paracasei. This observation could be useful when collecting background information for the selection of probiotic strains for use in oral health.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  - The water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical Italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving Brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. In this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable LAB isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. Samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of Brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculineC. The LAB were characterized by Gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of CO2 from glucose. The diversity of LAB was evaluated by RAPD-PCR (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction), 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and by Vitek 2 system. Twenty LAB strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different clusters, and identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus helveticus. Enterococcus species were dominant and citrate-positive. Only the strains of L. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and L. fermentum produced CO2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while L. casei was only citrate positive. This is the first report which elucidates the LAB diversity involved in Brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. Furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the LAB species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.
TI  - Streptococcus mitis induces conversion of Helicobacter pylori to coccoid cells during co-culture in vitro.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a major gastric pathogen that has been associated with humans for more than 60,000 years. H. pylori causes different gastric diseases including dyspepsia, ulcers and gastric cancers. Disease development depends on several factors including the infecting H. pylori strain, environmental and host factors. Another factor that might influence H. pylori colonization and diseases is the gastric microbiota that was overlooked for long because of the belief that human stomach was a hostile environment that cannot support microbial life. Once established, H. pylori mainly resides in the gastric mucosa and interacts with the resident bacteria. How these interactions impact on H. pylori-caused diseases has been poorly studied in human. In this study, we analyzed the interactions between H. pylori and two bacteria, Streptococcus mitis and Lactobacillus fermentum that are present in the stomach of both healthy and gastric disease human patients. We have found that S. mitis produced and released one or more diffusible factors that induce growth inhibition and coccoid conversion of H. pylori cells. In contrast, both H. pylori and L. fermentum secreted factors that promote survival of S. mitis during the stationary phase of growth. Using a metabolomics approach, we identified compounds that might be responsible for the conversion of H. pylori from spiral to coccoid cells. This study provide evidences that gastric bacteria influences H. pylori physiology and therefore possibly the diseases this bacterium causes.
TI  - Effectiveness of the two microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 and Lactobacillus plantarum LP01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis. BV is not accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. In contrast, aerobic vaginitis (AV) is predominantly associated with Escherichia coli, but Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus are also involved. Standard treatment of BV consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. The main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and recurrences. This study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize G. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit E. coli, thus identifying a possible use in AV. The second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by BV using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to hinder the growth of G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection 10231. The bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with Lactobacillus plantarum LP01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with BV. The 2 microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 (DSM 26955) and L. plantarum LP01 (LMG P-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. The amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. The women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. A clinical examination was performed and the Nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). A statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. RESULTS: L. fermentum LF15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. In the human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01, significantly reduced the Nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, P<0.001). Eight women (33.3%) recorded a Nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. At the end of the second month, only 4 women registered a Nugent score >7, definable as BV (16.7%, P=0.065 compared with d28). In the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. CONCLUSIONS: BV, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. Furthermore, BV is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. This study suggests the ability of the 2 strains L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01 to counteract acute Gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. This could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against Gardnerella on the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. Furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. In the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against E. coli, their prospective use in AV could also prove interesting.
TI  - Investigation of probiotic bacteria as dental caries and periodontal disease biotherapeutics.
AB  - Oral diseases, specifically dental caries and periodontal disease, are characterised by increases in pathogenic microorganisms, increased demineralisation and increased inflammation and levels of inflammatory markers. Despite the therapeutic strategies, oral diseases have elevated prevalence rates. Recent work has demonstrated that probiotic bio-therapeutics can decrease oral pathogen counts, including caries-causing Streptococcus mutans and oral inflammation. The aim of this work was to investigate putative probiotic bacteria, selected for S. mutans inhibition and for their oral health-promoting characteristics. The probiotic bacteria were screened for S. mutans inhibition, probiotic bacteriocin activity, salivary pH modulation, probiotic nutrient (sucrose) competition, probiotic co-aggregation with S. mutans, bacterial attachment to oral epithelial keratinocytes, bacterial nitric oxide production and bacterial antioxidant activity. The results indicate that Lactobacillus reuteri strains NCIMB 701359, NCIMB 701089, NCIMB 702655 and NCIMB 702656 inhibited S. mutans to non-detectable levels (<10 cfu/ml). L. reuteri strains also demonstrated the highest antioxidant capacity of the tested strains (7.73-13.99 microM Trolox equivalents), suggesting their use as both caries and periodontal disease therapeutics. Although Lactobacillus fermentum NCIMB 5221 inhibited S. mutans at lower levels, it significantly buffered the pH (4.18) of saliva containing S. mutans, co-aggregated with S. mutans (10.09%), demonstrated high levels of sucrose consumption (138.11 mM) and successfully attached to gingival epithelial cells (11%). This study identified four L. reuteri strains and one L. fermentum strain to be further investigated as oral disease biotherapeutics.
TI  - Bacterial profile of dentine caries and the impact of pH on bacterial population  diversity.
AB  - Dental caries is caused by the release of organic acids from fermentative bacteria, which results in the dissolution of hydroxyapatite matrices of enamel and dentine. While low environmental pH is proposed to cause a shift in the consortium of oral bacteria, favouring the development of caries, the impact of this variable has been overlooked in microbial population studies. This study aimed to detail the zonal composition of the microbiota associated with carious dentine lesions with reference to pH. We used 454 sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4 region) to compare microbial communities in layers ranging in pH from 4.5-7.8 from 25 teeth with advanced dentine caries. Pyrosequencing of the amplicons yielded 449,762 sequences. Nine phyla, 97 genera and 409 species were identified from the quality-filtered, de-noised and chimera-free sequences. Among the microbiota associated with dentinal caries, the most abundant taxa included Lactobacillus sp., Prevotella sp., Atopobium sp., Olsenella sp. and Actinomyces sp. We found a disparity between microbial communities localised at acidic versus neutral pH strata. Acidic conditions were associated with low diversity microbial populations, with Lactobacillus species including L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus and L. crispatus, being prominent. In comparison, the distinctive species of a more diverse flora associated with neutral pH regions of carious lesions included Alloprevotella tanerrae, Leptothrix sp., Sphingomonas sp. and Streptococcus anginosus. While certain bacteria were affected by the pH gradient, we also found that approximately 60% of the taxa associated with caries were present across the investigated pH range, representing a substantial core. We demonstrated that some bacterial species implicated in caries progression show selective clustering with respect to pH gradient, providing a basis for specific therapeutic strategies.
TI  - Effect of two probiotic strains of Lactobacillus on in vitro adherence of Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - The lactobacilli probiotics maintain a normal vaginal biota and prevent disease recurrence. This microorganisms form a pellicle on the vaginal epithelium that acts as a biologic barrier against colonization by pathogenic bacteria. In this paper were realized assays of exclusion, competition, and displacement. For these test, vaginal epithelial cells, two strains of lactobacilli and pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes) were used. The lactobacilli strains showed a great capacity of adherence, with a mean of 83.5 +/- 26.67 Lactobacillus fermentum cells and 56.2 +/- 20.87 Lactobacillus rhamnosus cells per vaginal epithelial cells. L. fermentum and L. rhamnosus were able to reduce the adherence of S. aureus, S. agalactiae and L. monocytogenes in a significant level in this assay (P < 0.01). The lactobacilli used in this study protect the vaginal epithelium through a series of barriers and interference mechanisms. The aim of present study was to assess the ability of vaginal Lactobacillus strains, selected for their probiotic properties, to block the adherence of pathogenic microorganisms in vitro by displacement, competition, and exclusion mechanisms.
TI  - Detection and partial characterization of a bacteriocin-like substance produced by Lactobacillus fermentum CS57 isolated from human vaginal secretions.
AB  - Lactobacilli (150) from human vaginal secretions were tested for the production of antimicrobial substances which can provide a physiological defense against the pathogenic microorganisms in the vaginal area. Sixteen of the isolates (10.6%) showed antibacterial activity against one or several closely related microorganisms used as indicators. Lactobacillus fermentum CS57 was the best producer and secretes a bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) with antagonistic activity against Streptococcus agalactiae and Candida albicans. The compound was susceptible to the proteolytic enzymes and was heat labile. The mode of action was identified as bactericidal. The crude activity of the L. fermentum CS57 BLS was linked to a substance with a molecular weight larger than 30 kDa. Plasmid analysis of L. fermentum CS57 revealed the presence of a plasmid band with molecular weight of 54.7 kb. All L. fermentum CS57 non-producer variants (BLS-) obtained by curing experiments, showed loss of plasmid band and were susceptible to the BLS of the original strain. Therefore antimicrobial activity and immunity production seem to be linked to genes located on that same plasmid. Taking into account our results, L. fermentum CS57 could be considered a candidate for potential use as probiotic for the prophylaxis of vaginal human infections.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and capacity for biofilm formation of different bacteria isolated from endodontic infections associated with root-filled teeth.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To date, a variety of microbial species have been isolated from endodontic infections. However, endodontic clinical bacterial isolates have not been sufficiently characterized with regard to their capacity for antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. In this study, antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation of 47 different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates, belonging to 32 different species previously isolated from infected filled root canals, were studied. METHODS: Antibiotic sensitivity to 11 antibiotics including penicillin G, amoxicillin, clindamycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, fosfomycin, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin was tested using the standardized Etest method (Bio Merieux, Marcy-1'Etoile, France). The antibiotic sensitivity of 4 control strains was also estimated in parallel. Additionally, the capacity to form biofilms was quantified using the microtiter plate test. RESULTS: Different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species were either resistant against a number of antibiotics or showed high minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics. Five aerobic and 2 anaerobic isolates, including Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus fermentum, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Prevotella buccae, and Propionibacterium acidifaciens, were characterized as being high biofilm producers, whereas 8 aerobic and 3 anaerobic isolates were found to be moderate biofilm producers. Most isolates with resistance or markedly high minimal inhibitory concentration values were also either moderate biofilm producers or high biofilm producers. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the clinical significance of endodontic infections could include that they serve as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, endodontic treatment should consider the adhesion and biofilm formation by a variety of bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic growth effects of Lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  - As lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. However, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. The antagonistic growth effects of Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. Both Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. The higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. The inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. Moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, Lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than Lactobacillus salivarius. However, the fermentative broth of Lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of Lactobacillus salivarius. These data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.
TI  - [Characterization of a probiotic Lactobacillus strain isolated from oral cavity].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: From oral cavity we isolated and characterized probiotic lactobacilli  that could probability be applied to therapy and prevention of oral diseases. METHODS: Lactobacillus strains were isolated by plating the saliva and dental plaque of healthy donors on selective medium. Then the target strains were tested for inhibiting the growth of a Streptococcus mutans strain belonging to cariogenic pathogen species. Other properties such as production of extracellular polysaccharide and resistance to the antibacterial substances were also investigated. RESULTS: Lactobacillus fermentum Y29, a strain with antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, was obtained from dental plaque. This strain was an extracellular polysaccharide producer, which corresponds to its aggregation ability. Moreover, L. fermentum Y29 showed resistance to 1.0 mg/mL lysozyme and 140 microg/g hydrogen peroxide that may guarantee its persistence in the complex oral niche. CONCLUSION: Probiotic properties were characterized of an oral isolate L. fermentum Y29, which provided a possibility for its application in prevention and treatment of oral diseases.
TI  - Prevalence of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus fermentum and their association with caries and dietary habits in preschool Thai children.
AB  - AIMS: To detect the prevalence of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus fermentum in plaque obtained from severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) and caries-free (CF) groups and to assess any association between their prevalence, feeding habits and oral hygiene practices within each group. STUDY DESIGN: Sixty-four supra-gingival plaque samples were collected from S-ECC and CF groups (CF = 30, S-ECC = 34). All participants were asked about feeding habits and oral hygiene care behaviour by direct questionnaire. METHODS: After DNA extraction, S. mutans and L. fermentum were amplified using standard PCR. Nested PCR was performed as a second identification method for S. mutans. RESULTS: Mean age in CF and S-ECC was 2.29 +/- 0.42 and 2.49 +/- 0.41 years, respectively. Mean dmft in S-ECC was 4.51 +/- 0.72. By standard PCR, no S. mutans was detected in CF group, while 10 % was detected in S-ECC group. By nested PCR, S. mutans was detected for 48 and 50 % in CF and S-ECC, respectively. L. fermentum was detected for 16 and 40 % in CF and S-ECC, respectively. CONCLUSION: Nested PCR gave a higher detection frequency than standard PCR but not significant (p </= 0.05). The prevalence of S. mutans was not different between the two groups, while the prevalence of L. fermentum was significantly associated with S-ECC (p </= 0.05).
TI  - Incidence of Bacteriocins Produced by Food-Related Lactic Acid Bacteria Active towards Oral Pathogens.
AB  - In the present study we investigated the incidence of bacteriocins produced by 236 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) food isolates against pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic oral bacteria. This set of LAB contained several strains (>/=17%) producing bacteriocins active against food-related bacteria. Interestingly only Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was able to inhibit the growth of Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii, while Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC 179 and Lactobacillus plantarun ACA-DC 269 produced bacteriocins solely against Streptococcus oralis. Thus, the percentage of strains that were found to produce bacteriocins against oral bacteria was ~1.3%. The rarity of bacteriocins active against oral LAB pathogens produced by food-related LAB was unexpected given their close phylogenetic relationship. Nevertheless, when tested in inhibition assays, the potency of the bacteriocin(s) of S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 against the three oral streptococci was high. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy combined with principal component analysis revealed that exposure of the target cells to the antimicrobial compounds caused major alterations of key cellular constituents. Our findings indicate that bacteriocins produced by food-related LAB against oral LAB may be rare, but deserve further investigation since, when discovered, they can be effective antimicrobials.
TI  - Development of a multiplex real time PCR to detect thermophilic lactic acid bacteria in natural whey starters.
AB  - A multiplex real time PCR (mRealT-PCR) useful to rapidly screen microbial composition of thermophilic starter cultures for hard cooked cheeses and to compare samples with potentially different technological properties was developed. Novel primers directed toward pheS gene were designed and optimized for multiple detection of Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus fermentum. The assay was based on SYBR Green chemistry followed by melting curves analysis. The method was then evaluated for applications in the specific detection of the 4 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in 29 different natural whey starters for Parmigiano Reggiano cheese production. The results obtained by mRealT-PCR were also compared with those obtained on the same samples by Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) and Length-Heterogeneity PCR (LH-PCR). The mRealT-PCR developed in this study, was found to be effective for analyzing species present in the samples with an average sensitivity down to less than 600 copies of DNA and therefore sensitive enough to detect even minor LAB community members of thermophilic starter cultures. The assay was able to describe the microbial population of all the different natural whey starter samples analyzed, despite their natural variability. A higher number of whey starter samples with S. thermophilus and L. fermentum present in their microbial community were revealed, suggesting that these species could be more frequent in Parmigiano Reggiano natural whey starter samples than previously shown. The method was more effective than LH-PCR and FISH and, considering that these two techniques have to be used in combination to detect the less abundant species, the mRealT-PCR was also faster. Providing a single step sensitive detection of L. helveticus, L. delbrueckii, S. thermophilus and L. fermentum, the developed mRealT-PCR could be used for screening thermophilic starter cultures and to follow the presence of those species during ripening of derived dairy products. A major increase in understanding the starter culture contribution to cheese ecosystem could be harnessed to control cheese ripening and flavor formation.
TI  - Bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy Ethiopian infants.
AB  - The objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from faecal samples of healthy Ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. One hundred fifty LAB were obtained from 28 healthy Ethiopian infants. The isolates belonged to Lactobacillus (81/150), Enterococcus (54/150) and Streptococcus (15/150) genera. Lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while Enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. Bacteriocin-producing LAB species were isolated from eight of the infants. Many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from Streptococcus salivarius, avicin A (class IIa) from Enterococcus avium, one class IIa bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from E. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from Lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin T from Lactobacillus gasseri isolate. Susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. The streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. All enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. Only one E. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. Tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to E. faecalis (47 %) and Enterococcus faecium (33 %). Screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. The structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being E. faecalis and Enterococcus raffinosus. This study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal LAB of Ethiopian infants while virulence factors occur at low levels.
TI  - The dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of Obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - Obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from Uganda namely: Obutoko, Enturire, Ekitiribita and Obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. Knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. Culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and mixed DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified ribosomal RNA genes were used to study the bacteria and yeast diversity of Obushera. The pH dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire whereas that of Ekitiribita decreased to 4.4 after 4 days. Counts of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. LAB and yeast isolates were identified by rRNA gene sequence analysis. LAB isolates included: Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus (Lb.) plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus (S.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Weisella (W.) confusa. DGGE indicated predominance of S. gallolyticus, S. infantarius subsp. infantarius, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, W. confusa, Lb. reuteri, Fructobacillus spp., L. lactis and L. lactis. Yeast isolates included Clavispora lusitaniae, Cyberlindnera fabianii, Issatchenkia orientalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DGGE indicated predominance of S. cerevisiae in Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire and also detected Pichia spp. and I. orientalis in Obutoko. Obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by Enterobacteriaceae and later by Lactococcus spp. Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillus spp. were also detected in Ekitiribita. Development of starters for Obushera may require combinations of LAB and S. cerevisiae for Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire and LAB for Ekitiribita.
TI  - The microbiology of Bandji, palm wine of Borassus akeassii from Burkina Faso: identification and genotypic diversity of yeasts, lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIM: To investigate physicochemical characteristics and especially genotypic diversity of the main culturable micro-organisms involved in fermentation of sap from Borassus akeassii, a newly identified palm tree from West Africa. METHODS AND RESULTS: Physicochemical characterization was performed using conventional methods. Identification of micro-organisms included phenotyping and sequencing of: 26S rRNA gene for yeasts, 16S rRNA and gyrB genes for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and acetic acid bacteria (AAB). Interspecies and intraspecies genotypic diversities of the micro-organisms were screened respectively by amplification of the ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2/16S-23S rDNA ITS regions and repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR). The physicochemical characteristics of samples were: pH: 3.48-4.12, titratable acidity: 1.67-3.50 mg KOH g(-1), acetic acid: 0.16-0.37%, alcohol content: 0.30-2.73%, sugars (degrees Brix): 2.70-8.50. Yeast included mainly Saccharomyces cerevisiae and species of the genera Arthroascus, Issatchenkia, Candida, Trichosporon, Hanseniaspora, Kodamaea, Schizosaccharomyces, Trigonopsis and Galactomyces. Lactobacillus plantarum was the predominant LAB species. Three other species of Lactobacillus were also identified as well as isolates of Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Fructobacillus durionis and Streptococcus mitis. Acetic acid bacteria included nine species of the genus Acetobacter with Acetobacter indonesiensis as predominant species. In addition, isolates of Gluconobacter oxydans and Gluconacetobacter saccharivorans were also identified. Intraspecies diversity was observed for some species of micro-organisms including four genotypes for Acet. indonesiensis, three for Candida tropicalis and Lactobacillus fermentum and two each for S. cerevisiae, Trichosporon asahii, Candida pararugosa and Acetobacter tropicalis. CONCLUSION: fermentation of palm sap from B. akeassii involved multi-yeast-LAB-AAB cultures at genus, species and intraspecies level. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: First study describing microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of palm wine from B. akeassii. Genotypic diversity of palm wine LAB and AAB not reported before is demonstrated and this constitutes valuable information for better understanding of the fermentation which can be used to improve the product quality and develop added value by-products.
TI  - Investigation of vaginal microbiota in sexually active women using hormonal contraceptives in Pakistan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies report association of contraceptives with moderate increase in urinary tract infection among sexually active premenopausal women. The aim of our study was to find out whether the use of hormonal contraceptives has any effect on microbiota of the vagina in the contraceptives users in Khairpur Sindh Pakistan. METHODS: A prospective study in woman population of Khairpur Sindh Pakistan aged 20-30 years and 31-40 years, using Hormonal contraceptives was carried out. High vaginal swab samples (n = 100) were collected from the test populations as well as control group (n = 100) and investigated for vaginal microbial flora using standard microbiological and biochemical techniques. RESULTS: Vaginal swabs culturing from hormonal contraceptives users in the age group 20-30 years showed statistically insignificant Candida sp (10% samples), and statistically significant (p < 0.05) Staphylococcus saprophyticus. (18% samples), Streptococcus agalactiae (23% samples), Escherichia coli (28% samples) and Lactobacillus fermentum (32% samples). In the age group 31-40 years, statistically significant percentage of samples (p < 0.05) showed Lactobacillus fermentum (28%), Candida sp (24%), and E. coli, (24%) where statistically insignificant samples showed Staphylococcus saprophyticus (13%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (11%). CONCLUSIONS: The use of hormonal contraceptives alters the normal microbiota of vagina in women according to the age. Lactobacillus fermentum appeared as the predominant species followed by E. coli among the age group of 20-30 years and, Lactobacillus fermentum, Candida sp and E. coli as predominant among women of age group 31-40 years when compared to corresponding control groups. An inverse relationship between E. coli and Lactobacillus fermentum was observed in the women aged 20-30 years.
TI  - Bacterial antagonism against periodontopathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study is to compare the prevalence of commensal bacteria, with beneficial properties, for healthy and diseased individuals and additionally to examine the inhibitory effect of some commercial dietary probiotics on periodontopathogens, comparing this inhibitory effect to that of orally derived beneficial bacteria. METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples from 35 patients (healthy and periodontitis patients) were analyzed. Growth inhibition of the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was examined using the agar overlay technique and agar well diffusion method. The quantification of the inhibitory effect was checked with the agar well diffusion method. RESULTS: Using the agar overlay technique, the prevalence of strains antagonistic toward P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and F. nucleatum was found to be higher in healthy individuals than in individuals with periodontitis, but this could not be validated by the agar well diffusion assay. Compared with the antagonistic activity of the isolated strains, the probiotic strains overall showed a stronger inhibition of the periodontal pathogens. CONCLUSION: It was shown that some oral bacteria can cause antagonism toward periodontopathogens, and these observations underline the therapeutic potential of applications that stimulate oral health by the application of beneficial effector strains.
TI  - Shifts in the microbial population in relation to in situ caries progression.
AB  - The shift in microbial diversity from young to mature plaque, related to caries activity on sound and restored surfaces, was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. During a 20-week in situ study on caries progression 8 subjects wearing restored and unrestored dentin and enamel sections, biofilm was sampled after 1 and 20 weeks (young or mature plaque). A higher microbial diversity (mature plaque) was seen in caries-active compared to caries-free subjects. Rothia dentocariosa and Scardovia inopinata were absent from all caries-free sites, but appeared in 50% of the caries-active sites.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of Thai oral streptococci, lactobacilli and pediococci.
AB  - This work was to assess the isolation and identification of Thai oral bacteria. Seventeen viridans group streptococci (VGS) and seventeen lactic acid bacteria from saliva were characterization based on their morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics and the 16S RNA gene sequences analysis. The Gram-positive cocci in chains of viridans group comprised of six isolates (Group I) were identified as Streptococcus gordonii, 6 isolates (Group II) were Streptococcus salivarius, 4 isolates (Group III) were Streptococcus sanguis and one isolate (Group IV) was Streptococcus mutans. Seventeen lactic acid bacterial isolates were Gram-positive and catalase negative. They did not contained diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan. They were divided into four groups, the rod-shaped in Group A (11 isolates) and Group B (2 isolates) which were identified as Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus salivarius, respectively. The tetrad-forming cocci in Group C (3 isolates) and Group D (1 isolate) were identified as Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus, respectively.
TI  - Molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and in situ amylase expression during traditional fermentation of cereal foods.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria play an important role in traditional fermented foods consumed in different countries. Study of their taxonomic structure and diversity is necessary for starter culture selection, improved safety and nutritional enhancement. To achieve these objectives, microbial genomic typing methods were used to study genetic differences of autochthonous bacteria and their distribution in two traditional African fermented cereal foods. A total of 85 predominant bacterial species were isolated from ogi and kunu-zaki obtained from Northern and Southern geographical region of Nigeria. They were identified using combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on rpoA, pheS and atpA genes as well as M13-PCR gel fingerprints. The results showed that Lactobacillus fermentum was the most frequently isolated species in ogi (71.4%) and kunu-zaki (84.5%). Other species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) identified were Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Non lactic acid bacteria isolated from these foods were species belonging to the Bacillus and Staphylococcus. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) analysis of the M13-PCR fingerprints for LAB strains showed clonal diversity among strains of the same species. In vitro and in situ expression of amylase gene during fermentation by amylolytic L. plantarum ULAG11 was detected, indicating the potential usefulness of such species for development of starter cultures and for controlled fermentation processes.
TI  - Monitoring of the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Soy sauce is a traditional seasoning produced through the fermentation of soybeans and wheat using microbes. In this study, the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process were analyzed by PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The bacterial DGGE profile indicated that the bacterial microbes in the koji were Weissella cibaria (Weissella confusa, Weissella kimchii, Weissella salipiscis, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus iners, or Streptococcus thermophilus), Staphylococcus gallinarum (or Staphylococcus xylosus), and Staphylococcus kloosii. In addition to these bacteria, Tetragenococcus halophilus was also detected in the mash during lactic acid fermentation. The fungal DGGE profile indicated that the fungal microbes in the koji were not only Aspergillus oryzae but also several yeasts. In the mash, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii appeared in the early fermentation stage, Candida etchellsii (or Candida nodaensis) and Candida versatilis were detected at the middle fermentation stage, and Candida etchellsii was detected at the mature fermentation stage. These results suggest that the microbial communities present during the soy sauce manufacturing process change drastically throughout its production. This is the first report to reveal the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process using a culture-independent method.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of MTAD and nisin in combination against common pathogens associated with root canal infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many pathogenic microorganisms were found in an infected root canal. The object of this study was to evaluate the effect of MTAD in combination with nisin on the pathogens associated with root canal infection. METHODS: The survival rates of 9 pathogenic bacteria were determined after 1-, 5-, and 10-minute treatment with MTAD, MTAN (substitution of doxycycline with nisin), and MTADN (nisin in combination with doxycycline). The survival rates of Enterococcus faecalis in the starvation phase and pretreatment alkalization as well as in the normal physiological state under MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN challenge for 1, 5, and 10 minutes were evaluated and compared. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphologic modification of Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus paracasei, and Porphyromonas gingivalis after MTAD and MTADN treatment. RESULTS: L. fermenti, L. paracasei, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, Streptococcus gordonii, and Peptostreptococcus were more sensitive to MTADN and MTAN than to MTAD. MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN showed a rapid antibacterial effect on P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Enterococcus faecalis in the stress state was as sensitive to MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN as the control E. faecalis. Furthermore, in the observation of scanning electron microscopy, the membranes in A. naeslundii and L. paracasei presented significant rupture, and P. gingivalis did not exhibit significant damage after MTADN treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MTAD in combination with nisin improved antibacterial efficacy against pathogens, especially for some gram-positive bacteria associated with persistent intracanal infection. Therefore, the combination had the potential to be used as an effective intracanal irrigation.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus oligofermentans sucrose metabolism demonstrates reduced pyruvic and lactic acid production.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus (S.) oligofermentans is a newly identified bacteria with a yet to be defined mechanism of sucrose metabolism that results in acid production. This study aimed to investigate the biochemical mechanisms of S. oligoferm-entans glucose metaolism. METHODS: The S. oligofermentans LMG21532, Lactobacillus (L.) fermentum 38 and the S. mutans UA140 were used to characterize sucrose metabolism by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and lactic acid production. Continuous dynamics and high performance capillary electrophoresis were used to determine LDH activity and lactic acid production, respectively, from bacteria collected at 0, 10 and 30 minutes after cultured in 10% sucrose. RESULTS: These analyses demonstrated that LDH activity of the three bacterial strains examined remained stable but significantly different throughout the sucrose fermentation process. The S. oligofermentans LDH activity ((0.61 +/- 0.05) U/mg) was significantly lower than that of L. fermentum ((52.91 +/- 8.97) U/mg). In addition, the S. oligofermentans total lactate production ((0.048 +/- 0.021) mmol/L) was also significantly lower than that of L. fermentum ((0.958 +/- 0.201) mmol/L). Although the S. oligofermentans LDH production was almost double of that produced by S. mutans ((0.32 +/- 0.07) U/mg), lactic acid production was approximately one sixth that of S. mutans ((0.296 +/- 0.058) mmol/L). Additional tests examining pyruvic acid production (the LDH substrate) demonstrated that lactic acid concentrations correlated with pyruvic acid production. That is, pyruvic acid production by S. oligofermentans was undetectable following sucrose incubation, however, (0.074 +/- 0.024) and (0.175 +/- 0.098) mmol/L pyruvic acid were produced by S. mutans and L. fermentum, respectively. CONCLUSION: S. oligofermentans is incapable of fermenting carbohydrates to produce enough pyruvic acid, which results in reduced lactic acid production.
TI  - [Development of pulsed field gel electrophoresis and application for characterization and identification of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method for molecular typing of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) and to apply it in identification and characterization of both bacteria isolated from yoghurt collected from Beijing supermarket. METHODS: The five most useful restriction enzymes including Apa I, Not I, Sfi I, Xba I and Sma I were chosen to cut DNA of 52 strains of Lactobacillus, S. thermophilus as well as associated standard bacteria strains. The endonucleases and electrophoresis conditions for PFGE analysis were optimized and applied in molecular typing of Lactobacillus and S.thermophilus isolates. Cluster analysis based on the PFGE data was conducted. The identification results of PFGE were compared with those obtained in biochemical and 16s ribosomal RNA PCR identification tests. RESULTS: Not I was suitable for L. bulgaricus, L. fermentum and L. delbrueckii digestion. While Apa I was an appropriate endonuclease for S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus and L. casei digestion. The results of molecular typing indicated that 24 strains of L.bulgaricus and 15 strains of S. thermophilus were grouped into 8 types by PFGE method, respectively. While 7 strains of L.acidophilus were grouped into 3 types and 2 strains of L. delbrueckii were grouped into 2 different PFGE types. CONCLUSION: The results of PFGE analysis are in compliance with those of 16s rRNA PCR and biochemical identification. The PFGE method developed in this study is suitable for molecular characterization of both Lactobacillus and S. thermophilus.
TI  - Synergistic effect between two bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances produced by Lactobacilli Strains with inhibitory activity for Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) are bacterial species that colonize the vagina in pregnant women and as such may cause serious infections in neonates that passed through the birth channel. The objective of this work was to study the inhibitory activities produced by each bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) of Lactobacillus rhamnosus L60 and Lactobacillus fermentum L23, and the effects of the combined BLIS-es of these lactobacilli on GBS. The interactions between the BLIS-es were assessed by qualitative and quantitative methods on agar plates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) were determined by a modification of the broth microdilution and checkerboard methods, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibilities of all S. agalactiae strains were assayed and the results of these tests were evaluated for statistical significance. A 7.5% of GBS isolates were recovered from 760 pregnant women and 91% of those strains were susceptible to each BLIS produced by L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, and also to a mixture of them. The comparisons among the BLIS-es showed statistically significant differences, with a combination of the BLIS-es from the two Lactobacillus species being better than the BLIS of each one alone (P < 0.05) as GBS growth inhibitors. Synergistic activities between the BLIS-es were found on 100% of susceptible GBS strains, MICs ranges of BLIS of L23 and L60 were 80-160 and 160-320 UA ml(-1), respectively. By the checkerboard method, the BLIS-es combination showed synergistic effect on all sensitive strains tested, with values of FICs ranging from 0.131 to 0.218. The BLIS-es produced by these lactobacilli of vaginal origin were able to inhibit S. agalactiae isolates. The results indicate that these strains may have probiotic potential for the control of GBS in women and may consequently prevent GBS infections in newborns.
TI  - Effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  - Food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. This study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape seed extract (GSE) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a GSE fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (GSE-M). On the other hand, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the GSE fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (GSE-O) fraction. Within bifidobacteria, Bifidobacterium lactis BB12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas Bifidobacterium breve 26M2 and Bifidobacterium bifidum HDD541 reached maximum growth in presence of GSE-O and GSE-M fractions. Metabolism of flavan-3-ols by LAB and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. The results revealed that only L. plantarum IFPL935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. An unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in L. plantarum IFPL935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus fermentum (195), Lactobacillus salivarius (53), Lactobacillus casei (20), Lactobacillus gasseri (18), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), Lactobacillus paracasei (12), Lactobacillus mucosae (12), Lactobacillus oris (12), Lactobacillus plantarum (11) and Lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. Inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. Most oral Lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. The strongest inhibitory activity was associated with Lact. paracasei, Lact. plantarum, Lact. rhamnosus, Lact. casei and Lact. salivarius. Lactobacillus SD1-SD6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 in the biofilm model. Also, it was demonstrated that growth of Strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with Lact. paracasei SD1. The inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. CONCLUSIONS: The results have shown that oral Lactobacillus SD1-SD6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against Strep. mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, Gram-negative periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results indicated that Lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in Mongolia.
AB  - Spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in Mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in Mongolia. The LAB counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/mL. Fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of LAB, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. In total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. Each isolate was considered to be presumptive LAB based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. All isolates from Mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), Enterococcus durans (3 strains), Lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), Lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), Lactobacillus casei (16 strains), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), Lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), Lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), Lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), Leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and Weissella cibaria (1 strain). The predominant LAB were Strep. thermophilus and Lb. helveticus, which were isolated from all sampling sites. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Mongolia have complex compositions of LAB species. Such diversity of LAB provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.
TI  - The anti-biofouling effect of Lactobacillus fermentum-derived biosurfactant against Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Biofouling in the oral cavity often causes serious problems. The ability of Streptococcus mutans to synthesize extracellular glucans from sucrose using glucosyltransferases (gtfs) is vital for the initiation and progression of dental caries. Recently, it was demonstrated that some biological compounds, such as secondary metabolites of probiotic bacteria, have an anti-biofouling effect. In this study, S. mutans was investigated for the anti-biofouling effect of Lactobacillus fermentum (L.f.)-derived biosurfactant. It was hypothesized that two enzymes produced by S. mutans, glucosyltransferases B and C, would be inhibited by the L.f.-biosurfactant. When these two enzymes were inhibited, fewer biofilms (or none) were formed. RNA was extracted from a 48-h biofilm of S. mutans formed in the presence or absence of L.f. biosurfactant, and the gene expression level of gtfB/C was quantified using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). L.f. biosurfactant showed substantial anti-biofouling activity because it reduced the process of attachment and biofilm production and also showed a reduction in gtfB/C gene expression (P value < 0.05).
TI  - Development of a pentaplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. helveticus, L. fermentum in whey starter for Grana Padano cheese.
AB  - A pentaplex PCR assay for the rapid, selective and simultaneous detection of Lactobacillus helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and L. fermentum, was developed. The target sequences were a group of genes coding for beta-galactosidase production (S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), for cell-enveloped associated proteinase synthesis (L. helveticus), for dipeptide transport system production (L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and for arginine-ornithine antiporter protein production (L. fermentum). The analytical specificity of the assay was evaluated with 5 reference strains and 140 lactic acid bacterial strains derived from raw milk cheeses and belonging to the Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Lactococcus and Enterococcus genera. The identification limit for each target strain was 10(3)CFU/ml. This new molecular assay was used to investigate the LAB population by direct extraction of DNA from the 12 whey cultures for Grana Padano. The pentaplex PCR assay revealed a good correspondence with microbiological analyses and allowed to identify even minor LAB community members which, can be out-competed in vitro by numerically more abundant microbial species.
TI  - The effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. METHODS: Twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (MS) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. The polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. Stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. The samples were cultured for MS, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. A part of the samples were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: Actinomyces naeslundii, A. viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. paracasei, L. rhamnose, L. plantarum, Streptococcus gordonii, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, Veillonella parvula. RESULTS: The MS counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (P<.01) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. Also the plaque MS percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (P<.01). The salivary MS counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. Nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. The DNA-DNA hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced MS counts in plaque but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. While the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping the intestinal microbiota is limited. In this study, LAB were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in Syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in Syria. A total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and identified by comparative 16S rDNA sequencing and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analyses. Thirty six different species of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Weissella and Pediococcus were identified. RAPD and MALDI-TOF-MS patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. Whereas some species were unique for one source, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. Interestingly, identical RAPD genotypes of L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis and P. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. Diversity of RAPD types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical transfer of intestinal LAB from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented West African cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  - In this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in Nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. In particular, PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. DNA sequencing of the highly variable V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes obtained from PCR-DGGE fingerprints identified species related to Weissella confusa, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus amylolyticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bacillus spp. and Lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. A more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16S rRNA gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the Lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the Streptococcaceae family. Interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. For example, L. plantarum, L. pantheris and L. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while W. confusa, Streptococcus lutetiensis and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. Phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.
TI  - Phylogenetic group- and species-specific oligonucleotide probes for single-cell detection of lactic acid bacteria in oral biofilms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) probes for the single-cell detection and enumeration of lactic acid bacteria, in particular organisms belonging to the major phylogenetic groups and species of oral lactobacilli and to Abiotrophia/Granulicatella. RESULTS: As lactobacilli are known for notorious resistance to probe penetration, probe-specific assay protocols were experimentally developed to provide maximum cell wall permeability, probe accessibility, hybridization stringency, and fluorescence intensity. The new assays were then applied in a pilot study to three biofilm samples harvested from variably demineralized bovine enamel discs that had been carried in situ for 10 days by different volunteers. Best probe penetration and fluorescent labeling of reference strains were obtained after combined lysozyme and achromopeptidase treatment followed by exposure to lipase. Hybridization stringency had to be established strictly for each probe. Thereafter all probes showed the expected specificity with reference strains and labeled the anticipated morphotypes in dental plaques. Applied to in situ grown biofilms the set of probes detected only Lactobacillus fermentum and bacteria of the Lactobacillus casei group. The most cariogenic biofilm contained two orders of magnitude higher L. fermentum cell numbers than the other biofilms. Abiotrophia/Granulicatella and streptococci from the mitis group were found in all samples at high levels, whereas Streptococcus mutans was detected in only one sample in very low numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Application of these new group- and species-specific FISH probes to oral biofilm-forming lactic acid bacteria will allow a clearer understanding of the supragingival biome, its spatial architecture and of structure-function relationships implicated during plaque homeostasis and caries development. The probes should prove of value far beyond the field of oral microbiology, as many of them detect non-oral species and phylogenetic groups of importance in a variety of medical conditions and the food industry.
TI  - Characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  - The study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from fermented foods in Xi'an, China. LAB strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of Lactobacillus (n = 73), and Streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16S rRNA gene. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and S. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). Some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. Minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of Lactobacillus. The erm(B) gene was detected from two strains of each of L. fermentum and L. vaginalis, and one strain of each of L. plantarum, L. salivarius, L. acidophilus, L. animalis, and S. thermophilus. The tet genes were identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. This is the first time, the authors identified tet(S) gene from L. brevis and L. kefiri. The erm(B) gene from L. fermentum NWL24 and L. salivarius NWL33, and tet(M) gene from L. plantarum NWL22 and L. brevis NWL59 were successfully transferred to Enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. It was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in Xi'an, China and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria fermentation of human milk oligosaccharide components, human milk oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides.
AB  - Human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. In infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (GOSs) are added to replace HMOs. This study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus reuteri, Streptococcus thermophilus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest HMO components, defined HMOs, and GOSs. All strains grew on lactose and glucose. N-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in L. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in all strains. Both hetero- and homofermentative LAB utilized N-acetylglucosamine via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. plantarum were the most versatile in hydrolysing pNP analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined HMOs. Whole cells of all six LAB hydrolysed oNP-galactoside and pNP-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. High beta-galactosidase activity of L. reuteri, L. fermentum, S. thermophilus and L. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and GOS hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of lactose and GOSs by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that LAB beta-galactosidases are involved in GOS digestion. In summary, the strains of LAB used were not capable of utilizing complex HMOs but metabolized HMO components and GOSs.
TI  - Microbiota of dentinal caries as assessed by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to identify the microbiota of different layers  of dentinal caries by using a culture-independent molecular biology approach. METHODS: DNA was extracted from samples taken from 3 distinct layers (superficial, middle and deep) of advanced occlusal caries and analyzed for the presence and relative levels of 28 oral bacterial species/phylotypes using a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. RESULTS: The mean number of target taxa per layer was 7.7 (+/- 3.96) in the superficial, 7 (+/- 3.4) in the middle, and 6.3 (+/- 3.04) in the deep layer. No statistical significance was observed for these differences (p = 0.36). Overall, the most prevalent taxa in the 3 layers were Atopobium genomospecies C1 (72.5%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (69%), Lactobacillus casei (68%), Veillonella species (55%) and Lactobacillus fermentum (52%). No differences were found in the prevalence rates of the most frequent target species in the 3 layers. The most prevalent taxa found at levels above 10(5) in the advanced front line of deep-dentin caries were Atopobium genomospecies C1, F. nucleatum, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus species and Veillonella species. CONCLUSION: The present results revealed that the prevalences of several established or candidate caries pathogens do not differ significantly in the different zones of dentinal caries lesions. The finding that some as-yet-uncharacterized species and novel species were found in high frequencies join other molecular studies to include them in the set of candidate caries pathogens.
TI  - [Isolation and identification of probiotics from yoghourt in Beijing].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To carry out isolation and the viable plate count of probiotics from yoghourt. To investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of strains to penicillin, gentamicin, ampicillin, vancomycin, clindamycin and erythromycin. METHODS: Probiotics were recovered and counted from yoghourt by plate count method. The recovered isolates were characterized by Gram's stain, biochemical test, antimicrobial susceptibility test. RESULTS: MRS medium and (36 +/- 1) degrees C were the optimum condition of culture. In total, 52 probiotic isolates were recovered from 31 yoghourt products, 12 (38.7%) products showed a lower probiotic quantity than 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml of the national stantard, and 19 (61.3%) products were higher than 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml. Gram's stain showed that 37 isolates were gram positive bacilli and 15 isolates were positive coccus. These 52 isolates were grouped into six species by biochemical method, including L. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. All 52 isolates were susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin, one isolate was resistant to both clindamycin and erythromycin, four isolates were resistant to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Most of yoghourt products contained sufficient viable probiotics as required by the national standard. A small quantity of isolates were resistant to some antimicrobials and multi -drug resistant isolates were also found.
TI  - [Identification of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus by PCR amplification and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a PCR method for identifying the 16S rRNA of Lactobacillus  and Streptococcus thermophilus at the species level. METHODS: Optimizing the method for DNA extraction and the conditions for PCR amplification. Joining the PCR amplification products from 16S rRNA to plasmid puc18-T and detecting the sequence. RESULTS: All 50 isolates recovered from yoghourt products were characterized by 16S rRNA sequence analysis and 7 groups were identified as L. bulgaricus (24 strains), S. thermophilus (12 strains), L. acidophilus (7 strains), L. casei (3 strains), L. delbrueckii (2 strains), L. fermentum (1 strain) and S. lutetiensis (1 strain). CONCLUSION: 16S rRNA PCR method developed in this research is a sensitive and reliable method for the identification of both Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Target DNA bands were identified according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. Comigrating bands present in the DGGE profiles were resolved by species-specific PCR. The results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. The dominant lactic acid bacteria included Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. Frequently encountered bacterial species were Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus kitasatonis, and Lactobacillus kefiri. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus buchneri, and Lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. In addition, L. buchneri, L. jensenii, and L. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for the first time in the Xinjiang koumiss. Furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on M17, de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe, Halligan-Pearce, and Kenner fecal media. The results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained by the DGGE analysis. This is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.
TI  - Characterization of a novel LysM domain from Lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The endolysin Lyb5, from Lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phiPYB5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria. Sequence analysis revealed that the C terminus of the endolysin Lyb5 (Ly5C) contained three putative lysin motif (LysM) repeat regions, implying that Ly5C was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. To investigate the potential of Ly5C for surface display, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to Ly5C at its N or C terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. After being mixed with various cells in vitro, GFP was successfully displayed on the surfaces of Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lb. brevis, Lb. plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus cells. Increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated L. lactis and Lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for Ly5C. Moreover, the pH and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of GFP-Ly5C, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. All results suggested that Ly5C was a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (LAB). To demonstrate the applicability of the Ly5C-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) from Paenibacillus sp. strain K1, replacing GFP, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of LAB cells via Ly5C. The success in surface display of GFP and beta-Gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in LAB.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria associated with the production of plaa-som, a traditional fermented fish product of Thailand.
AB  - Plaa-som is a Thai fermented fish product for which whole fish or fish fillets are fermented with either cooked rice or steamed sticky rice, salt, and garlic. A total of 762 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated during plaa-som fermentation by culture on CaCO(3)-MRS agar plates. They were screened and grouped by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), giving six groups that were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing as Lactococcus garvieae, Streptococcus bovis, Weissella cibaria, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus fermentum. Freshly mixed ingredients contained low populations of LAB (less than 10 CFU/g) that subsequently grew during fermentation to final populations of approximately 10(7)CFU/g. Early stages of the process were dominated by the presence of Lc. garvieae, S. bovis, and W. cibaria. At 48 h into fermentation, W. cibaria, P. pentosaceus, and Lb. plantarum were prevalent, and gave way to a dominance of Lb. plantarum that completed the fermentation. A mixture of these LAB species could be considered as species for development of a starter culture for plaa-som fermentation.
TI  - Microbial risk markers for childhood caries in pediatricians' offices.
AB  - Dental caries in pre-school children has significant public health and health disparity implications. To determine microbial risk markers for this infection, this study aimed to compare the microbiota of children with early childhood caries with that of caries-free children. Plaque samples from incisors, molars, and the tongue from 195 children attending pediatricians' offices were assayed by 74 DNA probes and by PCR to Streptococcus mutans. Caries-associated factors included visible plaque, child age, race, and snacking habits. Species were detected more frequently from tooth than tongue samples. Lactobacillus gasseri (p < 0.01), Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus vaginalis, and S. mutans with Streptococcus sobrinus (all p < 0.05) were positively associated with caries. By multifactorial analysis, the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus was negatively associated with caries. Prevotella nigrescens was the only species (p < 0.05) significantly associated with caries by the 'false discovery' rate. Analysis of the data suggests that selected Lactobacillus species, in addition to mutans streptococci, are risk markers for early childhood caries.
TI  - Genotypic characterization of non starter lactic acid bacteria involved in the ripening of artisanal Bitto PDO cheese.
AB  - Bitto of Valchiavenna, an artisanal Italian cheese produced without the addition  of any starter cultures, has been attributed a protected designation origin (PDO) cheese, but the strain composition of the natural microbial population colonizing this traditional dairy product is still unknown. To obtain preliminary information on the non starter lactic acid bacteria involved in its ripening, a total of 136 NSLAB isolates, randomly selected from MRS and M17 agar plates, were collected from three different cheese samples after 120 days of ripening. The new isolates were identified by combining PCR 16S-23S rDNA spacer analyses, partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing, species-specific probes and colony hybridization. Eighty-two isolates, representing 60% of the total strains selected, were homofermentative cocci: 83% of them were enterococci, with Enterococcus durans being the predominant species found. Pediococcus spp. were also isolated, together with strains of Streptococcus thermophilus. Within lactobacilli, 57% of the isolates were identified as Lactobacillus paracasei; Lact. curvatus, Lact. plantarum, Lact. fermentum, were present in a lower amount. The isolates were differentiated at strain-level by Rep-PCR analysis. This is the first effort to microbiological characterization of Valchiavenna's Bitto; the results suggest the possibility of preserving the wild bacterial population in order to protect the typical organoleptic characteristics of this traditional raw milk cheese and to select new strains for the dairy industry.
TI  - Screening of lactic acid bacteria from Indonesia reveals glucansucrase and fructansucrase genes in two different Weissella confusa strains from soya.
AB  - Homopolysaccharide (glucan and fructan) synthesis from sucrose by sucrase enzymes in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) has been well studied in the genera Leuconostoc, Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. This study aimed to identify and characterize genes encoding glucansucrase/glucosyltransferase (GTF) and fructansucrases/fructosyltransferase (FTF) enzymes from genomic DNA of 'rare' Indonesian exopolysaccharide-producing LAB. From a total of 63 exopolysaccharide-producing LAB isolates obtained from foods, beverages and environmental samples, 18 isolates showing the most slimy and mucoid colony morphologies on sucrose were chosen for further study. By comparing bacterial growth on De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS)-sucrose with that on MRS-raffinose, and using the results of a previous PCR screening study with degenerate primer pairs targeting the conserved catalytic domain of GTFs, various strains were identified as producers of fructan (13), of glucan only (five) or as potential producers of both glucan and fructan (nine). Here, we report the characteristics of three gtf genes and one ftf gene obtained from Weissella confusa strains MBF8-1 and MBF8-2. Strain MBF8-1 harbored two putative gtf genes with high sequence similarity to GTFB of Lactobacillus reuteri 121 and GTF180 of L. reuteri 180, respectively. Strain MBF8-2 possessed single gtf and ftf genes with high sequence similarity to GTFKg3 of Lactobacillus fermentum Kg3 and DSRWC of Weissella cibaria, and FTF levansucrase of L. reuteri 121, respectively.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Tarhana, a traditional Turkish fermented food.
AB  - Tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in Turkey. The aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated during processing of Tarhana. Samples were collected from eight different regions of Turkey. In order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of Tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. A total of 226 Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from MRS, M17 and SBM (Slanetz and Bartley Medium). The isolates were grouped and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-PCR fingerprinting [(GTG)(5) primer], multiplex PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. Pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of the isolates, 19% were identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as Lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as Enterococcus faecium, 7% as Pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as Weissella cibaria, 2% as Lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as Leuconostoc citreum, 1% as Lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as Lactobacillus casei. The different production sites investigated all had individual LAB profiles, but with P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. The main source of P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus was found to be the yogurt.
TI  - Culture-based PCR analysis of plaque samples of Japanese school children to assess the presence of six common cariogenic bacteria and its association with caries risk.
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the presence of six common cariogenic bacteria from Cariostat-inoculated plaque samples of Japanese elementary school children through PCR analysis and check its associations with caries risk testing the validity of Cariostat as a caries risk assessment tool. This epidemiological school-based study investigated plaque samples of 399 Japanese elementary school children. Assessed using the Cariostat, 48.2% of the children had high caries risk. DNA detection of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum and both S. mutans and S. sobrinus was seen in 65.2%, 24.1%, 69.7%, 17.5%, 7.8%, 19.3%, and 17.3% of the participants, respectively. Except for S. salivarius, the presence of all other investigated bacteria resulted in a statistically significant increase among the proportion of subjects with high caries risk. Caries risk assessed using Cariostat was significantly influenced by the presence of cariogenic bacteria. Being a selective medium for cariogenic bacteria, the Cariostat can be a useful and direct source of cariogenic bacterial DNA for PCR analysis while effectively assessing caries risk.
TI  - Lactobacillus fermentum BCS87 expresses mucus- and mucin-binding proteins on the  cell surface.
AB  - AIMS: To identify and characterize adhesion-associated proteins in the potential  probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum BCS87. METHODS AND RESULTS: Protein suspensions obtained from the treatment of Lact. fermentum BCS87 with 1 mol 1(-1) LiCl were analysed by Western blotting using HRP-labelled porcine mucus and mucin. Two adhesion-associated proteins with relative molecular weight of 29 and 32 kDa were identified. The N-terminal and internal peptides of the 32 kDa protein (32-Mmubp) were sequenced, and the corresponding gene (32-mmub) was found by inverse polymerase chain reaction. The complete nucleotide sequence of 32-mmub revealed an open reading frame of 903 bp encoding a primary protein of 300 amino acids and a mature protein of 272 residues. A basic local alignment search showed 47-99% identity to solute-binding components of ATP binding cassette transporter proteins in Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Clostridium. An OpuAC-conserved domain was identified and phylogenetic relationship analysis confirmed that 32-Mmubp belongs to the OpuAC family. CONCLUSIONS: Adhesion of Lact. fermentum BCS87 appeared to be mediated by two surface-associated proteins. 32-Mmubp is a component of ABC transporter system that also functions as an adhesin. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Characterization of 32-Mmubp and 32-mmub will contribute to understanding the host-bacteria interactions of Lact. fermentum with the intestinal tract of pigs.
TI  - A qualified presumption of safety approach for the safety assessment of Grana Padano whey starters.
AB  - A Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) approach was applied to dominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) associated with Grana Padano cheese whey starters. Thirty-two strains belonging to Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus fermentum, and representing the overall genotypic LAB diversity associated with 24 previously collected whey starters [Rossetti, L., Fornasari, M.E., Gatti, M., Lazzi, C., Neviani, E., Giraffa, G., 2008. Grana Padano cheese whey starters: microbial composition and strain distribution. International Journal of Food Microbiology 127, 168-171], were analyzed. All L. helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and S. thermophilus isolates were susceptible to four (i.e. vancomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and erythromycin) of the clinically most relevant antibiotics. One L. fermentum strain displayed phenotypic resistance to tetracycline (Tet(R)), with MIC of 32 microg/ml, and gentamycin (Gm(R)), with MIC of 32 microg/ml. PCR was applied to this strain to test the presence of genes tet(L), tet(M), tet(S), and aac(6')-aph(2')-Ia, which are involved in horizontal transfer of Tet(R) and Gm(R), respectively but no detectable amplification products were observed. According to QPS criteria, we conclude that Grana cheese whey starters do not present particular safety concerns.
TI  - A traditional Sudanese fermented camel's milk product, Gariss, as a habitat of Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius.
AB  - Samples of the traditional Sudanese fermented camel's milk product Gariss representing 9 different regions in Sudan were microbiologically characterized using an integrated approach including phenotypic and genotypic methods. Lactic acid bacteria [log(CFU/g)=7.76-8.66] and yeasts [log(CFU/g)=6.05-7.79] were detected in high numbers. A total of 180 LAB isolates were identified of which 123 isolates were found to belong to the Streptococcus bovis group. Thirteen representative isolates were characterized by PCR amplification and sequencing of the housekeeping genes rpoB and sodA and the streptococcal glucosyltransferase gene (gtf). All thirteen isolates were identified as Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, a potential human pathogen. The gene encoding the virulence determinant gtf was detected in 10 of the 13 tested strains. The same isolates were able to survive exposure to 0.3% (w/v) oxgall for 4 h and pH=2.7 for 1-4 h. Also Lactobacillus fermentum were detected in high numbers, whereas Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus helveticus were detected more occasionally. The yeast microflora in all Gariss samples consisted of Kluyveromyces marxianus and Issatchenkia orientalis with the former being predominant in 7 out of 9 samples.
TI  - Grana Padano cheese whey starters: microbial composition and strain distribution.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the species composition and the genotypic strain heterogeneity of dominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from whey starter cultures used to manufacture Grana Padano cheese. Twenty-four Grana Padano cheese whey starters collected from dairies located over a wide geographic production area in the north of Italy were analyzed. Total thermophilic LAB streptococci and lactobacilli were quantified by agar plate counting. Population structure of the dominant and metabolically active LAB species present in the starters was profiled by reverse transcriptase, length heterogeneity-PCR (RT-LH-PCR), a culture-independent technique successfully applied to study whey starter ecosystems. The dominant bacterial species were Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus fermentum. Diversity in the species composition allowed the whey cultures to be grouped into four main typologies, the one containing L. helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and S. thermophilus being the most frequent one (45% of the cultures analyzed), followed by that containing only the two lactobacilli (40%). Only a minor fraction of the cultures contained L. helveticus alone (4%) or all the four LAB species (11%). Five hundred and twelve strains were isolated from the 24 cultures and identified by M13-PCR fingerprinting coupled with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Most of the strains were L. helveticus (190 strains; 37% of the total), L delbrueckii subsp. lactis (90 strains; 18%) and S. thermophilus (215 strains; 42%). This result was in good agreement with the qualitative whey starter composition observed by RT-LH-PCR. M13-PCR fingerprinting indicated a markedly low infra-species diversity, i.e. the same biotypes were often found in more than one culture. The distribution of the biotypes into the different cultures was mainly dairy plant-specific rather than correlated with the different production areas.
TI  - Microflora of Feta cheese from four Greek manufacturers.
AB  - The components of the microflora of four Feta cheeses, produced by different Greek manufacturers, were determined by culture dependent and independent techniques. Isolates from microbiological media were first grouped by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and then representatives of each DGGE group were sequenced for identification purposes. DNA and RNA, extracted directly from the cheese, were subjected to PCR-DGGE. Moreover, Feta cheeses were subjected to FISH analysis in order to identify viable bacterial populations. The microbial ecology, as represented by the Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and yeast populations, was different for the four cheeses. The main LAB species isolated were Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus coryniformis and Lactobacillus fermentum. However, some inconsistencies were observed between the results obtained with the culture dependent and the culture independent approach. In the case of the yeasts, the results obtained by PCR-DGGE compared very well with those obtained by the conventional microbiological analysis and the main species found were Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia fermentans and C. zeylanoides. FISH analysis highlighted viable but not culturable populations of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus spp. RAPD-PCR performed on the L. plantarum isolates revealed a cheese specific distribution and a temperature dependent clustering.
TI  - Rapid identification of the three major species of dairy obligate heterofermenters Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus parabuchneri by species-specific duplex PCR.
AB  - In this study, the biodiversity of 154 strains of lactic acid bacteria, including 112 dairy product isolates presumptively identified as obligately heterofermentative lactobacilli (OHL) by classical microbiological tests, as well as 23 OHL-type strains, was investigated by PCR-based methods and gene sequencing. Using these techniques, 51% of the cheese isolates were actually identified as OHL. The non-OHL isolates were identified to the Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Weisella, Pediococcus or Streptococcus genera. Among the OHL cheese isolates, five species were directly identified including three of the most frequently isolated species -Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus parabuchneri and Lactobacillus brevis- and two rarely isolated species - Lactobacillus diolivorans and Lactobacillus reuteri. A sixth group made up of two dairy isolates was also identified and according to 16S rRNA gene and intergenic spacer region (ISR) sequencing data corresponded to Lactobacillus sp. and may constitute a new species. Species-specific primers were designed for the rapid and reliable detection of the three most frequently isolated species by species-specific duplex PCR.
TI  - Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC 179 displays probiotic potential in vitro and protects against trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis and Salmonella infection in murine models.
AB  - Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC 179, Lactobacillus plantarum ACA-DC 287 and Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 were studied for their probiotic potential. Firstly, strains were screened for antimicrobial activity towards a broad range of target strains, including lactic acid bacteria, food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. L. fermentum ACA-DC 179 was active against five streptococci, including the two pathogenic strains Streptococcus oralis LMG 14532T and Streptococcus pneumoniae LMG 14545T. S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was active against the majority of the strains tested, including not only lactic acid bacteria but also many food spoilage or pathogenic species. The three potential probiotic strains were found to survive variably at pH 2.5 and were unaffected by bile salts. Only S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 exhibited bile salt hydrolase activity, while none of the strains was haemolytic. Moreover, strains exhibited variable susceptibility towards commonly used antibiotics. L. plantarum ACA-DC 287 and S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 induced the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Also elevated levels of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 were observed with L. fermentum ACA-DC 179. This strain consequently was found to significantly reduce colitis in a TNBS-induced colitis mouse model. Furthermore, L. fermentum ACA-DC 179 was successfully applied in an experimental Salmonella-infection mouse model. To conclude, strain L. fermentum ACA-DC 179 possesses desirable probiotic properties, such as antimicrobial activity and immunomodulation in vitro, which were confirmed in vivo by the use of animal models.
TI  - Yeasts and lactic acid bacteria microbiota from masau (Ziziphus mauritiana) fruits and their fermented fruit pulp in Zimbabwe.
AB  - Masau are Zimbabwean wild fruits, which are usually eaten raw and/ or processed into products such as porridge, traditional cakes, mahewu and jam. Yeasts, yeast-like fungi, and lactic acid bacteria present on the unripe, ripe and dried fruits, and in the fermented masau fruits collected from Muzarabani district in Zimbabwe were isolated and identified using physiological and molecular methods. The predominant species were identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Issatchenkia orientalis, Pichia fabianii and Aureobasidium pullulans. A. pullulans was the dominant species on the unripe fruits but was not isolated from the fermented fruit pulp. S. cerevisiae and I. orientalis were predominant in the fermented fruit pulp but were not detected in the unripe fruits. S. cerevisiae, I. orientalis, P. fabianii and S. fibuligera are fermentative yeasts and these might be used in the future development of starter cultures to produce better quality fermented products from masau fruit. Lactic acid bacteria were preliminary identified and the predominant strains found were Lactobacillus agilis and L. plantarum. Other species identified included L. bifermentans, L. minor, L. divergens, L. confusus, L. hilgardii, L. fructosus, L. fermentum and Streptococcus spp. Some of the strains of LAB could also potentially be used in a mixed-starter culture with yeasts and might contribute positively in the production of fermented masau fruit products.
TI  - Nonstarter Lactobacillus strains as adjunct cultures for cheese making: in vitro  characterization and performance in two model cheeses.
AB  - Nonstarter lactic acid bacteria are the main uncontrolled factor in today's industrial cheese making and may be the cause of quality inconsistencies and defects in cheeses. In this context, adjunct cultures of selected lactobacilli from nonstarter lactic acid bacteria origin appear as the best alternative to indirectly control cheese biota. The objective of the present work was to study the technological properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from cheese by in vitro and in situ assays. Milk acidification kinetics and proteolytic and acidifying activities were assessed, and peptide mapping of trichloroacetic acid 8% soluble fraction of milk cultures was performed by liquid chromatography. In addition, the tolerance to salts (NaCl and KCl) and the phage-resistance were investigated. Four strains were selected for testing as adjunct cultures in cheese making experiments at pilot plant scale. In in vitro assays, most strains acidified milk slowly and showed weak to moderate proteolytic activity. Fast strains decreased milk pH to 4.5 in 8 h, and continued acidification to 3.5 in 12 h or more. This group consisted mostly of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains. Approximately one-third of the slow strains, which comprised mainly Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus curvatus, were capable to grow when milk was supplemented with glucose and casein hydrolysate. Peptide maps were similar to those of lactic acid bacteria considered to have a moderate proteolytic activity. Most strains showed salt tolerance and resistance to specific phages. The Lactobacillus strains selected as adjunct cultures for cheese making experiments reached 10(8) cfu/g in soft cheeses at 7 d of ripening, whereas they reached 10(9) cfu/g in semihard cheeses after 15 d of ripening. In both cheese varieties, the adjunct culture population remained at high counts during all ripening, in some cases overcoming or equaling primary starter. Overall, proximate composition of cheeses with and without added lactobacilli did not differ; however, some of the tested strains continued acidifying during ripening, which was mainly noticed in soft cheeses and affected overall quality of the products. The lactobacilli strains with low acidifying activity showed appropriate technological characteristics for their use as adjunct cultures in soft and semihard cheeses.
TI  - Species diversity and relative abundance of vaginal lactic acid bacteria from women in Uganda and Korea.
AB  - AIMS: Lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining vaginal health of women. The aim of this study was to compare the species richness and relative abundance of Lactobacillus and other lactic acid bacteria in women of two geographically distant countries, Uganda and Korea. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vaginal samples were obtained from two women populations in Uganda and Korea. The Lactobacillus Rogosa SL agar was used for initial isolation of lactic acid bacteria. After phenotypic analyses, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by polymerase-chain reaction and analysed by the BLAST program and phylogenetic tree construction. A total of 338 (128 Korean and 210 Ugandan) vaginal lactic acid bacterial strains were isolated, including five genera: Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Streptococcus and Weissella. While Lactobacillus crispatus was common in both populations, Lactobacillus fermentum was common only in Korean women, and Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus vaginalis only in Ugandan women. Among other lactic acid bacteria, Weissella was more common in Ugandan, and Pediococcus in Korean women. All Weissella strains produced hydrogen peroxide, and all Pediococcus strains inhibited Candida species. CONCLUSION: Although many lactic acid bacteria colonize women, their species distributions may be different in women of geographically separated communities. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The knowledge of species richness and relative abundance of vaginal lactic acid bacteria, including Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and Weissella, may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial replacement therapy.
TI  - Identification of glucose-fermenting bacteria present in an in vitro model of the human intestine by RNA-stable isotope probing.
AB  - 16S rRNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  spectroscopy-based metabolic profiling were used to identify bacteria fermenting glucose under conditions simulating the human intestine. The TIM-2 in vitro model of the human intestine was inoculated with a GI tract microbiota resembling that of the small intestine, to which subsequently 4, 20 or 40 mM of [U-(13)C]-glucose were added. RNA was extracted from lumen samples after 0 (control), 1, 2 and 4 h and subjected to density-gradient ultracentrifugation. Phylogenetic analysis of unlabeled 16S rRNA revealed a microbial community dominated by lactic acid bacteria and Clostridium perfringens. Distinct (13)C-incorporation into bacterial RNA was only observed for the 40-mM addition. 16S rRNA fingerprinting showed an activity drop of Lactobacillus fermentum after glucose addition, while Streptococcus bovis and C. perfringens were identified as the most active glucose-fermenters. Accordingly, NMR analysis identified lactate, acetate, butyrate and formate as the principal fermentation products, constituting up to 91% of the (13)C-carbon balance. RNA-SIP combined with metabolic profiling allowed us to detect differential utilization of a general model carbohydrate, indicating that this approach holds great potential to identify bacteria involved in the fermentation of dietary relevant oligo- and polymeric carbohydrates in the human intestine.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. METHODS: Samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. On the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. The isolates were determined as Lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16S rDNA. Sequencing of 16S rDNA genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. RESULTS: Predominant species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus gasseri were also present. The isolates Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, Lactobacillus fermentum BGHO36 and BGHO64, Lactobacillus gasseri BGHO89 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BGHO99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, Salmonella enteritidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of Candida albicans. Moreover, the isolates L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 were tolerant to low pH and high concentration of bile salts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings imply that L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - Caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  - In vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. The aim of this investigation was to establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. Microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on Thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. Microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization analysis. pH was measured as an indicator of cariogenic potential. The composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. Artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and pH conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. Complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. Sucrose supplementation limited the decline of Streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance of mutans Streptococci. Sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to Actinomyces israelii, Rothia dentocariosa and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. The microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and pH.
TI  - Nonstarter lactobacilli isolated from soft and semihard Argentinean cheeses: genetic characterization and resistance to biological barriers.
AB  - Nonstarter lactic acid bacteria isolated from Argentinean cheeses were identified and characterized by focusing on their resistance to biological barriers, along with other physiological features of potential interest, in the search for future probiotic organisms. Lactobacilli were enumerated and isolated from semihard and soft cheeses made with multistrain Streptococcus thermophilus starters. Lactobacilli counts in 1-week-old cheeses were between 10(5) and 10(7) CFU/g and then reached 10(7) CFU/ g in all 1-month samples, while streptococci were always above 10(9) CFU/g. A total number of 22 lactobacilli isolates were retained, identified, and characterized by in vitro tests. Species identity was determined by carbohydrate metabolism and species-specific PCR assays. Genetic diversity was explored by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR analysis. The Lactobacillus strains were assigned to the species L. casei, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, L. curvatus, L. fermentum, and L. perolens. All the strains studied tolerated 25 ppm of lysozyme, and most of them showed resistance to 0.3% bile. After incubation in gastric solution (pH 2.0), counts decreased by several log units, ranging from 3.2 to 7.0. The strains were able to grow in the presence of bile salts, but only three isolates were capable of deconjugation. The nonstarter lactobacilli that were assayed fermented the prebiotic substrates (especially lactulose and inulin). Some strains showed high cell hydrophobicity and beta-galactosidase activity, as well as inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria. It was concluded that most of the lactobacilli isolated in this study demonstrated resistance to biological barriers and physiological characteristics compatible with probiotic properties, which make them suitable for further research in in vivo studies aimed at identifying new probiotic organisms.
TI  - Lactobacillus fermentum BR11, a potential new probiotic, alleviates symptoms of colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in rats.
AB  - Current treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are relatively ineffective. Recently, probiotics have emerged as a potential treatment modality for numerous gastrointestinal disorders, including IBD. Few probiotics, however, have undergone appropriate preclinical screening in vivo. The current study compared the effects of four candidate probiotics on development of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in rats. Sprague Dawley rats were gavaged 1 mL of the potential probiotic (1 x 10(10) CFU/mL), or vehicle, twice daily for 14 days. Strains tested were Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), Streptococcus thermophilus TH-4 (TH-4), Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 (Bb12) and Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 (BR11). Colitis was induced from day 7 to 14 via administration of 2% DSS in drinking water. Disease activity index (DAI) was monitored daily until rats were killed at day 14. DAI decreased in DSS+Bb12 and DSS+BR11 compared to DSS+Vehicle. Colon length increased in DSS+BR11 (10%) and DSS+LGG (10%) compared to DSS+Vehicle. DSS+Bb12 and DSS+BR11 prevented the distal colon crypt hyperplasia evident in DSS+Vehicle, DSS+LGG and DSS+TH-4. BR11 was most effective at reducing colitic symptoms. Bb12 had minimal effects, whilst TH-4 did not prevent DSS-colitis and LGG actually exacerbated some indicators of colitis. Further studies into the potential benefits of L. fermentum BR11 are indicated.
TI  - Calcium modulates interactions between bacteria and hydroxyapatite.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion onto hydroxyapatite is known to depend on the surface properties of both the biomaterial and the bacterial strain, but less is known about the influence of the composition of the aqueous medium. Here, the adhesion of Streptococcus mutans and 3 different Lactobacilli on powdered hydroxyapatite was shown to change with Ca2+ concentration. The effect depends on the surface properties of each strain. Adhesion of Lactobacillus fermentum and salivarius (and of Streptococcus mutans at low Ca2+) was enhanced with increasing Ca2+ concentration. Lactobacillus casei was efficiently removed by adhesion on hydroxyapatite, even without Ca2+ addition, and the effect of this ion was only marginal. The results are interpreted in terms of Ca2+-mediated adhesion, and relative to the hydrophobic properties of each strain and the electrical properties of the bacterial and solid surfaces (electrophoretic mobility).
TI  - Probiotic properties of vaginal lactic acid bacteria to prevent metritis in cattle.
AB  - AIMS: The isolation of bovine vaginal lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and the screening of their beneficial properties to select those that could be used as probiotics in the prevention of bovine metritis were performed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Out of 76 Lactobacillus sp. and seven Streptococcus sp. strains, a small number showed high- and medium hydrophobicity when the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons method (MATH) was applied. In the agar plate diffusion test, a large number of strains inhibited vaginal bovine Escherichia coli 99/14 and human E. coli. This inhibition was due to acid. Only a few strains inhibited Actinomyces pyogenes 96/393, a pathogen isolated from bovine metritis. This inhibition remained after neutralization. The taxonomic identification of the selected strains was carried out by an amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). Most of the strains were identified as Lactobacillus fermentum, a few as Lactobacillus gasseri and one as Lactobacillus rhamnosus. CONCLUSIONS: Bovine vaginal lactobacilli strains have differential surface properties. The strains selected are capable of inhibiting specific metritis pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results can be applied for future studies to design a probiotic product to prevent metritis in dairy postpartum cows.
TI  - [Study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  - A comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. At physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms. Lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) CFU/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) CFU/1 g in the intestine content. The spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. Quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. Quantity of E. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) CFU/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) CFU/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) CFU/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. Lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--L. plantarum and L. fermentum. All the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. Twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. The degree of adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. The highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in Enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. The screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. The strain of Lactobacillus plantarum 200D proved to be the most active one. A complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. The biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.
TI  - Oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. However, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. We aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative oral pathogens. METHODS: A total of 238 Lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. In all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia was assessed. RESULTS: Lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. The most prevalent strains in healthy persons were Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, Lactobacillus plantarum. Obligately homofermentatives, particularly L. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for L. gasseri, P < 0.01). Sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited S. mutans, 88% A. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% P. gingivalis and 65% P. intermedia. The strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with Lactobacillus paracasei, L. plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against S. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. CONCLUSION: The composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly L. gasseri, in the latter group. Both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.
TI  - Monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) during shochu fermentation was monitored by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and by bacteriological culturing. No LAB were detected from fermented mashes by PCR-DGGE using a universal bacterial PCR primer set. However, PCR-DGGE using a new primer specific for the 16S rDNA of Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Tetragenococcus, Enterococcus, and Vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16S rDNA of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella revealed that Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus nagelii, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. It was also found that the LAB community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. Therefore, we confirmed that PCR-DGGE using all three primers specific for groups of LAB together was well suited to the study of the LAB diversity in shochu mashes. The results of DGGE profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. In conclusion, LAB are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.
TI  - Effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  - Fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. In this study, three sourdough yeasts, Candida milleri CBS 8195, Saccharomyces cerevisiae TS 146, and Torulaspora delbrueckii TS 207; a control, baker's yeast S. cerevisiae ALKO 743; and four Lactobacillus spp., L. acidophilus TSB 262, L. brevis TSB 307, L. plantarum TSB 304, and L. sanfranciscensis TSB 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. The microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. Total folate contents were determined using Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC 7469) as the growth indicator organism. The microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. Yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. Strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. curvatus, L. fermentum, L. helveticus, Pediococcus spp., and Streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. Although the four Lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal. It was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. Fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. Two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as Enterobacter cowanii and Pantoea agglomerans.
TI  - Rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by M13-generated, RAPD-PCR fingerprint databases.
AB  - About a thousand lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR, respectively. RAPD-PCR profiles, which were obtained by using the M13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by BioNumerics software. Cluster analysis of the combined RAPD-PCR fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library, which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. A library unit, in this case, can be considered to be a definable taxon. The strains belonged to 11 main RAPD-PCR fingerprinting library units identified as Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. The possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. The proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful LAB strain collection. The same approach could also be applied to identify LAB strains isolated from other food ecosystems.
TI  - Glucan synthesis in the genus Lactobacillus: isolation and characterization of glucansucrase genes, enzymes and glucan products from six different strains.
AB  - Members of the genera Streptococcus and Leuconostoc synthesize various alpha-glucans (dextran, alternan and mutan). In Lactobacillus, until now, the only glucosyltransferase (GTF) enzyme that has been characterized is gtfA of Lactobacillus reuteri 121, the first GTF enzyme synthesizing a glucan (reuteran) that contains mainly alpha-(1-->4) linkages together with alpha-(1-->6) and alpha-(1-->4,6) linkages. Recently, partial sequences of glucansucrase genes were detected in other members of the genus Lactobacillus. This paper reports, for the first time, isolation and characterization of dextransucrase and mutansucrase genes and enzymes from various Lactobacillus species and the characterization of the glucan products synthesized, which mainly have alpha-(1-->6)- and alpha-(1-->3)-glucosidic linkages. The four GTF enzymes characterized from three different Lb. reuteri strains are highly similar at the amino acid level, and consequently their protein structures are very alike. Interestingly, these four Lb. reuteri GTFs have relatively large N-terminal variable regions, containing RDV repeats, and relatively short putative glucan-binding domains with conserved and less-conserved YG-repeating units. The three other GTF enzymes, isolated from Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus parabuchneri, contain smaller variable regions and larger putative glucan-binding domains compared to the Lb. reuteri GTF enzymes.
TI  - Effect of Ampicillin on the kinetics of colonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae  and Lactobacillus fermentum in the respiratory tract of mice.
AB  - Ampicillin was selected to further study the effect of this antibiotic on the colonization capability of S. pneumoniae and L. fermentum intranasally inoculated in a mice experimental model. The sensitivity of S. pneumoniae and L. fermentum to antibiotics was evaluated by different "in vitro" techniques. The results showed that both microorganisms have a typical pattern of sensitivity to antibiotics in these assays. The "in vivo" experiments showed that the treatment with Ampicillin increased the number of lactobacilli and neumococci in the groups of mice treated only with one of the microorganisms. In those mice treated with Lactobacillus, challenged later with neumococci and treated with Ampicillin, the pathogen in lung decreased on the 4th day, disappearing completely after on. The histological studies showed that the antibiotic treatment decreased the inflammatory response produced by the pathogen at the lung and trachea levels.
TI  - Identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11.
AB  - Screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kDa protein. Analysis of the 3010-bp DNA insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (ORFs). One ORF encodes LysA, a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages Lj928 and Lj965 from Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lp1 and Lp2 from Lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of Lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage Phiadh. The immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated ORF downstream of lysA which has similarity to glutamyl-tRNA synthetases. The N-terminus of LysA has sequence similarity with N-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the C-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial SH3b domains. C-terminal bacterial SH3b domains were identified in the majority of Lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. LysA was expressed in Escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different Lactobacillus species and against Lactococcus lactis, streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. It was found that LysA is 2 and 8000 times more active against L. fermentum than L. lactis and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.
TI  - Nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic Gram-negative pathogens. Diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a Gram stain of a vaginal smear. Treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. A study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of BV by the Gram stain-based Nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that Bacteroides or Prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. In one case, only Gardnerella vaginalis was found. These findings illustrate that BV remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either Gardnerella or Mobiluncus. Use of a FemExam system (Cooper Surgical, Shelton, CT), based upon elevated pH and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the Gram stain method. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with BV but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14. These studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for BV. If such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the novel LysM domain-containing surface protein Sep from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in Lactobacillus and Lactococcus.
AB  - Examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kDa protein termed Sep. The amino-terminal sequence of Sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. Sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Lactobacillus plantarum. The carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of Sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (APF) surface proteins of Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii. The mature amino terminus of Sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding LysM domain, thereby making it distinct from APF proteins. We have identified a common motif within LysM domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding YG motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. Sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in L. fermentum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. Modified Sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, and L. lactis hosts. Sep as well as the previously described surface protein BspA were used to express and secrete in L. fermentum or L. rhamnosus a fragment of human E-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for Listeria monocytogenes. This study demonstrates that Sep has potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Indigenous raw milk microbiota influences the bacterial development in traditional cheese from an alpine natural park.
AB  - Nostrano di Primiero is a 6-month ripened cheese produced from raw milk collected in the Paneveggio-Pale di San Martino Natural Park area in the Italian Dolomites. In summer, this cheese is made using milk collected from two different areas, Passo Rolle and Vanoi, in the Paneveggio Natural Park. During the experiment, the milk from the two areas was separately processed, and cheeses were made in the same cheese factory using the same technological process. The microbiota of raw milk and cheeses of the two areas was isolated and the dominant population was monitored by RAPD analysis and identified by 16S rRNA sequence. The milk of the Passo Rolle area was mainly composed of mesophilic strains, thermophilic Streptococcus thermophilus, and low amounts of enterococci were also found; the milk of the Vanoi area was dominated by mesophilic microbiota mostly Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris and ssp. lactis and Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei. The plating of the natural starter culture revealed the presence of a relevant community of thermophilic cocci and lower amounts of enterococci. The dynamic population analysis showed the importance of the natural starter culture in the first 2 days of cheese ripening in both cheeses. Moreover, the large biodiversity observed in the raw milks was also detected in the cheeses during ripening. The Vanoi cheese was dominated by Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus macedonicus in the first two days and mesophilic 21 Lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei became the most represented population after 15 days of ripening. In the first few days, the Rolle cheese was characterized by being mainly composed of thermophilic S. macedonicus and S. thermophilus and secondarily by mesophilic cocci. During ripening, the microbiota composition changed, and at 15 days, mesophilic lactobacilli were the dominant population, but later, this was mainly composed of mesophilic cocci and lactobacilli. The taxonomical identification by 16S rRNA sequence confirmed a large biodiversity related to raw milk microbiota and only five strains of S. macedonicus, Lactobacillus plantarum, 21 Lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum and E. faecium were detected in both cheeses.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Lactobacillus species inhibiting the formation  of Streptococcus mutans biofilm.
AB  - Oral bacterium S11 was isolated from the saliva of young children without dental  caries and with little or no visible supragingival plaque. The S11 strain showed 99.5% similarity with Lactobacillus fermentum, and was identified on the basis of biochemical characteristics and a 16S rDNA sequence. S11 strain and its culture supernatant significantly inhibited the formation of the insoluble glucan produced by Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt. S11 did not affect the multiplication of S. mutans Ingbritt, but the adherence of S. mutans Ingbritt onto cuvette walls was inhibited completely.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial communities belonging to natural whey starters for Grana  Padano cheese by length heterogeneity-PCR.
AB  - AIMS: To detect bacteria present in controlled dairy ecosystems with defined composition by length-heterogeneity (LH)-PCR. LH-PCR allows to distinguish different organisms on the basis of natural variations in the length of 16S rRNA gene sequences. METHODS AND RESULTS: LH-PCR was applied to depict population structure of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species recoverable from Grana Padano cheese whey starters. Typical bacterial species present in the LAB community were evidenced and well discriminated. Small differences in species composition, e.g. the frequent finding of Streptococcus thermophilus and the constant presence of thermophilic lactobacilli (Lactobacillus helveticus, Lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis/bulgaricus and Lact. fermentum) were reliably highlighted. Specificity of LH-PCR was confirmed by species-specific PCR from total DNA of the cultures. CONCLUSIONS: LH-PCR is a useful tool to monitor microbial composition and population dynamics in dairy starter cultures. When present, non-dominant bacterial species present in the whey starters, such as Strep. thermophilus, can easily be visualized and characterized without isolating and cultivating single strains. A similar approach can be applied to more complex dairy ecosystems such as milk or cheese curd. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Community members and differences in population structure of controlled dairy ecosystems such as whey starters for hard cheeses can be evaluated and compared in a relative easy, fast, reliable and highly reproducible way.
TI  - Assessment of in-line near-infrared spectroscopy for continuous monitoring of fermentation processes.
AB  - The application of NIR in-line to monitor and control fermentation processes was  investigated. Determination of biomass, glucose, and lactic and acetic acids during fermentations of Staphylococcus xylosus ES13 was performed by an interactance fiber optic probe immersed into the culture broth and connected to a NIR instrument. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) calibration models of second derivative NIR spectra in the 700-1800 nm region gave satisfactory predictive models for all parameters of interest: biomass, glucose, and lactic and acetic acids. Batch, repeated batch, and continuous fermentations were monitored and automatically controlled by interfacing the NIR to the bioreactor control unit. The high frequency of data collection permitted an accurate study of the kinetics, supplying lots of data that describe the cultural broth composition and strengthen statistical analysis. Comparison of spectra collected throughout fermentation runs of S. xylosus ES13, Lactobacillus fermentum ES15, and Streptococcus thermophylus ES17 demonstrated the successful extension of a unique calibration model, developed for S. xylosus ES13, to other strains that were differently shaped but growing in the same medium and fermentation conditions. NIR in-line was so versatile as to measure several biochemical parameters of different bacteria by means of slightly adapted models, avoiding a separate calibration for each strain.
TI  - Peptide surface display and secretion using two LPXTG-containing surface proteins from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11.
AB  - A locus encoding two repetitive proteins that have LPXTG cell wall anchoring signals from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 has been identified by using an antiserum raised against whole L. fermentum BR11 cells. The first protein, Rlp, is similar to the Rib surface protein from Streptococcus agalactiae, while the other protein, Mlp, is similar to the mucus binding protein Mub from Lactobacillus reuteri. It was shown that multiple copies of mlp exist in the genome of L. fermentum BR11. Regions of Rlp, Mlp, and the previously characterized surface protein BspA were used to surface display or secrete heterologous peptides in L. fermentum. The peptides tested were 10 amino acids of the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein and a six-histidine epitope (His(6)). The BspA promoter and secretion signal were used in combination with the Rlp cell wall sorting signal to express, export, and covalently anchor the heterologous peptides to the cell wall. Detection of the cell surface protein fusions revealed that Rlp was a significantly better surface display vector than BspA despite having lower cellular levels (0.7 mg per liter for the Rlp fusion compared with 4 mg per liter for the BspA fusion). The mlp promoter and encoded secretion signal were used to express and export large (328-kDa at 10 mg per liter) and small (27-kDa at 0.06 mg per liter) amino-terminal fragments of the Mlp protein fused to the His(6) and CFTR peptides or His(6) peptide, respectively. Therefore, these newly described proteins from L. fermentum BR11 have potential as protein production and targeting vectors.
TI  - Role of peptidoglycan subtypes in the pathogenesis of bacterial cell wall arthritis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial cell wall (CW) arthritis develops in susceptible strains of rats after a single intraperitoneal injection of the CW from certain bacterial species, both pathogenic and non-pathogenic. For the development of chronic bacterial CW arthritis, the structure of the bacterial peptidoglycan (PG) has been found to be decisive. OBJECTIVE: To define the role of PG subtypes in the pathogenesis of chronic bacterial CW arthritis. METHOD: Arthritis was induced with CWs of Lactobacillus plantarum, L casei B, L casei C, and L fermentum. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to measure the presence of CW derived muramic acid in the liver and to determine PG subtypes. CWs were also tested for their resistance to lysozyme in vitro. RESULTS: These results and those published previously indicate that PGs of CWs which induce chronic arthritis, no matter whether they were derived from strains of Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, or Lactobacillus, all have lysine as the third amino acid of the PG stem peptide, representing PG subtypes A3alpha and A4alpha. Those strains which induce only transient acute arthritis or no arthritis at all do not have lysine in this position, resulting in different PG subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo degradation of only those PGs with the subtypes A3alpha and A4alpha leads to the occurrence of large CW fragments, which persist in tissue and have good proinflammatory ability. CWs with other PG subtypes, even if they are lysozyme resistant, do not cause chronic arthritis, because the released fragments are not phlogistic. It is emphasised that a variety of microbial components not causing inflammation have been found in animal and human synovial tissue.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - Isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a Ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  - One hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from Uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. Isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using API 50 CHL kits and additional biochemical tests. Coliforms, yeasts and LAB were enumerated in bushera. The pH, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. The LAB counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). The coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). The pH of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. Ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. The initial numbers of LAB and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the LAB numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. LAB counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. Coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). Yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. The pH declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. Lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Enterococcus genera. Tentatively, Lactobacillus isolates were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. fermentum, L. brevis and L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. Streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. LAB isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Weissella and Enterococcus. Eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch and were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), Weissella confusa (one strain) and L. plantarum (one strain).
TI  - Cholesterol assimilation by lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria isolated from the human gut.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of human gut-derived lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria on cholesterol levels in vitro. Continuous cultures inoculated with fecal material from healthy human volunteers with media supplemented with cholesterol and bile acids were used to enrich for potential cholesterol assimilators among the indigenous bacterial populations. Seven potential probiotics were found: Lactobacillus fermentum strains F53 and KC5b, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, Streptococcus bovis ATCC 43143, Enterococcus durans DSM 20633, Enterococcus gallinarum, and Enterococcus faecalis. A comparative evaluation regarding the in vitro cholesterol reduction abilities of these strains along with commercial probiotics was undertaken. The degree of acid and bile tolerance of strains was also evaluated. The human isolate L. fermentum KC5b was able to maintain viability for 2 h at pH 2 and to grow in a medium with 4,000 mg of bile acids per liter. This strain was also able to remove a maximum of 14.8 mg of cholesterol per g (dry weight) of cells from the culture medium and therefore was regarded as a candidate probiotic.
TI  - Effects of asparaginase and polyphenol oxidase on adhesive characteristics of microorganisms.
AB  - We studied the effects of polyphenol oxidase and asparaginase on microorganism adhesion to buccal epithelial cells. These enzymes reduced adhesion of pathogenic microorganisms (uropathogenic and Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Entamoeba spp., Influenza virus, Candida albicans, Streptococcus spp.) and had virtually no effect on adhesive characteristics of probiotic variants of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus fermentum.
TI  - Expression of a streptococcal glucosyltransferase as a fusion to a solute-binding protein in Lactobacillus fermentum BR11.
AB  - BspA is a non-covalently anchored cystine-binding protein from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11. It has previously been used to present antigens derived from infectious organisms on the L. fermentum BR11 cell surface. In this study, the capacity of BspA to present a very large polypeptide was tested. A temperature sensitive plasmid was constructed that encodes a 175-kDa chimeric protein consisting of a fusion between BspA and an N-terminally truncated derivative of the Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975 glucosyltransferase GtfJ. This plasmid was introduced into the L. fermentum genome. Integrants were able to incorporate 20-40 nmol sucrose derived glucose into glucan per ml culture per optical density unit. The glucosyltransferase activity was external to the cytoplasmic membrane and bound to the cell. Unlike native BspA, the BspA-GtfJ fusion could not be removed from the cell by 5 M LiCl wash.
TI  - Mononuclear cell response to enterobacteria and Gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota in early rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study whether enterobacteria and Gram-positive bacterial cell walls (BCW) derivedfrom normal intestinal microbiota are involved in the etiopathogenesis of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMC) were isolatedfrom patients with early RA (the average duration of 5 months) and the controls (other types of inflammatory arthritis). The mononuclear cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) responses to heat-killed Salmonella enteritidis (SE). Yersinia enterocolitica (YE), and Escherichia coli (EC), and to Gram-positive BCW derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, Eubacterium aerofaciens (EA), Eubacterium limosum (EL), Lactobacillus casei (LC), and Lactobacillus fermentum (LF), and a BCW derived from a pathogen, Streptococcus pyogenes (SP) were investigated. RESULTS: 39% or 56% of patients with early RA showed significant proliferation responses by PBMC or SFMC against enterobacteria, respectively. In other types of arthritis, corresponding figures were 59% or 66%. When BCW were used as antigens, 8.1% or 23% of patients with early RA showed proliferation responses by PBMC or SFMC, respectively. In other types of arthritis the corresponding figures were 7.5% or 35%, respectively. However, TNF-alpha production by SFMC stimulated by EA BCW, SE, YE or EC, was significantly higher in early RA than in other types of arthritis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SFMC reacting with enterobacteria or BCW exist in some patients with early RA, but also in other types of inflammatory arthritis. Intestinal bacterial agents may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of RA, but the effect appears to be non-specific.
TI  - Diversity, dynamics, and activity of bacterial communities during production of an artisanal Sicilian cheese as evaluated by 16S rRNA analysis.
AB  - The diversity and dynamics of the microbial communities during the manufacturing  of Ragusano cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in Sicily (Italy), were investigated by a combination of classical and culture-independent approaches. The latter included PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes (rDNA). Bacterial and Lactobacillus group-specific primers were used to amplify the V6 to V8 and V1 to V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene, respectively. DGGE profiles from samples taken during cheese production indicated dramatic shifts in the microbial community structure. Cloning and sequencing of rDNA amplicons revealed that mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including species of Leuconostoc, Lactococcus lactis, and Macrococcus caseolyticus were dominant in the raw milk, while Streptococcus thermophilus prevailed during lactic fermentation. Other thermophilic LAB, especially Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus fermentum, also flourished during ripening. Comparison of the rRNA-derived patterns obtained by RT-PCR to the rDNA DGGE patterns indicated a substantially different degree of metabolic activity for the microbial groups detected. Identification of cultivated LAB isolates by phenotypic characterization and 16S rDNA analysis indicated a variety of species, reflecting to a large extent the results obtained from the 16S rDNA clone libraries, with the significant exception of the Lactobacillus delbrueckii species, which dominated in the ripening cheese but was not detected by cultivation. The present molecular approaches combined with culture can effectively describe the complex ecosystem of natural fermented dairy products, giving useful information for starter culture design and preservation of artisanal fermented food technology.
TI  - Molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  - Although substantial epidemiologic evidence links Streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. Molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. The purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ECC) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. Cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal DNAs from a healthy subject and a subject with ECC were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. Ten novel phylotypes were identified. A number of species or phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant further investigation. In addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. Significant differences were observed for nine species: S. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Bifidobacterium, S. mutans, Veillonella, S. salivarius, S. constellatus, S. parasanguinis, and Lactobacillus fermentum were associated with caries. These data suggest that A. gerencseriae and other Actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel Bifidobacterium may be a major pathogen in deep caries. Further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.
TI  - The potential of a polyphasic PCR-dGGE approach in evaluating microbial diversity of natural whey cultures for water-buffalo Mozzarella cheese production: bias of culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses.
AB  - A polyphasic PCR-DGGE approach was used to describe the microbial population occurring in natural whey cultures (NWCs) for water-buffalo Mozzarella cheese production. Total microbial community was assessed without cultivation by analyzing DNA directly extracted from the original samples of NWC. In addition, DNA extracted from bulks of cells formed by harvesting colonies from the serial dilution agar plates of a variety of culture media was used to profile the "cultivable" community. The 16S rDNA V3 region was amplified using DNA from NWC as well as DNA from bulks as templates and the amplicons were separated by DGGE. The microbial entities occurring in NWCs were identified by partial 16S rDNA sequencing of DGGE bands: four lactic acid bacteria (LAB) closest relative of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus crispatus were revealed by the analysis of DNA directly extracted from NWC while two other LAB, Lactobacillus fermentum and Enterococcus faecalis, were identified by analyzing DNA from the cultivable community. The developed PCR-DGGE analysis of the "cultivable" community showed good potential in evaluating microbial diversity of a dairy environment: it usefully highlighted the bias introduced by selective amplification when compared to the analysis of the total community from NWC and allowed suitability of media and growth conditions to be evaluated. Moreover, it could be used to complete the culture independent study of microbial diversity to give information on concentration ratios among species occurring in a particular environment and can be proposed for rapid identification of dominant microorganisms in alternative to traditional tools.
TI  - The predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  - The predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (pH 5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. Streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. The proportions of Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. Actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque samples. The proportions of Candida albicans, Lactobacillus spp. and Veillonella spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. The most frequently isolated lactobacilli were Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The predominant aciduric flora was S. oralis, S. mutans and A. israelii and these taxa were also isolated from a similar proportion of the lesions at pH 7.0. Strains of S. mutans, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were genotyped using PCR-based methods. Each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. These data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.
TI  - Evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB  - The development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. Initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. Fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of partial 16S rRNA genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to Streptococcus thermophilus or Saccharococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus fermentum. The middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. Lactobacillus casei or Lactobacillus paracasei, L. fermentum, and Lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by DGGE during this stage. Bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of residual maltooligosaccharides. By 70 h, two new PCR bands were detected on DGGE gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. The bacteria were phylogenetically related to Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in Japan. These were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as MRS. Their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.
TI  - Protective effect of intranasally inoculated Lactobacillus fermentum against Streptococcus pneumoniae challenge on the mouse respiratory tract.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria are increasingly used to restore the ecological equilibrium  of different mucosal areas in humans and/or animals. Likewise, they can be used to potentially protect against pathogenic microorganisms. In the present paper, the preventive effect of intranasally inoculated Lactobacillus fermentum against challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae was studied, using a mouse experimental model. L. fermentum inoculated four times at a dose of 10(7) colony forming units per mouse was able to decrease the number of S. pneumoniae throughout the respiratory tract. The L. fermentum treatment increased the number of activated macrophages in lung slices, and a higher lymphocyte population in the tracheal lamina propria. S. pneumoniae challenge showed a typical response against pathogen with a higher non-specific immune response. Preventive treatment, i.e. L. fermentum administration prior to S. pneumoniae challenge, showed a response close to that of L. fermentum. Anti-S. pneumoniae antibodies increased in lactobacilli-treated animals compared to the non-treated lactobacilli mice. The increase in the antibody levels suggests that the mucosal immune system could be involved in the protective effect, accomplished with competitive exclusion, nutrient competition and production of inhibitory substances. This paper will be the basis for further studies of the protective effect of lactobacilli against S. pneumoniae in the respiratory tract.
TI  - Lactobacillus agilis is an important component of the pigeon crop flora.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB: enterococci, streptococci and lactobacilli) in the pigeon crop. METHODS AND RESULTS: The crops of 10 pigeons were sampled and inoculated on agar plates for isolation of streptococci, enterococci and lactobacilli. The isolates were identified using tDNA-PCR. Lactobacillus agilis, a species described in 1981 from municipal sewage, was the dominant component in eight of these pigeon crop sacs. A Lactobacillus species related to L. fermentum and L. mucosae but probably not belonging to one of these species was isolated from five birds. Three pigeons carried Enterococcus cecorum. Minor species found were E. columbae, E. faecalis, E. hirae, L. johnsonii, L. salivarius, and Streptococcus gallolyticus. A description is given of the phenotypic characteristics of the L. agilis pigeon strains. CONCLUSIONS, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: L. agilis is found to be the main component of the LAB flora in the pigeon crop.
TI  - Lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  - Samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for Lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. Yeasts (20.1%), Streptococcus spp. (8.7%), Staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. The Lactobacillus isolates were L. brevis (24.6%) L. fermentum (18.5%) L. casei (16.9%), L. delbrueckii (15.4%), L. plantarum (9.23%), L. acidophilus (7.69%), L. jensenii (4.62%), L. salivarius (1.54%) and L. gasseri (1.54%). The most common species was L. brevis (24.6%). The strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. All the Lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, S. sonnei, Klebsiella spp. and Campylobacter sp. All the lactobacilli except L. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. The involvement of Lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. The ability of Lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
TI  - Reduction of fecal shedding of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in lambs by feeding microbial feed supplement.
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7, an emerging food-borne pathogen, has  been implicated in several outbreaks in the US. Ruminants, including cattle, sheep and deer are reservoirs of E. coli O157:H7 and fecal shedding of the pathogen forms the vehicle of entry into the human food chain. We studied the efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, a mixture of L. acidophilus and S. faecium and a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus plantarum in reducing fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 by sheep experimentally infected with the pathogen prior to administration with the microbials. Following oral inoculation with 10(10)CFU of E. coli O157:H7, 30 Suffolk ram lambs were blocked by body weight (six blocks of five lambs each) and lambs within the block randomly assigned to five groups. The lamb groups were fed daily for 7 weeks a basal diet without microbial supplement (control) or the basal diet with L. acidophilus or with S. faecium or with a mixture of L. acidophilus and S. faecium or with a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum. The microbial supplements contained stabilized live naturally occurring bacteria and were mixed with the diet at the rate of 6.0x10(6)CFU per kilogram of diet. Fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed for E. coli O157:H7 using modified tryptic soy broth with novobiocin as a pre-enrichement broth and cefixim-tellurite sorbitol MacConkey agar (CT-SMAC) as a selective media. E. coli O157:H7 was confirmed by its reaction with O157 and H7 antisera. E. coli O157:H7 was shed continuously and in varying numbers in the feces throughout the 7-week experimental period by all five groups. However, lambs administered a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum shed significantly lower (P=0.0211) average number of E. coli O157:H7 (2.3log(10)CFU per gram of feces per week) than the other lamb groups over the entire experimental period. S. faecium supplemented lambs were comparable (P=0.0884) to lambs fed a mixture of L. acidophulus and S. faecium in fecal shedding of the pathogen (3.5 versus 4.4log(10)CFU per gram of feces) but significantly lower (P=0.0001) than the control lambs (5.6log(10)CFU per gram of feces) and those supplemented with L. acidophilus (5.5log(10)CFU per gram of feces). Average daily gain (ADG) and gain to feed ratio (G:F) were significantly improved (P=0.0145) by the mixed culture microbials (163.0g and 0.33 for the control, 186.4g and 0.37 for L. acidophulus, 168.2g and 0.36 for S. faecium, 213.6g and 0.46 for L. acidophulus and S. faecium, and 219.1g and 0.44, respectively for L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum supplemented lambs. The study indicates that supplementing lambs infected with E. coli O157:H7 with S. faecium or a mixture of S. faecium, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum in the diet can reduce total number of E. coli O157:H7 shed in the feces and improve animal meat production performance as well.
TI  - Microbial community dynamics during production of the Mexican fermented maize dough pozol.
AB  - The dynamics of the microbial community responsible for the traditional fermentation of maize in the production of Mexican pozol was investigated by using a polyphasic approach combining (i) microbial enumerations with culture media, (ii) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting of total community DNA with bacterial and eukaryotic primers and sequencing of partial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes, (iii) quantification of rRNAs from dominant microbial taxa by using phylogenetic oligonucleotide probes, and (iv) analysis of sugars and fermentation products. A Streptococcus species dominated the fermentation and accounted for between 25 and 75% of the total flora throughout the process. Results also showed that the initial epiphytic aerobic microflora was replaced in the first 2 days by heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including a close relative of Lactobacillus fermentum, producing lactic acid and ethanol; this heterolactic flora was then progressively replaced by homofermentative LAB (mainly close relatives of L. plantarum, L. casei, and L. delbrueckii) which continued acidification of the maize dough. At the same time, a very diverse community of yeasts and fungi developed, mainly at the periphery of the dough. The analysis of the DGGE patterns obtained with bacterial and eukaryotic primers targeting the 16S and 18S rDNA genes clearly demonstrated that there was a major shift in the community structure after 24 h and that high biodiversity-according to the Shannon-Weaver index-was maintained throughout the process. These results proved that a relatively high number of species, at least six to eight, are needed to perform this traditional lactic acid fermentation. The presence of Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and enterobacteria suggests a fecal origin of some important pozol microorganisms. Overall, the results obtained with different culture-dependent or -independent techniques clearly confirmed the importance of developing a polyphasic approach to study the ecology of fermented foods.
TI  - Effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  - The proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses. Indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. The consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. The present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified Robbins device. Exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of Bifidobacterium infantis 420 or Enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. However, suspensions of Lactobacillus fermentum B54, L. rhamnosus 744 or L. lactis cremoris SK11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. Suspensions of L. casei Shirota and Streptococcus thermophilus B significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. The reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of L. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Modulating immune responses with probiotic bacteria.
AB  - For many years, probiotic bacteria have been known to confer health benefits to the consumer. One possible mechanism for this may be the ability of probiotic bacteria to modulate immune responses. Oral administration of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) has been found to enhance innate immunity by stimulating the activity of splenic NK cells. Oral feeding with killed LcS was able to stimulate the production of Th1 cytokines, resulting in repressed production of IgE antibodies against Ovalbumin in experimental mice. The ability to switch mucosal immune responses towards Th1 with probiotic bacteria provides a strategy for treatment of allergic disorders. Growth of Meth A tumour cells in the lungs was also inhibited by intrapleural injection of LcS. Oral administration of other probiotic bacteria, such as Streptococcus thermophilus (St), Lactobacillus fermentum (Lf) and yeast (Y), elicited different immune responses. Mice that were prefed yeast or Lf followed by feeding with ovalbumin (OVA) responded better to vaccination with OVA than mice not given either probiotic or OVA or mice that had been prefed only OVA. However, antibody responses were significantly suppressed in response to vaccination with OVA in mice that had been prefed yeast followed by yeast and OVA as well as mice prefed Lf followed by Lf and OVA. Prefeeding St followed by OVA feeding enhanced cellular immune responses against ovalbumin. In contrast, mice prefed St followed by St + OVA were hyporesponsive against OVA. While antigen feeding alone appears to prime for an immune response, cofeeding antigen with probiotic bacteria can suppress both antibody and cellular immune responses and may provide an efficacious protocol to attenuate autoimmune diseases, such as experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, by jointly dosing with myelin basic protein and probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Polyphasic study of the spatial distribution of microorganisms in Mexican pozol,  a fermented maize dough, demonstrates the need for cultivation-independent methods to investigate traditional fermentations.
AB  - The distribution of microorganisms in pozol balls, a fermented maize dough, was investigated by a polyphasic approach in which we used both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, including microbial enumeration, fermentation product analysis, quantification of microbial taxa with 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes, determination of microbial fingerprints by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and 16S ribosomal DNA gene sequencing. Our results demonstrate that DGGE fingerprinting and rRNA quantification should allow workers to precisely and rapidly characterize the microbial assemblage in a spontaneous lactic acid fermented food. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) accounted for 90 to 97% of the total active microflora; no streptococci were isolated, although members of the genus Streptococcus accounted for 25 to 50% of the microflora. Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus fermentum, together with members of the genera Leuconostoc and Weissella, were the other dominant organisms. The overall activity was more important at the periphery of a ball, where eucaryotes, enterobacteria, and bacterial exopolysacharide producers developed. Our results also showed that the metabolism of heterofermentative LAB was influenced in situ by the distribution of the LAB in the pozol ball, whereas homolactic fermentation was controlled primarily by sugar limitation. We propose that starch is first degraded by amylases from LAB and that the resulting sugars, together with the lactate produced, allow a secondary flora to develop in the presence of oxygen. Our results strongly suggest that cultivation-independent methods should be used to study traditional fermented foods.
TI  - Human cytokine responses induced by gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota.
AB  - The normal microbiota plays an important role in the health of the host, but little is known of how the human immune system recognizes and responds to Gram-positive indigenous bacteria. We have investigated cytokine responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to Gram-positive cell walls (CW) derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, Eubacterium aerofaciens (Eu.a. ), Eubacterium limosum (Eu.l.), Lactobacillus casei (L.c.), and Lactobacillus fermentum (L.f.). Our results indicate that Gram-positive CW of the normal intestinal microbiota can induce cytokine responses of the human PBMC. The profile, level and kinetics of these responses are similar to those induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or CW derived from a pathogen, Streptococcus pyogenes (S.p.). Bacterial CW are capable of inducing production of a proinflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and an anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, but not that of IL-4 or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Monocytes are the main cell population in PBMC to produce TNF-alpha and IL-10. Induction of cytokine secretion is serum-dependent; both CD14-dependent and -independent pathways are involved. These findings suggest that the human cytokine responses induced by Gram-positive CW of the normal intestinal microbiota are similar to those induced by LPS or Gram-positive CW of the pathogens.
TI  - Starter culture activity in refrigerated fermented soymilk.
AB  - The refrigerated shelf life of soymilk fermented with single cultures of Lactobacillus fermentum, L. casei, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, and Bifidobacterium longum was evaluated. During storage at 4 degrees C for 28 days, the stability of the microflora differed markedly among the starter cultures. After 28 days, the average numbers of S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus decreased by two log cycles to 6.0 x 10(7) CFU/ml, whereas those of L. casei increased gradually by more than two log cycles to 4.6 x 10(9) CFU/ml. Numbers of B. longum and L. fermentum remained moderately high (8.7 x 10(8) CFU/ml and 3.7 x 10(8) CFU/ml, respectively) even after 28 days of storage. S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and L. casei continued to metabolize sucrose during the storage period, but the pattern of consumption was different among the strains. The other starter cultures did not seem to have significant activity (P > 0.05) on the residual sugars. In most cases, L(+)-lactate predominated.
TI  - Acid production from lactulose by dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Representative strains of oral streptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were incubated overnight with lactulose or other carbohydrates and the final pH recorded. Most bacteria tested were able to metabolize lactulose with the exception of strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lact. fermentum. Streptococcus mutans produced most acid overnight but the initial rate of acid production from lactulose by uninduced cultures was very low. Plaque pH was monitored in 12 volunteers following rinsing the mouth with lactulose, sucrose or sorbitol or Lactulose BP. These studies in vivo showed both lactulose and Lactulose BP to exhibit low acidogenic potential. Thus, although plaque bacteria are capable of fermenting lactulose, the results suggest that lactulose is likely to pose a small acidogenic challenge to teeth under normal conditions of use.
TI  - Preliminary characterization of microflora of Comte cheese.
AB  - The evolution of the microflora of three Comte cheeses made in duplicate with raw milk from three different sources was followed during ripening. The same starter was used with each type of milk. The comparison of the cheeses did not reveal any significant difference in the development of the microflora. Starter lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus), which are added at the beginning of manufacture, decreased quickly in the first stages of ripening supporting the hypothesis of cell autolysis. Other microorganisms, i.e. homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli (Lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, Lact. paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. fermentum), pediococci, enterococci and propionibacteria grew in cheese from small numbers in fresh curd. The characterization of Strep. thermophilus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that wild strains were also able to grow in the curd. The values for the genome size of 11 Strep. thermophilus strains determined in this investigation were in the range of 1.8-2.3 Mbp. The potential role of starter and raw milk microflora in cheese flavour development was considered.
TI  - Efficient secretion of the model antigen M6-gp41E in Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 8826.
AB  - Four Lactobacillus strains (Lb. plantarum NCIMB 8826, Lb. paracasei LbTGS1.4, Lb. casei ATCC 393 and Lb. fermentum KLD) were tested for their ability to produce and secrete heterologous proteins. These strains were first screened with an alpha-amylase reporter under the control of a set of expression or expression/secretion signals from various lactic acid bacteria. With most of the constructions tested, the level of extracellular production was highest in Lb. plantarum NCIMB 8826, and lowest in Lb. paracasei LbTGS1.4. These two strains were next assayed using a model antigen consisting of the N-terminal part of the M6 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes fused to the linear epitope ELDKWAS from human immunodeficiency virus gp41 protein. Secretion of this heterologous protein was inefficient in Lb. paracasei LbTGS1.4, which accumulated a large intracellular pool of the unprocessed precursor, whereas Lb. plantarum NCIMB 8826 was able to secrete the antigen to a level as high as 10 mg l-1.
TI  - Cell wall anchoring of the Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The M6 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. Based on the observation that the C-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the M6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several Lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing Lactobacillus fermentum strain, Lactobacillus sake, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. The M6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. In lactobacilli, essentially all detectable M6 protein was cell wall associated. These results suggest the feasibility of using the C-terminal anchor moiety of M6 for protein surface display in LAB.
TI  - [The antagonistic properties of microaerophilic bacteria isolated from the human  and mink digestive tracts].
AB  - Study of antagonistic properties of microaerophilic bacteria isolated from human  and mink gastroenteric tract have helped to establish differences in species composition, quantity and level of antagonistic activity of the studied microorganisms in respect to pathogenic microflora. It is shown that lactic acid bacteria identified as Lactobacillus fermentum and L. reuteri prevail among the strains isolated from the stomach and thin intestine of minks kept in the 30-km zone of Chernobyl NPP. Species composition of microaerophilic bacteria isolated from the digestive tract of the control minks is more variable. Antagonistically active bifidobacteria prevail in large intestine of experimental and control animals. Strains of lactic acid bacteria with the expressed antagonistic activity belonging to L. bavaricus, L. reuteri, L. coryniformis and L. maltaromicus have been found parallel with such known producers of antibiotic-like substances as L. fermentum. L. acidophilum. Streptococcus faecalis and bifidobacteria. L. maltaromicus most frequently occurred among antagonistically active strains revealed in feces of people which stayed in the zone of liquidation of the Chernobyl accident. Microaerophilic strains of bacteria (lactic acid, bifidobacteria and enterococci) manifest the expressed antagonistic activity connected with the capacity to not only acid formation but also to accumulation of antibiotic products of unknown nature. A strain of lactic acid bacteria L. fermentum 91 has been isolated from the contents of human gastroenteric tract. These bacteria are distinguished by most expressed and stable antagonism and characterized by the lack of pathogenicity in respect of albino mice that may be used to raise the microorganism resistance to gastric diseases.
TI  - Effect of extracellular lactate on growth of rumen lactate producers.
AB  - The addition of Na-lactate (50-150 mmol/l) to media with glucose had only marginal effect on the growth of rumen lactate-producing bacteria at pH between 6.5 and 5.8. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was somewhat more sensitive to external lactate than Streptococcus bovis, Lactobacillus fermentum and Selenomonas ruminantium. It can be concluded that rumen lactate producers, which proliferate at the onset of rumen lactic acidosis, are not influenced by the lactate accumulation, except some non-specific osmotic effects.
TI  - Coaggregation of oral lactobacilli with streptococci from the oral cavity.
AB  - The ability of oral lactobacilli to coaggregate with streptococci and actinomycetes was investigated. Of the 7 species of lactobacilli studied, only two were capable of coaggregation and the coaggregation was restricted to streptococci. Lactobacillus salivarius strains (2/4) coaggregated with Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus crista and tufted Streptococcus sanguis II strains. Lactobacillus fermentum (2/3) coaggregated with S. gordonii and S. sanguis. The coaggregation between L. salivarius and S. salivarius, S. gordonii or tufted S. sanguis II strains was mediated by a protein on the surface of the lactobacilli and was not inhibited by lactose. The coaggregation between L. fermentum and the streptococci was mediated by protein on the surface of the streptococci and was inhibited by lactose.
TI  - The binding of Pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid to human erythrocytes.
AB  - Previous studies have evaluated the binding characteristics of lipoteichoic acids (LTA) composed of polyglycerol phosphate to mammalian cell membranes. This present study was performed to evaluate the binding characteristics of Pneumococcal LTA, a polyribitol phosphate containing LTA, to human erythrocytes. Binding was found to be specific, reversible, and dependent on temperature and time. Maximum binding was achieved within 2 h at 37 degrees C. Scatchard plot analysis of the binding revealed a biphasic plot which suggests two receptor sites with different affinities. Competitive inhibition studies with LTA composed of polyglycerol phosphate and isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes and Lactobacillus fermentum revealed significant inhibition of Pneumococcal LTA-binding to the erythrocyte membrane by these heterologous LTAs. These results demonstrate that Pneumococcal LTA binds specifically to human erythrocytes and that the receptor site is similar for other structurally different LTAs.
TI  - The effect of pH on the sensitivity of species of Lactobacillus to chlorhexidine  and the antibiotics minocycline and spiramycin.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of Lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, Minocycline, and Spiramycin, at a range of pH from 5.0 to 7.4. Strains of Streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. There were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. The strains tested were sensitive at pH 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/mL): L. casei (6 strains), 10-60; L. plantarum (4 strains), 40; L. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; L. brevis (1 strain), 10; and L. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. The Streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/mL (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/mL (3 strains); and 10-20 micrograms/mL (2 strains). One strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/mL. Chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower pH levels. The following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/mL) at pH 6.5 followed by sensitivity at pH 5.0: L. casei (ATCC 15008), 40,60; L. plantarum (CH 374), 40,100; L. fermentum (CH 324) 10,40; L. acidophilus (ATCC 4356), 10,40; and S. mutans (BM 52), 2,2. All of the strains of Lactobacillus tested with Spiramycin were resistant at pH 5.0. Minocycline was less affected by changes in pH, but at pH 7.4 Lactobacillus strains were more resistant to Minocycline as compared with Spiramycin. Both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. The Lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of Streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.
TI  - [Lactic bacteria in the digestive tract of poultry].
AB  - Lactic bacteria predominate in the microflora of the digestive tract of chicken and turkey. They are represented mainly by Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. salivarius, L. fermentum and L. buchneri. Streptococcus faecium is always isolated. L. ruminis, L. vitulinus, L. delbrueckii, L. coryniformis and L. viridescens were found in this ecological niche for the first time. S. faecium and S. faecalis prevail in the digestive tract of geese and ducks, while lactobacilli are detected in a lesser amount and are represented mainly by L. plantarum. L. salivarius cells isolated from the digestive tract of poultry are highly polymorphous. Most of the lactic acid bacteria found in the digestive tract of poultry can grow at 45-50 degrees C whatever is the species they belong to.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid pAM beta 1 in Lactobacillus reuteri and between lactobacilli and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The broad-host-range plasmid pAM beta 1 (erythromycin resistance) was transferred conjugally from Streptococcus lactis to Lactobacillus reuteri, L. murinus, and L. fermentum. Transfer of pAM beta 1 between two L. reuteri strains occurred, and lactobacillus transconjugants could act as donors of pAM beta 1 in crosses with Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2.
TI  - Conjugal Transfer of Plasmid-Encoded Determinants for Bacteriocin Production and  Immunity in Lactobacillus acidophilus 88.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus 88 produced a bacteriocin, designated lactacin F, that  demonstrated inhibitory activity toward L. acidophilus 6032, L. lactis 970, L. helveticus 87, L. bulgaricus 1489, L. leichmanii 4797, L. fermentum 1750, and Streptococcus faecalis 19433. Production of lactacin F was pH dependent and could be maximized in MRS broth cultures maintained at pH 7.0. Lactacin F was heat stable and sensitive to ficin, proteinase K, trypsin, and Bacillus subtilis protease. L. acidophilus 88 harbored plasmids of 4 and 27 megadaltons. Variants of L. acidophilus 88 which were deficient in lactacin F production (Laf) and lactacin F immunity (Laf) retained the two resident plasmids. A Laf Laf derivative, L. acidophilus 89, was used as a recipient in agar surface mating experiments with L. acidophilus 88 (Laf Laf). Two types of Laf Laf transconjugants were recovered. One type (T-E) had acquired two plasmids of 68 (pPM68) and 52 (pPM52) megadaltons that were not detected in either the conjugal donor or the other type of Laf Laf transconjugants (T-89). Laf and Laf were unstable in the plasmid-bearing transconjugant. Plasmid analysis of Laf Laf variants revealed that pPM52 and pPM68 were cured with loss of Laf and Laf. Bacteriocin production and immunity phenotypes were genetically stable in Laf Laf transconjugants not harboring pPM52 and pPM68, suggesting chromosomal integration of the transferred determinants. The data demonstrated intragenic conjugation in L. acidophilus and provided direct evidence for involvement of transient plasmid determinants in Laf and Laf.
TI  - Effect of different preservative treatments on the microbial population of Nigerian orange juice.
AB  - The effect of different preservative treatments on the microbial load of Nigerian orange juice was studied over a period of 1 month. Results obtained indicated that pasteurization at 60 degrees and 80 degrees C for 20 to 40 min, freezing at -5 degrees C, and addition of sodium benzoate at a concentration of 0.1 to 0.4% (w/v) could form a microbiological basis for the preservation of the juice for 1 month. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, L. paramesenteroides, Streptococcus avium, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. fermentum, L. fructivorans, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were the micro-organisms isolated from the untreated and treated juice samples.
TI  - The ability to sensitize host cells for destruction by autologous complement is a general property of lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Streptococcus pneumoniae binds to erythrocytes and renders them susceptible to lysis by autologous complement. The present study was performed to determine whether LTA from two other gram-positive bacterial species had the ability to render mammalian cells susceptible to lysis by autologous complement. Human erythrocytes were sensitized with LTA from S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Lactobacillus fermentum. Under incubation in normal autologous serum, lysis was observed with each of the LTA-sensitized erythrocyte preparations. When erythrocytes from a C2-deficient patient were sensitized with the LTA preparations and then incubated in autologous, C2-deficient serum, the erythrocytes sensitized with S. pyogenes or L. fermentum LTA demonstrated relatively little lysis, whereas the erythrocytes sensitized with S. pneumoniae LTA yielded near-total lysis. After reconstitution of the C2-deficient serum with purified human C2, lysis was observed with all three LTA preparations. When erythrocytes from an agammaglobulinemic patient were sensitized with either the S. pyogenes or the L. fermentum LTA, they were not lysed in the presence of autologous agammaglobulinemic serum, whereas the erythrocytes sensitized with S. pneumoniae LTA were completely lysed. Serum obtained from the agammaglobulinemic patient after reconstitution with intravenous pooled gamma globulin was able to lyse autologous erythrocytes sensitized with each of the three LTA preparations. These results demonstrate that the ability to render host cells susceptible to lysis by autologous complement is a general property of LTA. Whether activation of the autologous complement occurs by the classical or alternative pathways and whether it is antibody dependent depends on the nature of the bacterial LTA.
TI  - Adherence of Trichomonas vaginalis to cell culture monolayers.
AB  - The in vitro adherence to WISH cells of a pathogenic Trichomonas vaginalis strain was studied with a method utilizing thymidine-labeled protozoa. A marked dose-related adherence was observed. Glutaraldehyde fixed trichomonads were not adherent. The presence of fetal calf serum during the assay did not influence attachment. Concanavalin A inhibited adherence of protozoa. Complete or partial inhibition of adherence was achieved by preincubating WISH cells with Lactobacillus fermentum or Streptococcus agalactiae. Finally, pretreatment of cells with alpha-estradiol, beta-estradiol, progesterone and estrone influenced attachment of protozoa, whereas estriol was ineffective. These results suggest that adherence of Trichomonas vaginalis is dependent on different factors, whose manipulation may have clinical relevance in preventing recurrence of trichomonad vaginitis.
TI  - Growth inhibition of Streptococcus mutans by cellular extracts of human intestinal lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro growth of Streptococcus mutans was completely inhibited by water-soluble extracts from cells of various intestinal lactic acid bacteria identified as Streptococcus faecium, Streptococcus equinus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The growth inhibition was dependent on the concentrations of the extracts. In contrast, the extracts did not inhibit the growth of the major indigenous intestinal lactic acid bacteria isolated from humans. These lactic acid bacteria were not acutely toxic in mice.
TI  - Interaction of anti-kojibiose antibody with the lipoteichoic acids from Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - Antisera prepared in rabbits by immunization with p-aminophenyl beta-kojibioside  conjugated to bovine serum albumin (antikojibiose sera), readily agglutinated whole cells of Streptococcus faecalis or Streptococcus faecium, and showed specific reactions with the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) of these streptococci by passive hemagglutination, microscale enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The interaction of the antikojibiose sera with the LTAs was inhibited best by kojibiose [alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----2)-D-glucose], somewhat less by the dextran from which the kojibiose was prepared, and not measurably by maltose [alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----4)-D-glucose]. The sera reacted only minimally in only the most sensitive assay (microscale enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with LTA from group A streptococci (this LTA contains a single kojibiosyl residue as part of the glycolipid moiety of the molecule and failed to react with the Lactobacillus fermentum LTA which is substituted with alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----2)-D -glucosyl units.
TI  - The adherence of lactic acid bacteria to the columnar epithelial cells of pigs and calves.
AB  - The adhesion of various lactobacilli and streptococci to columnar epithelial cells of pigs and calves were studied, by in vitro methods. The porcine strains isolated most frequently were Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lact, acidophilus and Lact. fermentum. Thirteen of the 22 lactobacilli were adhesive. All the streptococci isolated belonged to Lancefield's D-group; none of them adhered to pig epithelial cells. The adhesive strains (9 of 22) of calves were identified as Lact. fermentum. Adherence was variable even between strains of the same species. Isolates from plant material, cultured milk and cheese did not adhere to the columnar epithelial cells in vitro. The adhesive porcine strains tolerated low pH and bile acids, which is important for their survival under conditions in the stomach and intestine.
TI  - Detection and activity of lactacin B, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - A total of 52 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were examined for production of bacteriocins. A majority (63%) demonstrated inhibitory activity against all members of a four-species grouping of Lactobacillus leichmannii, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Lactobacillus lactis. Four L. acidophilus strains with this activity also inhibited Streptococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus fermentum, suggesting a second system of antagonism. Under conditions eliminating the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, no inhibition of other gram-positive or -negative genera was demonstrated by L. acidophilus. The agent produced by L. acidophilus N2 and responsible for inhibition of L. leichmannii, L. bulgaricus, L. helveticus, and L. lactis was investigated. Ultrafiltration studies indicated a molecular weight of approximately 100,000 for the crude inhibitor. The agent was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 60 min at 100 degrees C (pH 5). Activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. These characteristics identified the inhibitory agent as a bacteriocin, designated lactacin B. Examination of strains of L. acidophilus within the six homology groupings of Johnson et al. (Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 30:53-68, 1980) demonstrated that production of the bacteriocin lactacin B could not be used in classification of neotype L. acidophilus strains. However, the usefulness of employing sensitivity to lactacin B in classification of dairy lactobacilli is suggested.
TI  - A Phylogenetic Analysis of Lactobacilli, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. brevis, L. plantarum, L.  ruminis, L. casei, L. bifermentans, L. viridescens, L. fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 S ribosomal RNAs. All Lactobacillus species investigated together with P. pentosaceus and L. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. L. acidophilus and L. helveticus is the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. Lactobacillus, together with Streptococcus and Bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of Gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.
TI  - Immunisation of rhesus monkeys with Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus and lipoteichoic acid for protection against dental caries.
AB  - An attempt was made to protect rhesus monkeys from dental caries by immunisation  with Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). The vaccine composed of S. mutans gave significant protection against caries, a decrease in the number of S. mutans, an increase in IgG antibodies and a moderate increase in complement-fixing antibodies to LTA. When LTA was used as immunogen, there was only a small reduction in caries, without any detectable antibodies to LTA and a slight increase in IgG antibodies to cell of S. mutans. Vaccines of L. acidophilus or L. fermentum gave no protection. A combined vaccine of S. mutans and L. acidophilus did not reduce the incidence of caries but the antibody titre to cells of S. mutans was raised to a level comparable with that in the S. mutans-immunised monkeys. The results of this investigation in a subhuman primate confirm that immunisation with S. mutans induces protection against caries, unlike the attempt to immunise with two selected strains of lactobacilli. More studies are required to establish the role of specific serotypes of lactobacilli in the development of dental caries.
TI  - Production of lipoteichoic acid by lactobacilli and streptococci grown in different environments.
AB  - Representative strains of Streptococcus sanguis serotype 2 and of four Lactobacillus species were examined for the production of cellular and extracellular lipoteichoic acid (LTA) when grown at pH 6.0 in batch culture to the stationary phase with either glucose or fructose. Extracellular LTA was a minor component in all cases except for L. fermentum and L. casei NIRD R094 grown in fructose. The total amount of LTA (cellular and extracellular) produced by fructose-grown cultures was also considerably greater for these two strains, for L. salivarius, and also two of the S. sanguis strains. Growth of L. fermentum and L. casei in continuous culture in a chemostat showed that generation time and pH of growth can influence the total amount of LTA and the proportion of extracellular material. The results for glucose-limited cultures were quite disparate, with L. fermentum forming considerably more extracellular LTA than L. casei. However, in fructose-limited cultures L. fermentum formed less total LTA and L. casei more so that the differences were only minor. A difference in the utilization of glucose and fructose by the heterofermentative L. fermentum and the homofermentative L. casei strains is also indicated by differences in the yield of organisms at different dilution rates in continuous culture.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - Interaction of Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferases with teichoic acids.
AB  - The Streptococcus mutans GS5 glucosyltransferase activities (both water-soluble and -insoluble glucan-synthesizing fractions) were inhibited by purified lipoteichoic acid. In vitro sucrose-dependent colonization of smooth surfaces by strain GS5 was also markedly reduced in the presence of the amphipathic molecules. The inhibition of soluble glucan synthesis by lipoteichoic acid appeared to be competitive with respect to both sucrose and primer dextran T10. These inhibitory effects were dependent on the presence of the fatty acid components of lipoteichoic acid since deacylated lipoteichoic acids did not inhibit glucosyltransferase activity. However, the deacylated molecules did interact with the enzymes since deacylated lipoteichoic acid partially protected the enzyme activity against heat inactivation and also induced the formation of high-molecular-weight enzyme complexes from the soluble glucan-synthesizing fraction. The presence of teichoic acid in high-molecular-weight aggregates of glucosyltransferase isolated from the culture fluids of strain GS5 was suggested by the detection of polyglycerophosphate in these fractions. In addition to strain GS5, two other organisms containing polyglycerophosphate teichoic acids, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus fermentum, were demonstrated to bind glucosyltransferase activity. These results are discussed relative to the potential role of teichoic acid-glucosyltransferase interactions in enzyme binding to the cell surface of S. mutans and the formation of high-molecular-weight enzyme aggregates in the culture fluids of the organism.
TI  - Culture of five commonly used Acid-producing bacteria on banana pulp.
AB  - A significant fraction of the bananas and plantains produced in the humid tropics are wasted due to rapid spoilage. The use of acid-producing, anaerobic fermentation may be a safe and economical way to preserve the fruit in both large- and small-scale applications. The abilities of five commonly used, acid-producing bacteria to ferment media containing ripe or green bananas were examined. Three homofermentative bacteria, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Streptococcus faecalis, typically reduced the pH of a puree of ripe bananas from 4.8 to about 3.5 to 3.6 in 7 days at 37 degrees C. Action on green bananas was similar, but the drop in pH was less pronounced. Very little gas evolved. Lactobacillus fermentum (formerly Lactobacillus fermenti) and Leuconostoc mesenteroides showed active gas evolution and a significant drop in pH. About twice as much gas evolved from ripe banana medium as from green bananas. The fermented purees were spongy, soft solids floating in a clear liquor. The color was medium to light creamy brown, and the odor was pleasant. Fermented products stored at room temperature retained good appearance and aroma throughout a 1-month storage test.
TI  - Cariogenicity of human oral lactobacilli in hamsters.
AB  - Of 50 strains of lactobacilli isolated from dental plaque of school children, two strains, provisionally identified as Lactobacillus salivarius, and one strain, provisionally identified as Lactobacillus fermentum, induced significant caries activity in conventional hamsters. Sucrose was a required dietary cariogenic substrate and could not be replaced with glucose or starch. In contrast to cariogenic strains of Streptococcus mutans the active lactobacilli did not form adherent sucrose-mediated plaques in vitro, did not form intracellular iodophilic polysaccharides and did not form detectable insoluble extracellular polyglucans.
TI  - Extractability of cell wall polysaccharide from lactobacilli and streptococci by  autoclaving and by dilue acid.
AB  - Autoclaving cell wall of Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt for 15 min under the Rantz and Randall conditions released one-tenth of the total cell wall carbohydrate, whereas two-thirds was extracted after autoclaving for 180 min. The extract contained the serotype c-specific antigen but lacked the lipoteichoic acid component extracted when whole cells were autoclaved. Autoclaving cell wall preparations from other strains of S. mutans and also Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis in 0.85% NaCl for 180 min released the major proportion of the wall polysaccharide fraction. Approximately 50 to 90% of wall carbohydrate of Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus casei was released when cell wall preparations were autoclaved in 0.85% NaCl for 180 min. For wall preparations from several strains of S. mutans, autoclaving for 60 min at pH 3.75 released only 39 to 62% of wall carbohydrate, whereas almost total release could be achieved with the lactobacilli. Heating S. mutans Ingbritt cell wall for 24 h at 60 degrees C in 0.1 N H(2)SO(4) released only two-thirds of the wall carbohydrate; by comparison nearly all of the wall carbohydrate was released in 3 h from L. casei and L. fermentum. Autoclaving L. casei cell wall and purified soluble wall fractions hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bond between the polysaccharide and peptidoglycan. This was shown by the release of reactive N-acetylhexosamine in both cases and the presence of a phosphomonoester in the autoclaved soluble wall fractions. The results indicate that autoclaving can hydrolyze covalent linkages, and this must be considered when the Rantz and Randall procedure is used to obtain antigen preparations.
TI  - Bacteria associated with the gastric epithelium of neonatal pigs.
AB  - Light and electron microscopy showed lactobacilli and, to a lesser degree, streptococci to be closely associated with the squamous area of the pig stomach known as the pars esophagea. Several different types of extracellular layers were seen on bacteria attached to the epithelial surface. The total number of bacteria per square centimeter did not change with age up to 10 days, and there was no effect of weaning at 2 days. Lactobacillus fermentum, L. salivarius, and Streptococcus salivarius were isolated more frequently from sucking pigs than from those that were early weaned, whereas the reverse was true of L. acidophilus and S. bovis. All isolates recovered from washed macerated pars esophagea adhered to pig esophageal epithelial cells when tested in vitro.
TI  - Effect of growth conditions on the antigenic components of Streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli.
AB  - 1) The release of LTA from chemostat-grown cultures of S. mutans and L. fermentum is dependent on the generation time and pH. 2) The growth rate affects the immunogenicity of LTA and the wall polysaccharide of L. fermentum. 3) The growth of L. plantarum under glucose limitation influences the glucose content of the wall teichoic acid. The composition of the wall polysaccharide of S. mutans Ingbritt may also be changed under these conditions. 4) The conditions of autoclaving used to release cell wall antigens can hydrolyse the covalent linkage between polysaccharide and peptidoglycan.
TI  - Changes in the microflora and physiology of the anterior intestinal tract of pigs weaned at 2 days, with special reference to the pathogenesis of diarrhea.
AB  - The gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. Although there was a significantly higher count of Escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. There were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. Lactobacillus fermentum, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus salivarius, S. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. L. fermentum and S. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. The weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there may be gastric stasis. The gastric pH was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. In weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between pH and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and also a positive correlation between pH and number of E. coli. These correlations suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in the regulation of gastric pH in weaned pigs. Three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting HCl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, pH < 3.5). In sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. In weaned scouring pigs there was a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. There was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.
TI  - Origin of esterases in human whole saliva.
AB  - Whole saliva of 59 healthy persons was used for determination of esterase activity. The pattern of esterase was studied by means of isoelectrofocusing on thin-layer acrylamide gels. The esterases found in whole saliva are suggested to be derived from the cells of the tissue in the oral cavity. This origin is indicated (e.g.) by comparison between isolectrophoretic esterase patterns of whole saliva, submandibular saliva, gingival biopsy and fibroblast culture. Antisera against partially purified saliva esterases were produced in rabbits. These sera, used in immunoelectro-osmophoresis, gave esterase-active immunoprecipitate against whole saliva, the water-soluble materials of disrupted gingival biopsy and fibroblast culture, but not against the material of the bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis, Strptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus and Lactobacillus fermentum.
TI  - Reduction of population levels of some indigenous bacteria by lactobacilli in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - Effects of each of three indigenous Lactobacillus groups on other bacterial populations were separately investigated in gnotobiotic rats. In the wall of the non-glandular part of the stomach, contents of the stomach and contents of the upper part of the small intestine, some pre-associated indigenous bacteria were reduced to conventional population levels by introducing three groups of lactobacilli: Group I (Lactobacillus acidophilus and related strains), Group II (L. fermentum) and the groups mixed. However, no obvious reduction in cell numbers of the pre-associated bacteria occurred in the case of Group III (L. murini).
TI  - Formation of extracellular lipoteichoic acid by oral streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  - Examination of the culture fluids from a number of strains of oral streptococci and latobacilli has shown the presence of an erythrocyte-sensitizing antigen with the properties of lipoteichoic acid. The antigen was isolated from the culture fluids of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus fermentum and characterized chemically and serologically, For other strains, serological evidence for the presence of lipoteichoic acid depends on the reactivity with antiserum specific for the glycerol phosphate backbone. The relative concentrations of the antigen in culture fluids from different organisms, in culture fluids from different stages of growth, and in extracts of organisms was estimated by determining the maximum dilution that fully sensitized erythrocytes; the culture fluid titer, which is the reciprocal of the dilution, varied from 4 to 320. Strains of Streptococcus mutans were generally characterized by a high level of extracellular lipoteichoic acid, the amount being greater than that detectable in cell extracts; this conclusion was confirmed by using the quantitative precipitin method. A high-molecular-weight fraction obtained from S. mutans BHT culture fluid was effective in sensitizing erythrocytes at a concentration of 1 mug/ml, compared with 2 mug/ml required for cellular lipoteichoic acid from L. casei. The detecting procedure depends on the teichoic acid sensitizing erythrocytes but, as shown with L. fermentum, low-molecular-weight nonsensitizing teichoic acid may also be present in culture fluid.
