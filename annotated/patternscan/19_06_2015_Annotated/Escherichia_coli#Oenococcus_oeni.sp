TI  == the use of the replication region of plasmid prs7 from oenococcus oeni as a putative tool to generate cloning vectors for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a chimeric plasmid, prs7rep (6.1 kb), was constructed using the replication region of prs7, a large plasmid from oenococcus oeni, and pem64, a plasmid derived from pij2925 and containing a gene for resistance to chloramphenicol. prs7rep is a shuttle vector that replicates in escherichia coli using its pij2925 component and in lactic acid bacteria (lab) using the replication region of prs7. high levels of transformants per microg of dna were obtained by electroporation of prs7rep into pediococcus acidilactici (1.5 x 10(7)), lactobacillus plantarum (5.7 x 10(5)), lactobacillus casei (2.3 x 10(5)), leuconostoc citreum (2.7 x 10(5)), and enterococcus faecalis (2.4 x 10(5)). a preliminary optimisation of the technical conditions of electrotransformation showed that p. acidilactici and l. plantarum are better transformed at a later exponential phase of growth, whereas l. casei requires the early exponential phase for better electrotransformation efficiency. prs7rep contains single restriction sites useful for cloning purposes, bamhi, xbai, sali, hincii, sphi and psti, and was maintained at an acceptable rate (>50%) over 100 generations without selective pressure in l. plantarum, but was less stable in l. casei and p. acidilactici. the ability of prs7rep to accept and express other genes was assessed. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the replication region of a plasmid from o. oeni has been used to generate a cloning vector.

TI  == assessment of probiotic properties in lactic acid bacteria isolated from wine.
AB  == probiotic properties are highly strain-dependent but rarely studied in enological lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this study, the probiotic features of 11 strains of lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., and oenococcus oeni, including saliva and acid resistance, bile tolerance and exopolysaccharides' production, were investigated. the assays included two probiotic reference strains (lactobacillus  plantarum clc 17 and lactobacillus fermentum cect5716). the lactobacillus and pediococcus strains showed high resistance to lysozyme (>80% resistance to 100 mg/l of lysozyme under conditions simulating the in vivo dilution by saliva) and  were capable of surviving at low ph values (ph 1.8) and bile salts, suggesting good adaptation of the wine strains to gastrointestinal conditions. the ability of the strains to adhere to the intestinal mucosa and the inhibition of the adhesion of escherichia coli to human intestinal cells were also evaluated. adhesion levels of enological lab to caco-2 cells varied from 0.37% to 12.2%, depending on the strain. in particular, pediococcus pentosaceus cial-86 showed a  high percentage of adhesion to intestinal cells (>12%), even higher than that shown by the probiotic reference strains, and a high anti-adhesion activity against e. coli cial-153 (>30%), all of which support this wine lab strain as a potential probiotic.

TI  == structural and biochemical characterisation of a nad(+)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase from oenococcus oeni as a new model molecule for industrial biotechnology applications.
AB  == alcohol dehydrogenases are highly diverse enzymes catalysing the interconversion  of alcohols and aldehydes or ketones. due to their versatile specificities, these biocatalysts are of great interest for industrial applications. the adh3-gene encoding a group iii alcohol dehydrogenase was isolated from the gram-positive bacterium oenococcus oeni and was characterised after expression in the heterologous host escherichia coli. adh3 has been identified by genome blastp analyses using the amino acid sequence of 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase dhat from klebsiella pneumoniae and group iii alcohol dehydrogenases with known activity towards 1,3-propanediol as target sequences. the recombinant protein was purified in a two-step column chromatography approach. crystal structure determination and biochemical characterisation confirmed that adh3 forms a ni(2+)-containing homodimer in its active form. adh3 catalyses the interconversion of ethanol and its corresponding aldehyde acetaldyhyde and is also capable of using other alcoholic compounds as substrates, such as 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol and 1-propanol. in the presence of ni(2+), activity increases towards 1,3-propanediol and 1,2-propanediol. adh3 is strictly dependent on nad(+)/nadh, whereas no activity has been observed with nadp(+)/nadph as co-factor. the enzyme exhibits a specific activity of 1.1 u/mg using etoh as substrate with an optimal ph value of 9.0 for ethanol oxidation and 8.0 for aldehyde reduction. moreover, adh3 exhibits tolerance to several metal ions and organic solvents, but is completely inhibited in the presence of zn(2+). the present study demonstrates that o. oeni is a group iii alcohol dehydrogenase with versatile substrate specificity, including ni(2+)-dependent activity towards 1,3-propanediol.

TI  == malolactic enzyme from oenococcus oeni: heterologous expression in escherichia coli and biochemical characterization.
AB  == malolactic enzymes (mle) are known to directly convert l-malic acid into l-lactic acid with a catalytical requirement of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad (+) ) and mn ( 2+) ; however, the reaction mechanism is still unclear. to study a mle, the structural gene from oenococcus oeni strain dsm 20255 was heterologously expressed in escherichia coli, yielding 22.9 ku l (-1) fermentation broth. after  affinity chromatography and removal of apparently inactive protein by precipitation, purified recombinant mle had a specific activity of 280 u mg (-1)  protein with a recovery of approximately 61%. the enzyme appears to be a homodimer with a molecular mass of 128 kda consisting of two 64 kda subunits. characterization of the recombinant enzyme showed optimum activity at ph 6.0 and  45 degrees c, and km, vmax and kcat values of 4.9 mm, 427 u mg (-1) and 456 sec (-1) for l-malic acid, 91.4 microm, 295 u mg (-1) and 315 sec (-1) for nad (+) and 4.6 microm, 229 u mg (-1) and 244 sec (-1) for mn ( 2+) , respectively. the recombinant mle retained 95% of its activity after 3 mo at room temperature and 7 mo at 4 degrees c. when using pyruvic acid as substrate, the enzyme showed the conversion of pyruvic acid with detectable l-lactate dehydrogenase (l-ldh) activity and oxidation of nadh. this interesting observation might explain that mle catalyzes a redox reaction and hence, the requirements for nad (+) and mn ( 2+) during the conversion of l-malic to l-lactic acid.

TI  == basic characterization and partial purification of beta-glucosidase from cell-free extracts of oenococcus oeni st81.
AB  == aims: this study was designed to characterize a beta-glucosidase of oenococcus oeni st81, a strain isolated from a spanish wine of the origin appellation ribeira sacra. methods and results: the beta-glucosidase of o. oeni st81 seems to have a periplasmic localization into the cells. this activity was strongly inhibited by gluconic acid, partially inhibited by glucose and not inhibited by fructose, lactate, malate, mannitol or sorbitol. ethanol increased the activity of this enzyme up to 147%. among the several metal ions assayed, only fe(2)(+) (10 mmol l(-)(1)) and cu(2)(+) (5 mmol l(-)(1)) exhibited a partial inhibitory effect (40%). this enzyme was partially purified using a combination of ammonium  sulfate precipitation and chromatographic methods. the single peak because of beta-glucosidase in all chromatographic columns indicates the presence of a single enzyme with an estimated molecular mass of 140 kda. the calculated k(m) and v(max) values for 4-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside were 0.38 mmol l(-)(1) and 5.21 nmol min(-)(1), respectively. the enzyme was stable at ph 5.0 with a value of t(1/2) = 50 days for the crude extract. conclusions: the beta-glucosidase of o. oeni st81 is substantially different from those characterized from other wine-related lactic acid bacteria (lab), such as lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis; however, it appears to be closely related to a beta-glucosidase from o. oeni atcc baa-1163 cloned into escherichia coli. the periplasmic localization of the enzyme together with its high tolerance to ethanol and fructose, the low inhibitory effect of some wine-related compounds on the enzymatic activity and long-term stability of the enzyme could be of interest for winemaking. significance and impact of the study: information regarding a beta-glucosidase from o. oeni st81 is presented. although the release of aroma compounds by lab has been demonstrated, little information exists concerning the responsible enzymes. to our knowledge, this study contains  the first characterization of a native beta-glucosidase purified from crude extracts of o. oeni st81.

TI  == co-expression of the small heat shock protein, lo18, with beta-glucosidase in escherichia coli improves solubilization and reveals various associations with overproduced heterologous protein, groel/es.
AB  == we developed a new system to improve the overproduction of soluble proteins in e. coli based on a plasmid encoding the small heat-shock protein, lo18, derived from the lactic acid bacterium oenococcus oeni. the efficiency of this system was compared with that of another system based on production of the e. coli universal chaperone groel/es. a compatible plasmid encoding beta-glucosidase was constructed for the overproduction and aggregation of this enzyme. co-expression  with lo18 resulted in an increase in soluble beta-glucosidase levels similar to that obtained in the groel/es co-expression system. lo18 was found preferentially in the insoluble fraction, associated with aggregated enzyme. by contrast, groel/es was more abundant in the soluble fraction.

TI  == growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens by oenococcus oeni.
AB  == to explore the possibility of using oenococcus oeni to inhibit foodborne pathogens, and to characterize antimicrobial compounds produced by o. oeni, 24 strains of o. oeni were tested for their ability to inhibit growth of foodborne pathogens, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enteritidis, and listeria monocytogenes by using the spot-on-lawn method. of the 24 strains, 17 strains were able to inhibit all 3 pathogens in this study. proteases, catalase, and buffer solutions were used for determining the type of inhibitory compounds produced from 4 selected strains with stronger inhibitory activity. antimicrobial activity of 2 strains against the pathogens was completely inactivated by buffer  solution, and other 2 strains against e. coli o157:h7 were partially removed. the antimicrobial compound was not sensitive to selected proteases and catalase. practical application: there is little information available about using o. oeni  for human pathogens control. the results of this study revealed such discovery and potential applications for pathogen control.

TI  == construction of theta-type shuttle vector for leuconostoc and other lactic acid bacteria using pcb42 isolated from kimchi.
AB  == the pcb42 plasmid from leuconostoc citreum cb2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (lab) was constructed. the pcb42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low g+c content, and no single-stranded dna intermediates during replication, which indicates that pcb42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. in silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 dna-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. the fragment encompassing orf5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. this plasmid was capable of replicating in various lab, including l. citreum, l.  mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, lb. reuteri, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, weissella confusa, and oenococcus oeni. the lab-e. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pcb42 and pek104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pleucm42, showed a high segregational stability in l. citreum cb2567 after 100 generations of cell division. by using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, l. citreum cb2567. the pleucm42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering  of various strains of lab.

TI  == molecular cloning, heterologous expression, and characterization of ornithine decarboxylase from oenococcus oeni.
AB  == ornithine decarboxylase (odc) is responsible for the production of putrescine, the major biogenic amine found in wine. oenococcus oeni is the most important lactic acid bacterium in the winemaking process and is involved in malolactic fermentation. we report here the characterization of odc from an o. oeni strain isolated from wine. screening of 263 strains isolated from wine and cider from all over the world revealed that the presence of the odc gene appears to be strain specific in o. oeni. after cloning, heterologous expression in escherichia coli, and characterization, the enzyme was found to have a molecular mass of 85 kda and a pi of 6.2 and revealed maximal activity at ph 5.5 and an optimum temperature of 35 degrees c. kinetic studies showed that o. oeni odc is specific  for l-ornithine with a k(m) value of 1 mm and a v(max) of 0.57 u.mg(-1). the hypothesis that cadaverine, which results from lysine decarboxylation, may be linked to putrescine production is not valid since o. oeni odc cannot decarboxylate l-lysine. as no lysine decarboxylase was detected in any of the o.  oeni genomes sequenced, cadaverine synthesis may result from another metabolic pathway. this work is the first characterization of an odc from a lactic acid bacterium isolated from a fermented product.

TI  == cloning and characterisation of a cystathionine beta/gamma-lyase from two oenococcus oeni oenological strains.
AB  == sulphur-containing compounds in wine have been extensively studied because of their effect on wine flavour and quality. in this study, an enzyme that degrades  sulphur-containing amino acids was cloned and characterised from two oenococcus oeni strains of oenological origins. the enzyme has features of a cystathionine-gamma-lyase (ec 4.4.1.1), a pyridoxal-5-phosphate-dependent enzyme  catalysing an alpha,gamma-elimination reaction of l: -cystathionine to produce l: -cysteine, alpha-ketobutyrate and ammonia. moreover, it was able to catalyse an alpha,beta-elimination reaction producing homocysteine, pyruvate and ammonia from l: -cystathionine. an elimination reaction of l: -cysteine and dl: -homocysteine  was also efficiently catalysed by the enzyme, resulting in the formation of hydrogen sulphide. furthermore, the ability to demethiolate methionine into methanethiol, an unfavourable volatile sulphur compound in terms of wine aroma, was observed. the findings of this work suggest that o. oeni seems to play a minor role in the production of volatile sulphur compounds during the vinification process as the optimal conditions were far from the harsh wine environment.

TI  == distinct amino acids of the oenococcus oeni small heat shock protein lo18 are essential for damaged protein protection and membrane stabilization.
AB  == the small heat shock protein (smhsp) lo18 from lactic acid bacteria oenococcus oeni reduces in vitro thermal aggregation of proteins and modulates the membrane  fluidity of native liposomes. an absence of information relating to the way in which the smhsp demonstrates a stabilizing effect for both proteins and membranes prompted this study. we expressed three lo18 proteins with amino acid substitutions in escherichia coli to investigate their ability to prevent e. coli protein aggregation and their capacity to stabilize e. coli whole-cell membranes. our results showed that the alanine 123 to serine substitution induces a decrease in chaperone activity in denaturated proteins, and that the tyrosine 107 is required for membrane stabilization. moreover, this study revealed that the oligomeric structures of proteins with amino acid substitutions do not appear to  be modified. our data strongly suggest that different amino acids are involved in the thermostabilization of proteins and in membrane fluidity regulation and are localized in the alpha-crystallin domain.

TI  == cloning and characterization of an intracellular esterase from the wine-associated lactic acid bacterium oenococcus oeni.
AB  == we report the cloning and characterization of estb28, the first esterase to be so characterized from the wine-associated lactic acid bacterium, oenococcus oeni. the published sequence for o. oeni strain psu-1 was used to identify putative esterase genes and design pcr primers in order to amplify the corresponding region from strain ooeni28, an isolate intended for inoculation of wines. in this way a 912-bp open reading frame (orf) encoding a putative esterase of 34.5 kda was obtained. the amino acid sequence indicated that estb28 is a member of family iv of lipolytic enzymes and contains the gdsag motif common to other lactic acid  bacteria. this orf was cloned into escherichia coli using an appropriate expression system, and the recombinant esterase was purified. characterization of estb28 revealed that the optimum temperature, ph, and ethanol concentration were  40 degrees c, ph 5.0, and 28% (vol/vol), respectively. estb28 also retained marked activity under conditions relevant to winemaking (10 to 20 degrees c, ph 3.5, 14% [vol/vol] ethanol). kinetic constants were determined for estb28 with p-nitrophenyl (pnp)-linked substrates ranging in chain length from c(2) to c(18). estb28 exhibited greatest specificity for c(2) to c(4) pnp-linked substrates.

TI  == characterization of an acquired dps-containing gene island in the lactic acid bacterium oenococcus oeni.
AB  == aims: to identify novel actors responsible for the marked adaptation of the oenococcus oeni species to its environment. methods and results: genomic surveillance of the available genome sequences from o. oeni indicated the presence of a small orf, encoding a protein named dps(a). the cloned gene complemented the dps(-) mutant of escherichia coli and conferred resistance to hydrogen peroxide, wine, and metals. the dps(a) gene was flanked by is-related elements. the entire region was characterized by an anomalously high gc content compared to those reported for oenococcal genomes. the dps(a) gene was present in 15 of the 38 tested isolates. positive strains originated from different geographical areas and sources. no change in tolerance to wine or to oxidative stress was observed between o. oeni strains harbouring dps(a) and those not harbouring this gene. conclusions: some o. oeni have acquired a functional homologue to the dps gene from e. coli as part of a mobile element. significance  and impact of the study: dps(a) probably increases the bacterial fitness in response to environmental challenges. however, the physiological condition under  which it adds a selective advantage to o. oeni during winemaking remains to be found.

TI  == changes in membrane lipid composition in ethanol- and acid-adapted oenococcus oeni cells: characterization of the cfa gene by heterologous complementation.
AB  == cyclopropane fatty acid (cfa) synthesis was investigated in oenococcus oeni. the  data obtained demonstrated that acid-grown cells or cells harvested in the stationary growth phase showed changes in fatty acid composition similar to those of ethanol-grown cells. an increase of the cfa content and a decrease of the oleic acid content were observed. the biosynthesis of cfas from unsaturated fatty acid phospholipids is catalysed by cfa synthases. quantitative real-time-pcr experiments were performed on the cfa gene of o. oeni, which encodes a putative cfa synthase. the level of cfa transcripts increased when cells were harvested in stationary phase and when cells were grown in the presence of ethanol or at low ph, suggesting transcriptional regulation of the cfa gene under different stress  conditions. in contrast to escherichia coli, only one functional promoter was identified upstream of the cfa gene of o. oeni. the function of the cfa gene was  confirmed by complementation of a cfa-deficient e. coli strain. nevertheless, the complementation remained partial because the conversion percentage of unsaturated fatty acids into cfa of the complemented strain was much lower than that of the wild-type strain. moreover, a prevalence of cycc19 : 0 was observed in the membrane of the complemented strain. this could be due to a specific affinity of  the cfa synthase from o. oeni. in spite of this partial complementation, the complemented strain of e. coli totally recovered its viability after ethanol shock (10 %, v/v) whereas its viability was only partly recovered after an acid shock at ph 3.0.

AB  == extracellular proteins from oenococcus oeni, a wine-making bacterium, were isolated during growth on media differing by their nitrogen content. analysis by  two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed a low number of protein signals. among the main spots, one signal corresponded to a single protein, which contained a lysine repeat domain characteristic of cell-wall hydrolases. we demonstrated that this major protein, named epra, was able to hydrolyse several proteins. the heterologous production of this protein in escherichia coli confirmed the protease activity of epra. with a mw of 21.3 kda and a pi of 5.3, epra presents optimal activity at ph 7.0 and 45 degrees c. this o. oeni protease differs from all lactic acid bacteria proteases so far identified, and thus this bacterium possesses at least three proteases for wine protein hydrolysis.

TI  == heterologous expression of bacterial and human multidrug resistance proteins protect escherichia coli against mercury and zinc contamination.
AB  == in order to determine the role of multidrug resistance proteins in mercury and zinc resistance, human mdr1, lactococcus lactis lmra, and oenococcus oeni omra genes were expressed in an escherichia coli tolc mutant which is hypersensitive to metals. the three transporters conferred an increased mercury and zinc resistance to e. coli as compared to the control bacteria. this improved resistance correlated with a decreased zinc and mercury bioaccumulation. indeed,  quantification of intracellular metal concentrations by atomic absorption spectrometry (aas) showed a 2.1-, 3-, and 5.1-fold decrease in zinc in cells expressing hmdr1, omra, and lmra, respectively, and a 2.7-, 7.5-, and 7.7-fold decrease in mercury in cells expressing omra, lmra, and hmdr1, respectively, as compared to the control bacteria. this means that hmdr1, lmra, and omra proteins  which are specialised in xenobiotic scavenging, their main known function, are nevertheless able to confer some resistance against metals. our results show that the tolc mutated strain is well adapted to the study of mdr transporter activity  and could be used to screen substrates and competitive hmdr1 inhibitors.

TI  == the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus has a novel structure.
AB  == in methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus, oxaloacetate synthesis is a major and  essential co(2)-fixation reaction. this methanogenic archaeon possesses two oxaloacetate-synthesizing enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from this organism was purified  to homogeneity. the subunit size of this homotetrameric protein was 55 kda, which is about half that of all known bacterial and eukaryotic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases (ppcs). the nh(2)-terminal sequence identified this enzyme as the product of mth943, an open reading frame with no assigned function in the genome  sequence. a blast search did not show an obvious sequence similarity between mth943 and known ppcs, which are generally well conserved. this is the first report of a new type of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase that we call ppca ("a" for "archaeal"). homologs to ppca were present in most archaeal genomic sequences, but only in three bacterial (clostridium perfringens, oenococcus oeni, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) and no eukaryotic genomes. ppca was the only recognizable oxaloacetate-producing enzyme in methanopyrus kandleri, a hydrothermal vent organism. each ppca-containing organism lacked a ppc homolog. the activity of m. thermautotrophicus ppca was not influenced by acetyl coenzyme  a and was about 50 times less sensitive to aspartate than the escherichia coli ppc. the catalytic core (including his(138), arg(587), and gly(883)) of the e. coli ppc was partly conserved in ppca, but three of four aspartate-binding residues (lys(773), arg(832), and asn(881)) were not. ppcs probably evolved from  ppca through a process that added allosteric sites to the enzyme. the reverse is  also equally possible.

AB  == the central genomic regions of oenococcus oeni phages fog30 and fogpsu1 have been compared with the equivalent regions of oenophages fog44 and phi 10mc. in all cases, an almost identical endolysin gene was followed by one of two orfs, encoding putative holins (orf117 and orf163). the fog44 endolysin was established as a secretory protein when expressed in lactococcus lactis. orf117 (from fog44)  promoted lysis of escherichia coli cultures upon induction of a defective lambda  sam7 prophage, but orf163 (from fog30) failed to elicit a lysis response in this  system. fog44 and fogpsu1 were shown to integrate at the 3' end of a trna(glu) and a trna(lys), respectively. searching the available sequence of the o. oeni mcw genome for attp-like elements, two other trna targets could be proposed for prophage establishment. between the lysis and integration elements, a diverse cluster of genes (absent in phi 10mc) was observed. one common gene in this "lysogenic conversion cluster" was experimentally confirmed as a transcriptional  repressor, affecting the expression of a putative permease gene.

TI  == a bacterial gene homologous to abc transporters protect oenococcus oeni from ethanol and other stress factors in wine.
AB  == the wine lactic acid bacteria oenococcus oeni has to cope with harsh environmental conditions including an acidic ph, a high alcoholic content, non-optimal growth temperatures, and growth inhibitory compounds such as fatty acids, phenolic acids and tannins. we here describe characterisation and cloning  of the o. oeni omra gene encoding a protein belonging to the atp-binding cassette superfamily of transporters. the omra protein displays the highest sequence similarity with the subfamily of atp-dependent multidrug resistance (mdr) proteins, most notably the bacterial lactococcus lactis lmra homologue of the human mdr1 p-glycoprotein. the omra gene proved to be a stress-responsive gene since its expression was increased at high temperature or under osmotic shock. the omra protein function was tested in escherichia coli, and consistent with the omra gene expression pattern, omra conferred protection to bacteria grown on a high salt medium. omra also triggered bacterial resistance to sodium laurate, wine and ethanol toxicity. the homologous lmra protein featured the same stress-protective pattern than omra when expressed in e. coli, and the contribution to resistance of both omra and lmra transporters was decreased by verapamil, a well-known inhibitor of the human mdr1 protein. genes homologous to  omra were detected in other wine lactic acid bacteria, suggesting that this type  of genes might constitute a well-conserved stress-protective molecular device.

AB  == the putative cell-lysis gene lys of lactobacillus plantarum g1e phage phig1e encodes for a 442 amino-acids protein lys. the n-terminal region (about 80 amino  acids) of lys consists of two discrete regions (the signal-peptide-like domain and the de domain containing putative active sites of endolysin). to elucidate functions of the regions of lys, mutational (random, site-directed, and/or fusion) analysis was performed. the plasmid pndehl, expressing the wild type lys  protein under promoter of lacz' gene in escherichia coli, was constructed. two molecular species (44 kda; referred to as pre-lys, and 42 kda; mature-lys) from the protein extract of xl1-blue/pndehl were detected on a sodium dodecyl sulfate  gel and zymogram with l. plantarum g1e cells. based on the n-terminal amino acid  sequences, the two molecules were determined as; pre-lys (the amino acid position deduced from lys gene, 1-7) mklknkl, mature-lys (27-33) qtlssqs. the mature lys was hardly detected in the cells treated with sodium azide. these results suggested that the n-terminal 26 amino acids region of lys precursor form is possibly processed posttranslationally, by a seca-dependent manner at least in e. coli. analysis of the point mutants (pld36a, ple39a, ple55a, ple67a and pld71a),  indicated that the acidic residues (aspartic acids at position 36, 71 and glutamic acids at position 39, 55) of n-terminal region and the serine at the position 48 of phig1e lys are essential for the lytic activity.

TI  == biochemical and physiological studies of the small heat shock protein lo18 from the lactic acid bacterium oenococcus oeni.
AB  == the small heat shock protein (smhsp) family has been extensively studied in eukaryotic cells. smhsp assemble into large multimeric structures and possess chaperone activity that can prevent protein aggregation in vitro. few studies on  prokaryotic smhsp are actually available and no smhsp from lactic acid bacteria has been characterized at a biochemical level to date. here we report on the lo18 membrane-associated smhsp from the lactic acid bacterium oenococcus oeni. using size exclusion chromatography, nondenaturing pore-exclusion page and in vitro and in vivo cross-linking experiments, the multimeric structure of lol8 from o. oeni  or expressed in escherichia coli was investigated. in vitro, lo18 is able to form a trimer and a higher oligomer which could be a dodecamer. experiments strongly suggest that the same structures exist in vivo. first, lo18 prevented thermal aggregation of citrate synthase and lactate dehydrogenase even at 60degreesc. these findings showed that the prokaryotic smhsp lo18 can function as a molecular chaperone in vitro. second, lo18 did not protect lactate dehydrogenase from thermal inactivation and did not assist in enzymatic activity restoration after thermal aggregation, suggesting that other components may be needed for the refolding of the enzyme in an active conformation. third, we showed that membrane association of lo18 depends on the temperature upshift. moreover, expression of this smhsp was induced by administration of a membrane fluidiser, the benzyl alcohol, suggesting that lo18 expression could be regulated by the level of membrane fluidity.

TI  == improved acid tolerance of a recombinant strain of escherichia coli expressing genes from the acidophilic bacterium oenococcus oeni.
AB  == aims: oenococcus oeni is a lactic acid bacterium used in wine fermentation. two open reading frames (orfb and orfc) were identified in the upstream region of the hsp18 gene, encoding the small heat-shock protein lo18. expression of these genes in conditions of acid stress was studied in escherichia coli. methods and results: sequence analysis showed that orfb encodes a putative transcriptional regulator of the lysr family. the protein encoded by orfc shares homologies with  multi-drug resistance systems. heterologous expression of orfb, orfc and hsp18 genes in escherichia coli significantly enhanced the viability of the host strain under acidic conditions. conclusion: it was demonstrated that the three genes were needed for acquisition of this acid tolerance phenotype. significance and impact of the study: heterologous expression of oenococcus genes could be used to confer acidophilic behaviour on strains of biotechnological interest.

TI  == the n-terminal region of the oenococcus oeni bacteriophage fog44 lysin behaves as a bona fide signal peptide in escherichia coli and as a cis-inhibitory element, preventing lytic activity on oenococcal cells.
AB  == the function of the n-terminal region of the oenococcus oeni phage fog44 lysin (lys44) as an export signal was investigated. we observed that when induced in escherichia coli, lys44 was cleaved between residues 27 and 28 in a seca-dependent manner. lys44 processing could be blocked by a specific signal peptidase inhibitor and was severely reduced by modification of the cleavage site. the lethal effect of lys44 expression observed in e. coli was ascribed to the presence of its n-terminal 27-residue sequence, as its deletion resulted in the production of a nontoxic, albeit active, product. we have further established that lytic activity in oenococcal cells was dependent on lys44 processing. an active protein with the molecular mass expected for the cleaved enzyme was detected in extracts from o. oeni-infected cells. the temporal pattern of its appearance suggests that synthesis and export of lys44 in the infected host progress along with phage maturation. overall, these results provide, for the first time, experimental evidence for the presence of a signal peptide in a bacteriophage lysin. database searches and alignment of protein sequences support the prediction that other known o. oeni and lactococcus lactis phages also encode secretory lysins. the evolutionary significance of a putative phage lysis mechanism relying on secretory lytic enzymes is tentatively discussed, on the basis of host cell wall structure and autolytic capacity.

TI  == comparison of partial malolactic enzyme gene sequences for phylogenetic analysis  of some lactic acid bacteria species and relationships with the malic enzyme.
AB  == dna sequences covering 36% of the mle gene that encodes the malolactic enzyme were determined for 13 strains of lactic acid bacteria, representing pediococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus and oenococcus genera. the sequences were aligned with the corresponding region of mles in lactococcus lactis. the phylogenetic distance matrix tree of all mle sequences was compared with the 16s rrna phylogenetic tree. the analysis showed that the mle fragment evolved more rapidly than the 16s gene and differently. pediococcus and lactobacillus species were intermixed in the 16s rrna tree whereas they were separated in the mle tree. leuconostoc mesenteroides and oenococcus oeni were distinct from other species in the 16s rrna tree, whereas they were intermixed with lactobacillus species and lactococcus lactis in the mle tree. the amino acid sequences deduced from partial mle genes were aligned with 22 malic enzyme sequences and the corresponding phylogenetic tree was constructed. malic and malolactic enzymes were distinct at  the phylogenetic level, except for malic enzymes of yeast and escherichia coli which were nearer the malolactic enzymes than the other malic enzymes. the analysis of conserved sites showed several interesting amino acids specific to either malic enzyme or malolactic enzyme.

TI  == the oenococcus oeni clpx homologue is a heat shock gene preferentially expressed  in exponential growth phase.
AB  == using degenerated primers from conserved regions of previously studied clpx gene  products, we cloned the clpx gene of the malolactic bacterium oenococcus oeni. the clpx gene was sequenced, and the deduced protein of 413 amino acids (predicted molecular mass of 45,650 da) was highly similar to previously analyzed clpx gene products from other organisms. an open reading frame located upstream of the clpx gene was identified as the tig gene by similarity of its predicted product to other bacterial trigger factors. clpx was purified by using a maltose  binding protein fusion system and was shown to possess an atpase activity. northern analyses indicated the presence of two independent 1.6-kb monocistronic  clpx and tig mrnas and also showed an increase in clpx mrna amount after a temperature shift from 30 to 42 degrees c. the clpx transcript is abundant in the early exponential growth phase and progressively declines to undetectable levels  in the stationary phase. thus, unlike hsp18, the gene encoding one of the major small heat shock proteins of oenococcus oeni, clpx expression is related to the exponential growth phase and requires de novo protein synthesis. primer extension analysis identified the 5' end of clpx mrna which is located 408 nucleotides upstream of a putative aua start codon. the putative transcription start site allowed identification of a predicted promoter sequence with a high similarity to the consensus sequence found in the housekeeping gene promoter of gram-positive bacteria as well as escherichia coli.

TI  == expression of the oenococcus oeni trxa gene is induced by hydrogen peroxide and heat shock.
AB  == sequencing of the dna region located upstream of the alpha-acetolactate synthase  and decarboxylase (alss-alsd) cluster of oenococcus oeni allowed identification of an orf, named trxa. this encodes a protein of 104 amino acids very similar to  known thioredoxins. the protein encoded by the cloned fragment was able to complement escherichia coli strains lacking a functional thioredoxin. considering the results of protein sequence comparisons and complementation experiments, it was concluded that the trxa gene encodes a functional thioredoxin. studies of trxa expression showed that the abundance of trxa mrna was similar during all growth stages. a significant increase in trxa mrna levels was observed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide in the medium or after heat shock. a single transcriptional start site was determined with total rna isolated from cells subjected or not subjected to oxidative stress or heat shock. in each case the same promoter region was identified and shown to have a high similarity to the consensus promoter sequence of gram-positive bacteria, as well as to that of e. coli and the previously mapped promoters from o. oeni.

TI  == molecular analysis of the region encoding the lytic system from oenococcus oeni temperate bacteriophage phi 10mc.
AB  == malolactic fermentation by oenococcus oeni is a crucial step in wine-making. oe.  oeni phages are thought to be responsible for fermentation failures, yet they have received little attention. after a molecular analysis concerning the phage phi 10mc integration system, this paper focuses on the lytic system. the attp (phage attachment site)-flanking region has been cloned and sequenced. the 1296-bp lysin gene (lys) was identified in this region. the deduced amino acid sequence showed classical structural features of phage lysins, and this gene product expressed in escherichia coli had a lytic activity against oe. oeni. downstream of lys, a second orf was present (p163). according to its amino acid sequence and the location of its gene, the product could be the phi 10mc holin. this study shows that the genomic organization of phage phi 10mc attp-flanking regions is very similar to that of other lactic acid bacteriophages.

TI  == identification and sequence analysis of the region encoding the site-specific integration system from leuconostoc oenos (oenococcus oeni) temperate bacteriophage phi 10mc.
AB  == malolactic fermentation conducted by leuconostoc oenos is an essential step in winemaking. l. oenos bacteriophages are thought to be responsible for fermentation failures, yet they have received little attention. the integration system of bacteriophage phi 10mc in the lof111 l. oenos strain chromosome was studied and a 1,456 bp phage dna fragment was cloned and sequenced. an open reading frame (int) showing homology with several temperate bacteriophage integrases was located upstream of the phage attachment site (attp). this organisation is comparable to other phage site-specific recombination systems. the same bacterial attachment site (attb) located in at trna(leu) gene was found  in all 15 l. oenos strains studied and was involved in phi 10mc integration in the bacterial chromosome.

TI  == sequence analysis of leuconostoc oenos dna: organization of plo13, a cryptic plasmid.
AB  == a leuconostoc oenos plasmid, plo13, was studied to analyze its genetic organization and to define its functions. the nucleotide sequence (3948 bp) revealed three major open reading frames. features commonly found in plasmids that replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism were identified within plo13: first, a sequence coding for a protein with an amino acid sequence homologous to  the plasmid recombination enzymes (pre), but for which a specific target site similar to those previously described was not found; second, a sequence probably  encoding a replication protein (rep). the putative plo13 rep protein amino acid sequence is divergent from the pc194-pub110 family rep proteins. however, the consensus sequence of the rep protein active site was found, as well as the rep protein consensus target site. no sequence similar to the previously described minus-origins (ssos) are present in plo13; nevertheless, a 200-bp sequence rich in imperfect palindromes may be involved in the minus-strand replication. these overall differences are in agreement with the previously reported important phylogenetic distance existing between ln. oenos and other lactic acid bacteria.
