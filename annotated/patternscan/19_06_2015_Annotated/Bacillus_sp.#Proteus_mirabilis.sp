TI  == aerobic microbial community of insectary population of phlebotomus papatasi.
AB  == background: microbes particularly bacteria presenting in the gut of haematophagous insects may have an important role in the epidemiology of human infectious disease. methods: the microbial flora of gut and surrounding environmental of a laboratory strain of phlebotomus papatasi, the main vector of  zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) in the old world, was investigated. biochemical reactions and 16s rdna sequencing of the isolated bacteria against 24 sugars and amino acids were used for bacteria species identification. common mycological media used for fungi identification as well. results: most isolates belonged to the enterobacteriaceae, a large, heterogeneous group of gram-negative rods whose natural habitat is the intestinal tract of humans and animals. enterobacteriaceae groups included edwardsiella, enterobacter, escherichia, klebsiella, kluyvera, leminorella, pantoea, proteus, providencia, rahnella, serratia, shigella, tatumella, and yersinia and non enterobacteriaceae groups included bacillus, staphylococcus and pseudomonas. the most prevalent isolates were proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris. these saprophytic and swarming motile bacteria were isolated from all immature, pupae, and mature fed or unfed male or  female sand flies as well as from larval and adult food sources. five fungi species were also isolated from sand flies, their food sources and colonization materials where candida sp. was common in all mentioned sources. conclusion: midgut microbiota are increasingly seen as an important factor for modulating vector competence in insect vectors so their possible effects of the mirobiota on the biology of p. papatasi and their roles in the sandfly-leishmania interaction  are discussed.

TI  == anti-biofilm activity of biogenic selenium nanoparticles and selenium dioxide against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-biofilm activity of biologically synthesized selenium nanoparticles (se nps) against the biofilm produced by clinically isolated bacterial strains compared to that of selenium dioxide. thirty strains of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis were isolated from various specimens of the patients hospitalized in different hospitals (kerman, iran). quantification of the biofilm using microtiter plate assay method introduced 30% of s. aureus, 13% of p. aeruginosa and 17% of p. mirabilis isolates as severely adherent strains. transmission electron micrograph (tem) of the purified se nps (produced by bacillus sp. msh-1) showed individual and spherical nano-structure in the size range of 80-220nm. obtained results of the biofilm formation revealed that selenium nanoparticles inhibited the biofilm of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, and p.  mirabilis by 42%, 34.3%, and 53.4%, respectively, compared to that of the non-treated samples. effect of temperature and ph on the biofilm formation in the presence of se nps and seo2 was also evaluated.

TI  == detection of persistent organic compounds from biomethanated distillery spent wash (bmds) and their degradation by manganese peroxidase and laccase producing bacterial strains.
AB  == biomethanated distillery spent wash (bmds) retains dark black colour with complex persistent organic pollutants even after anaerobic treatment. the specific ratio  (4:3:1:1) of proteus mirabilis (fj581028), bacillus sp. (fj581030), raoultella planticola (gu329705) and enterobacter sakazakii (fj581031) decolourised bmds up  to 76% within 192 hr along with degradation of persistent organic compounds in presence of glucose (1%) and peptone (0.1%). the colour removal ability was noted due to ligninolytic enzyme activity. where the maximum manganese peroxidase was 1.93 u ml(-1) and laccase activity equalled 0.84 u ml(-1). the gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (gc-ms) analysis confirmed the direct correlation between colourant and persistent organic pollutants due to simultaneous reduction of colour and pollutants present in bmds. the seed germination test showed reduction of 75% toxicity after bacterial treatment process.

TI  == cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe): a new antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant cyclic dipeptide from bacillus sp. n strain associated with a rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode.
AB  == a new microbial cyclic dipeptide (diketopiperazine), cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) was isolated for the first time from the ethyl acetate extract of fermented modified  nutrient broth of bacillus sp. n strain associated with rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode. antibacterial activity of the compound was determined  by minimum inhibitory concentration and agar disc diffusion method against medically important bacteria and the compound recorded significant antibacterial  against test bacteria. highest activity was recorded against staphylococcus epidermis (1 microg/ml) followed by proteus mirabilis (2 microg/ml). the activity of cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) against s. epidermis is better than chloramphenicol, the standard antibiotics. cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) recorded significant antitumor activity  against a549 cells (ic50 value: 10 mum) and this compound recorded no cytotoxicity against factor signaling normal fibroblast cells up to 100 mum. cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) induced significant morphological changes and dna fragmentation associated with apoptosis in a549 cells. acridine orange/ethidium bromide stained cells indicated apoptosis induction by cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe). flow cytometry analysis showed that the cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) did not induce cell cycle arrest. effector molecule of apoptosis such as caspase-3 was found activated in treated cells, suggesting apoptosis as the main mode of cell death. antioxidant activity was evaluated by free radical scavenging and reducing power activity, and the compound recorded significant antioxidant activity. the free radical scavenging activity of cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) is almost equal to that of butylated hydroxyanisole, the standard antioxidant agent. we also compared the biological activity of natural cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) with synthetic cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) and cyclo(l-tyr-l-phe). natural and synthetic cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) recorded similar pattern of activity. although synthetic cyclo(l-tyr-l-phe) recorded lower activity. but in the case of reducing power activity, synthetic cyclo(l-tyr-l-phe) recorded significant activity than natural and synthetic cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe). the results of the present study reveals that cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) is more bioactive than cyclo(l-tyr-l-phe). to the best of our  knowledge, this is the first time that cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) has been isolated from  microbial natural source and also the antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant  activity of cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) is also reported for the first time.

TI  == biodegradation of organic compounds of molasses melanoidin (mm) from biomethanated distillery spent wash (bmds) during the decolourisation by a potential bacterial consortium.
AB  == molasses melanoidin (mm) is a major pollutant in biomethanated distillery spent wash (bmds) due to its recalcitrant properties. the 75% colour and 71% cod of mm  (1,000 ppm) were reduced with developed bacterial consortium comprising proteus mirabilis (iitrm5; fj581028), bacillus sp. (iitrm7; fj581030), raoultella planticola (iitrm15; gu329705) and enterobacter sakazakii (iitrm16, fj581031) in  the ratio of 4:3:2:1 within 10 days at optimized nutrient. bacterial consortium showed manganese peroxidase and laccase activity during mm decolourisation. the dominant growth of r. planticola and e. sakazakii was noted in consortium during  mm decolourisation. the comparative gc-ms analysis of extracted compounds of control and degraded samples showed that most of the compounds present in control were completely utilized by bacterial consortium along with production of some metabolites. the developed bacterial consortium could be a tool for the decolourisation and degradation of melanoidin containing bmds.

TI  == molecular biology of microbial ureases.
AB  == urease (urea amidohydrolase; ec 3.5.1.5) catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia and carbamate. the latter compound spontaneously decomposes to yield another molecule of ammonia and carbonic acid. the urease phenotype is widely distributed across the bacterial kingdom, and the gene clusters encoding this enzyme have been cloned from numerous bacterial species. the complete nucleotide sequence, ranging from 5.15 to 6.45 kb, has been determined for five species including bacillus sp. strain tb-90, klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, helicobacter pylori, and yersinia enterocolitica. sequences for selected genes have been determined for at least 10 other bacterial species and the jack bean enzyme. urease synthesis can be nitrogen regulated, urea inducible, or constitutive. the crystal structure of the k. aerogenes enzyme has been determined. when combined with chemical modification studies, biophysical and spectroscopic analyses, site-directed mutagenesis results, and kinetic inhibition experiments, the structure provides important insight into the mechanism of catalysis. synthesis of active enzyme requires incorporation of both carbon dioxide and nickel ions into the protein. accessory genes have been shown to be required for activation of urease apoprotein, and roles for the accessory proteins in metallocenter assembly have been proposed. urease is central to the virulence of p. mirabilis and h. pylori. urea hydrolysis by p. mirabilis in the urinary tract leads directly to urolithiasis (stone formation) and contributes to the development of acute pyelonephritis. the urease of h. pylori is necessary for colonization of the gastric mucosa in experimental animal models of gastritis and serves as the major antigen and diagnostic marker for gastritis and peptic ulcer  disease in humans. in addition, the urease of y. enterocolitica has been implicated as an arthritogenic factor in the development of infection-induced reactive arthritis. the significant progress in our understanding of the molecular biology of microbial ureases is reviewed.

TI  == [aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  == on the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in april 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. they were: bordetella bronchiseptica, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus sp., branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus sp., enterobacter agglomerans, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas diminuta, alcaligenes faecalis and escherichia coli. however, young weaned rabbits were more often pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. the usefulness of performing only pasteurella and bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. it is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.

AB  == normal values for intestinal flora were determined on four adult, two juvenile, and four infant agoutis (dasyprocta sp) maintained at our institution. serologic, hematologic, biochemical, and histologic observations were also made on these same agoutis, and serologic, microbiologic, and endoparasitic tests were made on  serum and fecal samples from agoutis maintained at other institutions. streptococci, lactobacilli and nonenteropathogenic escherichia coli were isolated from cecal contents of all age groups. gaffkya tetragena and bacillus sp were recovered from infant agoutis, proteus mirabilis from juvenile agoutis, and proteus mirabilis and micrococcus sp from adult agoutis. infant agoutis showed marginal antibody titers to reovirus type 3 and toolan's h-1 viruses, and theiler's gdvii antibodies were detected in juvenile agoutis, but no antibody titers to murine viruses were found in the adult agoutis maintained at our institution. hematologic, biochemical, and histologic data for these agoutis were comparable to those of other hystricomorph rodents. serologic tests of the agoutis maintained at other institutions disclosed antibodies for gdvii virus in  all of 17 animals tested, while marginal titers were found for sendai virus in four and for reovirus type 3 in eight of the 17 animals. only low incidences of pathogenic bacteria (salmonella, pseudomonas, and citrobacter) were isolated from the agoutis maintained elsewhere. the endoparasites found in these agoutis were ascaris, toxascaris, strongyloides, trichuris, and trichomonas.
