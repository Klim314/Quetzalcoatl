TI  == comparative in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against 1,001 anaerobes isolated from human intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == by using an agar dilution method, the comparative in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) were studied against 1,001 anaerobes isolated from human intra-abdominal infections in 17 countries worldwide. mk-0826 was uniformly active against all isolates, including all bacteroides fragilis group species isolates, with the exception of 12 of 61 (20%) strains of bilophila wadsworthia,  3 strains of lactobacilli, and 1 isolate of acidaminococcus fermentans. geographical variation in activity was not observed.
