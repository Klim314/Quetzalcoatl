TI  == streptolysin s-like virulence factors: the continuing saga.
AB  == streptolysin s (sls) is a potent cytolytic toxin and virulence factor that is produced by nearly all streptococcus pyogenes strains. despite a 100-year history of research on this toxin, it has only recently been established that sls is just one of an extended family of post-translationally modified virulence factors (the sls-like peptides) that are produced by some streptococci and other gram-positive pathogens, such as listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum. in this review, we describe the identification, genetics, biochemistry and various functions of sls. we also discuss the shared features of the virulence-associated sls-like peptides, as well as their place within the rapidly expanding family of  thiazole/oxazole-modified microcins (tomms).

TI  == clostridiolysin s, a post-translationally modified biotoxin from clostridium botulinum.
AB  == through elaboration of its botulinum toxins, clostridium botulinum produces clinical syndromes of infant botulism, wound botulism, and other invasive infections. using comparative genomic analysis, an orphan nine-gene cluster was identified in c. botulinum and the related foodborne pathogen clostridium sporogenes that resembled the biosynthetic machinery for streptolysin s, a key virulence factor from group a streptococcus responsible for its hallmark beta-hemolytic phenotype. genetic complementation, in vitro reconstitution, mass  spectral analysis, and plasmid intergrational mutagenesis demonstrate that the streptolysin s-like gene cluster from clostridium sp. is responsible for the biogenesis of a novel post-translationally modified hemolytic toxin, clostridiolysin s.

TI  == identification of spya, a novel adp-ribosyltransferase of streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes, the aetiological agent of both respiratory and skin infections, produces numerous exotoxins to establish infection. this report identifies a new exotoxin produced by this organism, termed spya, for s. pyogenesadp-ribosylating toxin. spya, mw 24.9, has amino acid identity with the adp-riboslytransferases (adprts) staphylococcus aureus edin and clostridium botulinum c3. recombinant spya was able to hydrolyse beta-nad(+), and this activity was dependent on a glutamate at position 187. spya has a putative biglutamate active site, and similar to most biglutamate adprts, was able to adp-ribosylate poly-l-arginine. spya modified numerous proteins in both cho and hela cell lysates. two-dimesional gel analysis and maldi-tof ms analysis of modified proteins indicated that vimentin, tropomyosin and actin, all cytoskeletal proteins, are targets. expression of spya in hela cells resulted in  loss of actin microfilaments. we hypothesize that spya is produced by s. pyogenes to disrupt cytoskeletal structures and promote colonization of the host.

TI  == phages and the evolution of bacterial pathogens: from genomic rearrangements to lysogenic conversion.
AB  == comparative genomics demonstrated that the chromosomes from bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages) are coevolving. this process is most evident for bacterial pathogens where the majority contain prophages or phage remnants integrated into the bacterial dna. many prophages from bacterial pathogens encode virulence factors. two situations can be distinguished: vibrio cholerae, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, corynebacterium diphtheriae, and clostridium botulinum depend on a specific prophage-encoded toxin for causing a specific disease, whereas staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium harbor a multitude of prophages and each phage-encoded virulence or fitness factor makes an incremental contribution to the fitness of the lysogen. these prophages behave like "swarms" of related prophages. prophage diversification seems to be fueled by the frequent transfer of phage material by recombination with superinfecting phages, resident prophages, or occasional acquisition of other mobile dna elements or bacterial chromosomal genes. prophages also contribute to the diversification of the bacterial genome architecture. in many cases, they actually represent a large fraction of the strain-specific dna sequences. in addition, they can serve as anchoring points for genome inversions. the current review presents the available genomics and biological data on prophages from bacterial pathogens in an evolutionary framework.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
