TI  == influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  == the results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. to be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (da) and molecular weights (mw) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. they were tested at different ph values for their antimicrobial activities against four gram-negative bacteria  (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhi), four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (aspergillus niger, fusarium oxysporum and alternaria solani). chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (da and mw) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower da and the lower ph give the larger efficiency. antibacterial activity was further enhanced for gram-negative bacteria with decreasing mw, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the gram-positive. concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. fungal growth decreased with increasing mw for f. oxysporum and decreasing da for a. solani, but no mw or da dependences were observed with a. niger.

TI  == studies on interaction of colloidal silver nanoparticles (snps) with five different bacterial species.
AB  == silver nanoparticles (snps) are being increasingly used in many consumer products like textile fabrics, cosmetics, washing machines, food and drug products owing to its excellent antimicrobial properties. here we have studied the adsorption and toxicity of snps on bacterial species such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus barbaricus and klebsiella pneumoniae. the influence of zeta potential on the adsorption of snps on bacterial cell surface was investigated at acidic, neutral and alkaline ph and with varying salt (nacl) concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 1.5 m). the survival rate of bacterial species decreased with increase in adsorption of snps. maximum adsorption and toxicity was observed at ph 5, and nacl concentration of <0.5 m. a very less adsorption was observed at ph 9 and nacl concentration >0.5 m, there by resulting in less toxicity. the zeta potential study suggests that, the adsorption of snps on the cell surface was related to electrostatic force of  attraction. the equilibrium and kinetics of the adsorption process were also studied. the adsorption equilibrium isotherms fitted well to the langmuir model.  the kinetics of adsorption fitted best to pseudo-first-order. these findings form a basis for interpreting the interaction of nanoparticles with environmental bacterial species.

TI  == involvement of apolipophorin iii in antibacterial defense of galleria mellonella  larvae.
AB  == apolipophorin iii (apolp-iii) is an abundant hemolymph protein involved in lipid  transport and immune response in insects. we investigated involvement of apolp-iii in the antibacterial response in galleria mellonella larvae. immune challenge with gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae) and gram-positive (micrococcus luteus) bacteria led to an increase in the level of apolp-iii in g. mellonella hemolymph, 0.5-2h and 8h after treatment, respectively. apolp-iii purified from larval hemolymph as well as that present in hemolymph extracts adsorbed on the surface of different bacteria. the adsorption  capacity of apolp-iii on bacterial cells prompted us to investigate the effect of this phenomenon on bacterial growth. our results demonstrate antibacterial activity of apolp-iii against selected gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in vitro. among bacteria tested, salmonella typhimurium and k. pneumoniae were the most sensitive to apolp-iii. live/dead staining of bacteria incubated with purified apolp-iii revealed their growth inhibition; however, neither morphological changes in the cell shape nor formation of cell aggregates was noticed. the results suggest that apolp-iii is a multifunctional protein in g. mellonella hemolymph.

TI  == a new laboratory cultivation of paramecium bursaria using non-pathogenic bacteria strains.
AB  == in most studies dealing with the laboratory cultivation of paramecia (paramecium  bursaria), klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria are used to inoculate the medium. however, klebsiella pneumoniae is a typical pathogen, and its use is always associated with a risk of infection. the aim of the present research was to examine non-pathogenic bacteria strains as components of the medium for paramecium bursaria. the paramecia were incubated on lettuce infusions bacterized with different bacteria strains: bacillus subtilis dsm 10, bacillus megaterium dsm 32, escherichia coli dsm 498, micrococcus luteus dsm 348. a strain derived from the natural habitat of paramecium bursaria was used as the control one. experiments were conducted under constant light and in the dark. paramecia cells  were counted under a stereomicroscope on consecutive days of incubation. the obtained results show that the most intensive growth of paramecium bursaria occurs in the presence of escherichia coli dsm 498. the use of this strain as a component of the medium allows one to obtain a high number of ciliates regardless of the light conditions. it can be concluded that the paramecium bursaria cultivation procedure can be modified by using the non-pathogenic bacteria strain escherichia coli dsm 498 instead of klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == prostaglandin e2 modulates the expression of antimicrobial peptides in the fat body and midgut of anopheles albimanus.
AB  == prostaglandins (pgs) participate in the regulation of vertebrate and in at least  six insect orders' immune responses. we identified pge2 in midgut, fat body, malpighian tubules, and ovarioles of anopheles albimanus (aa) mosquitoes. our data indicate that pge2 synthesis in cultured midguts responds to the presence of two bacterial species, micrococcus luteus and klebsiella pneumoniae. the production of mrna coding for antimicrobial peptides aa-attacin, aa-cecropin, and aa-gambicin was observed in cultured fat bodies and midguts. the production of these messengers was reduced in the presence of dexamethasone, and this effect was reversed by arachidonic acid. adding pge2 to cultures resulted in increased aa-cecropin mrna and decreased aa-attacin and aa-gambicin mrnas.

TI  == broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
AB  == although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates  produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. after being treated with manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of pichia pastoris was slightly affected. microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and  loss of cell mobility. viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial  colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed e. coli and b. subtilis cells. under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the gram-positive bacteria  (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) were killed. in the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (dhi) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than l-dopa, n-acetyldopamine  (nada) or n-beta-alanyldopamine (nbad) did, suggesting that dhi and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. the antifungal activity of dhi was detected using p. pastoris, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, and beauveria bassiana. these results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (dce)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of long-chain, water-soluble, dendritic tricarboxylato amphiphiles.
AB  == objectives: to measure the antimicrobial activities of three series of homologous, dendritic tricarboxylato (three-headed) amphiphiles against a battery of bacteria and fungi. methods: three series of homologous dendritic amphiphiles  were synthesized containing c13 to c22 fatty chains. susceptibility of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus plantarum, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), mycobacterium smegmatis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans and aspergillus niger to the amphiphiles was measured by broth microdilution and reported as the mic. results: several amphiphiles from each homologous series, designed and constructed to overcome the low solubility of saturated long-chain fatty acids, had antimicrobial activity against mrsa (mic =  36 mg/l), c. albicans (mic = 4.4 mg/l), s. cerevisiae (mic = 1.1 mg/l) and m. smegmatis (mic = 8.9 mg/l). these amphiphiles had considerably better antimicrobial activities than the corresponding saturated fatty acids. alkyl chain length influenced the values of mic; longer chains (c18-c22) were generally more antimicrobial, but there was no uniform pattern among the microorganisms tested. conclusions: as the antimicrobial activity of the amphiphiles increased with increasing chain length, it is anticipated that maximum activity was not reached with these series. thus, the identification of the optimal chain length would provide a target compound for development of low-cost, topical microbicides and anti-infectives. further, these series of dendritic amphiphiles with the very long chains can be used as new water-soluble probes for elucidation of membrane structure and for identification of novel targets for antimicrobial design.

TI  == screening chemical composition and in vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the essential oils from origanum syriacum l. growing in turkey.
AB  == in the present study, essential oil from the leaves of syrian oreganum [origanum  syriacum l. (lauraceae)] grown in turkish state forests of the dortyol district,  turkey, was obtained by steam distillation. the chemical composition of oil was analysed by gc and gc-ms, and was found to contain 49.02% monoterpenes, 36.60% oxygenated monoterpenes and 12.59% sesquiterpenes. the major components are as follows: gamma-terpinene, carvacrol, p-cymene and beta-caryophyllene. subsequently, the reducing power, antioxidant and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radical-scavenging activities of the essential oil were studied. the reducing power was compared with ascorbic acid, and the other activities were compared with 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl phenol (bht, butylated hydroxytoluene).  the results showed that the activities were concentration dependent. the antioxidant activities of the oil were slightly lower than those of ascorbic acid or bht, so the oil can be considered an effective natural antioxidant. antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from the leaves of origanum syriacum was also determined on 16 microorganisms tested using the agar-disc diffusion method, and showed antimicrobial activity against 13 of these.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of 9-o-acyl- and 9-o-benzoyl-substituted berberrubines.
AB  == in the course of a structure-activity relationship study on berberrubine derivatives, a series of compounds bearing 9-o-acyl-(4-6) and 9-o-benzoyl- (7) substituents was synthesized with the expectation of increasing the antimicrobial activity. one of the berberrubine derivatives, 9-lauroylberberrubine chloride was the most active against gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis as well as the gram-negative bacterium klebsiella pneumoniae in comparison to berberine, the currently used antibiotic in clinic. this result suggested that the presence of lipophilic substituents of certain structures and  sizes might be crucial for the optimal antimicrobial activity.

TI  == susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa to a photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  == the photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd-arg(2)) on the growth of selected pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates is described as compared to the effect of hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd). growth inhibition  of hpd-arg(2) of three gram-positive strains (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus) and five laboratory strains of gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) was observed as well. serratia marcescens strain was resistant to light-activated hpd-arg(2) or hpd. the antimicrobial activity of light-activated hpd-arg(2) against p. aeruginosa may offer an additional option in the anti-pseudomonal therapy of wounds.

TI  == periodic acid-schiff-positive organisms in primary cutaneous bacillus cereus infection. case report and an investigation of the periodic acid-schiff staining  properties of bacteria.
AB  == primary cutaneous bacillus cereus infection frequently presents as a single necrotic bulla on the extremity of an immunocompromised patient. in lesional biopsy specimens and smears, the large gram-positive rods of b cereus may be mistaken for clostridium species. this is a potentially serious error, as bacillus species are resistant to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. we studied a case in which large periodic acid-schiff-staining organisms were seen in the biopsy specimen from a necrotic bulla on the finger of a neutropenic  patient with diffuse large cell lymphoma. the tissue biopsy specimen subsequently yielded a pure culture of b cereus. staining with periodic acid-schiff was then performed on a series of bacterial species in human tissue and from smears of culture colonies. the following bacterial species were found to be consistently periodic acid-schiff positive after diastase digestion: b cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, propionibacterium acnes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and micrococcus luteus.

TI  == purification of equine neutrophil lysozyme and its antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == lysozyme from equine neutrophil granulocytes was isolated in a pure form by fast  performance liquid chromatography, i.e. ion-exchange chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography. the lysozyme lysed micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus lentus and was also bactericidal against the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, bordetella bronchiseptica, and serratia marcescens. staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were not lysed. the lysozyme was only very slightly bactericidal for  s. epidermidis and s. aureus. equine neutrophil lysozyme was found to be bactericidal for gram-positive as well as for gram-negative bacteria without further treatment. equine and chicken egg white lysozymes were found to be immunologically related when examined using specific antisera against each of them. both lysozymes also had very similar specific enzymatic activities against  m. luteus membranes.

TI  == extracellular product of nocardia amarae induces bacterial cell flocculation.
AB  == the fact that nocardia amarae yk1 produced a bacterial flocculation-inducing substance (designated as fix) was discovered. fix had a function of flocculating  proliferous cells. fix-induced flocculation was inhibited by making cells resting, but not completely by adding chloramphenicol. fix worked widely on gram-positive to -negative bacteria. in the presence of fix, achromobacter cycloclastus iam1013, acinetobacter calcoaceticus iam1517, bacillus subtilis iam1069, escherichia coli c600-1, e. coli iam1239, flavobacterium lutescens iam1667, klebsiella pneumoniae iam1102, micrococcus luteus iam1313 and pseudomonas putida iam1002 formed flocs. b. cereus iam1029, however, exhibited no flocculation.

TI  == analysis of cell division gene ftsz (sulb) from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the ftsz (sulb) gene of escherichia coli codes for a 40,000-dalton protein that carries out a key step in the cell division pathway. the presence of an ftsz gene protein in other bacterial species was examined by a combination of southern blot and western blot analyses. southern blot analysis of genomic restriction digests  revealed that many bacteria, including species from six members of the family enterobacteriaceae and from pseudomonas aeruginosa and agrobacterium tumefaciens, contained sequences which hybridized with an e. coli ftsz probe. genomic dna from more distantly related bacteria, including bacillus subtilis, branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus, did not hybridize under minimally stringent conditions. western blot analysis, with anti-e. coli ftsz antiserum, revealed that all bacterial species examined contained a major immunoreactive band. several of the enterobacteriaceae were transformed with a multicopy plasmid encoding the e. coli ftsz gene. these transformed strains, shigella sonnei, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter  aerogenes, were shown to overproduce the ftsz protein and to produce minicells. analysis of [35s]methionine-labeled minicells revealed that the plasmid-encoded gene products were the major labeled species. this demonstrated that the e. coli  ftsz gene could function in other bacterial species to induce minicells and that  these minicells could be used to analyze plasmid-endoced gene products.

TI  == [reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. the range of immunological specificity of escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
AB  == the antigenic specificity of e. coli m17 peptidoglycans (pg) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with pg opsonized with the whole and exhausted igg fraction of human serum. within the generic taxon, the pg under study were similar in their antigenic properties. the opsonic activity of igg exhausted with the preparations of different e. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. an essential difference of e. coli pg from similar components of other representatives of the family enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. after the removal of antibodies to pg of remote taxons (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus  luteus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable  (9.7-33.8%). the results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of pg at different taxonomic levels.

TI  == wheat germ agglutinin potentiates uptake of bacteria by murine peritoneal macrophages.
AB  == exposure of thioglycollate-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages to wheat germ agglutinin (wga) increased markedly the uptake of six different bacteria, which have surface receptors for the lectin. uptake of staphylococcus aureus h was higher by 3-5-fold, of s. aureus 52a2 by 1.8-fold, of s. aureus 52a5 by 1.7-fold, of s. albus by 2.3-fold, of shigella flexneri by 6-fold and of micrococcus luteus by 6.5-fold. klebsiella pneumoniae, devoid of receptors for wga, was not phagocytosed following pretreatment of macrophages with the lectin. pretreatment  of the bacteria with the lectin also resulted, in most cases, in an increase in phagocytosis. interaction of wga with the macrophages and with the bacteria, as well as the potentiation of phagocytosis, was abolished by tri-n-acetylchitotriose, a saccharide that binds specifically to wga, but not by  monosaccharides which do not interact with this lectin. with non-elicited macrophages, enhancement of phagocytosis by wga was less pronounced, probably because of the higher number of lectin-binding sites (5-fold) on the elicited cells. peanut agglutinin and soybean agglutinin, that bind to macrophages but not to the bacteria studied, lack the ability to potentiate phagocytosis. macrophage  surface sugars thus appear to play an important role in phagocytosis by serving as receptors for lectins that form bridges between the macrophages and the microorganisms.

TI  == lack of influence of commonly used drugs on bioassay indicator organisms.
AB  == many commonly used pharmaceutical agents have been found to inhibit bacterial growth in vitro. determinations of antimicrobial concentrations in sera of patients taking nonrecognized antibacterial agents could possibly be altered if bioassay systems are utilized for the determinations. we therefore attempted to determine the in vitro effect of commonly used drugs on bioassay indicator organisms. fifty-one different agents (antihistamines, anticholinergics, central  nervous system agents, cardiovascular agents, analgesics, steroids, muscle blockers, and other miscellaneous agents) were tested for inhibition or enhancement of the growth of bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, and klebsiella pneumoniae. none of the agents tested exhibited any effect on standard in vitro bioassay organisms. nortriptyline hydrochloride inhibited the growth of b. subtilis and m. luteus at a concentration of 500 micrograms/ml (zones of inhibition, 14 and 13 mm, respectively), but no inhibition was observed with concentrations of 50 micrograms/ml or lower.

TI  == [cefoperazone concentration in infected tissues and clinical effect for patients  with peritonitis (author's transl)].
AB  == a new antibiotic drug of cephalosporin, with marked resistance to beta-lactamase, cefoperazone (cpz) for parenteral use was used in 6 patients with acute peritonitis and perforated appendicitis. cpz in a dose of 1 g was given intravenously during the operation. tissue specimens of different sites were taken from removed organs. the materials of purulent ascites and appendix were subsequently taken at intervals. determination of cpz concentration was performed according to paper disk bioassay with micrococcus luteus atcc 9341 strain. cpz concentration in purulent ascites increased quickly after injection, and reached  high level peak at 30 minutes to 1 hour, then they were very slowly declined. cpz concentration in the infected appendix, was directly proportional to the degree of pathological changes of inflammation. cpz concentration in serious gangrenous  appendix reached to 50.3 mcg/g at 20 minutes after intravenous injection, and increased to 54.3 mcg/g at 30 minutes, 60.3 mcg/g at 38 minutes, respectively. on the cpz concentration in patients with appendicitis, the concentration in purulent ascites and appendix were observed higher than the mic of cpz for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae bacilli. cpz therefore will be a very  useful drug when used for chemotherapy of acute peritonitis.
