TI  == potential of novel dextran oligosaccharides as prebiotics for obesity management  through in vitro experimentation.
AB  == the energy-salvaging capacity of the gut microbiota from dietary ingredients has  been proposed as a contributing factor for the development of obesity. this knowledge generated interest in the use of non-digestible dietary ingredients such as prebiotics to manipulate host energy homeostasis. in the present study, the in vitro response of obese human faecal microbiota to novel oligosaccharides  was investigated. dextrans of various molecular weights and degrees of branching  were fermented with the faecal microbiota of healthy obese adults in ph-controlled batch cultures. changes in bacterial populations were monitored using fluorescent in situ hybridisation and scfa concentrations were analysed by  hplc. the rate of gas production and total volume of gas produced were also determined. in general, the novel dextrans and inulin increased the counts of bifidobacteria. some of the dextrans were able to alter the composition of the obese human microbiota by increasing the counts of bacteroides-prevotella and decreasing those of faecalibacterium prausnitzii and ruminococcus bromii/r. flavefaciens. considerable increases in scfa concentrations were observed in response to all substrates. gas production rates were similar during the fermentation of all dextrans, but significantly lower than those during the fermentation of inulin. lower total gas production and shorter time to attain maximal gas production were observed during the fermentation of the linear 1 kda  dextran than during the fermentation of the other dextrans. the efficacy of bifidobacteria to ferment dextrans relied on the molecular weight and not on the  degree of branching. in conclusion, there are no differences in the profiles between the obese and lean human faecal fermentations of dextrans.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.
