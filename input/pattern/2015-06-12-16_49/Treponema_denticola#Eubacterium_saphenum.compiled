TI  - Detection frequency of periodontitis-associated bacteria by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival and supragingival plaque of periodontitis and healthy subjects.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the detection frequencies of 25 bacterial species in subgingival and supragingival plaque of 18 untreated periodontitis subjects and 12 periodontally healthy subjects. Genomic DNA was extracted from subgingival and supragingival plaque samples, and bacterial detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction of the 16S rRNA genes. Fourteen bacteria showed no relationship with periodontitis, and 11 of these 14 species were frequently detected (> or =50%) in subgingival plaque in both periodontitis and healthy subjects. Nine bacteria such as Eubacterium saphenum, Prevotella intermedia, and Treponema denticola seemed to be related to periodontitis; their detection frequencies in subgingival plaque samples were higher in periodontitis than in healthy subjects, but these differences were not statistically significant by multiple comparisons (0.002< or =P<0.05). Two species (Mogibacterium timidum and Porphyromonas gingivalis) were detected significantly more frequently in subgingival plaque of periodontitis subjects than of healthy subjects (P<0.002), with P. gingivalis being detected only in periodontitis subjects, suggesting that these two species are closely related to periodontitis. There were no significant differences in the detection frequencies of the 25 bacteria between subgingival and supragingival plaque, suggesting that the bacterial flora of supragingival plaque reflects that of subgingival plaque.
