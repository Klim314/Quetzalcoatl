TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of three Brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. The extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. The propolis extracts inhibited the growth of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, Ruminococcus albus 7, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens D1, Prevotella albensis M384, Peptostreptococcus sp. D1, Clostridium aminophilum F and Streptococcus bovis Pearl11, while R. albus 20, Prevotella bryantii B(1)4 and Ruminobacter amylophilus H18 were resistant to all the extracts. The inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (C. aminophilum F and Peptostreptococcus sp. D1) being the most sensitive. Inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. The extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (LLOS C3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. The major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and Artepillin C) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains. Only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.
TI  - Effects of soybean small peptides on rumen fermentation and on intestinal and total tract digestion of luxi yellow cattle.
AB  - Four Luxi beef cattle (400+/-10 kg) fitted with ruminal, duodenal and ileal cannulas were used in a 4x4 Latin square to assess the effects of soybean small peptide (SSP) infusion on rumen fermentation, diet digestion and flow of nutrient in the gastrointestinal tract. The ruminal infusion of SSP was 0 (control), 100, 200 and 300 g/d. Ruminal SSP infusion linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased microbial protein synthesis and rumen ammonia-N concentration. Concentrations of total volatile fatty acid were linearly increased (p = 0.029) by infusion SSP. Rumen samples were obtained for analysis of microbial ecology by real-time PCR. Populations of rumen Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Streptococcus bovis, Ciliate protozoa, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Prevotella ruminicola were expressed as a proportion of total Rumen bacterial 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA). Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations which related to total bacterial 16S rDNA were increased (p<0.05), while Streptococcus bovis populations were linearly (p = 0.049) and quadratically (p = 0.020) decreased by infusion of SSP. Apparent rumen digestibility of DM and NDF were (Q, p<0.05; L, p<0.05) increased with infusion SSP. Total tract digestion of DM, OM and NDF were linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased by infusing SSP. The flow of total amino acids (AA), essential amino acids (EAA) and individual amino acids were linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased with infusion SSP. The digestibility of Lysine was quadratically (p = 0.033) increased and apparent degradability of Arginine was linearly (p = 0.032) and quadratically (p = 0.042) increased with infusion SSP. The results indicated that infusion SSP could improve nutrient digestion, ruminal fermentation and AA availability.
TI  - Rumen microbial population dynamics during adaptation to a high-grain diet.
AB  - High-grain adaptation programs are widely used with feedlot cattle to balance enhanced growth performance against the risk of acidosis. This adaptation to a high-grain diet from a high-forage diet is known to change the rumen microbial population structure and help establish a stable microbial population within the rumen. Therefore, to evaluate bacterial population dynamics during adaptation to a high-grain diet, 4 ruminally cannulated beef steers were adapted to a high-grain diet using a step-up diet regimen containing grain and hay at ratios of 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, and 80:20. The rumen bacterial populations were evaluated at each stage of the step-up diet after 1 week of adaptation, before the steers were transitioned to the next stage of the diet, using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, 16S rRNA gene libraries, and quantitative real-time PCR. The T-RFLP analysis displayed a shift in the rumen microbial population structure during the final two stages of the step-up diet. The 16S rRNA gene libraries demonstrated two distinct rumen microbial populations in hay-fed and high-grain-fed animals and detected only 24 common operational taxonomic units out of 398 and 315, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene libraries of hay-fed animals contained a significantly higher number of bacteria belonging to the phylum Fibrobacteres, whereas the 16S rRNA gene libraries of grain-fed animals contained a significantly higher number of bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. Real-time PCR analysis detected significant fold increases in the Megasphaera elsdenii, Streptococcus bovis, Selenomonas ruminantium, and Prevotella bryantii populations during adaptation to the high-concentrate (high-grain) diet, whereas the Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Fibrobacter succinogenes populations gradually decreased as the animals were adapted to the high-concentrate diet. This study evaluates the rumen microbial population using several molecular approaches and presents a broader picture of the rumen microbial population structure during adaptation to a high-grain diet from a forage diet.
TI  - Biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) within 24 h. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Lactobacillus vitulinus, Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus caprinus, and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/L TNT, with <5% of the original TNT recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. Eubacterium ruminantium, Lactobacillus ruminis, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Streptococcus bovis, and Wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/L TNT, with 23-60% of the TNT recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. Clostridium polysaccharolyticum, Megasphaera elsdenii, Prevotella bryantii, Prevotella ruminicola, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/L TNT. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, Prevotella albensis, and Treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the TNT. Anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/L TNT. These results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming TNT.
TI  - The characterization of lactic acid producing bacteria from the rumen of dairy cattle grazing on improved pasture supplemented with wheat and barley grain.
AB  - AIMS: To identify and characterize the major lactic acid bacteria in the rumen of dairy cattle grazing improved pasture of rye grass and white clover and receiving a maize silage and grain supplement with and without virginiamycin. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-five bacterial isolates were obtained from the rumen of 16 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows. The isolates were initially grouped on the basis of their Gram morphology and by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the PCR amplified 16S rDNA. A more definitive analysis was undertaken by comparing the 16S rDNA sequences. Many of the isolates were closely related to other previously characterized rumen bacteria, including Streptococcus bovis, Lactobacillus vitulinus, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Prevotella bryantii and Selenomonas ruminantium. The in vitro production of L- and/or D-lactate was seen with all but five of the isolates examined, many of which were also resistant to virginiamycin. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of grain with virginiamycin may reduce the risk of acidosis but does not prevent its occurrence in dairy cattle grazing improved pasture. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows that lactic acid production is caused, not only by various thoroughly researched types of bacteria, but also by others previously identified in the rumen but not further characterized.
TI  - Genetic features of circular bacteriocins produced by Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - This review highlights the main genetic features of circular bacteriocins, which  require the co-ordinated expression of several genetic determinants. In general terms, it has been demonstrated that the expression of such structural genes must be combined with the activity of proteins involved in maturation (cleavage/circularization) and secretion outside the cell via different transporter systems, as well as multifaceted immunity mechanisms essential to ensuring the bacteria's self-protection against such strong inhibitors. Several circular antibacterial peptides produced by Gram-positive bacteria have been described to date, including enterocin AS-48, from Enterococcus faecalis S-48 (the first one characterized), gassericin A, from Lactobacillus gasseri LA39, and a similar one, reutericin 6, from Lactobacillus reuteri LA6, butyrivibriocin AR10, from the ruminal anaerobe Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens AR10, uberolysin, from Streptococcus uberis, circularin A, from Clostridium beijerinckii ATCC 25752, and subtilosin A, from Bacillus subtilis. We summarize here the progress made in the understanding of their principal genetic features over the last few years, during which the functional roles of circular proteins with wide biological activity have become clearer.
TI  - Dominance of Prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time PCR.
AB  - Relative quantification real-time PCR was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. Abundance of each target taxon was calculated as a fraction of the total 16S rRNA gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. Bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus Prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies in the samples. However, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal Prevotella species Prevotella bryantii, Prevotella ruminicola and Prevotella brevis. The proportion of rRNA gene copies attributable to Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Selenomonas ruminantium and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. Proportions for Ruminobacter amylophilus and Eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Streptococcus bovis, Ruminococcus albus and Megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies. The data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.
TI  - Assessment of biases associated with profiling simple, model communities using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism-based analyses.
AB  - Community profiles based on terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses of amplified ribosomal RNA genes are used to monitor changes in microbial community structure and are sometimes employed for semi-quantitative estimates of species richness and abundance in environmental samples. To assess the accuracy of T-RFLP community profiles representing the relative abundance of bacteria in a sample, five species of ruminal bacteria were used to construct simple "communities". Template DNA for PCR amplification was generated either by mixing equal quantities of genomic DNA from pure cultures or by mixing equal numbers of cells prior to DNA extraction. Pairwise mixtures of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 with Ruminococcus albus 8, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49 and Streptococcus bovis JB1 were created and a 5-member community was constructed. With genomic DNA mixes, relative abundance calculations based on T-RFLP patterns did not reflect input ratios. These discrepancies could not be accounted for by differences in genome size and rRNA operon copy number. In cell mixing experiments, easily lysed cells were overrepresented. To determine if a numerical correction factor could be used to compensate for observed discrepancies, we attempted to quantify biases attributed to DNA extraction and PCR amplification. Biases attributable to these factors led to deviations from expected PCR product ratios by 6% to 38%. We found that interactions were so complex that a suitable factor could not be derived. The unsystematic dependence of T-RFLP peak ratios on variability of DNA extraction and PCR amplification prevents accurate quantification of the relative abundance of microorganisms designed to represent simplified natural populations.
TI  - Effect of the microbial feed additive Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 on protein and peptide degrading activities of rumen bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  - We investigated the potential of the ruminant feed additive Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 on protein and peptide degrading activities of the rumen bacterial species Prevotella albensis M384, Streptococcus bovis 20480, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 3071 grown in vitro. Alive or heat-killed yeast cells were added to bacterial cultures in a complex casein-glucose medium. After incubation of the cultures at 39 degrees C under O(2)-free CO(2), peptidase activities were determined in the absence or in the presence of yeasts. Protease activities were detected after PAGE in gelatin-copolymerized gels. In co-incubations of bacteria and live S. cerevisiae I-1077, proteinase activities were reduced compared to the activities in the bacterial monocultures. Measurement of peptidase activities and microbial enumerations in the co-incubations suggested that live yeasts and bacteria interacted in a competitive way, leading to a decrease in peptidase activities. The mechanism responsible for such an effect could be mainly a competition for substrate utilization, but the release of small competitive peptides by the yeast cells is also likely to be implicated.
TI  - Use of community genome arrays (CGAs) to assess the effects of Acacia angustissima on rumen ecology.
AB  - This research developed a community genome array (CGA) to assess the effects of Acacia angustissima on rumen microbiology. A. angustissima produces non-protein amino acids as well as tannins, which may be toxic to animals, and CGA was used to assess the effects of this plant on the ecology of the rumen. CGAs were developed using a 7.5 cmx2.5 cm nylon membrane format that included up to 96 bacterial genomes. It was possible to separately hybridize large numbers of membranes at once using this mini-membrane format. Pair-wise cross-hybridization experiments were conducted to determine the degree of cross-hybridization between strains; cross-hybridization occurred between strains of the same species, but little cross-reactivity was observed among different species. CGAs were successfully used to survey the microbial communities of animals consuming an A. angustissima containing diet but quantification was not precise. To properly quantify and validate the CGA, Fibrobacter and Ruminococcus populations were independently assessed using 16S rDNA probes to extracted rRNA. The CGA detected an increase in these populations as acacia increased in the diet, which was confirmed by rRNA analysis. There was a great deal of variation among strains of the same species in how they responded to A. angustissima. However, in general Selenomonas strains tended to be resistant to the tannins in the acacia while Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was sensitive. On the other hand some species, like streptococci, varied. Streptococcus bovis-like strains were sensitive to an increase in acacia in the diet while Streptococcus gallolyticus-like strains were resistant. Strep. gallolyticus has independently been shown to be resistant to tannins. It is concluded that there is significant variation in tannin resistance between strains of the same species. This implies that there are specific molecular mechanisms at play that are independent of the phylogenetic position of the organism.
TI  - The use of PCR for the identification and characterisation of bacteriocin genes from bacterial strains isolated from rumen or caecal contents of cattle and sheep.
AB  - PCR primers were designed to amplify the gene that encodes bovicin 255 from Streptococcus gallolyticus LRC0255 and the bacteriocin genes from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains AR10 and OR79A (bviD and bvi79A) in order to screen for their incidence in rumen and caecal B. fibrisolvens and Streptococcus bovis-like isolates from New Zealand and North American ruminants. None of the B. fibrisolvens-like strains (n=34) isolated from New Zealand or North America had the genes encoding for butyrivibriocins AR10 (bviD) or OR79 (bvi79A). However, seven S. bovis isolates from New Zealand ruminants and three from North American animals had the bovicin 255 gene. Sequence comparison of cloned bovicin 255 PCR products indicated a 92.9-95.7% similarity to that of the corresponding bovicin 255 gene sequence of S. gallolyticus. Four of the New Zealand bovicin 255 positive S. bovis isolates were from the caecal contents of the same sheep and had identical PFGE profiles. Two other S. bovis isolates sharing the same PFGE profile were isolated from a separate animal from the same flock. PFGE analysis of the North American strains indicated that all three were closely related as two of three had identical PFGE profiles with the remaining isolate differing only by a single band position. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the 10 isolates were at least 99.8% identical to S. bovis. All 10 S. bovis isolates having the gene for bovicin 255 produced bacteriocin activity that inhibited the growth of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius D1 in a deferred antagonism plating (DAP) assay. Certain S. bovis isolates obtained from ruminants have bacteriocin activity associated with a distinct bovicin 255 gene sequence but it appears that bacteriocin production by the rumen anaerobe B. fibrisolvens may be uncommon in strains isolated from cattle and sheep in New Zealand.
TI  - [Metabolism of rumen microbial populations formed on biosubstrates with different assimilation under the effect of pentachlorophenol].
AB  - It has been established that metabolism of mixed microbial population formed on easy assimilated sources of energy and nitrogen (concentrate diet) progressed on higher level. There is increase of amilolytic activity, formation of lactate, ammonia, low molecular carbonic acids with predomination of propionate molar fraction. The increased resistance to effect of pentachlorophenol (PCP) is characteristic nature of the latter. The role of the most resistant synthrophic bacteria to PCP increases. The pure strains of Streptococcus bovis and Megasphaera elsdenii do not stop metabolism at 100 microM of PCP. Mixed population of microorganisms formed on hard accessible biosubstrates (cellulose) and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens have the increased cellulosolytic activity and while the high sensibility even to low doses of PCP (10-40 microM) is observed. It has been supposed that mechanism of PCP effect is ambiguous for various species of microbial complex of rumen. It's effect strength on all main chains of metabolism (membrane transport, energetic exchange, protein biosynthesis, etc.) significantly depends on capacity of pool of metabolic intermediates formed as a result of definite program of biotechnology of nurture, but significantly decreases the harmful effect of biocides.
TI  - Establishing populations of Megasphaera elsdenii YE 34 and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens YE 44 in the rumen of cattle fed high grain diets.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether Megasphaera elsdenii YE34 (lactic acid degrader) and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens YE44 (alternative starch utilizer to Streptococcus bovis) establish viable populations in the rumen of beef cattle rapidly changed from a forage-based to a grain-based diet. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five steers were inoculated with the two bacterial strains (YE34 and YE44) and five served as uninoculated controls. With the exception of one animal in the control group, which developed acidosis, all steers rapidly adapted to the grain-based diet without signs of acidosis (pH decline and accumulation of lactic acid). Bacterial populations of S. bovis, B. fibrisolvens and M. elsdenii were enumerated using real-time Taq nuclease assays. Populations of S. bovis remained constant (except in the acidotic animal) at ca 10(7) cell equivalents (CE) ml-1 throughout the study. Megasphaera elsdenii YE34, was not detectable in animals without grain in the diet, but immediately established in inoculated animals, at 10(6) CE ml-1, and increased 100-fold in the first 4 days following inoculation. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, initially present at 10(8) CE ml-1, declined rapidly with the introduction of grain into the diet and was not detectable 8 days after grain introduction. CONCLUSION: Megasphaera elsdenii rapidly establishes a lactic acid-utilizing bacterial population in the rumen of grain-fed cattle 7-10 days earlier than in uninoculated cattle. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study has demonstrated that rumen bacterial populations, and in particular the establishment of bacteria inoculated into the rumen for probiotic use, can be monitored by real-time PCR.
TI  - Lotus corniculatus condensed tannins decrease in vivo populations of proteolytic  bacteria and affect nitrogen metabolism in the rumen of sheep.
AB  - Condensed tannins in forage legumes improve the nutrition of sheep by reducing ruminal degradation of plant protein and increasing crude protein flow to the intestine. However, the effects of condensed tannins in forage legumes on rumen bacterial populations in vivo are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the specific effects of condensed tannins from Lotus corniculatus on four proteolytic rumen bacteria in sheep during and after transition from a ryegrass (Lolium perenne)-white clover (Trifolium repens) diet (i.e., low condensed tannins) to a Lotus corniculatus diet (i.e., higher condensed tannins). The bacterial populations were quantified using a competitive polymerase chain reaction. Lotus corniculatus was fed with or without ruminal infusions of polyethylene glycol (PEG), which binds to and inactivates condensed tannins, enabling the effect of condensed tannins on bacterial populations to be examined. When sheep fed on ryegrass-white clover, populations of Clostridium proteoclasticum B316T, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens C211a, Eubacterium sp. C12b, and Streptococcus bovis B315 were 1.5 x 10(8), 1.1 x 10(6), 4.6 x 10(8), and 7.1 x 10(6) mL(-1), respectively. When the diet was changed to Lotus corniculatus, the average populations (after 8-120 h) of C. proteoclasticum, B. fibrisolvens, Eubacterium sp., and S. bovis decreased (P < 0.001) to 2.4 x 10(7), 1.1 x 10(5), 1.1 x 10(8), and 2.5 x 10(5) mL(-1), respectively. When PEG was infused into the rumen of sheep fed Lotus corniculatus, the populations of C. proteoclasticum, B. fibrisolvens, Eubacterium sp., and S. bovis were higher (P < 0.01-0.001) than in sheep fed Lotus corniculatus without the PEG infusion, with average populations (after 8-120 h) of 4.9 x 10(7), 3.8 x 10(5), 1.9 x 10(8), and 1.0 x 10(6), respectively. Sheep fed the Lotus corniculatus diet had lower rumen proteinase activity, ammonia, and soluble nitrogen (P < 0.05-0.001) than sheep that were fed Lotus corniculatus plus PEG. The Lotus corniculatus diet reduced rumen nitrogen digestibility (P < 0.05) and ammonia pool size and increased the flow of undegraded feed nitrogen to the abomasum. The nitrogen intake, rumen non-ammonia nitrogen pool size, rumen microbial non-ammonia nitrogen pool size, and abomasal microbial non-ammonia nitrogen fluxes were similar both in sheep fed only Lotus corniculatus and in sheep fed Lotus corniculatus plus PEG, but nonmicrobial non-ammonia nitrogen flux to the abomasum was higher (P < 0.01) for the sheep fed only Lotus corniculatus. Although condensed tannins in Lotus corniculatus reduced the populations of some proteolytic bacteria, total ruminal microbial protein and microbial protein outflow to the abomasum were unchanged, suggesting a species-specific effect of condensed tannins on bacteria in the rumen.
TI  - Effects of exogenous ammonia or free amino acids on proteolytic activity and protein breakdown products in Streptococcus bovis, Prevotella albensis, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens.
AB  - We studied in details the ammonia or free amino acids (AA) effects on proteolytic activity of three ruminal bacteria: enzymatic activities and protein breakdown products were measured at the end of the exponential growth phase. In Streptococcus bovis the simultaneous uptake of ammonia and probably small peptides induced a decline in total proteolytic activity as a result of changes in endopeptidasic activities. With free AA, the tendency for the endopeptidasic activities to specialise was more evident and the total proteolytic activity decreased too. In Prevotella albensis, the inhibition of proteolysis with free AA was linked to the disappearance of free endopeptidases, to the specialization of cell-associated endopeptidases and to the decrease in exopeptidases. The decrease of proteolysis in P. albensis when ammonia was added was more difficult to interpret. With ammonia or AA Butyrivibro fibrisolvens developed a distinct behavior of those expressed by the other species: the increase of the total proteolytic activity could be explained by a better balance of the endopeptidases expressed. It then clearly appeared that the expression of the proteolytic activities are linked to the nature and/or to the quantity of the nitrogen source. This leads each species to adopt its own nutritional strategy in order to adapt to the environmental conditions of the ruminal ecosystem.
TI  - The effect of condensed tannins from Lotus pedunculatus and Lotus corniculatus on the growth of proteolytic rumen bacteria in vitro and their possible mode of action.
AB  - Five strains of proteolytic rumen bacteria were treated with condensed tannins (CT) purified from Lotus pedunculatus and Lotus corniculatus to investigate their effect on the growth of these bacteria in vitro. Streptococcus bovis NCFB 2476, Eubacterium sp. C124b, Prevotella bryantii B14, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c, and Clostridium proteoclasticum B316T were tested against 200, 400, and 600 microg CT x mL(-1) extracted from L. pedunculatus and L. corniculatus. In the absence of CT, all bacterial strains showed typical growth and reached maximum optical density (OD) after 6-8 h of incubation in a plant protein medium. Growth of Eubacterium sp., P. bryantii, and B. fibrisolvens was inhibited (P < 0.01-0.001) more by the CT from L. pedunculatus than by the CT from L. corniculatus. All strains continued to grow in the presence of 200 microg x mL(-1) of the CT from L. pedunculatus, but attained significantly (P < 0.05-0.01) lower maximum OD600 values than (minus CT) controls, except for S. bovis. At 400 and 600 microg x mL(-1), the addition of CT from L. pedunculatus inhibited (P < 0.05-0.001) the growth of all bacterial strains tested compared with controls. The growth of Eubacterium sp. and P. bryantii was stimulated for the first 4-6 h of incubation (P < 0.001) by 200 microg x mL(-1) of CT from L. corniculatus, but then declined leading to a significant difference in OD values compared with the controls. At 400 microg x mL(-1), the CT from L. corniculatus reduced (P < 0.05-0.01) the growth of all strains except S. bovis, while 600 microg x mL(-1) inhibited (P < 0.01-0.001) the growth of all strains. To study the mechanism of CT action, the degradation of the large subunit (LSU) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco; Fraction 1 Leaf protein) was followed after bacterial cells or Rubisco were preincubated with CT extracted from L. corniculatus and L. pedunculatus. Both preincubations decreased LSU degradation, but they differed in their response to polyethylene glycol (PEG) addition. Addition of PEG to CT-Rubisco preincubations negated the effects of CT, while PEG addition to CT-bacteria preincubations did not. This implies that the CT-bacterial interaction is stronger than the CT-Rubisco interaction or the interaction is of a different type. Also, L. pedunculatus CT reduced the degradation of the LSU to a greater extent than the CT from L. corniculatus when preincubated with bacteria.
TI  - Evidence for recent intergeneric transfer of a new tetracycline resistance gene,  tet(W), isolated from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and the occurrence of tet(O) in ruminal bacteria.
AB  - We have previously reported high-frequency transfer of tetracycline resistance between strains of the rumen anaerobic bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. Donor strains were postulated to carry two TcR genes, one of which is transferred on a novel chromosomal element. It is shown here that coding sequences within the non-transmissible gene in B. fibrisolvens 1.230 are identical to those of the Streptococcus pneumoniae tet(O) gene. This provides the first evidence for genetic exchange between facultatively anaerobic bacteria and rumen obligate anaerobes. In contrast, the product of the transmissible TcR gene shares only 68% amino acid sequence identity with the TetO and TetM proteins and represents a new class of ribosome protection tetracycline resistance determinant, designated Tet W. The tet(W) coding region shows a higher DNA G + C content (53%) than other B. fibrisolvens genes or other ribosome protection-type tet genes, suggesting recent acquisition from a high G + C content genome. Tet(W) genes with almost identical sequences are also shown to be present in TcR strains of B. fibrisolvens from Australian sheep and in TcR strains of two other genera of rumen obligate anaerobes, Selenomonas ruminantium and Mitsuokella multiacidus. This provides compelling evidence for recent intergeneric transfer of resistance genes between ruminal bacteria. Tet(W) is not restricted to ruminal bacteria, as it was also present in a porcine strain of M. multiacidus.
TI  - Effects of ammonia and amino acids on the growth and proteolytic activity of three species of rumen bacteria: Prevotella albensis, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The addition of increasing physiological concentrations of ammonia or amino acids had distinct effects on the growth and proteolytic activity of Streptococcus bovis JB1, Prevotella albensis, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens DSM3071. The growth of S. bovis and B. fibrisolvens was enhanced by NH(3) and AA, and that of P. albensis was reduced compared with a control with protein as the sole source of nitrogen. The proteolytic activity of S. bovis and P. albensis was reduced, but that of B. fibrisolvens was improved. NH(3) seemed to act mainly on the cell-associated fraction of the proteolytic activity, while the action of AA was not specific. In the rumen the proteolytic activity of S. bovis and P. albensis would be optimal at low concentrations of NH(3) or AA (<0.05 and <0.27 g/L respectively). In contrast, B. fibrisolvens would need higher concentrations (0.5 g/L of NH(3) or 2.7 g/L of AA). It can be assumed that these bacteria will grow in different ecological niches.
TI  - Feasibility of using total purines as a marker for ruminal bacteria.
AB  - A procedure for measuring total purine content of mixed ruminal bacteria was adapted for use in the determination of purines in pure cultures of ruminal bacteria. Recovery of adenine and guanine, alone or in mixture, was quite variable. The problem was traced to solubility of the silver salt of adenine in the acid wash solution. When the precipitating solution was used as the wash, recovery of the purines was over 97%. Recovery of a 1:1 mixture of adenine and guanine added to yeast RNA was 100.6+/-3.2%. Purine, protein, and bacterial concentrations were determined for 10 pure cultures of ruminal bacteria: Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, D16f, H10b, and H17c; Fibrobacter succinogenes B21a; Lachnospira multiparus D25e; Lactobacillus lactis ARD26e; Prevotella ruminicola H15a; Ruminococcus albus 7; Ruminococcus flavefaciens B34b; and Streptococcus bovis ARD5d. The CV for the most-probable-number (MPN) assay (bacterial concentrations), purine analysis, and protein analysis were 55.86, 5.25 and 6.52%, respectively. Considerable variation was found among bacterial species and strains when purine and protein concentrations were compared as the amount per individual cell. More consistent values were obtained when these components were expressed on a dry matter basis. Purine:protein ratios for the 10 pure cultures ranged from .023 to .1299, with a mean value of .0883. For samples of mixed bacteria separated from ruminal fluid, this ratio was found to average .0306, which is approximately one-third of the value for the pure cultures. The value determined for the mixed bacterial sample is similar to previously reported values. Based on the ratio obtained with the pure cultures, the microbial protein flow out of the rumen has probably been overestimated in most previous reports. Limited studies suggest that the samples of mixed ruminal bacteria used as a standard are probably contaminated with feed particles containing protein, which results in lower purine:protein ratios.
TI  - The ability of "low G + C gram-positive" ruminal bacteria to resist monensin and  counteract potassium depletion.
AB  - Gram-negative ruminal bacteria with an outer membrane are generally more resistant to the feed additive, monensin, than Gram-positive species, but some bacteria can adapt and increase their resistance. 16S rRNA sequencing indicates that a variety of ruminal bacteria are found in the "low G + C Gram-positive group," but some of these bacteria are monensin resistant and were previously described as Gram-negative species (e.g., Selenomonas ruminantium and Megasphaera elsdenii). The activity of monensin can be assayed by its ability to cause potassium loss, and results indicated that the amount of monensin needed to catalyze half maximal potassium depletion (K(d)) from low G + C gram-positive ruminal bacteria varied by as much as 130-fold. The K(d) values for Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, Streptococcus bovis JB1, Clostridium aminophilum F, S. ruminantium HD4, and M. elsdenii B159 were 10, 65, 100, 1020, and 1330 nM monensin, respectively. B. fibrisolvens was very sensitive to monensin, and it did not adapt. S. bovis and C. aminophilum cultures that were transferred repeatedly with sub-lethal doses of monensin had higher K(d) values than unadapted cultures, but the K(d) was always less than 800 nM. S. ruminantium and M. elsdenii cells were highly resistant (K(d) > 1000 nM), and this resistance could be explained by the ability of these low G + C Gram-positive bacteria to synthesize outer membranes.
TI  - Sequence analysis and characterization of pOM1, a small cryptic plasmid from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and its use in construction of a new family of cloning vectors for Butyrivibrios.
AB  - As a preliminary step in the development of vector systems, we have isolated and  begun to characterize small, cryptic plasmids from several strains of the rumen bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. We present here the complete nucleotide sequence of Butyrivibrio plasmid pOM1, which was isolated from B. fibrisolvens Bu49. While it is very similar in size to the previously characterized Butyrivibrio plasmids pRJF1 and pRJF2, pOM1 exhibits a restriction pattern which is quite distinct. Analysis of sequence data reveals that pOM1 contains only two open reading frames of significant length (ORF1 and ORF2), both of which are required for self-replication and maintenance. The protein encoded in ORF1 shows homologies with Pre (plasmid recombination enzyme) proteins encoded in plasmids from gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bacillus thuringiensis. The putative translation product of ORF2, on the other hand, resembles Rep (replication) proteins of a different group of gram-positive plasmids, for which the Staphylococcus plasmid pSN2 is a prototype. Unlike the other characterized-Butyrivibrio plasmids, pOM1 appears to replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism. Experimental evidence showing the presence of a single-stranded replication intermediate consistent with this mechanism is presented. pOM1 has been used in the construction of a new Escherichia coli-B. fibrisolvens shuttle vector, pSMerm1, which has been successfully used to introduce a cloned gene into B. fibrisolvens harboring the pRJF1 plasmid.
TI  - A defined medium for rumen bacteria and identification of strains impaired in de  novo biosynthesis of certain amino acids.
AB  - A completely defined growth medium has been developed to determine the nitrogen requirements for several species of ruminal bacteria, and has revealed two strains which are impaired in de novo biosynthesis of certain amino acids. Using NH4Cl as a sole nitrogen source, the medium supported growth of Butyrivibrio, Selenomonas, Prevotella and Streptococcus species. One strain of B. fibrisolvens (E14) and one strain of P. ruminicola (GA33) did not grow in the presence of NH4Cl until the medium was supplemented with amino acids or peptides. For B. fibrisolvens strain E14, methionine was identified as the specific growth-limiting amino acid although methionine alone did not support growth in the absence of NH4Cl. For P. ruminicola strain GA33, any individual amino acid other than methionine or cysteine could supplement the medium and support growth. Enzyme assays confirmed a lack of NADH and NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activities in this strain.
TI  - Identification of proteolytic rumen bacteria isolated from New Zealand cattle.
AB  - The protease activities of 212 strains of rumen bacteria isolated from New Zealand cattle grazing pasture were measured. Thirty-seven per cent of strains had activity greater than or equal to the proteolytic rumen bacterium Prevotella ruminicola and 43 of these isolates were identified by morphology, carbon source utilization, Gram stain, biochemical tests and fermentation end-product analysis. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis showed that the strains formed four clusters: cluster A contained 26 strains and clustered with a reference strain of Streptococcus bovis; cluster C contained three strains and clustered with a reference strain of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, while clusters B (10 strains) and D (three strains) did not cluster with any of the remaining rumen bacterial type strains. Further tests identified strains of cluster B as Eubacterium budayi, while cluster D strains most closely resembled B. fibrisolvens and were described as B. fibrisolvens-like. An unclustered strain, C21a, was identified as P. ruminicola. The significance of these proteolytic bacterial populations is discussed in relation to protein breakdown in New Zealand ruminants.
TI  - Rumen fermentation and metabolic profile in conventional and gnotobiotic lambs.
AB  - Observations were carried out of actual acidity, volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations, enzyme activity in the rumen, total protein, urea, total lipid and glucose in the serum of conventional (CL) and gnotobiotic lambs (GL) in the period of milk nutrition. The inoculum of gnotobiotic lambs contained Streptococcus bovis, Prevoxella ruminicola, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Selenomonas ruminantium at a concentration of 1.10(6) each. Throughout the observation period the pH of the rumen contents of gnotobiotic lambs ranged within 6.5-6.8 with a significant difference at an age of 7 weeks. Total VFA concentrations in the rumen contents were increased in the CL throughout milk nutrition: the differences at 4 and 5 weeks of age were significant. Total VFA in the conventional lambs revealed an increasing tendency between weeks 4 and 7, reaching higher levels at 7 weeks of age (57.1 mmol.l-1), whereas in the gnotobiotic animals the range (24.3-30.1 mmol.l-1) was narrow and the peak occurred at 6 weeks of age. In GL significantly increased molar proportions of acetic acid were observed whereas in CL the molar proportions of propionic acid proved to be significant increased. The molar proportions of butyric and valeric acids were increased in CL but the group differences were not significant. In GL no isoacids were found. Alpha amylase (E.C.3.2.1.1.) activity of the rumen contents was significantly increased in GL between weeks 2 and 6 of age whereas cellulase (endoglucanase E.C.3.2.1.4. and cellobiohydrolase E.C.3.2.1.91.) activity was significantly increased in 4-week-old CL. Over the whole period of milk nutrition no significant differences were observed in urease (E.C.3.5.1.5.) activity of the rumen contents in the examined groups. At 5 weeks of age significantly increased total protein levels were observed in the conventional animals with maximum levels occurring at 4 weeks of age (CL-59.5 g.l-1 GL-55.3 g.l-1). Urea levels in 6-week old conventional lambs were significantly higher than in the gnotobiotic animals (CL-6.4 mmol.l-1 vs. GL-1.9 mmol.l-1). As to glycaemia no significant group differences were recorded. In the conventional animals total lipid levels were significantly increased at 1 and 6 weeks of age with a peak occurring in the first week of life (7.5 g.l-1) whereas in the gnotobiotic lambs a significant increase was observed at 3 weeks of age, the peak being recorded in 4 week-old animals (4.3 g.l-1). Throughout the period of interest the mean daily weight gains in the conventional and gnotobiotic lambs presented 0.164 and 0.162 kg, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Cyclic AMP in ruminal and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - An examination of cAMP levels in predominant species of ruminal bacteria and other anaerobic bacteria was conducted. Cellular cAMP concentrations of glucose-grown cultures of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, Prevotella ruminicola D31d, Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 and D, Megasphaera elsdenii B159, Streptococcus bovis JB1, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482, and Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 were determined at various times during growth by a competitive binding radioimmunoassay procedure. The results were compared to those for Escherichia coli NRRL B3704. The levels of cAMP ranged from undetectable for B. thetaiotaomicron to approximately 15 pmol/mg cell protein for P. ruminicola D31d. Varying the growth substrate in a manner previously shown to elicit regulatory response did not alter the level of cAMP in these organisms. In general, cAMP concentrations present in these organisms were much lower than the 6-25 pmol/mg cell protein observed for E. coli. The levels of cAMP in P. ruminicola were consistently higher than levels in other anaerobes, particularly during the early exponential and stationary phases of growth. Based on these data it seems unlikely that cAMP is involved in regulation of substrate catabolism in the anaerobic bacteria examined except in P. ruminicola where it may have an unknown regulatory function.
TI  - Influence of Yucca shidigera extract on ruminal ammonia concentrations and ruminal microorganisms.
AB  - An extract of the desert plant Yucca shidigera was assessed for its possible benefit in ruminal fermentation. The extract bound ammonia in aqueous solution when concentrations of ammonia were low (up to 0.4 mM) and when the extract was added at a high concentration to the sample (20%, vol/vol). The apparent ammonia-binding capability was retained after autoclaving and was decreased slightly following dialysis. Acid-precipitated extract was inactive. No evidence of substantial ammonia binding was found at higher ammonia concentrations (up to 30 mM). When Y. shidigera extract (1%, vol/vol) was added to strained rumen fluid in vitro, a small (6%) but significant (P < 0.05) decrease in ammonia concentration occurred, apparently because of decreased proteolysis. Inclusion of Y. shidigera extract (1%, vol/vol) in the growth medium of the rumen bacterium Streptococcus bovis ES1 extended its lag phase, while growth of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens SH13 was abolished. The growth of Prevotella (Bacteroides) ruminicola B(1)4 was stimulated, and that of Selenomonas ruminantium Z108 was unaffected. Protozoal activity, as measured by the breakdown of 14C-leucine-labelled S. ruminantium in rumen fluid incubated in vitro, was abolished by the addition of 1% extract. The antimicrobial activities were unaffected by precipitating tannins with polyvinylpyrrolidone, but a butanol extract, containing the saponin fraction, retained its antibacterial and antiprotozoal effects. Saponins from other sources were less effective against protozoa than Y. shidigera saponins. Y. shidigera extract, therefore, appears unlikely to influence ammonia concentration in the rumen directly, but its saponins have antimicrobial properties, particularly in suppressing ciliate protozoa, which may prove beneficial to ruminal fermentation and may lead indirectly to lower ruminal ammonia concentrations.
TI  - Effects of Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.) Condensed Tannins on Growth and Proteolysis by Four Strains of Ruminal Bacteria.
AB  - Sainfoin leaf condensed tannins inhibited growth and protease activity in Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens A38 and Streptococcus bovis 45S1 but had little effect on Prevotella ruminicola B(1)4 or Ruminobacter amylophilus WP225. Tannins bound to cell coat polymers in all strains. Morphological changes in B. fibrisolvens and S. bovis implicated the cell wall as a target of tannin toxicity.
TI  - Effect of extracellular lactate on growth of rumen lactate producers.
AB  - The addition of Na-lactate (50-150 mmol/l) to media with glucose had only marginal effect on the growth of rumen lactate-producing bacteria at pH between 6.5 and 5.8. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was somewhat more sensitive to external lactate than Streptococcus bovis, Lactobacillus fermentum and Selenomonas ruminantium. It can be concluded that rumen lactate producers, which proliferate at the onset of rumen lactic acidosis, are not influenced by the lactate accumulation, except some non-specific osmotic effects.
TI  - Development of a DNA probe for Streptococcus bovis by using a cloned amylase gene.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is a normal inhabitant of the rumen but has been implicated as a causative agent for ruminal lactic acidosis and related problems. While rarely isolated from humans, S. bovis has been identified as a causative agent for endocarditis, meningitis, and septicemia. Recent reports have also suggested a correlation between human colonic carcinoma and increased levels of S. bovis. Identification of S. bovis strains of human origin has been problematic because of variations in results of biochemical tests compared with results for ruminal strains. We have tested a cloned amylase gene from the ruminal strain S. bovis JB1 as a potential DNA probe for rapid and accurate identification of S. bovis strains from all sources. DNAs from strains identified as S. bovis, of both human and ruminal origin, were found to hybridize with the probe under stringent conditions. The probe also hybridized with variants of S. bovis that did not grow on starch. The probe did not hybridize with DNA isolated from other bacteria of human colonic and ruminal origin, including Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ruminicola, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and Enterococcus faecalis but did demonstrate hybridization with Streptococcus salivarius.
TI  - Interaction of ruminal bacteria in the production and utilization of maltooligosaccharides from starch.
AB  - The degradation and utilization of starch by three amylolytic and one nonamylolytic species of ruminal bacteria were studied. Pure cultures of Streptococcus bovis JB1, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, and Bacteroides ruminicola D31d rapidly hydrolyzed starch and maltooligosaccharides accumulated. The major starch hydrolytic products detected in S. bovis cultures were glucose, maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose. In addition to these oligosaccharides, B. fibrisolvens cultures produced maltopentaose. The products of starch hydrolysis by B. ruminicola were even more complex, yielding glucose through maltotetraose, maltohexaose, and maltoheptaose but little maltopentaose. Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 grew poorly on starch, digested only a small portion of the available substrate, and generated no detectable oligosaccharides as a result of cultivation in starch containing medium. S. ruminantium was able to grow on a mixture of maltooligosaccharides and utilize those of lower degree (less than 10) of polymerization. A coculture system containing S. ruminantium as a dextrin-utilizing species and each of the three amylolytic bacteria was developed to test whether the products of starch hydrolysis were available for crossfeeding to another ruminal bacterium. Cocultures of S. ruminantium and S. bovis contained large numbers of S. bovis but relatively few S. ruminantium and exhibited little change in the pattern of maltooligosaccharides observed for pure cultures of S. bovis. In contrast, S. ruminantium was able to compete with B. fibrisolvens and B. ruminicola for these growth substrates. When grown with B. fibrisolvens, S. ruminantium grew to high numbers and maltooligosaccharides accumulated to a much lesser degree than in cultures of B. fibrisolvens alone. S. ruminantium-B. ruminicola cultures contained large numbers of both species, and maltooligosaccharides never accumulated in these cocultures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cloning and expression of an amylase gene from Streptococcus bovis in Escherichia coli.
AB  - An amylase gene was identified in a Streptococcus bovis 033 lambda gtWES lambda B genomic library. Using a starch overlay and a Congo red-iodine staining procedure, amylase positive clones could be identified by zones of clearing. Ten amylase positive clones were identified using this procedure. The clone chosen for further study, lambda SBA105, contained an insert of approximately 7.5 kb. The insert was mapped, and subcloning localized the amylase gene to a region of approximately 3.1 kb. Cloning of the 3.1 kb amylase fragment into pUC18 in both orientations revealed that the amylase gene was transcribed from its own promoter. Amylase activity was expressed by the Escherichia coli subclones and was found to be largely associated with the cytoplasmic fraction. Southern hybridization of genomic DNA from the amylolytic strains, S. bovis 033, S. bovis 077, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 194 and 195 revealed a single hybridizing band in S. bovis 033 DNA only. This indicates that the amylase gene from S. bovis may differ from the amylases of these other amylolytic bacteria.
TI  - DAP-decarboxylase activity and lysine production by rumen bacteria.
AB  - The last step of pathway of lysine biosynthesis by rumen bacteria was tested. The first measurements of DAP-decarboxylase activity and of lysine production by Megasphera elsdenii, Selenomonas ruminantium, Clostridium spp., Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Bacteroides succinogenes as well as the first attempts to increase the lysine production by ruminal streptococci by mutation are described. The highest values were measured in Selenomonas ruminantium (DAP-decarboxylase activity = 146 micrograms DAP.min-1.mg-1 protein and lysine production was 390 micrograms.mg-1 protein) and the lowest values were ascertained in Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (DAP-decarboxylase activity = 27 micrograms DAP.min-1.mg-1 protein and lysine production was 32 micrograms.mg-1 protein). DAP-decarboxylase activity was increased by mutation especially in Streptococcus bovis, the lysine production in both of tested ruminal streptococci. The potential use of lysine-excreting mutants in calves in future is suggested.
TI  - A survey of peptidase activity in rumen bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-nine strains of 14 species of rumen bacteria were screened for their ability to hydrolyse Ala2, Ala5, GlyArg-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide (GlyArg-MNA) and Leu-MNA. Several species, notably Megasphaera elsdenii, were active against Ala2, and a smaller number, including Bacteroides ruminicola, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Lachnospira multipara and Ruminobacter amylophilus, broke down Ala5. Streptococcus bovis had an exceptionally high leucine arylamidase activity. However, only Ba. ruminicola hydrolysed GlyArg-MNA. Further investigation revealed that only Ba. ruminicola and Bu. fibrisolvens hydrolysed Ala5 to Ala3 and Ala2, with little ALa4 being produced, in a manner similar to rumen fluid. The activity of Ba. ruminicola against synthetic peptidase substrates, including GlyArg-MNA, LysAla-MNA, ArgArg-MNA, GlyPro-MNA, LeuVal-MNA, and Ala3-p-nitroanilide, was similar to that of rumen fluid, whereas the activity of Bu. fibrisolvens was quite different. Since the main mechanism by which peptides are broken down in the rumen is similar to dipeptidyl aminopeptidase type I, for which GlyArg-MNA is a diagnostic substrate, it was concluded that Ba. ruminicola was the most important single species in peptide breakdown in the rumen.
TI  - Introduction of Tn916 and pAM beta 1 into Streptococcus bovis JB1 by conjugation.
AB  - The transposon Tn916 and self-mobilizing plasmid pAM beta 1 were conjugated from  Enterococcus faecalis to the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis JB1. Transconjugants were identified by resistance to tetracycline (Tn916) or erythromycin (pAM beta 1) and by Southern hybridization analyses. Transfer frequencies were 7.0 x 10(-6) and 1.0 x 10(-6) per recipient cell for Tn916 and pAM beta 1, respectively. The transconjugants JB1/Tn916 and JB1/pAM beta 1 were used as donors for matings with E. faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and the ruminal bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. While pAM beta 1 was successfully transferred to all three organisms, Tn916 was transferred only into B. subtilis and B. fibrisolvens at very low frequencies. This is the first report of conjugal DNA transfers between two ruminal organisms.
TI  - Digestion of barley, maize, and wheat by selected species of ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Differences in the digestion of barley, maize, and wheat by three major ruminal starch-digesting bacterial species, Streptococcus bovis 26, Ruminobacter amylophilus 50, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens A38, were characterized. The rate of starch digestion in all cereal species was greater for S. bovis 26 than for R. amylophilus 50 or B. fibrisolvens A38. Starch digestion by S. bovis 26 was greater in wheat than in barley or maize, whereas starch digestion by R. amylophilus 50 was greater in barley than in maize or wheat. B. fibrisolvens A38 digested the starch in barley and maize to a similar extent but was virtually unable to digest the starch in wheat. The higher ammonia concentration in cultures of B. fibrisolvens A38 when grown on wheat than when grown on barley or maize suggests that B. fibrisolvens A38 utilized wheat protein rather than starch. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that B. fibrisolvens A38 initially colonized cell wall material, while S. bovis 26 randomly colonized the endosperm and R. amylophilus 50 preferentially colonized starch granules. There was subsequent colonization but only superficial digestion of wheat starch granules by B. fibrisolvens A38. Variation in the association between starch and protein within the endosperm of cereal grains contributes to the differential effectiveness with which amylolytic species can utilize cereal starch.
TI  - Inducible bacteriophages from ruminal bacteria.
AB  - The incidence of temperate bacteriophage in a wide range of ruminal bacteria was  investigated by means of induction with mitomycin C. Supernatant liquid from treated cultures was examined for phagelike particles by using transmission electron microscopy. Of 38 ruminal bacteria studied, nine organisms (23.7%) representing five genera (Eubacteria, Bacteroides, Butyrivibrio, Ruminococcus, and Streptococcus) produced phagelike particles. Filamentous particles from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens are the first of this morphological type reported from ruminal bacteria. All of the other particles obtained possessed polyhedral heads and long, noncontractile tails (group B-type phage). The limited range of morphological types produced by mitomycin C induction cannot yet account for the much wider range of types found in ruminal contents by direct examination. The presence of viral genetic material in a significant percentage of the bacteria tested, as well as in a range of different genera, indicates that viral genetic material may be a normal constituent of the genome of appreciable numbers of ruminal bacteria.
TI  - Esterase activities in Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains.
AB  - Thirty strains of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens isolated in diverse geographical locations were examined for esterase activity by using naphthyl esters of acetate, butyrate, caprylate, laurate, and palmitate. All strains possessed some esterase activity, and high levels of activity were observed with strains 49, H17c, S2, AcTF2, and LM8/1B. Esterase activity also was detected in other ruminal bacteria (Bacteroides ruminicola, Selenomonas ruminantium, Ruminobacter amylophilus, and Streptococcus bovis). For all B. fibrisolvens strains tested, naphthyl fatty acid esterase activity paralleled culture growth and was predominantly cell associated. With strains 49, CF4c, and S2, the activity was retained by protoplasts made from whole cells. Esterase activity was detected with all strains when grown on glucose, and some strains showed higher activity levels when grown on other substrates (larchwood xylan or citrus pectin). When nitrophenyl esters of fatty acids were used to measure esterase activity, generally four- to sevenfold-higher activity levels were detected, and with a number of strains substantial levels were found in the culture fluid. Cultures of these strains (H17c, NOR37, D1, and D30g) contained xylanase and acetyl xylan esterase activities, neither of which was associated to any great extent with the cells. Acetyl xylan esterase has not been previously detected in ruminal bacteria and may be important to overall digestion of forage by these organisms.
TI  - Amylolytic activity of selected species of ruminal bacteria.
AB  - A variety of species of ruminal bacteria were screened for the ability to grow in starch-containing medium and produce amylase. Of those tested, the highest levels of amylase were produced by Streptococcus bovis JB1 and Ruminobacter amylophilus H18. Other strains that grew well on starch and produced amylase included Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens A38 and 49 and Bacteroides ruminicola 23 and B14. Varying the carbohydrate source provided for growth resulted in changes in the growth rate and level of amylase produced by these strains. All strains grew rapidly in starch-containing medium, and the rates of growth were generally more rapid than those observed for maltose-grown cultures. For S. bovis JB1, B. ruminicola 23 and B14, and B. fibrisolvens 49 and A38, amylase was produced when growth was on maltose or starch, but this activity was greatly reduced in glucose-grown cultures. The distribution of amylolytic activity between cellular and extracellular fractions was sometimes affected by the carbohydrate provided for growth. If S. bovis JB1 and B. fibrisolvens 49 were grown on starch, amylase was largely associated with cell pellets; however, if grown on maltose these strains produced activities that were almost entirely present in the extracellular fluid fractions. Although not as dramatic, a similar shift in the location of amylase activities was noted for the two B. ruminicola strains when grown on the same substrates. Growth on maltose or starch had little influence on either the predominantly cell-associated activity of B. fibrisolvens A38 or the activity of R. amylophilus H18, which was equally divided between cell pellet and extracellular fluid fractions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effects of potassium ion concentrations on the antimicrobial activities of ionophores against ruminal anaerobes.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of monensin and lasalocid against representative strains of ruminal bacteria were evaluated in medium containing three different concentrations of potassium (1.3, 7.9, or 23.3 mM). The growth of Eubacterium ruminantium was inhibited by low concentrations of ionophores (less than or equal to 0.16 mg/liter), while the strain of Streptococcus bovis tested was resistant to high concentrations of ionophores (40 mg/liter) at all potassium concentrations tested. The MICs of the ionophores for strains of Bacteroides succinogenes, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens and for one strain of Bacteroides ruminicola increased with increasing potassium concentrations in the medium. High concentrations of ionophores (40 mg/liter) decreased the maximum cell yields or increased the lag times or both in cultures of one strain of Bacteroides ruminicola and two strains of Selenomonas ruminantium but did not completely inhibit the growth of these organisms. Increased potassium concentrations in the medium (from 7.9 to 23.3 mM) decreased the lag times or increased the cell yields or both when these three strains were grown in ionophore-containing medium, while the activities of lasalocid and monensin against these organisms were enhanced in the medium containing low potassium concentrations (1.3 mM). The data from this study suggest that extracellular potassium concentrations may influence the antimicrobial activities of ionophores in the rumen.
TI  - Interactions between rumen amylolytic and lactate-utilizing bacteria in growth on starch.
AB  - The growth and metabolism of the rumen amylolytic bacteria Streptococcus bovis, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Bacteroides ruminicola, growing in pure cultures and co-cultures with the rumen lactilytic bacteria Megasphaera elsdenii and Veillonella alcalescens were followed. The interaction of amylolytic bacteria with V. alcalescens represents a simple food chain. The interaction with M. elsdenii is more complex, since there is a simultaneous competition for products of the starch degradation.
TI  - Factors affecting the rate of breakdown of bacterial protein in rumen fluid.
AB  - 1. The cellular proteins of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Lactobacillus casei, Megasphaera elsdenii, Selenomonas ruminantium and Streptococcus bovis were labelled by growth in the presence of L-[14C]leucine, and the breakdown of labelled protein was measured in incubations of these bacteria with rumen fluid to which unlabelled 5 mM-L-leucine was added. The rate of protein breakdown was estimated from the rate of release of radioactivity into acid-soluble material. 2. Protein breakdown occurred at different rates in different species. The mean rates for B. fibrisolvens, L. casei, M. elsdenii, Sel. ruminantium and Str. bovis were 28.6, 18.1, 17.7, 10.5 and 5.3%/h respectively in samples of strained rumen fluid (SRF) with different protozoal populations. Rates of 3%/h or less were found in SRF from ciliate-free sheep or in faunated SRF from which protozoa had been removed by centrifugation. Further removal of mixed rumen bacteria had little effect. Suspensions of washed protozoa degraded bacterial protein at rates which were of the same order as those found in SRF. 3. The rate of breakdown of bacterial protein in different samples of SRF tended to increase as the numbers of small entodiniomorphid protozoa increased. The numbers of larger entodiniomorphs and holotrichs had no obvious influence on this rate. 4. Autoclaved and u.v.-treated bacteria were generally no different from live bacteria in their susceptibility to breakdown in SRF from faunated sheep, indicating that endogenous protein turnover was not a significant cause of bacterial protein catabolism. 5. The rate of bacterial protein breakdown was unrelated to the proteolytic activity of SRF. 6. It was concluded that predation by small protozoa is by far the most important cause of bacterial protein turnover in the rumen, with autolysis, other lytic factors and endogenous proteolysis being of minor importance.
TI  - Seasonal changes in the cecal microflora of the high-arctic Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus).
AB  - The dominant cecal bacteria in the high-arctic Svalbard reindeer were characterized, their population densities were estimated, and cecal pH was determined in summer, when food quality and availability is good, and in winter, when it is very poor. In summer the total culturable viable bacterial population was (8.9 +/- 5.3) X 10(8) cells ml-1, whereas in winter it was (1.5 +/- 0.7) X 10(8) cells ml-1, representing a decrease to 17% of the summer population density. Of the dominant species of cultured bacteria, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens represented 23% in summer and 18% in winter. Streptococcus bovis represented 17% in summer and 5% in winter. Bacteroides ruminicola represented 10% in summer and 26% in winter. In summer and winter, respectively, the proportion of the viable population showing the following activities was as follows: fiber digestion, 36 and 48%; cellulolysis, 10 and 6%; xylanolysis, 33 and 48%; and starch utilization, 77 and 71%. The most abundant cellulolytic species in summer was Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, representing 62% of the total cellulolytic population, and in winter it was Ruminococcus albus, representing 80% of the total cellulolytic population. The most abundant xylanolytic species in summer was Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and in winter it was Bacteroides ruminicola, representing 59 and 54% of the xylanolytic isolates in summer and winter, respectively. The cecal bacterial of the Svalbard reindeer have the ability to digest starch and the major structural carbohydrates of the diet that are not digested in the rumen. The cecum in these animals has the potential to contribute very substantially to the digestion of the available plant material in both summer and winter.
TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of hexoses by ruminal bacteria: evidence for the phosphotransferase transport system.
AB  - Six species of ruminal bacteria were surveyed for the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent phosphorylation of glucose. Selenomonas ruminantium HD4, Streptococcus bovis JB1, and Megasphaera elsdenii B159 all showed significant activity, but Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, Bacteroides succinogenes S85, and Bacteroides ruminicola B1(4) showed low rates of PEP-dependent phosphorylation and much higher rates in the presence of ATP. S. ruminantium HD4, S. bovis JB1, and M. elsdenii B159 also used PEP to phosphorylate the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). Rates of 2-DG phosphorylation with ATP were negligible for S. bovis JB1 and M. elsdenii B159, but toluene-treated cells of S. ruminantium HD4 phosphorylated 2-DG in the presence of ATP as well as PEP. Cell-free extracts of S. ruminantium HD4 used ATP but not PEP to phosphorylate glucose and 2-DG. Since PEP could serve as a phosphoryl donor in toluene-treated cells but not in cell-free extracts, there was evidence for membrane and hence phosphotransferase system involvement in the PEP-dependent activity. The ATP-dependent phosphorylating enzymes from S. ruminantium HD4 and S. bovis JB1 had molecular weights of approximately 48,000 and were not inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate. Based on these criteria, they were glucokinases rather than hexokinases. The S. ruminantium HD4 glucokinase was competitively inhibited by 2-DG and mannose, sugars that differ from glucose in the C-2 position. Since 2-DG was a competitive inhibitor of glucose, the same enzyme probably phosphorylates both sugars. The S. bovis JB1 glucokinase was not inhibited by either 2-DG or mannose and had a higher Km and Vmax for glucose.
TI  - Stoichiometry of glucose and starch splitting by strains of amylolytic bacteria from the rumen and anaerobic digester.
AB  - The stoichiometry of glucose and starch splitting by the amylolytic bacteria Streptococcus bovis, Selenomonas ruminantium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Eubacterium ruminantium and Clostridium sp. was followed. There were many differences in the ratios of metabolites and in growth yields, as well as in the cell composition, between the growth on glucose and starch. The bacteria employ different nutritional strategies with respect to both energy sources.
TI  - Seasonal changes in the ruminal microflora of the high-arctic Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus).
AB  - The dominant rumen bacteria in high-arctic Svalbard reindeer were characterized,  their population densities were estimated, and ruminal pH was determined in summer, when food quality and availability are good, and in winter, when they are poor. In summer the total cultured viable population density was (2.09 +/- 1.26) X 10(10) cells ml-1, whereas in winter it was (0.36 +/- 0.29) X 10(10) cells ml-1, representing a decrease to 17% of the summer population density. On culture, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens represented 22% of the bacterial population in summer and 30% in winter. Streptococcus bovis represented 17% of the bacterial population in summer but only 4% in winter. Methanogenic bacteria were present at 10(4) cells ml-1 in summer and 10(7) cells ml-1 in winter. In summer and winter, respectively, the proportions of the viable population showing the following activities were as follows: starch utilization, 68 and 63%; fiber digestion, 31 and 74%; cellulolysis, 15 and 35%; xylanolysis, 30 and 58%; proteolysis, 51 and 28%; ureolysis, 40 and 54%; and lactate utilization, 13 and 4%. The principal cellulolytic bacterium was B. fibrisolvens, which represented 66 and 52% of the cellulolytic population in summer and winter, respectively. The results indicate that the microflora of the rumen of Svalbard reindeer is highly effective in fiber digestion and nitrogen metabolism, allowing the animals to survive under the austere nutritional conditions typical of their high-arctic habitat.
TI  - The rumen microbiology of seaweed digestion in Orkney sheep.
AB  - The microbial populations of the rumens of seaweed-fed and pasture-fed Orkney sheep were examined. The populations in the pasture-fed sheep were similar to those of other domestic ruminants fed on land plants, but those of the seaweed-fed animals showed major differences in the dominant species. Total ciliate populations were quantitatively similar, but in the seaweed-fed animals Dasytricha ruminantium was one of the most dominant species. No phycomycete fungi or cellulolytic bacteria were found in the seaweed-fed animals, and the bacterial population was dominated by Streptococcus bovis, Selenomonas ruminantium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and lactate-utilizing species. Electron microscopy revealed that spirochaetes and an unidentified filamentous bacterium were probably of major significance in seaweed digestion. The ability of bacterial strains from both groups of animals to metabolize plant and algal constituents was examined.
TI  - Effect of pH on growth rates of rumen amylolytic and lactilytic bacteria.
AB  - The relationship between the pH of the medium and specific growth rates, in well-buffered media at 38.5 degrees C, was determined for three strains of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and for one strain each of Streptococcus bovis, Selenomonas ruminantium subsp. lactilytica. Megasphaera elsdenii, Veillonella alcalescens, and Propionibacterium acnes. The pH optima for growth were between 6.1 and 6.6 for all six species, and the upper pH limits were between 7.3 and 7.8. The lower limit pH values for growth on glucose were 5.4 for B. fibrisolvens, near 5.0 for V. alcalescens, and between 4.4 and 4.8 for the other four species. These values fall within the minimum pH ranges found when these species are grown in poorly buffered medium with nonlimiting glucose concentrations. Acid sensitivity per se could cause the washout of B. fibrisolvens, but not of the other five species, from the rumens of animals on high-starch diets.
TI  - Effects of lasalocid or monensin on lactate-producing or -using rumen bacteria.
AB  - Lasalocid or monensin inhibited most of the lactate-producing rumen bacteria (Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Eubacterium cellulosolvens, E. ruminantium, Lachnospira multiparus, Lactobacillus ruminis, L. vitulinus, Ruminococcus albus, R. flavefaciens, Streptococcus bovis). Minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from .38 to 3.0 micrograms/ml. Among the lactate producers, those that produce succinate as a major end product (Bacteroides, Selenomonas, Succinimonas, Succinivibrio) were not inhibited by lasalocid or monensin. Also, none of the major lactate fermenters (Anaerovibrio, Megasphaera, Selenomonas) was inhibited by lasalocid or monensin. Veillonella alcalescens was inhibited by 24 micrograms/ml of lasalocid but was resistant to monensin. Hence, the reported increase in propionate in lasalocid- or monensin-fed cattle may result from selection for succinate producers and lactate fermenters. Lasalocid and monensin appeared to inhibit selectively the production of L(+), but not D(-) lactic acid. The inhibition of major lactate-producing bacteria (Streptococcus and Lactobacillus) suggests that lasalocid or monensin may be used to prevent lactic acidosis in ruminants.
TI  - Effect of pH on the efficiency of growth by pure cultures of rumen bacteria in continuous culture.
AB  - A total of 10 strains of rumen bacteria, Selenomonas ruminantium HD4, Megasphaera elsdenii B159, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens A38, Streptococcus bovis JB1, Lactobacillus vitulinus GA1, Bacteroides ruminicola B14, B. ruminicola GA33, Ruminococcus albus 7, Ruminococcus flavefaciens C94, and Bacteroides succinogenes S85, were grown in energy-limiteH of the medium reservoir was lowered approximately 0.3 pH units, and the energy source concentration remaining in the culture vessel, optical density, cell mass, and pH were determined. A low pH appeared to have a detrimental effect on cell yields. Large variations were seen among strains in both the magnitude of yield depressions at lower pH values and in the pH at which the culture washed out. Lactate analysis indicated ta are discussed in relation to the effect of pH on the efficiency of protein synthesis in the rumen and rumen microbial ecology.
TI  - Effects of combinations of substrates on maximum growth rates of several rumen bacteria.
AB  - Five rumen bacteria, Selenomonas ruminantium, Bacteroides ruminicola, Megasphaera elsdenii, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and Streptococcus bovis were grown in media containing nonlimiting concentrations of glucose, sucrose, maltose, cellobiose, xylose and/or lactate. Each bacterium was grown with every substrate that it could ferment in every possible two-way combination. Only once did a combination of substrates result in a higher maximum growth rate than that observed with either substrate alone. Such stimulations of growth rate would be expected if specific factors unique to individual substrates (transport proteins and/or enzymes) were limiting. Since such synergisms were rare, it was concluded that more general factors limit maximum growth rates in these five bacteria.
TI  - Comparison of maintenance energy expenditures and growth yields among several rumen bacteria grown on continuous culture.
AB  - Maintenance energy expenditures were mesured for five rumen bacteria, Selenomonas ruminantium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Bacteroides ruminicola, Megasphaera elsdenii, and Streptococcus bovis, by using a complex medium with glucose as the carbon source. Large differences (as high as 8.5-fold) in maintenance energy expenditures were seen among these bacteria. The suggestion is made that maintenance requirements could be a significant determinant of bacterial competition in the rumen. Theoretical maximum growth yields, calculated from double reciprocal plots of yield versus dilution rate, were compared to theoretical Y(ATP) values in order to estimate minimum molar adenosine 5'-triphosphate yields from glucose for each bacterium. Results showed that relative yield among the bacteria was growth rate dependent. At high dilution rates, both S. ruminantium and S. bovis produced lactate as their principal fermentation product. At lower dilution rates very little lactate was formed and growth yields increased. Acetate and ethanol were the predominant fermentation products of S. bovis at low dilution rates. Other workers have shown that S. ruminantium produces acetate and propionate at low growth rates.
TI  - Comparison of substrate affinities among several rumen bacteria: a possible determinant of rumen bacterial competition.
AB  - Five rumen bacteria, Selenomonas ruminantium, Bacteroides ruminicola, Megasphaera elsdenii, Streptococcus bovis, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens were grown in continuous culture. Estimates of substrate affinities were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots of dilution rate versus substrate concentration. Each bacterium was grown on at least four of the six substrates: glucose, maltose, sucrose, cellobiose, xylose, and lactate. Wide variations in substrate affinities were seen among the substrates utilized by a species and among species for the same substrate. These wide differences indicate that substrate affinity may be a significant determinant of bacterial competition in the rumen where soluble substrate concentrations are often low. Growth of these bacteria in continuous culture did not always follow typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Inflated theoretical maximum growth rates and non-linear Lineweaver-Burk plots were sometimes seen. Maintenance energy expenditures and limitation of growth rate by factors other than substrate concentration (i.e., protein synthesis) are discussed as possible determinants of these deviations.
TI  - Production of branched-chain volatile fatty acids by certain anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Net production of isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, and 2-methylbutyric acid by cultures of Bacteroides ruminicola and Megasphaera elsdenii on media that contained Trypticase or casein hydrolysate continued (up to 5 days) after growth had ceased. Only trace quantities of these acids were produced in a medium that contained a mixture of amino acids that did not include the branched-chain amino acids. M. elsdenii produced increased quantities of the branched-chain fatty acids in a medium that contained Trypticase when glucose was reduced or eliminated from the culture medium. However, B. ruminicola produced increased quantities of branched-chain fatty acids and of phenylacetic acid from Trypticase when glucose was supplied at 3 mg/ml rather than at 1 mg/ml. Single strains of Streptococcus bovis, Selenomonas ruminantium, Bacteroides amylophilus, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens did not produce branched-chain fatty acids.
TI  - Effects of heavy metals and other trace elements on the fermentative activity of  the rumen microflora and growth of functionally important rumen bacteria.
AB  - The inhibitory effects of high concentrations of essential and non-essential trace elements were tested on the rumen microflora using the rate of fermentation in vitro as the assay. The elements (and the concentration causing 50% inhibition) in decreasing order of toxicity were Hg2+ (20 microgram/ml), Cu2+ (21 microgram/ml), Cr6+ (70 microgram/ml), Se4+ (73 microgram/ml), Ni2+ (160 microgram/ml), Cd2+ (175 microgram/ml), As3+ (304 microgram/ml) and As5+ (1610 microgram/ml). The elements tested that were either weak or noninhibitory at concentrations greater than 400 microgram/ml included Zn2+, Cr2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Pb2+, and Co2+. Methylmercury was as inhibitory as mercuric chloride to the fermentation. When the inhibitory effect of Cd2+ was tested on separated bacterial and protozoal fractions, it was more inhibitory to the bacteria. The inhibitory effects of trace elements were also determined for a number of axenic cultures of rumen bacteria. The bacteria which most frequently exhibited the greatest sensitivity were Bacteroides succinogenses, Ruminococcus albus, Bacteroides amylophilus, and Eubacterium ruminantium. Those often exhibiting intermediate sensitivities included Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Selenomonas ruminantium, and Megasphera elsdenii, while Streptococcus bovis was very refractory to all elements tested. Rumen fluid provided a modest protective effect for the bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of the predominant bacteria occurring in the rumen of goats (Capra hircus).
AB  - A total of 44 strains of bacteria were isolated from rumen contents of the goat.  Based on morphology, Gram stain, anaerobiosis, motility, and fermentation end products, they were grouped into 11 different types. For each type, all or representative strains were characterized in detail. The type, number of strains characterized over total number of strains, and identification were as follows: type 1, 6/21, atypical Butyrivibrio fibriosolvens; type 2, 6/9, atypical Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens; type 3, 3/3, genus uncertain; type 4, 2/2, genus uncertain; type 5, 3/3, Streptoccous bovis; type 6, 1/1, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens; type 7, 1/1, Bacteroides ruminicola subsp. ruminicola; type 8, 1/1, Bacteroides ruminicola subsp. brevis; type 9, 1/1, family Peptococcaceae, genus uncertain; type 10, 1/1, genus Bacteroides; type 11, 1/1, genus Bacteroides. About 70% of the isolated strains were classified as Butyrivibrio, which is quite high compared with previous studies in cattle on similar rations. Of the 30 strains listed as type 1 and 2, the 12 studied further were characterized as atypical Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, which differed from the species description primarily by their inability to hydrolyze starch and lack of gas production.
TI  - Enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms.
AB  - Joyner, A. E., Jr. (University of California, Davis), and R. L. Baldwin. Enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms. J. Bacteriol. 92:1321-1330. 1966.-The activities of enzymes representing the major pathways of carbohydrate metabolism and anaerobic electron transport in cell-free extracts of whole rumen contents have been reported. The effects of diet upon the activities of several enzymes suggested that enzymatic measurements might prove useful for the study of rumen metabolism. In the present study, the distribution and characteristics of aldolase, succinate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, lactyl-coenzyme A dehydrase, lactate dehydrogenase, and other enzymes were measured in cell-free extracts of pure cultures of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, R. albus, Bacteroides succinogenes, B. ruminicola, B. amylophilus, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Peptostreptococcus elsdenii, Streptococcus bovis, and Selenomonas ruminantium. Some enzymes were widely distributed (aldolase, glutamate dehydrogenase), whereas others were observed in one or two species (lactyl-coenzyme A dehydrase). The cofactor requirements and kinetic characteristics of enzymes varied considerably with species. Enzymes that vary with species might be employed as indices for estimating the activities of various groups of microorganisms in whole rumen contents.
TI  - The biohydrogenation of alpha-linolenic acid and oleic acid by rumen micro-organisms.
AB  - 1. alpha-[U-(14)C]Linolenic acid was incubated with the rumen contents of sheep and the metabolic products were characterized by thin-layer chromatography, gas-liquid chromatography and absorption spectroscopy in the ultraviolet and infrared. 2. A tentative scheme for the biohydrogenation route to stearic acid is presented. The main pathway is through diconjugated cis-cis-cis-octadecatrienoic acid, non-conjugated trans-cis (cis-trans)-octadecadienoic acid and trans-octadecenoic acid, but other pathways are apparent. 3. Washed rumen micro-organisms possessed only a limited capacity to hydrogenate alpha-linolenic acid and oleic acid but the rate was greatly stimulated by a factor(s) present in the supernatant rumen liquor. 4. Pure cultures of Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and a coliform organism isolated from sheep faeces possessed negligible ability to hydrogenate unsaturated fatty acids compared with a mixed population of rumen micro-organisms. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens slowly converted linoleic acid into octadecenoic acid.
