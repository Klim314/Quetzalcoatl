TI  == bacteroides faecis sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == two anaerobic, gram-negative, non-motile and non-spore-forming bacterial strains, designated maj27(t) and maj26, were isolated from human faeces. both isolates grew optimally at 37 degrees c, were oxidase- and catalase-negative, were sensitive to bile and produced acid from fermentation of several substrates, including glucose. a study based on 16s rrna gene sequences showed that both isolates were closely related to type strains of species of the genus bacteroides. comparisons of the isolates with bacteroides thetaiotaomicron vpi 5482(t) and bacteroides finegoldii jcm 13345(t) showed high levels of 16s rrna gene sequence similarity (98.6-98.7 and 96.9-97.0 %, respectively), but low levels of dna-dna relatedness (</=22 %). the dna g+c content (42.7+/-1 mol%) and  the major fatty acid (anteiso-c(15 : 0), 39.3-42.5 %) supported the assignment of the isolates to the genus bacteroides. based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, genotypic and phylogenetic studies, we propose that strains maj27(t) and maj26 be classified as representing a novel species, bacteroides faecis sp. nov. the type  strain is maj27(t) (=kctc 5823(t)=jcm 16478(t)).

TI  == bacteroides xylanisolvens sp. nov., a xylan-degrading bacterium isolated from human faeces.
AB  == during the course of a study on the xylan-degrading community from the human gut, six xylanolytic, gram-negative, anaerobic rods were isolated from faecal samples. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that the isolates were closely related to  each other (> or =99 % sequence similarity) and that they belonged to the genus bacteroides. on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, representative strain xb1at was most closely related to the type strains of bacteroides ovatus (97.5 %), b. finegoldii (96.5 %) and b. thetaiotaomicron (95.5 %). dna-dna hybridization results revealed that strain xb1at was distinct from its closest relative, b. ovatus. the dna g+c content of strain xb1at (42.8 mol%) and major fatty acid composition (anteiso-c15 : 0, 33.8 %) further supported its affiliation to the genus bacteroides. the novel isolates degraded different types of xylan, and were also able to grow on a variety of carbohydrates. unlike most other bacteroides species isolated from the human gut, these isolates were not able to degrade starch. other biochemical tests further demonstrated that strain  xb1at could be differentiated from the closest related bacteroides species. xylan and sugars were converted by strain xb1at mainly into acetate, propionate and succinate. based on physiological, phenotypic and phylogenetic data, the six novel strains are considered to represent a novel species of the genus bacteroides, for which the name bacteroides xylanisolvens sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is xb1at (=dsm 18836t =ccug 53782t).

TI  == bacteroides finegoldii sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == two strains, 199t and 176, of gram-negative, anaerobic, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacteria were isolated during studies of microbiota in human faeces using polyamine-deficient medium. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna  gene sequences revealed that the isolated strains belonged to the genus bacteroides. the g+c content (42.4-43.0 mol%) and major fatty acid composition (anteiso-c15:0, 31.8-36.2 %) supported the affiliation of the two strains to the  genus bacteroides. 16s rrna gene sequence similarities with their closest neighbours, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and bacteroides ovatus, ranged from 94.6 to 96.5 %. dna-dna hybridization and phenotypic analysis showed that the two strains belonged to the same species (dna-dna relatedness of 89 %) and were distinct from their close relatives, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. ovatus (<23 % dna-dna relatedness). on the basis of these data, a novel species of the genus bacteroides, bacteroides finegoldii sp. nov., is proposed, comprising the designated type strain 199t (=jcm 13345t=dsm 17565t) and strain 176 (=jcm 13346).

TI  == reclassification of bacteroides putredinis (weinberg et al., 1937) in a new genus alistipes gen. nov., as alistipes putredinis comb. nov., and description of alistipes finegoldii sp. nov., from human sources.
AB  == during studies on the bacteriology of appendicitis in children, we often isolated from inflamed and non-inflamed tissue samples, an unusual bile-resistant pigment-producing strictly anaerobic gram-negative rod. phenotypically this organism resembles members of bacteroides fragilis group of species, as it is resistant to bile and exhibits a special-potency-disk pattern (resistance to vancomycin, kanamycin and colistin) typical for the b. fragilis group. however, the production of brown pigment on media containing haemolysed blood and a cellular fatty acid composition dominated by iso-c15:0, suggests that the organism most closely resembles species of the genus porphyromonas. however, the  unidentified organism differs from porphyromonads by being bile-resistant and by  not producing butyrate as a metabolic end-product. comparative 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequencing studies show the unidentified organism represents a distinct sub-line, associated with but distinct from, the miss-classified species bacteroides putredinis. the clustering of the unidentified bacterium with bacteroides putredinis was statistically significant, but they displayed > 4% sequence divergence with each other. chromosomal dna-dna pairing studies further  confirmed the separateness of the unidentified bacterium and bacteroides putredinis. based on phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, it is proposed that bacteroides putredinis and the unidentified bacterium from human sources be  classified in a new genus alistipes, as alistipes putredinis comb. nov. and alistipes finegoldii sp. nov., respectively. the type strain of alistipes finegoldii is ccug 46020(t) (= ahn243(t)).
