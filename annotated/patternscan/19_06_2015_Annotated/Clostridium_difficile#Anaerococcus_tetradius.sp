TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of levornidazole, its metabolites and comparators against clinical anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == this study evaluated the in vitro anti-anaerobic activity and spectrum of levornidazole, its metabolites and comparators against 375 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria, including gram-negative bacilli (181 strains), gram-negative  cocci (11 strains), gram-positive bacilli (139 strains) and gram-positive cocci (44 strains), covering 34 species. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levornidazole, its five metabolites and three comparators against these anaerobic isolates were determined by the agar dilution method. minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of levornidazole and metronidazole were measured against 22 strains of bacteroides fragilis. levornidazole showed good activity against b. fragilis, other bacteroides spp., clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens  and peptostreptococcus magnus, evidenced by mic90 values of 0.5, 1, 0.25, 2 and 1mg/l, respectively. the activity of levornidazole and the comparators was poor for veillonella spp. generally, levornidazole displayed activity similar to or slightly higher than that of metronidazole, ornidazole and dextrornidazole against anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive bacilli and gram-positive  cocci, especially b. fragilis. favourable anti-anaerobic activity was also seen with levornidazole metabolites m1 and m4 but not m2, m3 or m5. for the 22 clinical b. fragilis strains, mbc50 and mbc90 values of levornidazole were 2mg/l  and 4mg/l, respectively. both mbc50/mic50 and mbc90/mic90 ratios of levornidazole were 4, similar to those of metronidazole. levornidazole is an important anti-anaerobic option in clinical settings in terms of its potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity, bactericidal property, and the anti-anaerobic activity of its metabolites m1 and m4.

TI  == essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of angelica archangelica l.  (apiaceae) roots.
AB  == in this paper, the chemical composition and the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of angelica archangelica l. (apiaceae) roots from central italy were analyzed. the major constituents of the oil were alpha-pinene (21.3%), delta-3-carene (16.5%), limonene (16.4%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.7%). the oil shows a good antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, eubacterium limosum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of 0.25, 0.25, 0.13, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50% v/v, respectively. a weaker antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli-very useful in the intestinal microflora-has also been shown with mic values >4.0% v/v.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of aerial parts and ripe fruits of echinophora spinosa (apiaceae) from italy.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils obtained from the flowering aerial parts and ripe fruits of echinophora spinosa l. (apiaceae) from central italy were analyzed by gc/ms. the major constituents of the oil from the aerial parts were beta-phellandrene (34.7%), myristicin (16.5%), delta3-carene (12.6%), alpha-pinene (6.7%) and alpha-phellandrene (6.2%), and of the oil from the ripe fruits p-cymene (50.2%), myristicin (15.3%), alpha-pinene (15.1%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.1%). the two oils showed good antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, eubacterium limosum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and candida albicans with mic values respectively of 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50%, v/v, and 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 2.25, 0.50%, v/v, for aerial parts and ripe fruits respectively. a less significant antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, very important in the intestinal microflora, was also detected, with mic values higher than 4.0%, v/v.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of dysbiosis in ulcerative colitis during remission.
AB  == background: presence of intestinal microbes is a prerequisite for the development of ulcerative colitis (uc), although deviation of the normal intestinal microbiota composition, dysbiosis, is presumably implicated in the etiology of uc. methods: the fecal microbiota of 30 uc samples obtained from 15 patients who  were sampled twice and from 15 healthy control subjects originating from 2 geographic locations was analyzed using highly reproducible phylogenetic microarray that has the capacity for detection and quantification of more than 1000 intestinal bacteria in a wide dynamic range. results: the fecal microbiota composition is not significantly influenced by geographic location, age, or gender, but it differs significantly between the patients with uc and the control subjects (p = 0.0004). uc-associated microbiota is stable during remission and similar among all patients with uc. significant reduction of bacterial diversity  of members of the clostridium cluster iv and significant reduction in the abundance of bacteria involved in butyrate and propionate metabolism, including ruminococcus bromii et rel. eubacterium rectale et rel., roseburia sp., and akkermansia sp. are markers of dysbiosis in uc. increased abundance of (opportunistic) pathogens including fusobacterium sp., peptostreptococcus sp., helicobacter sp., and campylobacter sp. as well as clostridium difficile were found to be associated with uc. conclusions: dysbiosis in uc is stable in time and shared between patients from different geographic locations. the microbial alterations offer a mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of the disease.

TI  == activity of a novel cyclic lipopeptide, cb-183,315, against resistant clostridium difficile and other gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic intestinal pathogens.
AB  == we evaluated the activity of cb-183,315 against clostridium difficile, including  strains that are resistant to fluoroquinolones and metronidazole and with elevated mics to vancomycin as well as other gram-positive intestinal pathogens.  the mics of cb-183,315 against all c. difficile isolates were </= 1 mug/ml. cb-183,315 had greater activity than vancomycin and metronidazole against c. difficile isolates and was more active than the comparators against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre). cb-183,315 also had excellent activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), other clostridium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against a european compilation of anaerobes collected as part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test).
AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) is a global surveillance study designed to monitor the in vitro activity of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial tigecycline against nosocomial- and community-acquired pathogens. in this study the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 1256 anaerobic pathogens collected across europe has been compared to the activity of several comparator antibiotics. the pathogens examined in this study included bacteroides, prevotella, anaerococcus, clostridium, finegoldia and peptostreptococcus. low minimum inhibitory concentration (mic(90)) values were noted against gram-positive anaerobes for most agents on the test panel, with the exceptions of cefoxitin and clindamycin. low mic(90)s were also reported against  gram-negative isolates for most agents, with the exceptions of clindamycin and, to a lesser degree, piperacillin-tazobactam. the lowest mic(90)s against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms were typically noted for the carbapenem meropenem and tigecycline. tigecycline showed the lowest mic(90) against the key  pathogen clostridium difficile (0.25 mg/l). these in vitro results indicate that  tigecycline may be useful in the treatment of infections caused by or involving anaerobic pathogens.

TI  == surveillance and trends of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates of anaerobes in kuwait hospitals from 2002 to 2007.
AB  == the susceptibility trends for all anaerobes processed by the anaerobe reference laboratory against various antibiotics were determined by using data for 2557 isolates referred by all government hospitals in kuwait from 2002 to 2007. mic were determined for the following anti-anaerobic antibiotics: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin, imipenem, meropenem, metronidazole, penicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin (for gram-positive anaerobes only), using e-test method. the commonest isolates were bacteroides fragilis (36.8%), followed by peptostreptococcus spp. (21.9%), bacteroides ovatus (15.5%) and prevotella bivia (12.1%). in addition, prevotella  oralis and other bacteroides spp. represented 8.5% and 8.1% of total number of isolates, respectively. resistance rate varied among the antimicrobial agents and the species tested. the beta-lactams, with the exception of penicillin, were the  most active drugs. piperacillin-tazobactam was the only antimicrobial agent to which all the isolates were uniformly susceptible. imipenem and metronidazole were highly active with resistance rate of only <5% recorded against most isolates. however, 42.8, 55.8 and 9.3% of clostridium difficile isolates were resistant to imipenem, clindamycin and meropenem, respectively. it is noteworthy  that from 2002 to 2007, there was a gradual increase in resistance rates to clindamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin among b. fragilis. periodic surveillance of antibiotic resistance among the anaerobic bacteria is recommended as a guide to empiric antibiotic use and formulation of guideline for appropriate choice of antimicrobial therapy in anaerobic infections.

TI  == [relationship between clostridium difficile associated diarrhea and intestinal microecosystem disorder in patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation].
AB  == this study was to investigate the relationship between clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (cdad) and intestinal microecosystem in patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-hsct) and to clarify clinical characteristics of intestinal microecosystem disorder. clostridium difficile (cd) was isolated and identified by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay using clostridium difficile premier toxins a&b kit and anaerobic culture in 44 cases with diarrhea. fecal flora (bifidobacteria, lactobacillus, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, and yeasts) of patients were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed by mitsuoka's methods. the results showed that cdad occurred after using antibiotic  or chemotherapy. clostridium difficile was detected in 12 patients with diarrhea  (positive rate was 27.27%). there was marked changes of intestinal microecosystem when patients suffered from cdad. the number of lactobacillus, bifidobacteria, bacteroides, enterobacteriaceae and so on decreased significantly. it was effective to treat cdad with vancomycin, metronidazole and probiotic, but the recurrence rate was 16.67%. in conclusion, cdad complicated by allo-hsct is related to change of intestinal microecosystem. while treating cdad with the sensitive antibiotic, the intestinal flora of patients should be supported actively. this treatment contributes to improving disease status and reducing diarrhea recurrence.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of dc-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == dc-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. dc-159a showed activity against streptococcus spp. (mic(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. the mic 90s of dc-159a against staphylococcus  spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the mic 90 of dc-159a was 8 microg/ml. dc-159a was the most active against enterococcus spp. (mic 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml)  and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of dc-159a against mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. the mics of dc-159a against chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and dc-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against peptostreptococcus spp., clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. dc-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, dc-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. the bactericidal activity of dc-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. these activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with dc-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.

TI  == antianaerobe activity of ceftobiprole, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == agar dilution testing of 463 anaerobes showed most gram-positive beta-lactamase-negative strains (other than some clostridium difficile and peptostreptococcus anaerobius), as well as both beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains of fusobacterium nucleatum, to have ceftobiprole  mic values of < or =0.016 to 4 microg/ml. ceftobiprole was less active against beta-lactamase-positive gram-negative bacilli, especially the members of the bacteroides fragilis group. like ceftobiprole, piperacillin was active mainly against beta-lactamase-negative strains, though mic values for piperacillin were  often 1 to 2 dilutions higher than for ceftobiprole. carbapenems had mic values < or =4 microg/l against all except some c. difficile and 2 strains of b. fragilis. all strains were susceptible to metronidazole, and all bacteria, except c. difficile and a single bacteroides distasonis strain, were susceptible to chloramphenicol. clindamycin resistance was seen in most anaerobe groups, whereas high moxifloxacin mics were found mainly among the b. fragilis and prevotella groups, and a few c. difficile and f. nucleatum strains.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid and eperezolid, two novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid (formerly u-100766) and eperezolid (formerly u-100592) are novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents that are active against multi-drug-resistant staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, corynebacteria, and mycobacteria. preliminary studies also demonstrated that the compounds inhibited some test strains of anaerobic bacteria. therefore, we extended the in vitro evaluation of  these agents to include a total of 54 different anaerobic species. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values were determined using a standard agar dilution method for 143 anaerobic bacterial isolates. eperezolid and linezolid demonstrated potent activity against the anaerobic gram-positive organisms with most mic values in the range of 0.25-4 microg/ml. viridans streptococci demonstrated mics of 1-2 microg/ml; peptostreptococcus species and propionibacterium species were inhibited by </=0.25-1 microg/ml. clostridial species were generally susceptible to the oxazolidinones (mics of </=0.25-8 microg/ml); however, seven strains of clostridium difficile with linezolid mics of 16 microg/ml or greater were detected. against the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, linezolid was more potent than eperezolid, especially for bacteroides  species. linezolid inhibited most bacteroides in the range of 2-8 microg/ml, while eperezolid was generally two- to eight-fold less active. linezolid and eperezolid both demonstrated potent activity against fusobacterium species,mobiluncus species,prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas asaccharolytica (mics of </=0.25-0.5 microg/ml). overall, the oxazolidinones demonstrated a significant level of activity against a number of clinically-important anaerobic bacterial species. linezolid may potentially provide a broader spectrum of anaerobic coverage than eperezolid due to its greater activity against bacteroides species.

TI  == [role of obligate anaerobes in infections in hospitalized patients and therapeutic options].
AB  == monitoring of prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of strictly anaerobic bacteria, causing infections in hospitalized patients, constitutes a part of a program for prudent use of antibiotics. the aim of the study was to assess prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in patients hospitalized in a tertiary  care hospital in 2001-2002 with reference to empiric antibiotic therapy. the most common gram-positive bacteria were clostridium difficile--27.7%, peptostreptococcus spp. and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus--21.9% and actinomyces spp.--11.1%. there was an increase in the number of stool samples positive for c. difficile toxins a and b from 39.4% in 2001 to 59.0% in 2002. the results of susceptibility testing of gram-positive isolates showed the highest percentages of strains susceptible to piperacilin/tazobactam--99.6%, ticarcillin/clavulanate--98.5%, imipenem--98.5%, amoxicillin/clavulanate--97.4% and piperacillin--97.4%. the most prevalent gram-negative anaerobes were strains  of bacteroides spp.--43.1%, prevotella spp.--35.8% and fusobacterium spp.--11.0%. all tested strains of gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to metronidazole, piperacilin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem. in the analyzed population beta-lactam antibiotics with beta-lactamase inhibitors, carbapenems and metronidazole may be used in empiric therapy of infections caused by strictly anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activities of the new semisynthetic glycopeptide telavancin (td-6424), vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and four comparator agents against anaerobic gram-positive species and corynebacterium spp.
AB  == telavancin is a new semisynthetic glycopeptide anti-infective with multiple mechanisms of action, including inhibition of bacterial membrane phospholipid synthesis and inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. we determined the in vitro activities of telavancin, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ampicillin against 268 clinical isolates of anaerobic gram-positive organisms and 31 corynebacterium strains using agar dilution methods according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards procedures. plates with daptomycin were supplemented with ca(2+) to 50 mg/liter. the mics at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited (mic(90)s) for telavancin and vancomycin were as follows: actinomyces spp. (n = 45), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium difficile (n = 14), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium ramosum (n =  16), 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium innocuum (n = 15), 4 and 16 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium clostridioforme (n = 15), 8 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; eubacterium group (n = 33), 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; lactobacillus spp. (n = 26), 0.5 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; propionibacterium spp. (n = 34), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; peptostreptococcus spp. (n  = 52), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; and corynebacterium spp. (n = 31),  0.03 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of td-6424 was similar to that of quinupristin-dalfopristin for most strains except c. clostridioforme and lactobacillus casei, where quinupristin-dalfopristin was three- to fivefold more  active. daptomycin had decreased activity (mic > 4 microg/ml) against 14 strains  of actinomyces spp. and all c. ramosum, eubacterium lentum, and lactobacillus plantarum strains. linezolid showed decreased activity (mic > 4 microg/ml) against c. ramosum, two strains of c. difficile, and 15 strains of lactobacillus  spp. imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were active against >98% of strains. the mics of ampicillin for eight clostridium spp. and three strains of l. casei were >1 microg/ml. the mic(90) of td-6424 for all strains tested was </=2 microg/ml. td-6424 has potential for use against infections with gram-positive anaerobes and deserves further clinical evaluation.

TI  == phospholipid analogue profiles of peptostreptococcus, micromonas, and finegoldia  species analysed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.
AB  == species of peptostreptococcus cause a variety of infections, primarily abscesses  of soft tissues, joints, and mucous membranes. the aim of this study was to compare the phospholipid analogue profiles of peptostreptococcus species, represented by p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. indolicus, p. lacrimalis, and p. prevotii; micromonas micros (p. micros) and finegoldia magna (p. magnus).  after anaerobic growth on blood-faa, lipids extracted by chloroform-methanol (2:1 v/v) were purified, then analysed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (fab-ms) in negative ion mode. the major peaks with mass to charge (m/z) 719, 721, and 749, corresponded to phosphatidylglycerol analogues, namely pg (32:1), pg (32:0), and pg (34:0), which have been found previously in lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and staphylococcus spp. other major peaks observed, with m/z 619, 647, 665, 675, 677, 687, 691, 693, 701, 703, 707, 733, and 746 have also been reported in one or more of these three species. however, other major peaks found here in peptostreptococcus, micromonas, and finegoldia have not been described elsewhere; these are 501, 514, 515, 618, 659, 673, 676, 688, 690, 692,  694, 700, 706, 715, 718, 722, and 750. we conclude that peptostreptococcus, micromonas, and finegoldia isolates are chemically unique.

TI  == in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, bacitracin, and four other antimicrobials against intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == by using an agar dilution method, the in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, and five other agents were determined against 300 gram-positive and 54 gram-negative strains of intestinal anaerobes. ramoplanin was active at <or=2 microg/ml against 287 of 300 (95.7%) gram-positive organisms, including 18 strains of clostridium difficile for which mics of ramoplanin were 0.25 to 0.5 microg/ml; for 3 of these, linezolid mics were 8 to 16 micro g/ml. nineteen clostridium innocuum strains for which the vancomycin mic at which 90% of strains were inhibited was 16 microg/ml were susceptible to ramoplanin at 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml and to teicoplanin at 0.125 to 1.0 microg/ml. all strains of eubacterium, actinomyces, propionibacterium, and peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited by <or=0.25 microg of ramoplanin per ml and <or=1 microg of vancomycin per ml. ramoplanin was also active at <or=4 microg/ml against 15 of 22 of the prevotella and porphyromonas strains tested, but ramoplanin mics for all 31 strains of the bacteroides fragilis group, the fusobacterium mortiferum-fusobacterium varium group, and veillonella spp. were >or=256 microg/ml. ramoplanin displays excellent activity against c. difficile and other gram-positive enteric anaerobes, including vancomycin-resistant strains; however, it has poor activity against most gram-negative anaerobes and thus potentially has a lesser effect on the ecological balance of normal fecal flora.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ph-027 versus linezolid and other anti-anaerobic antimicrobials against clinical isolates of clostridium difficile and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == ph-027 is a new 5-triazole oxazolidinone synthesized in our laboratories, which shows strong activity against gram-positive aerobic bacteria including clinical isolates. the objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro activity of this compound in comparison with linezolid and other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes. the in vitro activity of ph-027 in comparison with those of linezolid and other antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 201 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria by agar dilution and etest methods. ph-027 showed excellent activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) in the range of 0.12-4.0 microg/ml against all isolates; mic90s being 4.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0 and 2.0 microg/ml against clostridium difficile, peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis, prevotella  bivia and fusobacterium spp. respectively. in comparison, linezolid had mic in the range of 0.5-4.0 microg/ml against all isolates, with mic90s of 2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0 and 2.0 microg/ml against the same set of bacteria respectively. ph-027  demonstrated excellent in vitro activity that is superior to linezolid against peptostreptococcus spp., b. fragilis and p. bivia. however, against c. difficile  and fusobacterium spp, ph-027 and linezolid showed comparable in vitro activity.  against all anaerobes, metronidazole, ph-027 and, to a lesser extent, linezolid had the most potent activity. from the results of in vitro susceptibility testing, both linezolid and ph-027 show promise in the treatment of anaerobic infections.

TI  == linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

TI  == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora  of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing  depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

TI  == a risk-benefit assessment of teicoplanin in the treatment of infections.
AB  == teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic whose activity is selectively oriented against gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, clostridium difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and corynebacterium jeikeium; such activity is affected by neither methicillin resistance nor beta-lactamase production. teicoplanin is not significantly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; consequently, it has  to be administered intravenously (either by infusion or by rapid injection) or intramuscularly. its long half-life allows regimens based upon once daily administration. the adverse effects most frequently associated with teicoplanin treatment are local and hypersensitivity reactions, such as itching and drug fever; anaphylactoid reactions (the 'red man syndrome') are seldom observed. teicoplanin also has less potential than vancomycin to cause nephrotoxicity, especially when administered in combination with an aminoglycoside. teicoplanin has been proven to be effective in the treatment of microbiologically documented  gram-positive infections, including 'difficult to treat infections' such as endocarditis and prosthetic infections. furthermore, recent trials in patients with haematological malignancies or other cancers have clearly demonstrated that  teicoplanin is at least as efficacious as vancomycin in the empirical initial antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients, and is associated with fewer adverse effects. finally, owing to its good tolerability profile and the advantage of once daily administration by both intravenous and intramuscular routes, teicoplanin has proven to be very useful for the outpatient treatment of  serious gram-positive infections. in conclusion, teicoplanin is potentially an effective alternative to vancomycin both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, with the advantage over vancomycin of single daily dose administration  and lower toxicity. further comparative studies with vancomycin are, however, required to better define the therapeutic role of teicoplanin for particular infections (i.e. infective endocarditis).

TI  == anaerobic bacteria and bacterial infections: perspectives on treatment and resistance in italy.
AB  == results of laboratory tests of 2,000 samples obtained from 1984 to 1987 from patients with suspected anaerobic infections and the clinical experience of these patients are reported. of these samples, 395 were positive for anaerobes; 36.5% of these 395 samples contained single organisms, and 63.5% contained a mixture of anaerobes and aerobes. abdominal infections were the infections most frequently caused by anaerobes. the bacteroides fragilis group and strains of peptostreptococcus were the microorganisms most frequently isolated. in addition, 300 anaerobes isolated from clinical samples at three italian hospitals were tested for susceptibility to 10 antibiotics (aztreonam, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole, penicillin, and piperacillin). imipenem and metronidazole proved to be the most active agents, with low and similar values for the 50% and 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). no microorganism showed resistance to these agents. after imipenem and metronidazole, clindamycin was the most effective agent tested. all other antibiotics tested showed elevated mics against bacteroides species and clostridium difficile. in italy, cefoxitin still maintains satisfactory activity  against the majority of anaerobes tested.

TI  == bacteriotherapy for chronic relapsing clostridium difficile diarrhoea in six patients.
AB  == six patients with chronic relapsing diarrhoea caused by clostridium difficile were treated with rectal instillation of homologous faeces (one patient) or a mixture of ten different facultatively aerobic and anaerobic bacteria diluted in  sterile saline (five patients). the mixture led to a prompt loss of cl difficile  and its toxin from the stools and to bowel colonisation by bacteroides sp, which  had not been present in pre-treatment stool samples. strains of escherichia coli, cl bifermentans, and peptostreptococcus productus in the mixture inhibited the in-vitro growth of cl difficile, which in turn inhibited the growth of bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides vulgatus, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. the finding that bacteroides sp had been absent during the patients' illness but was  present after recovery suggests that the absence of bacteroides sp may result in  chronic relapsing cl difficile diarrhoea, and that its presence may prevent colonisation by cl difficile.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

TI  == characterization of cross-reactive proteins detected by culturette brand rapid latex test for clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium sporogenes, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides asaccharolyticus have been reported to react in the culturette brand rapid latex  test (marion scientific, div. marion laboratories, inc., kansas city, mo.) for clostridium difficile. from the results of this study we showed that c. sporogenes and p. anaerobius produce a protein which is very similar biochemically and immunologically to the protein of c. difficile that is detected by the test. thus, the positive latex reactions observed with c. sporogenes and p. anaerobius are due to a cross-reactive protein. we did not detect this cross-reactive protein in filtrates from b. asaccharolyticus, indicating that this bacterium reacts with the latex reagent by some other mechanism. we cloned the c. difficile gene that codes for the cross-reactive protein and showed that the protein produced by the recombinant organism is nontoxic and distinct from toxin a, thus confirming our earlier findings.

AB  == freshly compared cell suspensions of clostridia (clostridium bifermentans, c. botulinum proteolytic type a, c. difficile, c. sordellii, and c. sporogenes) and  peptostreptococcus anaerobius converted leucine to isovaleric (iv) and isocaproic (ic) acids in the absence of other amino acids. the optimal ph for conversion was between 8 and 9 at 37 degrees c. the stoichiometry of reaction was compatible with that expected for the stickland reaction, as the ratio of iv to ic was 1:2,  the amount of co2 produced was equivalent to that of iv, and ammonium ion concentrations were equal to the total c5 and c6 acids formed. the presence of alanine and valine (proton donors in the stickland reaction) in incubations effectively increased the concentration of ic at the expense of iv production, implying that leucine acted there primarily as a proton acceptor. glycine and proline (proton acceptors) stimulated both iv and ic production from leucine, but increases in iv concentrations were proportionately greater than for ic so that leucine was primarily a proton donor in the presence of proton acceptors. glucose stimulated the conversion of leucine to volatile fatty acids but favoured ic production. production of ic from leucine was inhibited by surface active compounds (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and desoxycholate) as well as arsenite  and iodoacetate. the redox dyes methyl viologen and phenosafranine inhibited ic production more severely than iv production, as did the nitroimidazole antimicrobial agent, metronidazole.
