anti-infective activities of lactobacillus strains in the human intestinal microbiota: from probiotics to gastrointestinal anti-infectious biotherapeutic agents.
a vast and diverse array of microbial species displaying great phylogenic, genomic, and metabolic diversity have colonized the gastrointestinal tract. resident microbes play a beneficial role by regulating the intestinal immune system, stimulating the maturation of host tissues, and playing a variety of roles in nutrition and in host resistance to gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens. the mechanisms by which the resident microbial species combat gastrointestinal pathogens are complex and include competitive metabolic interactions and the production of antimicrobial molecules. the human intestinal microbiota is a source from which lactobacillus probiotic strains have often been isolated. only six probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, i.e., l. rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, l. johnsonii ncc 533, l. acidophilus lb, and l. reuteri dsm 17938, have been well characterized with regard to their potential antimicrobial effects against the major gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens and rotavirus. in this review, we describe the current knowledge concerning the experimental antibacterial activities, including antibiotic-like and cell-regulating activities, and therapeutic effects demonstrated in well-conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of these probiotic lactobacillus strains. what is known about the antimicrobial activities supported by the molecules secreted by such probiotic lactobacillus strains suggests that they constitute a promising new source for the development of innovative anti-infectious agents that act luminally and intracellularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
dying in yoghurt: the number of living bacteria in probiotic yoghurt decreases under exposure to room temperature.
background/aims: while probiotic bacteria are successfully used in the treatment  of ulcerative colitis, the effect of commercially available probiotic products is still controversial. here, we study whether the number of living probiotic bacteria in yoghurts is altered by an interruption of the cold chain. methods: three commonly available probiotic yoghurts were kept at 4 degrees c or put at room temperature (rt) for 6 h or 24 h. an aliquot of each yoghurt was applied on man-rogosa-sharpe agar and incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 h. colony forming units (cfu) were counted by microscopy. results: the first yoghurt, containing lactobacillus johnsonii, showed a significant decrease in cfu after 6 h of storage at rt, which was further pronounced after 24 h. the number of cfu of the second yoghurt, containing lactobacillus gg, was also decreased after 6 h and further diminished after 24 h at rt. from the third yoghurt, containing lactobacillus acidophilus, only 53.8% of the cfu remained after 6 h at rt; after 24 h, only about one fourth of the cfu were found. conclusions: our data demonstrate that the number of living probiotic bacteria in yoghurt products decreases dramatically after exposure to rt. this represents an important information for consumers of such products.
alteration of the ileal microbiota of weanling piglets by the growth-promoting antibiotic chlortetracycline.
antibiotics such as chlortetracycline (ctc) have been used to promote growth of pigs for decades, but concerns over increased antibiotic-resistant infections in humans have prompted the development of alternative strategies. developing alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters (agps) could be informed by information on the mechanisms of growth promotion, notably, how agps affect the microbial populations of the gastrointestinal tract. pigs from three sows were aseptically delivered by cesarean section. six piglets were distributed to each of two foster mothers until weaning, when piglets were fed a diet with or without 50 mg/kg ctc for 2 weeks. the ileal bacterial microbiota was characterized by using a cultivation-independent approach based on dna extraction, pcr amplification, cloning, and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene pool. the ileal and mucosal communities of these growing pigs were dominated by lactobacillus bacteria, various members of the family clostridiaceae, and members of the poorly known genus turicibacter. overall, ctc treatment resulted in three shifts: a decrease in lactobacillus johnsonii, an increase in l. amylovorus, and a decrease in turicibacter phylotypes. the composition of the microbiota varied considerably between individual pigs, as revealed by shared operational taxonomic units (otus) and similarity (sons) analysis (theta(yc) values). while the observed variation between untreated pigs obscured the possible effect of ctc, integral-libshuff and sons analyses of pooled libraries indicated a significant shift due to ctc in both the lumen and the mucosa, with some otus unique to either treated or control ileum. dotur analysis revealed little overlap between control and treated communities at the 3% difference level, indicating unique ileal communities in the presence of ctc.
characterization of the amylovorin locus of lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471, producer of a bacteriocin active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, in combination with colistin and pyocins.
lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 produces amylovorin l, a bacteriocin with an antibacterial activity against some strains of the lactobacillus lineage. based on the sequence of one active peptide, a gene encoding active amylovorin l was cloned and sequenced. genome walking allowed us to sequence a larger fragment of 7577 bp of genomic dna, with 12 predicted orfs. the previously characterized amylovorin l peptide-encoding gene is preceded by another gene encoding a small polypeptide with a typical bacteriocin-processing double-glycine site, suggesting that amylovorin l is a two-component class iib bacteriocin (amylovorin lalpha/beta). lalpha and lbeta show the highest similarity to gassericin t from lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 and blpn from streptococcus pneumoniae r6, respectively, and to lafa and lafx, which form the lactacin f bacteriocin of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533. as for other lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins, amylovorin l showed no activity against the gram-negative opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa on its own, but showed synergistic inhibitory activity when used in combination with the peptide antibiotic colistin, and, remarkably, with the p. aeruginosa soluble bacteriocins, pyocins s1 and s2.
identification of lactobacilli isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens and characterization for potential use as probiotics to control salmonella enteritidis.
aims: to select lactobacillus strains from laying hens for potential use as probiotic to control salmonella enteritidis infection. methods and results: one hundred and eighty-six lactobacilli were isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens, and identified at the species level by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. all isolates belonged to the lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri or lactobacillus salivarius phylogenetic groups, with the l. reuteri group being the most predominant group. based on genetic diversity, about 50 representative strains were selected and tested for in vitro properties that could be predictive for probiotic activity in laying hens. salmonella inhibition was shown to be species dependent, and correlated to some extent with the production of lactic acid. a selection of strains was evaluated in a s. enteritidis challenge experiment. two strains, l. reuteri r-17485 and lactobacillus johnsonii r-17504 significantly decreased the colonization of chicks by s. enteritidis in caeca, liver and spleen. conclusions: lactobacilli isolated from laying hens were observed to inhibit salmonella growth in vitro, most probably through production of lactic acid, and to decrease in vivo the s. enteritidis colonization of chicks. significance and impact of the study: the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from laying hens may have probiotic potential in reducing s. enteritidis infection.
kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds.
six lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1, l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and l. rhamnosus gg) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344. all lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. by studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and ph control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. the antibacterial activity of l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus gg was solely due to the production of lactic acid. the antibacterial activity of l. johnsonii la1 and l. plantarum aca-dc 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). the latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. in addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of salmonella into caco-2/tc7 cells.
antimicrobial potential of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
antibacterial activity is an important characteristic of probiotics. a possible way to achieve this antibacterial activity is through the production of bacteriocins. this study shows that the commercial probiotic strains lactobacillus johnsonii la1 and lactobacillus casei yit 9029 produce bacteriocins. the nature of the antimicrobial compound could be derived from its behaviour: a narrow inhibitory spectrum (only active against closely related strains), loss of activity when treated with proteinases, and rather small molecular masses (around 6000 da or less). further, three bacteriocins produced by lb. johnsonii la1, lb. casei yit 9029 and lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 showed inhibitory activity against the human gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori. however, a fourth bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus ibb 801 was not able to inhibit h. pylori. this indicates that some bacteriocins produced by specific probiotic strains can fulfil a role in the inhibition of this common pathogen.
the genome sequence of the probiotic intestinal bacterium lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533.
lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533 is a member of the acidophilus group of intestinal lactobacilli that has been extensively studied for their "probiotic" activities that include, pathogen inhibition, epithelial cell attachment, and immunomodulation. to gain insight into its physiology and identify genes potentially involved in interactions with the host, we sequenced and analyzed the 1.99-mb genome of l. johnsonii ncc 533. strikingly, the organism completely lacked genes encoding biosynthetic pathways for amino acids, purine nucleotides, and most cofactors. in apparent compensation, a remarkable number of uncommon and often duplicated amino acid permeases, peptidases, and phosphotransferase-type transporters were discovered, suggesting a strong dependency of ncc 533 on the host or other intestinal microbes to provide simple monomeric nutrients. genome analysis also predicted an abundance (>12) of large and unusual cell-surface proteins, including fimbrial subunits, which may be involved in adhesion to glycoproteins or other components of mucin, a characteristic expected to affect persistence in the gastrointestinal tract (git). three bile salt hydrolases and two bile acid transporters, proteins apparently critical for git survival, were also detected. in silico genome comparisons with the >95% complete genome sequence of the closely related lactobacillus gasseri revealed extensive synteny punctuated by clear-cut insertions or deletions of single genes or operons. many of these regions of difference appear to encode metabolic or structural components that could affect the organisms competitiveness or interactions with the git ecosystem.
characterization and production of amylovorin l471, a bacteriocin purified from lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 by a novel three-step method.
the strongly hydrophobic bacteriocin amylovorin l471 from lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 was isolated and purified to homogeneity from complex culture broth by a novel, rapid and simple three-step protocol including (i) ammonium sulphate precipitation, (ii) chloroform/methanol extraction/precipitation and (iii) reversed-phase hplc, the only chromatographic step involved. the molecular mass of the peptide was determined to be 4876.9 da by electrospray mass spectrometric analysis. n-terminal amino acid sequencing identified 35 amino acid residues as being identical to the n-terminal sequence of lactobin a, a bacteriocin from another l. amylovorus strain. these non-identical strains produce bacteriocins that display small differences in molecular mass and inhibitory spectrum. the amino acid sequence of amylovorin l471 shared significant homology with lactacin x, one of the two bactericidal peptides produced by lactobacillus johnsonii vpi11088. a purified amylovorin l471 preparation permitted confirmation of the inhibitory spectrum previously established with a crude extract. it displayed a bactericidal mode of action on lactobacilli after an extremely rapid adsorption to the target cells. two listeria spp. were only weakly sensitive. amylovorin l471 appears to be produced constitutively. ethanol not only stimulated specific bacteriocin production but also prevented adsorption of the bacteriocin molecules to the producer cells upon prolonged fermentation. the latter result supports the hypothesis that the apparent inactivation of bacteriocin observed during the stationary phase of batch fermentations is due to adsorption.
cell surface-associated lipoteichoic acid acts as an adhesion factor for attachment of lactobacillus johnsonii la1 to human enterocyte-like caco-2 cells.
the influence of ph on the adhesion of two lactobacillus strains to caco-2 human  intestinal cells was investigated. one strain, lactobacillus johnsonii la1, was adherent at any ph between 4 and 7. the other one, l. acidophilus la10, did not attach to this cell line under the same experimental conditions. on the basis of these results, we used the monoclonal antibody technique as a tool to determine differences on the surface of these bacteria and to identify a factor for adhesion. mice were immunized with live la1, and the hybridomas produced by fusion of spleen cells with ons1 cells were screened for the production of antibodies specific for l. johnsonii la1. a set of these monoclonal antibodies was directed against a nonproteinaceous component of the l. johnsonii la1 surface. it was identified as lipoteichoic acid (lta). this molecule was isolated, chemically characterized, and tested in adhesion experiments in the same system. the adhesion of l. johnsonii la1 to caco-2 cells was inhibited in a concentration-dependent way by purified lta as well as by l. johnsonii la1 culture supernatant that contained lta. these results showed that the mechanism of adhesion of l. johnsonii la1 to human caco-2 cells involves lta.
functional analysis of the gene encoding immunity to lactacin f, lafi, and its use as a lactobacillus-specific, food-grade genetic marker.
lactacin f is a two-component class ii bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus johnsonii vpi 11088. the laf operon is composed of the bacteriocin structural genes, lafa and lafx, and a third open reading frame, orfz. two strategies were employed to study the function of orfz. this gene was disrupted in the chromosome of nck64, a lafa729 lafx orfz derivative of vpi 11088. a disruption cassette consisting of orfz interrupted with a cat gene was cloned into psa3 and introduced into nck64. manipulation of growth temperatures and antibiotic selection resulted in homologous recombination which disrupted the chromosomal copy of orfz with the cat gene. this orfz mutation resulted in loss of immunity to lactacin f but had little effect on production of lafx, which is not bactericidal without lafa. expression of orfz in this orfz- background rescued the immune phenotype. expression of orfz in a bacteriocin-sensitive derivative of vpi 11088 also reestablished immunity. these data indicate that orfz, renamed lafi, encodes the immunity factor for the lactacin f system. the sensitivity of various lactobacillus strains to lactacin f was further evaluated. lactacin f inhibited 11 strains including several members of the a1, a2, a3, a4, b1, and b2 l. acidophilus homology groups. expression of lafi in bacteriocin-sensitive strains l. acidophilus atcc 4356, l. acidophilus ncfm/n2, l. fermentum ncdo1750, l. gasseri atcc 33323, and l. johnsonii atcc 33200 provided immunity to lactacin f. furthermore, it was shown that lactacin f production by vpi 11088 could be used to select for l. fermentum ncdo1750 transformants containing the recombinant plasmid encoding lafi. the data demonstrate that lafi is functional in heterologous hosts, suggesting that it may be a suitable food-grade genetic marker for use in lactobacillus species.
