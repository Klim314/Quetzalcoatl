TI  == proteobacterial arfa peptides are synthesized from non-stop messenger rnas.
AB  == the translation of non-stop mrna (which lack in-frame stop codons) represents a significant quality control problem for all organisms. in eubacteria, the transfer-messenger rna (tmrna) system facilitates recycling of stalled ribosomes  from non-stop mrna in a process termed trans-translation or ribosome rescue. during rescue, the nascent chain is tagged with the tmrna-encoded ssra peptide, which promotes polypeptide degradation after release from the stalled ribosome. escherichia coli possesses an additional ribosome rescue pathway mediated by the  arfa peptide. the e. coli arfa message contains a hairpin structure that is cleaved by rnase iii to produce a non-stop transcript. therefore, arfa levels are controlled by tmrna through ssra-peptide tagging and proteolysis. here, we examine whether arfa homologues from other bacteria are also regulated by rnase iii and tmrna. we searched 431 arfa coding sequences for mrna secondary structures and found that 82.8% of the transcripts contain predicted hairpins in  their 3'-coding regions. the arfa hairpins from haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis, vibrio fischeri, and pasteurella multocida are all cleaved by rnase iii as predicted, whereas the hairpin from neisseria gonorrhoeae functions as an  intrinsic transcription terminator to generate non-stop mrna. each arfa homologue is ssra-tagged and degraded when expressed in wild-type e. coli cells, but accumulates in mutants lacking tmrna. together, these findings show that arfa synthesis from non-stop mrna is a conserved mechanism to regulate the alternative ribosome rescue pathway. this strategy ensures that arfa homologues are only deployed when the tmrna system is incapacitated or overwhelmed by stalled ribosomes.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of wild mushroom extracts against clinical isolates resistant to different antibiotics.
AB  == aims: this work aimed to screen the antimicrobial activity of aqueous methanolic  extracts of 13 mushroom species, collected in braganca, against several clinical  isolates obtained in hospital center of tras-os-montes and alto douro, portugal.  methods and results: microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc).  mic results showed that russula delica and fistulina hepatica extracts inhibited  the growth of gram-negative (escherichia coli, morganella morganni and pasteurella multocida) and gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. a bactericide effect of both extracts was observed in past. multocida, strep. agalactiae and strep. pyogenes with mbc of 20, 10 and 5 mg ml(-)(1), respectively. lepista nuda extract exhibited a bactericide effect upon past. multocida at 5 mg ml(-)(1) and inhibited proteus mirabilis at 20 mg ml(-)(1). ramaria botrytis extract showed activity against enterococcus faecalis and l. monocytogenes, being bactericide for past. multocida, strep. agalactiae (mbcs 20 mg ml(-)(1)) and strep. pyogenes (mbc 10 mg ml(-)(1)). leucopaxillus giganteus extract inhibited the growth of e. coli and pr. mirabilis, being bactericide for past. multocida, strep. pyogenes and strep.  agalactiae. conclusions: fistulina hepatica, r. botrytis and r. delica are the most promising species as antimicrobial agents. significance and impact of the study: mushroom extracts could be an alternative as antimicrobials against pathogenic micro-organisms resistant to conventional treatments.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  == in a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in grenada, west indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth,  nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. a total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to  species level and 46 to genus level. a commercial bacterial identification system (api/biomerieux), was used for this purpose. the most common species was escherichia coli (n=60), followed by staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), s. hominis (16), s. haemolyticus (12), streptococcus canis (9), proteus mirabilis (8), pasteurella multocida (7), streptococcus mitis (7), staphylococcus xylosus (7), s. capitis (6), s. chromogenes (4), s. sciuri (3), s. auricularis (2), s. lentus (2), s. hyicus (2), streptococcus suis (2) and pseudomonas argentinensis (2). sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. a molecular method  using 16s rrna sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. e. coli and s. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. s. felis/simulans was the most  common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. p. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. staphylococcus aureus, or s. intemedius/s. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested  against, including tetracycline.

TI  == a new tetracycline resistance determinant cloned from proteus mirabilis.
AB  == the chromosomal inducible tcr determinant from proteus mirabilis was cloned and the nucleotide sequence of both the structural and repressor genes determined. the deduced amino acid sequence of the structural protein shows the highest similarity to teta(h) from pasteurella multocida (78.4%), followed by teta(b) from tn10 (50.9%). based on this analysis, we suggest that this new determinant can be assigned to a new class, tetj.

TI  == serological and biochemical properties of the major outer membrane protein within strains of the genus actinobacillus.
AB  == sarcosyl-extracted outer membrane preparations of organisms of the genus actinobacillus were investigated with regard to heat-modifiable and serological properties as well as n-terminal amino acid sequencing of the isolated major outer membrane protein (omp). the major omp of actinobacillus lignieresii was recognized by a monoclonal antibody with specificity towards proteus mirabilis ompa. moreover, n-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed strong homology to ompa of enterobacteriaceae, on the contrary, no reaction of the proteus mirabilis ompa monoclonal antibody was detectable when investigating the outer membrane preparations of actinobacillus suis and actinobacillus equuli in western blot analyses. n-terminal amino acid sequencing of the major omp of these two species  showed homologies to ompc or ompf of the enterobacteriaceae. in accordance with these results, a polyclonal antibody with specificity for the major omp of pasteurella multocida cross-reacted with the major omps of actinobacillus suis and actinobacillus equuli. the relationship of the major omp of pasteurella multocida and ompc and ompf had been verified in recent studies.

TI  == freeze-substitution of gram-negative eubacteria: general cell morphology and envelope profiles.
AB  == freeze-substitution was performed on strains of escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, campylobacter fetus, vibrio cholerae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, aeromonas salmonicida, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, caulobacter crescentus, and leptothrix discophora with a substitution medium composed of 2% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone. a thick periplasmic gel ranging from 10.6 to 14.3 nm in width  was displayed in e. coli k-12, k30, and his 1 (a k-12 derivative containing the k30 capsule genes), p. multocida, c. fetus, p. putida, a. salmonicida, h. pleuropneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. the other bacteria possessed translucent periplasms in which a thinner peptidoglycan layer was seen. capsular polysaccharide, evident as electron-dense fibers radiating outward perpendicular  to the cell surface, was observed on e. coli k30 and his 1 and p. mirabilis cells. a more random arrangement of fibers forming a netlike structure was apparent surrounding cells of h. pleuropneumoniae. for the first time a capsule,  distinct from the sheath, was observed on l. discophora. in all instances, capsular polysaccharide was visualized in the absence of stabilizing agents such  as homologous antisera or ruthenium red. other distinct envelope structures were  observed external to the outer membrane including the sheath of l. discophora and the s layers of a. salmonicida a450 and c. crescentus cb15a. we believe that the  freeze-substitution technique presents a more accurate image of the structural organization of these cells and that it has revealed complex ultrastructural relationships between cell envelope constituents previously difficult to visualize by more conventional means of preparation.

TI  == in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == [aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  == on the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in april 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. they were: bordetella bronchiseptica, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus sp., branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus sp., enterobacter agglomerans, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas diminuta, alcaligenes faecalis and escherichia coli. however, young weaned rabbits were more often pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. the usefulness of performing only pasteurella and bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. it is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.

TI  == [growth of some pathogenic microorganisms on chemically defined media which were  proposed for sensitivity testing (author's transl)].
AB  == the growth of 16 bacterial cultures, which belong to the frequently encountered pathogens, in three different chemically defined fluid media was investigated through turbidity measurements in comparison with mueller-hinton-broth. e. coli,  salm. dublin, salm. typhi-murium, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, pseud. aeruginosa and bac. cereus grew in two of the three tested defined media with approximately the same intensity as in the mueller-hinton broth. staph. aureus grew well only in one of the 3 tested defined media. listeria monocytogenes, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, pasteurella multocida, neisseria gonorrhoeae and brucella abortus showed only in one of the three tested media a barely descernible growth, whereas strept. faecalis, strept. pneumoniae, strept. pyogenes showed no growth in the three tested defined media after 34 hours of incubation. none of the tested defined media can be used for routine sensitivity  testing but the use of two of the three tested defined media as a reference medium for the standardization of the complex sensitivity testing media remains theoretically possible.
