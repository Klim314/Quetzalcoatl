TI  == effects of parental omega-3 fatty acid intake on offspring microbiome and immunity.
AB  == the "western diet" is characterized by increased intake of saturated and omega-6  (n-6) fatty acids with a relative reduction in omega-3 (n-3) consumption. these fatty acids can directly and indirectly modulate the gut microbiome, resulting in altered host immunity. omega-3 fatty acids can also directly modulate immunity through alterations in the phospholipid membranes of immune cells, inhibition of  n-6 induced inflammation, down-regulation of inflammatory transcription factors,  and by serving as pre-cursors to anti-inflammatory lipid mediators such as resolvins and protectins. we have previously shown that consumption by breeder mice of diets high in saturated and n-6 fatty acids have inflammatory and immune-modulating effects on offspring that are at least partially driven by vertical transmission of altered gut microbiota. to determine if parental diets high in n-3 fatty acids could also affect offspring microbiome and immunity, we fed breeding mice an n-3-rich diet with 40% calories from fat and measured immune outcomes in their offspring. we found offspring from mice fed diets high in n-3 had altered gut microbiomes and modestly enhanced anti-inflammatory il-10 from both colonic and splenic tissue. omega-3 pups were protected during peanut oral allergy challenge with small but measurable alterations in peanut-related serologies. however, n-3 pups displayed a tendency toward worsened responses during e. coli sepsis and had significantly worse outcomes during staphylococcus  aureus skin infection. our results indicate excess parental n-3 fatty acid intake alters microbiome and immune response in offspring.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal effects of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelength (red, green, and blue) light-emitting diode irradiation.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelengths, providing average power output and effects on three  common pathogenic bacteria. background data: ultraviolet (uv) light kills bacteria, but the bactericidal effects of uv may not be unique, as 425 nm produces a similar effect. the bactericidal effects of light-emitting diode (led) wavelengths such as 625 and 525 nm have not been described. before conducting clinical trials, the appropriate wavelength with reasonable dose and exposure time should be established. materials and methods: the bactericidal effects of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelength led irradiation were investigated in vitro for the anaerobic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis and two aerobes (staphylococcus  aureus and escherichia coli dh5alpha). average power output was 6 mw/cm(2) for 1  h. the bacteria were exposed to led irradiation for 1, 2, 4, and 8 h (21.6, 43.2, 86.4, and 172.8 j/cm(2), respectively). led irradiation was performed during growth on agar and in broth. control bacteria were incubated without led irradiation. bacterial growth was expressed in colony-forming units (cfu) and at  an optical density at 600 nm in agar and broth. results: the bactericidal effect  of led phototherapy depended upon wavelength, power density, bacterial viable number, and bacteria species. the bactericidal effect of 425 and 525 nm irradiation varied depending upon the bacterial inoculation, compared with unirradiated samples and samples irradiated with red light. especially, p. gingivalis and e. coli dh5alpha were killed by 425 nm, and s. aureus growth was inhibited by 525 nm. however, the wavelength of 625 nm was not bactericidal for p. gingivalis, e. coli dh5alpha, or s. aureus. conclusions: irradiation at 625 nm light was not bactericidal to s. aureus, e. coli, and p. gingivalis, whereas wavelengths of 425 and 525 nm had bactericidal effects. s. aureus was also killed at 525 nm.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == background: patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. this study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with cp.  methods: subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with cp in the united states. the samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/l, clindamycin at 4 mg/l, doxycycline at 4 mg/l, and metronidazole at 16 mg/l, with a post hoc combination of data for  amoxicillin and metronidazole. gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. results: overall, 74.2% of the patients with cp revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. one or more test species, most often prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, or aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with cp, respectively. fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either s. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). conclusions: patients with cp in the united states frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. the wide variability  found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with  cp.

TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == the short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum  of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects  was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone,  in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were  not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

TI  == gingival fluid cytokine expression and subgingival bacterial counts during pregnancy and postpartum: a case series.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to assess gingival fluid (gcf) cytokine messenger rna (mrna) levels, subgingival bacteria, and clinical periodontal conditions during a normal pregnancy to postpartum. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial samples were analyzed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gcf samples were assessed with real-time pcr including five proinflammatory cytokines and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. results: nineteen pregnant women with a mean age of 32 years (s.d. +/- 4 years, range 26-42) participated in the study. full-mouth bleeding scores (bop) decreased from an average of 41.2% (s.d. +/- 18.6%) at the 12th week of pregnancy to 26.6% (s.d. +/- 14.4%) at the 4-6 weeks postpartum (p < 0.001). between week 12 and 4-6 weeks postpartum, the mean probing pocket depth changed from 2.4 mm (s.d. +/- 0.4) to 2.3 mm (s.d. +/- 0.3) (p = 0.34). higher counts of eubacterium saburreum, parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and staphylococcus aureus were found at week 12 of pregnancy than at the 4-6 weeks postpartum examinations (p < 0.001). during and after pregnancy, statistically significant correlations between bop scores and bacterial counts were observed. bop scores and gcf levels of selected cytokines were not related to each other and no differences in gcf levels of the  cytokines were observed between samples from the 12th week of pregnancy to 4-6 weeks postpartum. decreasing postpartum counts of porphyromonas endodontalis and  pseudomonas aeruginosa were associated with decreasing levels of il-8 and il-1beta. conclusions: bop decreased after pregnancy without any active periodontal therapy. associations between bacterial counts and cytokine levels varied greatly in pregnant women with gingivitis and a normal pregnancy outcome.  postpartum associations between gcf cytokines and bacterial counts were more consistent. clinical relevance: combined assessments of gingival fluid cytokines  and subgingival bacteria may provide important information on host response.

TI  == electrochemically induced anatase inhibits bacterial colonization on titanium grade 2 and ti6al4v alloy for dental and orthopedic devices.
AB  == bacterial contamination of implanted devices is a common cause of their failure.  the aim of the present study was to assess the capability of electrochemical procedures to: (a) promote the formation of anatase on the surface of commercially pure grade 2 ti and ti grade 5 (ti6al4v) alloy; (b) inhibit in vitro biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis and oral plaque in vivo, (c) preserve favorable response of osteoblasts and fibroblasts to materials surfaces. ti grade 2 and ti grade 5 were respectively anodized at two different voltages: 90 and 130v for pure titanium; 100 and 120v for ti6al4v alloy. surface characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (sem) equipped with eds probe, laser profilometry and x-ray diffractometry. bacterial adhesion characterization was performed either in vitro and in vivo in patients. osteoblast and fibroblast response was evaluated by metabolic activity assessment. the higher voltage applied in the anodization treatment of pure titanium (130v) and ti6al4v alloy (120v) surfaces, compared to the untreated pure titanium and ti6al4v and to lower voltage treatments, resulted in a greater decrease in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. in contrast, the high voltage treatments were found to promote  osteoblasts and fibroblasts proliferation. the observations indicated that the experimented high voltage anodization treatments may contribute to preserve the tissue integration and reduce bacteria colonization of titanium and titanium alloy for implantable applications.

TI  == microbiologic results after non-surgical erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet laser or air-abrasive treatment of peri-implantitis: a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study is to assess clinical and microbiologic effects of the non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis lesions using either an erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet (er:yag) laser or an air-abrasive subgingival polishing method. methods: in a 6-month clinical trial, 42 patients with peri-implantitis were treated at one time with an er:yag laser or an air-abrasive device. routine clinical methods were used to monitor clinical conditions. baseline and 6-month intraoral radiographs were assessed with a software program. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method was used to assess 74 bacterial species from the site with the deepest probing depth (pd) at  the implant. non-parametric tests were applied to microbiology data. results: pd  reductions (mean +/- sd) were 0.9 +/- 0.8 mm and 0.8 +/- 0.5 mm in the laser and  air-abrasive groups, respectively (not significant). no baseline differences in bacterial counts between groups were found. in the air-abrasive group, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus anaerobius were found at lower counts at 1 month after therapy (p <0.001) and with lower counts in the laser group for fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme (p = 0.002), and fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum (p = 0.002). both treatments failed to reduce bacterial counts at 6 months. porphyromonas gingivalis counts were higher in cases with progressive peri-implantitis (p <0.001). conclusions: at 1 month, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, and s. anaerobius were reduced in the air-abrasive group,  and fusobacterium spp. were reduced in the laser group. six-month data demonstrated that both methods failed to reduce bacterial counts. clinical improvements were limited.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == comparative evaluation of bactericidal potential of four root canal filling materials against microflora of infected non-vital primary teeth.
AB  == background and objectives: since complete debridement of the root canals of the primary teeth is not practically possible due to the highly variable root canal anatomy, success of the endodontic therapy depends partly on the use ofantibacterial irrigating agents and root canal filling materials. recent literature indicates that anaerobes comprise a majority of the bacteria in necrotic root canals ofprimary teeth. the study determined the antibacterial effectiveness of four root canal filling materials namely calcium hydroxide, zinc oxide eugenol, vitapex and metapex against microbial specimens obtained directly  from necrotic root canals of primary teeth. method: microbial specimens were collected using sterile paper points, from 15 primary maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth of randomly selected children in the age group of 4-10 years with infected non vital primary teeth, requiring pulpectomy procedure. the microbial specimens collected were subjected to microbiological analysis and the antimicrobial potential of root canal filling materials were tested using agar diffusion technique. results: were statistically analyzed using one-way anova. facultative/aerobic organisms were isolated in all the cases, anaerobic organisms were isolated in 80% of the cases, and candida albicans was isolated in 1 case. zoe showed superior inhibitory activity against most of the organisms isolated followed by vitapex, calcium hydroxide and metapex in descending order. conclusion: our data may be useful as a guide for relative antimicrobial effectiveness or non-effectiveness of the materials employed. in vivo studies are required to state the specific antimicrobial activity and merits and demerits of  any of the test filling material.

TI  == microbiology of third and fourth branchial pouch cysts.
AB  == objectives/hypothesis: to identify the most common pathogens involved in infections of third and fourth branchial pouch cysts. third and fourth branchial  pouch cyst infections are an uncommon cause of anterior neck abscesses often confused with other entities, such as thyroglossal duct cysts and thyroid abscesses leading to misdiagnosis, recurrence, and increased morbidity related to a delay in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. study design: retrospective chart and literature review. methods: retrospective chart review case series of patients presenting to the bobby r. alford department of otolaryngology at texas  children's hospital from july 2004 to july 2008 with third and fourth branchial pouch cysts. results: a total of 11 patients were identified. all patients had left-sided lesions. eikenella corrodens was found in 60% of cultures and was the  most common organism identified in our patient group. furthermore, 56% of the organisms isolated were anaerobic. all organisms with the exception of staphylococcus aureus were identified as oral cavity flora. conclusions: third and fourth branchial pouch cysts provide a communication between the neck and the oral cavity through pyriform sinus tracts. the presence of oral cavity flora in a left anterior neck abscess should raise the suspicion of a branchial pouch anomaly, and subsequently alter therapeutic management.

TI  == isolation of staphylococcus aureus and black-pigmented bacteroides indicate a high risk for the development of ludwig's angina.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to compare clinical, microbiological, enzymatic, and host immune response variables between subjects hospitalized with  facial cellulitis, with ludwig's angina (la) and without ludwig's angina (wola).  study design: microbiological and enzymatic tests on pus, and hematological and immunological assessments on blood samples of 15 patients with la and 42 patients with wola were performed. laboratory findings of both groups were compared using  the student t test. multiple logistic regression analysis was performed and significant differences identified by univariate analysis. results: patients with la demonstrated increased levels of white blood cell counts, urea, and crp levels, and decreased levels of cic compared with patients wola. however, only crp and urea were found to be significantly raised in the la group. a greater population of staphylococcus aureus and black-pigmented bacteroides were isolated from patients with la. conclusion: elevated levels of crp and urea could indicate the severity of infection in patients with la. this could be because of the highly virulent and fast-spreading organisms, s. aureus and black-pigmented bacteroides, which may be a factor indicative of la.

TI  == oral microbial and respiratory status of persons with mental retardation/intellectual and developmental disability: an observational cohort study.
AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of select  microorganisms in oral biofilms and to investigate relationships between oral and respiratory status in persons with mental retardation/intellectual and developmental disabilities (idd). study design: we conducted a 6-month-long observational cohort study with 63 persons with idd. oral examinations, oral sampling, and medical record reviews were performed at baseline and then monthly. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to analyze all baseline oral samples for the presence of streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), prevotella melaninogenica, and candida albicans. pcr analyses were also performed on participants' samples collected in the month before being diagnosed with a respiratory infection. results: all subjects had p. melaninogenica detected by pcr in their oral samples. fifty-five percent (35 of 63) of participants had s. pneumoniae, mrsa, and c. albicans in their oral samples at baseline. no dental decay was detected clinically, oral hygiene was fair, and dysphagia was common. during the 6 months of the study, there were 22 respiratory infections (35% of participants)-12 pneumonias, 7 sinusitis, 1 bronchitis, and 1 upper respiratory tract infection. participants with microorganisms in their baseline samples were significantly more likely to develop any respiratory infection and those who had poor oral status were significantly more likely to develop pneumonia. almost 60% of participants who developed respiratory infections had the same microorganism detected in the sample collected in the month before infection as had been detected in their baseline sample. conclusion: potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the oral cavity and poor oral status significantly increased the risk of developing respiratory infections, including pneumonia, in persons with idd. the results suggest that colonization with these microorganisms may persist despite routine tooth brushing. meticulous comprehensive oral hygiene of the oral cavity may be needed to reduce oropharyngeal microbial load.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == influence of the menstrual cycle on the oral microbial flora in women: a case-control study including men as control subjects.
AB  == changes in the levels of female sex hormones during the menstrual cycle may cause cyclic differences in subgingival bacterial colonization patterns. the purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle cause changes in the oral microbiota. methods: bacterial plaque samples were collected in 20 systemically and periodontally healthy women using no hormonal contraceptives (test group) over a period of 6 weeks. twenty age-matched systemically and periodontally healthy men were assigned to the control group. samples were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay, and 74 species were analyzed. results: no cyclic pattern of bacterial colonization was identified for any of the 74 species studied in women not using  hormonal contraceptives. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (y4) was common at the beginning of menstruation (mean: 32%) and increased during the following 2 weeks (36%) in women (p <0.05). no cyclic differences in bacterial presence were found among the men (p values varied between 0.14 and 0.98). men presented with significantly higher bacterial counts for 40 of 74 species (p <0.001), including staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa but not porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.15) or  tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.42). conclusions: during a menstruation period, cyclic variation in the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy women of child-bearing age who were not using oral hormonal contraceptives could not be confirmed. male control subjects presented with higher levels of many species but also without a cyclic pattern.

TI  == effects of low-energy shock waves on oral bacteria.
AB  == we have recently demonstrated that extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (eswt) is effective in promoting the healing of dermal wounds and in regenerating alveolar  bone lost through periodontal disease. the objective of the present study was to  determine any antibacterial effect of eswt on oral bacteria. monoculture suspensions of 6 bacterial species were treated with 100 to 500 pulses of eswt at energy flux densities (efd) of 0.12 mj/mm(2), 0.22 mj/mm(2), and 0.3 mj/mm(2). following treatment, aliquots were plated for viability determination and compared with untreated controls. eswt showed a significant microbicidal effect for streptococcus mutans and an unencapsulated strain of porphyromonas gingivalis following as few as 100 pulses at 0.3 mj/mm(2) (p <or= 0.001). in addition, a significant disruption of bacterial aggregates was observed at lower efds. no significant reduction in viability was observed for all other bacteria at efds and pulses tested (p > 0.05). these findings suggest that low-energy eswt may be  bactericidal for selected oral bacteria.

AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == tannerella forsythia and pseudomonas aeruginosa in subgingival bacterial samples  from parous women.
AB  == background: information on the subgingival microbiota in parous women is limited. the present study assessed 74 bacterial species at periodontal sites. methods: subgingival bacterial plaque was collected from women > or =6 months after delivery. bacteria were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gingivitis was defined as > or =20% of sites with bleeding on probing (bop), and periodontitis was defined as radiographic evidence of bone loss and probing depths > or =5.0 mm. results: a total of 197 women (mean age: 29.4 +/- 6.8 years; range: 18 to 46 years) were included in the study. gingivitis was identified in 82 of 138 subjects without evidence of periodontitis (59.4%). periodontitis was found in 59 women (32%). higher bacterial levels in subjects with gingivitis compared to those without evidence of gingivitis were observed for actinomyces neuii, bifidobacterium bifidum, corynebacterium pseudogenitalis,  porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella bivia, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p <0.001 for each). higher bacterial levels in subjects with periodontitis compared to those without periodontitis (bop not accounted for) were found for 32 of 79 species (p <0.001) including lactobacillus iners, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella bivia, p. aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. binary univariate logistic regression analysis identified that p. aeruginosa (p <0.001) and t. forsythia (p <0.05) were independently predictive of periodontal status. the odds ratio of having p. aeruginosa at levels > or =1 x 10(5) in the sample and periodontitis was 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 5.9; p <0.001). conclusion: in addition to p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, a diverse microbiota,  including p. aeruginosa, p. endodontalis, p. bivia, and s. aureus, can be found in subgingival plaque samples from women of child-bearing age with periodontitis.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide combined with chlorhexidine gel used as intracanal medicament.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide (ca(oh)2) combined with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (chx) gel against endodontic pathogens and to compare the results with the ones achieved by ca(oh)2 mixed with sterile water and by chx gel alone. two methods were used: the agar diffusion test and the direct contact test. ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel produced inhibitory zones ranging from 2.84 to 6.5 mm, and required from 30 seconds to 6 hours to eliminate all tested microorganisms. however, 2% chx gel showed the largest microbial growth zones from 4.33 to 21.67 mm, and required 1 minute or less to inhibit all tested microorganisms. a paste of ca(oh)2 plus sterile water  inhibited only the microorganisms with which it was in direct contact and required from 30 seconds to 24 hours to kill all tested microorganisms. in conclusion, 2% chx gel + ca(oh)2 showed better antimicrobial activity than ca(oh)2 manipulated with sterile water.

TI  == [the antimicrobial effects of chitosans on oral pathogenic microbes in vitro].
AB  == purpose: to study the antimicrobial activities of chitosans of different molecular weights and concentrations on oral pathogenic microbes under ph 6.5 in  vitro. methods: the inhibition effects of chitosans of different molecular weights and different concentrations (2.0%, 1.5%, 1.0%, 0.5%) on staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, helicobacter pylori, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis in culture were investigated, and the differences of their antimicrobial activities under high temperature and after filtering were compared. one way analysis of variance, randomized block design analysis of variance and t test were used for statistical analysis. results: chitosans of different molecular weights all showed bacteriostatic effects on staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, helicobacter pylori, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis. low molecular weight chitosans showed the strongest effects, but the high molecular weight ones had strong effects on streptococcus mutans (p<0.05,0.01). the bacteriostatic effects of chitosans were not affected by high temperatures (p>0.05). conclusion: chitosans have inhibitory effects on oral pathogenic microbes under ph 6.5.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of croton cajucara benth linalool-rich essential oil on artificial biofilms and planktonic microorganisms.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that a linalool-rich essential oil from croton cajucara benth presents leishmanicidal activity. in the present study, we demonstrate that this essential oil inhibits the growth of reference samples of candida albicans, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sobrinus, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans cell suspensions, all of them associated with oral cavity disease. the purified linalool fraction was only inhibitory for c. albicans. microbes of saliva specimens from human individuals with fixed orthodontic appliances, as well as the reference strains,  were used to construct an artificial biofilm which was exposed to linalool or to  the essential oil. as in microbial suspensions, the essential oil was toxic for all the microorganisms, while the purified linalool fraction mainly inhibited the growth of c. albicans. the compounds of the essential oil were separated by thin  layer chromatography and exposed to the above-cited microorganisms. in this analysis, the proliferation of the bacterial cells was inhibited by still uncharacterized molecules, and linalool was confirmed as the antifungal component of the essential oil. the effects of linalool on the cell biology of c. albicans  were evaluated by electron microscopy, which showed that linalool induced a reduction in cell size and abnormal germination. neither the crude essential oil  nor the purified linalool fraction is toxic to mammalian cells, which suggests that the essential oil or its purified components may be useful to control the microbial population in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == effect of porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles on coaggregation of staphylococcus aureus to oral microorganisms.
AB  == vesicles from the outer membrane of porphyromonas gingivalis have the ability to  aggregate a wide range of streptococcus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, and actinomyces viscosus. we found that in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles, staphylococcus aureus coaggregated with streptococcus  spp., and the mycelium-type candida albicans, but not the yeast type. autoaggregation of s. aureus in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles is inhibited by l-arginine, l-lysine, and l-cysteine. both the methicillin-sensitive (mssa) and -resistant (mrsa) strains of s. aureus were able to coaggregate with streptococcus spp., a. naeslundii, and a. viscosus when they were treated with p. gingivalis vesicles. p. gingivalis vesicle-treated mycelium-type c. albicans coaggregated with s. aureus, but the yeast-type did not. these results indicate that strains of s. aureus, including mrsa, could adhere to oral biofilms in dental plaque on the tooth surface or in the gingival crevice when p. gingivalis  is present.

TI  == acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp.), fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. streptococcus spp. (including s.  pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have also been reported. gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are arachnia, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. therapy includes maintenance  of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. the choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx  may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.

AB  == the antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic  pathogens. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of  four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (ah26, ah plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (n2), and one calcium hydroxide-based  sealer (sealapex). the testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia). the freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. after varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. all the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial  activity. the sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types  and bacterial strains. n2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. the extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.

TI  == lactoferrin, amylase and mucin muc5b and their relation to the oral microflora in hyposalivation of different origins.
AB  == there are several reasons for hyposalivation, each affecting the salivary composition in different ways. the aim of this study was to analyze and compare lactoferrin, amylase and mucin muc5b in stimulated whole saliva collected from subjects with hyposalivation of different origins and to relate the results to the presence of some microbial species associated with oral disorders. albumin was determined as a marker of serum leakage. the characteristic feature for subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation was a large increase in lactoferrin, probably due to leakage through inflamed mucosal tissues, while it was a high albumin content for the group with primary sjogren's syndrome, probably due to disruption of the fragile mucosa. the saliva composition in subjects with hyposalivation of unknown origin or due to medicines was close to that in the healthy controls. all three hyposalivation groups tended to display a decrease in the concentrations of muc5b and amylase. none of the microbial species analyzed (streptococci, mutans streptococci, lactobacillus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus and enterics) correlated with concentration of muc5b in saliva. the rt group, having the highest concentration of lactoferrin, had the lowest median number of f. nucleatum and was the only group in which median number of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens was zero.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in primary sjogren's syndrome.
AB  == objective: knowledge of the effect of primary sjogren's syndrome (pss) on the microbial flora in the different predilection sites for oral disorders is needed  for planning preventive treatment. we carried out microbial analysis of samples from the dorsum of the tongue, smooth mucosa, supragingival tooth surfaces, and the gingival crevice region of 20 patients with pss. methods: a clinical oral examination was performed and whole unstimulated and stimulated secretion rates were measured. results: compared with healthy controls, subjects with pss harbored higher numbers and frequencies of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., and candida albicans in the supragingival plaque. on the smooth mucosa and  tongue, the pss subjects displayed an increased frequency of c. albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterics, and enterococci. c. albicans was detected about  twice as frequently in the supragingival plaque as it was on the tongue. in the gingival crevice region, the pss group harbored slightly lower proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens than controls. the clinical and microbial differences were mainly due to the pss subjects with a stimulated secretion rate of < 0.5 ml/min. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any subject with pss. conclusion: the microbial flora in the different ecosystems reflected the status of oral disorders in the subjects with pss. specific site sampling and analysis in subjects with pss revealed further differences compared  with controls, and is therefore preferable to saliva sampling for oral treatment  planning and for the evaluation of the effect of oral treatment and of preventive measures implemented in individuals with pss.

TI  == early implant failures in patients treated with branemark system titanium dental  implants: a retrospective study.
AB  == implant failure has been associated with factors such as poor bone quality, insufficient bone volume, implant instability, unfavorable implant loading, and smoking habits. infections and host responses may also be important factors in dental implant failure. the objectives of the present study were to identify various explanatory factors associated with titanium implant failure. forty subjects with stage 1 non-osseointegrated titanium dental implants (noti) ad modum branemark and 40 age- and gender-matched control subjects with successfully osseointegrated titanium implants (soti) were studied. clinical data and gamma g  immunoglobulin (igg) antibody titers were studied. an independent t test revealed that significantly longer implants were placed in subjects with soti (p < .05). statistically significant differences in bone shape and resorption (bsr) scores were found between soti and noti (p < .05). logistic regression analysis identified 3 significant explanatory outcome variables: serum antibody avidity scores for bacteroides forsythus (p < .0001), serum antibody titers to staphylococcus aureus (p < .001), and the bsr scores (p < .05). antibody avidity  to b forsythus and antibody titer to s aureus were therefore the 2 most important factors associated with early implant failures and with a significant predictive  ability. this indicates that immunologic factors are involved in osseointegration.

AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == [an experimental study of the patterns in the development of an inflammatory process in the mandibular bone tissue caused by exposure to anaerobic microflora].
AB  == inflammatory process in mandibular bone was induced in 39 outbred rats by a pure  culture of bacteroides fragilis and by an associative culture of b. fragilis and  staphylococcus aureus. anaerobic microflora notably aggravated the course of inflammation. in contrast to inflammation in other parts of the skeleton, inflammation of the jaws involves a high risk of infection of the oral cavity by  pathogenic microflora. a variety of microorganisms is isolated from the focus: from gram-positive staphylococci to gram-negative enterobacteria, which fact should be borne in mind when planning antibiotic therapy. combined use of antibiotics active towards the entire spectrum of agents detected in this study is the most effective.

TI  == possible potentiation of toxins from prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and porphyromonas gingivalis by cotinine.
AB  == background: smoking is a recognized risk factor for the initiation and progression of periodontitis. however, the mechanism by which smoking induces its negative effects on the periodontium is not clear. this study aimed to test the hypothesis that synergy may occur between cotinine and bacterial products isolated from 3 putative periodontopathogens. methods: a chick embryo toxin assay was used to investigate bacterial toxins (cell-free extracellular toxins and cell-free cell lysates) from 5 species with and without cotinine. a total of 9 putative periodontopathogens (3 species) and 2 non-oral controls (2 species) were studied. the periodontal species were: prevotella intermedia (n = 4), prevotella  nigrescens (n = 4), and porphyromonas gingivalis (n = 1). the control species tested were: staphylococcus aureus (n = 1) and escherichia coli (n = 1). results: the toxicity kill was significantly greater than expected by simple addition alone (p <0.05, fisher's exact test) between cotinine (800 ng/ml) and 1) the cell-free extracellular toxins of p. nigrescens mh1 and 2) the cell-free cell lysates of p. intermedia mh2. synergy occurred with cotinine plus the cell-free extracellular toxins in all but 3 periodontal isolates, and the cell-free cell lysates in all but 2 periodontal isolates. cotinine significantly (p <0.05, fisher's exact test) enhanced the effects of cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates from one control species (e. coli), but not the other (s. aureus). conclusions: these findings indicate that synergy in an in vitro assay can occur  between cotinine and toxins from putative periodontopathogens. this may be one important mechanism by which smoking increases the severity of periodontitis.

TI  == oral microflora in subjects with reduced salivary secretion.
AB  == it is generally assumed that a decreased salivary secretion rate will promote plaque accumulation and increase the risk for caries, gingival inflammation, and  mucosal infections. in this study, the effect of hyposalivation on the oral microflora was examined. the following micro-organisms were analyzed in rinsing samples from 14 subjects with hyposalivation: the total number of anaerobically growing micro-organisms, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and enterics. the study group, age 53 +/- 7 years, had no history of radiation therapy and showed no signs of inflammation in their salivary glands on biopsy. all were dentate with a mean of 24 +/- 3 teeth. their salivary secretion rates were 0.03 +/- 0.02 ml/min  (unstimulated) and 0.84 +/- 0.65 ml/min (stimulated). the control group was matched to the hyposalivation group according to age, sex, and number of teeth. there was a significantly increased number of lactobacilli, and a tendency, not statistically significant and with large variations within the groups, toward a higher proportion of mutans streptococci and a lower proportion of alpha-hemolytic streptococci in the hyposalivation group. the presence of micro-organisms associated with gingival inflammation and mucosal infections was  comparable with that in the healthy controls. the results indicated that a low salivary secretion rate mainly promotes a flora associated with the development of caries.

TI  == bacteriostatic effects of hyaluronic acid.
AB  == background: this investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (ha) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. the rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that ha can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. methods: in this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant ha (low, 141 kd; medium, 757 kd; and high, 1,300 kd) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. three concentrations of each ha formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. results: recombinant ha exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (mw) and concentration. the high concentrations of the medium mw ha had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella oris, staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes strains. the 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high mw ha had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. among the bacterial strains studied, ha was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that ha in the mw range of 1,300 kd may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds  when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.

TI  == the microbiota of periodontal pockets with different depths in therapy-resistant  periodontitis.
AB  == this study presents the composition of the cultivable microbiota colonising periodontal pockets of different depths among 2 patient-groups classified as non-responsive (nr-group; 11 participants) or responsive (r-group; 10 participants) to periodontal treatment. microbiological samples from three types  of pocket (< 4 mm deep a-samples; 4-5 mm b-samples; > 5 mm c-samples) were analysed by cultural methods for putative periodontitis pathogens, microbial groups constituting > or = 5% of the total cultivable flora and opportunistic pathogens. actinomyces naeslundii, a. israelii, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, anaerobic streptococci and facultative anaerobic streptococci were most prevalent. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, staphylococcus aureus, enteric rods and yeasts were less prevalent. the periodontitis pathogens bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and peptostreptococcus micros constituted together (on average) < or = 23% of the viable counts in the a- and b-samples of  both patient groups and in the c-samples of the r-group. in the c-samples of the  nr-group their mean counts were 45%. correlations were found between smoking habits and the five pathogens in the c-samples and in pooled pocket depth samples. the results show that groups of periodontopathogens should be considered a causal factor in therapy-resistant periodontitis. further, smoking and deep pockets can enhance a shift in the balance of the subgingival microflora predisposing a site to disease and a susceptible host may be the pre-requisite to therapy-resistant periodontitis.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == isolation of fusobacterium necrophorum from cancrum oris (noma).
AB  == a study of the predominant microflora in active sites of noma (cancrum oris) lesions was carried out in eight noma patients 3-15 years of age in sokoto state  in northwestern nigeria. paper point sampling and conventional anaerobic microbiologic techniques were used. fusobacterium necrophorum was recovered from  87.5% of the noma lesions. oral microorganisms included prevotella intermedia, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and actinomyces spp. which were isolated from 75.0%, 50.0%, and 37.5% of the patients, respectively. peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas spp. were each recovered from one lesion. the f. necrophorum and p. intermedia isolates were tested for antibiotic sensitivity to clindamycin, tetracycline, metronidazole, and penicillin using the e-test, and all strains were observed to be sensitive to all of the antibiotics tested with the exception of one strain of p. intermedia,  which showed resistance to penicillin. the first reported isolation from human noma lesions of f. necrophorum, a pathogen primarily associated with animal diseases, may have important etiologic and animal transmission implications.

TI  == immune response to fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and other anaerobes in children with acute tonsillitis.
AB  == the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was determined in the saliva of 20 children with acute group a beta-haemolytic streptococcal (gabhs) pharyngo-tonsillitis, and 20 with acute non-gabhs tonsillitis. antibody titres to four gram-negative anaerobic bacilli that reside in the oropharynx (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were determined in these and 20 control patients. an average of 8.8 aerobic and anaerobic isolates per patient saliva specimens were found during the acute tonsillitis stage in both groups, and 6.9 (in gabhs tonsillitis) and 5.6 (in non-gabhs tonsillitis) 5-6 weeks later. there were 10- to 1000-fold more bacteria in the acute stages of the inflammation in both gabhs  and non-gabhs groups. these bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, peptostreptococcus spp., f. nucleatum, prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp. significantly higher antibodies levels to  f. nucleatum and p. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients  with non-gabhs pharyngo-tonsillitis (p < 0.001) and gabhs tonsillitis (p < 0.05), as compared with their first sample or the levels of antibodies in controls. the  increase in the number of several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria during acute tonsillitis and the increase in antibody levels to f. nucleatum and p. intermedia, known oral pathogens, may suggest a possible pathogenic role for these organisms in acute non-gabhs and gabhs tonsillitis.

TI  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans on denture surfaces.
AB  == infectious diseases caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, mrsa,  and candida albicans are often serious in compromised hosts. we enumerated mrsa and c. albicans on denture surfaces and in saliva samples from 29 adults. staphylococcus species, mrsa, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, mrse, were detected on 17, 3, and 1 of the 29 denture surfaces, respectively. c. albicans were detected on 22 denture surfaces. all saliva samples from patients whose dentures carried staphylococcus species and c. albicans were also found to contain both microorganisms. adherence of isolated 3h labeled cells of mrsa and c. albicans to resin beads and saliva-coated resin beads was examined. cells of both microorganisms adhered in significantly higher  numbers to saliva-coated resin beads than to resin beads. the hydrophobicity of the mrsa isolated from denture surfaces varied from strain to strain; that of c.  albicans strains was moderately high. the zeta potentials of mrsa isolates and of c. albicans isolates determined in kci buffer were significantly low. the potential of the resin beads decreased after treatment with saliva. two out of 5  mrsa strains were found to be inhibited in growth by oral streptococcus, actinomyces, and gram-negative bacterial strains, suggesting that some oral bacterial species play a role in inhibiting the colonization of staphylococcus species. no isolates of c. albicans were inhibited in their growth by any of the  oral bacteria tested. isolates of mrsa and c. albicans coaggregated with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum strains. using denture cleaners every night for 2 weeks did not reduce numbers of staphylococcus species or c. albicans organisms in saliva.

TI  == the interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. the reference bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (gf) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (e) from 2 such persons, hela cells (hela), and an amnion cell line (amnion). the cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a bioscreen robot analyzer (labsystems, finland). results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line  of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == in vivo efficacy of trovafloxacin (cp-99,219), a new quinolone with extended activities against gram-positive pathogens, streptococcus pneumoniae, and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the interesting in vitro antimicrobial activity and pharmacokinetics of the new quinolone trovafloxacin (cp-99,219) warranted further studies to determine its in vivo efficacy in models of infectious disease. the significance of the pharmacokinetic and in vitro antimicrobial profiles of trovafloxacin was shown through efficacy in a series of animal infection models by employing primarily oral therapy. against acute infections, trovafloxacin was consistently more effective than temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae and other gram-positive pathogens while maintaining activity comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against gram-negative organisms. in a model of murine pneumonia, trovafloxacin was more efficacious than temafloxacin, while  ciprofloxacin failed against s. pneumoniae (50% protective doses, 2.1, 29.5, and  >100 mg/kg, respectively). in addition to its inherent in vitro potency advantage against s. pneumoniae, these data were supported by a pharmacokinetic study that  showed levels of trovafloxacin in pulmonary tissue of s. pneumoniae-infected cf1  mice to be considerably greater than those of temafloxacin and ciprofloxacin (twice the maximum drug concentration in serum; two to three times the half-life, and three to six times the area under the concentration-time curve). against localized mixed anaerobic infections, trovafloxacin was the only agent to effectively reduce the numbers of recoverable cfu of bacteroides fragilis ( >1,000-fold), staphylococcus aureus (1,000-fold), and escherichia coli ( >100-fold) compared with ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole, clindamycin, cefoxitin, and ceftriaxone. the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of  trovafloxacin and its pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals provide support for  the ongoing and planned human phase ii and iii clinical trials.

TI  == role of suspected periodontopathogens in microbiological monitoring of periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal disease is the clinical result of a complex interaction between the host and plaque bacteria. although a specificity to some degree is found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), it has been difficult to obtain evidence for a specific etiological role of the bacteria associated with periodontal disease in adults. what we see is the net result of host-parasite interactions which in an unpredictable moment accumulate  and exceed the threshold of tissue integrity. this hypothesis is concomitant with the view of periodontal disease as a polymicrobial infection, predominantly anaerobic, which occurs commonly in the oral cavity or elsewhere in the body. some micro-organisms (risk markers) occur more frequently than others and may significantly determine the outcome of this host-parasite interaction. microbiological sampling and analysis seem to be of limited value in risk assessment; however, they can be used as tools in diagnosis in ljp patients and acute infections, and in treatment decision and therapy control in "refractory" patients. suspected pathogens (risk markers) are actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and some species of spirochetes, while the roles of prevotella intermedia, bacteroidesforsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and peptostreptococcus micros are more uncertain. the presence of periodontopathogens as well as enterics, staphylococcus aureus and candida especially, should be considered in patients with systemic individual disorders--e.g., diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and aids--or with implants.

AB  == after optimizing conditions for maximal production of menaquinones (mk), s. aureus and b. vulgatus were grown in batches, harvested and extracted for qualitative and quantitative mk content utilizing hplc (high performance liquid chromatography) until a total of 6 mg was available. five normal healthy male volunteers were placed on a vitamin k1 deficient diet (< or = 25 micrograms/day)  and were subsequently warfarinized to maintain a prothrombin time (pt) 1.5-2 times control. following stabilization of daily warfarin dosage 1 mg doses of the extracted mk were orally administered. as a control, the same volunteers were later warfarinized but no mk was given. within 24 h of mk administration the prothrombin time (pt) decreased (mean +/- sem) 3.6 +/- 1.0 s (p < 0.005) and the  factor vii level increased 0.36 +/- 0.3 u/ml (p < 0.005) vs a pt increase of 1.0  +/- 1.0 s (p > 0.1) and a factor vii level increase of 0.03 +/- 0.1 u/ml (p > 0.1) in the control phase. within 48 h of mk administration the pt was normal in  all subjects but remained > or = 1.5 times control in the control phase. these data demonstrate for the first time the absorption and bioactivity of bacterially synthesized vitamin k in humans.

TI  == expression of fc-gamma-riii and fibronectin in peripheral polymorphonuclear neutrophils with increased response to fc stimulation in patients with juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == the nature of increased luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (cl) in peripheral polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) in juvenile periodontitis is of pathophysiological interest and may serve as a model for tissue damage caused by  granulocytes. activation of pmns by opsonized staphylococcus aureus was compared  with that of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides gingivalis, regarded as being more specific for juvenile periodontitis. the cl was higher in  the pmns from the patients, independently of bacteria and mode of opsonization (autologous serum or gamma-globulin). fc-gamma-riii assessed on the washed fragments from peripheral pmns was significantly (p < or = 0.005) lower in the patients with juvenile periodontitis than in their pair-matched healthy controls, while the content of fibronectin was higher (p < or = 0.032). however, when fc-gamma-riii and fibronectin were studied in fresh pmns by flow cytometry no difference could be found between the two groups. the increased generation of cl  of peripheral pmns found in patients with juvenile periodontitis seems to be independent of humoral factors and of bacterial species and may be related to the properties of the pmn cell membranes.

TI  == refractory periodontitis associated with abnormal polymorphonuclear leukocyte phagocytosis and cigarette smoking.
AB  == to learn if refractory periodontitis may be associated with defects in peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) function, phagocytosis and chemotaxis were analyzed in 31 otherwise healthy patients and 12 unaffected controls. when compared to controls, no chemotactic defects to 10 nm f-met-leu-phe (fmlp) were detected. in contrast, phagocytosis was significantly impaired (p < 0.001). the mean rates of adhesion and ingestion of opsonized staphylococcus aureus by pmns were 7.1 +/- 1.7 (+/- sd) and 1.4 +/- 0.5 bacteria/100 pmns/minute respectively for patients, and 11.0 +/- 2.4 and 3.1 +/- 0.6 for unaffected, healthy controls.  while the quality of oral hygiene and access to dental care were high, a retrospective search for associated environmental variables showed that 90% (28 of 31) of the refractory patients were smokers. the frequency of smokers is particularly striking, since only 21% of adults in minnesota use tobacco regularly. these data suggest that there is a strong association between a peripheral blood pmn defect and refractory periodontitis. furthermore, these studies suggest that tobacco use may contribute to this association.

TI  == the predominant microflora of the palatal mucosa in an elderly island population.
AB  == the prevalence and microbiology of macrophotographically documented denture stomatitis were studied in denture wearers participating in an interdisciplinary  health-monitoring project (koster health project) on the koster islands, sweden.  upper dentures were used by 26.6% of the adult population, and 59.2% of the denture wearers had stomatitis. denture stomatitis type i was identified as sialadenitis. the more severe forms of denture stomatitis (types ii and iii) demonstrated increased recovery of microorganisms in the palatal mucosa in addition to sialadenitis. only one proband showed increased growth of fungi. hemophilus spp. and bacteroides spp. were the predominating microorganisms in stomatitis types ii and iii. shifts in the normal oral flora are suggested to be  an important factor for the development of denture stomatitis. it is concluded that bacterial colonization on the palatal mucosa may play an important role in denture stomatitis in this relatively healthy population.

TI  == the antimicrobial effect of various endodontic sealers.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of an endodontic sealer can be helpful in destroying any remaining root canal microbes. therefore it was decided to test the antimicrobial activity of several commonly used endodontic sealers. the sealers used were grossman's sealer, tubliseal, calciobiotic, sealapex, hypocal, eucapercha, nogenol, and ah26. also tested were dry calcium hydroxide powder, calcium hydroxide mixed with saline, and a teflon formulation. the microbes used  were streptococcus mutans (a gram-positive microaerophile). staphylococcus aureus (a gram-positive facultative anaerobe), and bacteroides endodontalis (a gram-negative obligate anaerobe). the freshly mixed sealers were placed into the  prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. after varying periods of incubation, the zones of inhibition of bacterial growth were observed and measured. grossman's sealer had the greatest overall antibacterial activity. however, ah26 had the greatest activity against b. endodontalis. the zinc oxide-eugenol-based sealers had more antimicrobial activity than either the  calcium hydroxide-based sealers or eucapercha.

TI  == correlation of the extravascular pharmacokinetics of azithromycin with in-vivo efficacy in models of localized infection.
AB  == infection models were used to clarify the roles of serum and extravascular concentrations in the in-vivo efficacy observed with azithromycin. in-vivo experiments were designed to give serum concentrations well below the mic and tissue levels generally above the mic at time of challenge and during the course  of infection. the efficacy of azithromycin against a salmonella enteritidis oral  challenge (a tissue-associated infection model) in mice correlated directly with  azithromycin liver levels, but not serum concentrations. the significance of extravascular pharmacokinetics was observed in a comparative study of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin against the salmonella challenge. ciprofloxacin has a greater than 100-fold in-vitro potency advantage over azithromycin against  this organism, but azithromycin (5 mg/kg) produced a greater reduction in cfu than ciprofloxacin (100 mg/kg) at the primary site of infection (liver). in another model, extravascular fluid levels, measured by bioassay of implanted paper discs, were compared with plasma levels in relation to control of a localized staphylococcus aureus infection in rats. extravascular fluid levels of  azithromycin were greater than the mic of the strain used for five days after a 100 mg/kg dose, while erythromycin levels were less than 20% of the mic at 30 h after a 200 mg/kg dose. serum concentrations of both compounds were less than 20% of the mic at the time of challenge. the antibiotic levels at the site of infection correlated with the reduction of staph. aureus cfu (99% with azithromycin compared with controls, p less than 0.01; 0% with erythromycin) recovered from inoculated discs. the significance of extravascular concentrations of azithromycin was further supported in other models of localized infections induced with escherichia coli or a mixture of staph. aureus and bacteroides fragilis.

AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of 128 bacterial strains was tested to amine fluoride-stannous fluoride (amf + snf) and chlorhexidine (chx) solutions. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus mutans, and bacteroides intermedius were among the species investigated. the 50% and 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were assessed by an agar dilution method. the mic ranges for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 2-32 micrograms/ml for chx and 0.25-64 micrograms/ml for amf + snf. the respective values for s. mutans were 0.5-8 micrograms/ml (chx) and 2-8 micrograms/ml (amf + snf); and 4-8 micrograms/ml (chx) and 2-4 micrograms/ml (amf + snf) for b. intermedius. streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus were most resistant of the control strains (mic 64 micrograms/ml to chx and 32 micrograms/ml to amf + snf, respectively). thus, both solutions tested exerted a definite inhibitory action on the dental plaque pathogens studied.

TI  == activity of fce 22891 compared with cefuroxime axetil and cefixime in pulmonary and subcutaneous infections in mice.
AB  == the therapeutic activity of fce 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. in experimental pneumonia fce 22891 was the most active antibiotic. in aerobic abscesses fce 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against str. pyogenes. in abscesses caused by gram-negative bacteria, fce 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against gram-negative  bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of ent. cloacae. fce 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by bacteroides fragilis 101. we conclude that fce 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins  characterized by longer half lives.

TI  == role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  == the effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. support for the importance of encapsulated bacteroides sp. and anaerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci (afgpc) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, compared to their number in the normal oral flora. studies of the pathogenicity of anaerobic bacteria of the bacteroides, fusobacterium, and clostridium genera and afgpc are also presented. the organisms were inoculated into mice and their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses was determined. encapsulated bacteroides, fusobacteria, and afgpc generally induced abscesses, whereas unencapsulated organisms did not. however, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (less than 1%) survived in the abscess,  and became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or nonviable encapsulated bacteria. these strains were thereafter able to induce abscesses when injected alone. encapsulated bacteroides sp. and anaerobic cocci induced bacteremia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the unencapsulated form of the same strains. the relative importance of encapsulated anaerobes in relation to their aerobic and facultative counterparts in mixed infection was studied, using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative cultures of abscesses induced in mice. with few exceptions, possession of a capsule made bacteroides sp. more important than their aerobic counterparts. synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated bacteroides sp. and all tested aerobic bacteria and most afgpc, and between most  afgpc and pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus. these studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.

AB  == a prospective randomized trial was performed to compare oral neomycin and erythromycin with single-dose intravenous metronidazole and ceftriaxone in elective colorectal surgery. the study was discontinued after 60 patients were entered. the overall rate of infection was 41 percent in the oral neomycin and erythromycin group (n = 29) compared with 9.6 percent in those who received intravenous metronidazole and ceftriaxone (n = 31) (p less than 0.01). infections in the oral group were principally due to resistant staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and escherichia coli. preoperative administration of oral neomycin and erythromycin was associated with a significant reduction of escherichia coli counts (1 x 10(7) to 3 x 10(5) organisms/ml, p less than 0.05) compared with the intravenous group, but there was no significant reduction in the counts of bacteroides fragilis (2 x 10(8) to 1 x 10(7) organisms/ml) and there was an increase in the counts of clostridia (2 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(6) organisms/ml). these results indicate that single-dose systemic prophylaxis with  appropriate antibiotics is superior to oral neomycin and erythromycin.

TI  == role of anaerobic bacteria in bite-wound infections.
AB  == the etiologic agents usually involved in wound infections due to human or animal  bites are the aerobic skin flora of the victim, e.g., staphylococcus aureus, and/or the aerobic oral flora of the biter, e.g., pasteurella multocida. while anaerobic bacteria are predominant in the normal oral flora of humans and animals, their importance in the pathogenesis of bite-wound infections has not been stressed. most investigators in this field have either not cultured these wounds for anaerobic bacteria or not utilized optimal culture techniques. in a series of studies on human and animal bite wounds, methods that are optimal for recovery of anaerobic bacteria were used. anaerobes were found in significant quantities in 39% of animal bite wounds, 50% of human bite wounds, and 56% of clenched-fist injuries. several species of anaerobes usually were present in the  wounds and always were present in mixed culture with aerobic oral flora. the anaerobes most commonly isolated included bacteroides asaccharolyticus, bacteroides bivius, bacteroides disiens, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, bacteroides ruminicola, bacteroides pneumosintes, bacteroides ureolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium russii, peptococcus species,  peptostreptococcus species, and veillonella species. initial, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bite wounds should be directed against potential anaerobic as well as aerobic pathogens.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial activity of clindamycin analogues: pirlimycin, 1,2 a  potent antibacterial agent.
AB  == the preparation of a series of analogues of clindamycin is described in which the naturally occurring five-membered cyclic amino acid amide portion of the molecule is replaced by a four-, six-, or seven-membered cyclic amino acid amide. the most interesting compound is pirlimycin (7e, u-57,930e), in which the (2s-trans)-4-n-propylhygramide portion of clindamycin is replaced by (2s-cis)-4-ethylpipecolamide. this structural modification results in significantly favorable changes in toxicity, metabolism, and antibacterial potency. although the in vitro antibacterial activity of clindamycin and pirlimycin are nearly identical, the latter compound is 2-20 times more active than clindamycin when administered to mice experimentally infected with strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and plasmodium berghei. pirlimycin is absorbed in rats and  mice following both subcutaneous and oral administration. it readily penetrates b. fragilis induced abscesses in mice and is sequestered within these abscesses.  a drug concentration of at least 60 times the required inhibitory concentration is maintained for 6 h following a single subcutaneous dose of 200 mg/kg. urinary  excretion of total bioactivity consists only of intact pirlimycin with no other antibacterially active metabolites being detected. pirlimycin is tolerated well in rats and mice at the administered levels.
