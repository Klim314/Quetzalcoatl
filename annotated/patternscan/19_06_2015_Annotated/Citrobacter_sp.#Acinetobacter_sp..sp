TI  == biosynthesis and characterization of silver nanoparticles using panchakavya, an indian traditional farming formulating agent.
AB  == synthesis of silver nanoparticles (agnps) with biological properties is of vast significance in the development of scientifically valuable products. in the present study, we describe simple, unprecedented, nontoxic, eco-friendly, green synthesis of agnps using an indian traditional farming formulating agent, panchakavya. silver nitrate (1 mm) solution was mixed with panchakavya filtrate for the synthesis of agnps. the nanometallic dispersion was characterized by surface plasmon absorbance measuring 430 nm. transmission electron microscopy showed the morphology and size of the agnps. scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the presence of agnps. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis revealed that proteins in the panchakavya were involved in the reduction and capping of agnps. in addition, we studied the antibacterial activity of synthesized agnps. the synthesized agnps (1-4 mm) extensively reduced the growth  rate of antibiotic resistant bacteria such as aeromonas sp., acinetobacter sp., and citrobacter sp., according to the increasing concentration of agnps.

TI  == are community environmental surfaces near hospitals reservoirs for gram-negative  nosocomial pathogens?
AB  == background: hospital visitors and staff visit neighboring businesses, creating the potential for contamination of surfaces with hospital flora. methods: cultures were obtained from environmental surfaces in hospital lobbies and the surrounding community of 6 hospitals in brooklyn, ny. as a control, cultures were taken from surfaces >1.5 miles from any hospital. screening for beta-lactamases was done by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and select isolates were fingerprinted by the repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-pcr method. results: of 493 cultures, most (70%) involved doors from local businesses. cephalosporin-resistant citrobacter freundii (n = 3), escherichia coli (n = 2), and enterobacter sp (n = 2) were recovered from surfaces near hospitals, but not  from control sites. one isolate of stenotrophomonas maltophilia harbored an integron-associated vim-2. acinetobacter baumannii was recovered in 15 samples, including 4.5% of swabs from </=0.5 miles of the hospitals versus 0% from >/=0.6  miles (p = .004). eleven a baumannii isolates were clonally related by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-pcr and were also related to a known clinical isolate. conclusions: strains of a baumannii and cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae can be recovered from environmental surfaces surrounding hospitals. finding these pathogens in the perihospital environment suggests hand  cleansing should be emphasized for all people entering and leaving hospitals. the finding of integron-associated vim-2 in our region is disconcerting, and further  vigilance is warranted.

TI  == molecular diversity of class 2 integrons in antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria found in wastewater environments in china.
AB  == the molecular architecture of class 2 integrons among gram-negative bacteria from wastewater environments was investigated in jinan, china. out of the 391 antibiotic-resistant bacteria found, 38 isolates harboring class 2 integrons encoding potentially transferrable genes that could confer antibiotic resistance  were found. these isolates were classified into 19 rep-pcr types. these strains were identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing and found to be as follows: proteus mirabilis (16), escherichia coli (7), providencia spp. (7), proteus spp.  (2), p. vulgaris (3), shigella sp. (1), citrobacter freundii (1), and acinetobacter sp. (1). their class 2 integron cassette arrays were amplified and  then either analyzed using pcr-rflp or sequenced. the typical array dfra1-sat2-aada1 was detected in 27 isolates. six atypical arrays were observed,  including three kinds of novel arrangements (linf2(attc1)-dfra1(attc2)-aada1-orf441 or linf2(attc1)-dfra1(attc2)-aada1, dfra1-catb2-sat2-aada1, and estx(vr)-sat2-aada1) and a hybrid with the 3'cs of class 1 integrons (dfra1-sat2-aada1-qach), and dfra1-sat1. twenty-four isolates were also found to carry class 1 integrons with 10 types of gene cassette arrays. several non-integron-associated antibiotic resistance genes were found, and their transferability was investigated. results showed that water sources in the jinan  region harbored a diverse community of both typical and atypical class 2 integrons, raising concerns about the overuse of antibiotics and their careless disposal into the environment.

TI  == de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy for bacteraemia due to difficult-to-treat  gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == purpose: to examine the status and clinical outcome of de-escalating antimicrobial therapy for bacteraemia due to hospital-acquired, gram-negative bacilli that are difficult to treat. methods: among 1,610 patients presenting with positive blood cultures collected at our medical centre over a 6-year period, 133 were infected with serratia, pseudomonas, acinetobacter, citrobacter  or enterobacter sp. (spaces). we examined the appropriateness of an empiric initial administration of antimicrobials based on in vitro sensitivity, and the success and outcomes of a pathogen-directed de-escalation of therapy. the treatment was considered to be successfully de-escalated when the antimicrobial spectrum was narrowed according to a spectrum ranking or when >/= 2 antimicrobials prescribed initially were lowered to one agent. outcome measures included persistent, recurrent and metastatic infections, infection-related deaths and cost of antimicrobials. results: the treatment was initially appropriate in 79 of 133 patients (59 %), of whom 49 (62 %) were candidates for and 28 (57 %) underwent treatment de-escalation. no treatment failure was observed among these 28 patients, while 2 of 11 patients (18 %) whose treatment was not de-escalated died (p = 0.13). the median cost of antimicrobials was <euro>250/patient lower in the de-escalated than in the non-de-escalated group (p < 0.001). conclusions: antimicrobial therapy for bacteraemia due to hard-to-treat spaces was de-escalated in 57 % of candidates, based on the in vitro sensitivity, with no deaths and significantly lower costs of antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == comparative analysis of fecal microflora of healthy full-term indian infants born with different methods of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean): acinetobacter sp. prevalence in vaginally born infants.
AB  == in this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (vb) and through cesarean section (cb) were investigated using culture-independent 16s rdna cloning and sequencing approach. the results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of vb infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart cb infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants  delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. the most abundant bacterial species present in vb infants were acinetobacter sp., bifidobacterium sp. and staphylococcus sp. however, cb infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with citrobacter sp., escherichia coli and clostridium difficile. the intestinal  microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of bifidobacteria species. an interesting finding of  our study was recovery of large number of acinetobacter sp. consisting of acinetobacter pittii (former acinetobacter genomic species 3), acinetobacter junii and acinetobacter baumannii in the vb infants clone library. among these, acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii (acb) complex. although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.

TI  == isolation of a selected microbial consortium capable of degrading methyl parathion and p-nitrophenol from a contaminated soil site.
AB  == a bacterial consortium with the ability to degrade methyl parathion and p-nitrophenol, using these compounds as the only carbon source, was obtained by selective enrichment in a medium with methyl parathion. samples were taken from moravia, medellin; an area that is highly contaminated, owing to the fact that it was used as a garbage dump from 1974 to 1982. acinetobacter sp, pseudomonas putida, bacillus sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa citrobacter freundii, stenotrophomonas sp, flavobacterium sp, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas sp, acinetobacter sp, klebsiella sp and proteus sp were the microorganisms identified within the consortium. in culture, the consortium was able to degrade 150 mg l(-)(1) of methyl-parathion and p-nitrophenol in 120 h, but after adding glucose  or peptone to the culture, the time of degradation decreased to 24 h. in soil, the consortium was also able to degrade 150 mg l(-)(1) of methyl parathion in 120 h at different depths and also managed to decrease the toxicity.

TI  == biodegradation potential of pure and mixed bacterial cultures for removal of 4-nitroaniline from textile dye wastewater.
AB  == environmentally toxic aromatic amines including nitroanilines are commonly generated in dye contaminated wastewater in which azo dyes undergo degradation under anaerobic conditions. the aim of this study was to develop a process for biological treatment of 4-nitroaniline. three bacteria identified as acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii and klebsiella oxytoca were isolated from enrichment cultures of activated sludge on 4-nitroaniline, after which the isolates and the mixed culture were studied to determine optimal conditions for biodegradation. hplc analyses showed the mixed culture was capable of complete removal of 100micromol/l of 4-nitroaniline within 72h under aerobic conditions. there was an inverse linear relationship (r(2)=0.96) between the rate of degradation (v) and 4-nitraoaniline concentrations [s] over 100-1000micromol/l. the bacterial culture was also capable of decolorizing structurally different azo dyes (acid red-88, reactive black-5, direct red-81, and disperse orange-3) and also degraded nitrobenzene. our findings show that enrichment cultures from activated sludge can be effective for the removal of dyes and their toxic intermediates, and that treatment may best be accomplished using an anaerobic-aerobic process.

TI  == characterization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in rendered animal products.
AB  == antibiotics are used in food animal production to treat diseases and also to improve performance. antibiotics are not used on all farms, and antibiotic resistance is occasionally found on farms that do not use antibiotics. rendered animal protein products are often included in poultry feeds and could potentially serve as a source of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. one hundred sixty-five rendered animal protein products from cattle, poultry, and fish were aseptically  collected from poultry feed mills. fifty-five percent of the poultry meal samples had detectable levels of gram-negative bacteria ranging from 40 to 10,440 colony-forming units/g of sample. poultry meal and meat and bone meal had the greatest number of samples with bacteria resistant to five or more antibiotics. a high percentage of feed samples (85%) contained bacteria resistant to amoxicillin, ampicillin, clavulanic acid, or cephalothin, whereas few samples contained bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. acinetobacter calcoaceticus, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter cloacae were the most commonly isolated antibiotic-resistant bacteria. isolation for salmonella was also performed, with 14% of the meat and bone meal samples containing salmonella sp. only one of the meat and bone meal isolates, salmonella livingstone, was resistant to five or more antibiotics. many of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria contained integrons, genetic elements that mediate multiple drug resistance.

TI  == sub-mic ciprofloxacin effect on fimbrial production by uropathogenic escherichia  coli strains.
AB  == the urine from 210 patients with acute urinary tract infection (uti) was examined to study the in vitro effect of ciprofloxacin on fimbriae production by uropathogenic escherichia coli isolates. forty-nine bacterial samples of density  10(5) cfu/ml were not considered. from the resulting 161 samples, e. coli was the major strain found, present in 54 samples. other microoganisms found were: enterococcus sp. (34 samples), staphylococcus epidermis (22), yeasts (11), proteus sp. (11), pseudomonas sp. (11), klebsiella sp. (8), enterobacter sp. (6), citrobacter sp. (3), and acinetobacter sp. (1). the uropathogenic e. coli strains found were p-fimbriated, as demonstrated by hemoagglutination activity against human erythrocytes with and without mannose, sds-page of fimbrial proteins and transmission electron microscopy (tem). all e. coli strains found were exposed in vitro to sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin (1/8 mic). our results showed that: 1) p-fimbriated e. coli is the most prevalent microorganism in acute uti (34%); 2) exposure to sub-mics of ciprofloxacin inhibits fimbrial production  in 79% of e. coli strains; 3) the pattern of sds-page fimbrial proteins is modified after exposure; in particular, the most affected synthesis involves the  protein at 18 kd known as p-fimbriae.

TI  == [in vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpirome compared to other broad-spectrum beta-lactam drugs against 804 clinical isolates from 9 brazilian hospitals].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the in vitro activity of the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefpirome in comparison to that of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and imipenem in a multicenter study involving nine hospitals from six  cities (four states). material and method: a total of 804 isolates from patients  hospitalized in either intensive care units or oncology/hematology units was evaluated. the isolates were collected between june and november of 1995, i.e. before cefpirome became commercially available in brazil, and susceptibility tested by broth microdilution following the nccls procedures. all isolates resistant to cefpirome were retested by e-test. results: against enterobacteriaceae (n = 344), cefpirome demonstrated an activity 2 to 32-fold higher than that of the third-generation cephalosporins (tgcs) and similar to that of imipenem. the percentages of enterobacteriaceae susceptible were: 88%, 69% and 96% for cefpirome, tgcs and imipenem, respectively. the cefpirome spectrum was greater or equal than that of imipenem against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, morganella morganii and serratia marcescens. against acinetobacter sp. (n = 77), cefpirome was slightly more active than ceftazidime;  however, the percentages of isolates resistant to these compounds were high (84%  and 88%, respectively). the activities of cefpirome, ceftazidime and imipenem were very similar against p. aeruginosa isolates (n = 128), with mic50(mg/ml)/percent susceptible of 8/59%, 8/62% and 4/62% respectively. against  aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the cefpirome activity was 4 to 16-fold higher than that of tgcs but 2 to 8-fold lower than that of imipenem. conclusion: the results suggest that, in brazil, cefpirome has a spectrum of activity which is higher than that of the tgcs against aerobic gram-negative (enterobacteriaceae and non-enterobacteriaceae) and gram-positive bacteria and similar to that of imipenem against some enterobacteriaceae species and p. aeruginosa.

AB  == background: in the last decade were in sr documented new problems in resistance to the newer antibiotics that with regard to their structure and antibacterial properties resisted to the known mechanism of bacterial resistance. the emergence of multiple drug resistance to the new betalactams is connected both with frequent application of these drugs in the hospitals and transfer of r plasmids.  methods and results: we studied composition and transferability of resistance to  newer betalactam antibiotics in strains of acinetobacter sp., enterobacter sp, and citrobacter sp. isolated during one month in patients from two teaching university hospitals. all strains studied were resistant to cefotaxime (ctx), ceftazidime (caz) and aztreonam (atm) but acinetobacter strains, although resistant also to caz and atm transferred the resistance to ctx only. thus, resistance to caz and atm has a chromosomal origin in these strains. a strain of  citrobacter sp., resistant to ctx, caz and atm, produced a esbl betalactamase detectable in a double-disk diffusion method (fig. 1). an enterobacter cloacae strain transfers directly the resistance to all new betalactams indicated. their  hydrolysis by these strains points to their production of new types of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases esbl). conclusions: we strongly recommend to be strictly rational in the use of new betalactams of ctx, cza or atm type because it is suspected that, especially in so-called empirical prophylaxis or treatment, they exert a strong selective pressure toward the prevalence of mutants with transferable esbl-producing nosocomial bacteria resistant to these drugs.

TI  == [use of aztreonam for the purpose of preventing postoperative purulent complications].
AB  == the efficacy of the prophylactic use of azthreonam, a monocyclic beta lactam antibiotic, was studied in 20 patients operated for liver diseases. the drug was  administered intramuscularly in a dose of 1 g 30 minutes prior to the operation.  during the postoperative period the drug was administered in a dose of 1 g 4-5 times a day for 4 to 5 days. the clinical effect in all the patients was good: no elevation of the body temperature above 37.5 degrees c and no suppuration of the  operation wound. adverse reaction to the treatment were not observed. 135 clinical isolates were tested for the susceptibility to azthreonam. the most susceptible gram-negative bacteria were the following: e coli (100 per cent), p.  mirabilis (100 per cent), m. morganii (100 per cent), p. rettgeri (100 per cent)  and citrobacter sp. (84 per cent). p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, p. vulgaris and  enterobacter were less susceptible (64, 50, 50 and 47.5 per cent respectively). all the s. aureus isolates were resistant.

TI  == a comparative study of the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux api20e and api20ne identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  == the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter (crystal, becton dickinson microbiology systems) is a new multi-test identification system for gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. one hundred and three selected  gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate api20e or api20ne (biomerieux) reading after overnight incubation. the isolates included in the study, and the number tested,  were as follows: acinetobacter sp, 8; aeromonas hydrophila, 1; citrobacter diversus, 1; citrobacter freundii, 1; escherichia coli, 13; enterobacter aerogenes, 10; enterobacter agglomerans, 2; enterobacter cloacae, 6; klebsiella oxytoca, 6; klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; morganella morganii, 2; proteus mirabilis, 6; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; salmonella sp, 2; salmonella typhi, 1; serratia marcescens, 1; shigella sonnei, 2; shigella sp, 2; vibrio metschnikovii, 1; xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, yersinia enterocolitica, 2. the api20e and api20ne systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the api systems compared to 3 with the crystal. crystal is more convenient than api for routine clinical use because it  requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

TI  == the danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  == two strains-s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. after application in the surgery ward, two enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. the resistant bacteria, b. cereus and 4 strains of ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. in hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. only one of them was s. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. most of them were isolated from the floor, but  also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. the most dangerous were three gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. they were isolated from the floor (enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (proteus mirabilis) and from the container  with oral mixture in infant ward (ps. malthophilia). many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), citrobacter freundi, ps. aeruginosa, ps. cepacia (2 strains), ps. maltophilia (2  strains) and moraxella. many resistant strains were also present on the walls (e. coli, ps. mirabilis, ps. cepacia, alcaligens, acinetobacter). the resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. klebsiella oxytoca and ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. acinetobacter and pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.

TI  == analysis of bacteriuria in patients with burns.
AB  == a detailed analysis of bacteriuria in 148 aged patients with burns was made for a period of 2 years (1991-92), in order to determine the incidence of the urine infections they sustained, the sources and mechanisms of the infections and the impact on the course and outcome of the primary disease. urine infection was found in 7.6 per cent (46 patients) of all patients treated for burns during the  study period; 39.1 per cent were community acquired uroinfection (cau) and 60.9 per cent were hospital acquired (hau). in addition there were eight patients with bacteriuria, secondary to a generalized bacterial infection (gbi), and 11 with candiduria associated with massive antibacterial therapy. leading causes of cau were the common uropathogens: e. coli, citrobacter and proteus sp.; those of hau  were multiresistant hospital strains, characteristic of the burns clinic: pseud.  aeruginosa, klebsiella sp., acinetobacter sp. and serratia sp. this study confirmed the role of transurethral catheterizations as factors associated with the development or exacerbation of chronic uroinfections, which increased the chances of non-survival, especially in aged people with concomitant chronic urological, nephrological or other underlying diseases. the causes of death in 20 patients with hau, cau, gbi and candiduria were analysed. the need for strict monitoring of burned patients at risk for uroinfection development and the need to take urgent preventive measures is emphasized.

TI  == resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in barbados.
AB  == resistance to third-generation, or extended-spectrum, cephalosporins caused by induction of class i beta-lactamases has been reported rarely from developing countries. seven isolates of cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative rods were recovered recently from urine, burns and ulcers in the queen elizabeth hospital,  barbados. the isolates were identified as acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2), citrobacter freundii (1), enterobacter cloacae (1), morganella morganii (1), providencia stuartii (1) and proteus sp. (1). induction of beta-lactamase by cefoxitin was demonstrated, and minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by agar dilution. beta-lactamases were demonstrated by isoelectric focusing; the presence of chromosomal beta-lactamases was confirmed in at least three of the resistant isolates. the only antibiotics which were uniformly active against these resistant strains were imipenem and ciprofloxacin. these data confirm the existence of resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins in barbados, and emphasise the necessity for continuous surveillance of resistance patterns in the caribbean region.

TI  == analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, plesiomonas and acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

TI  == epidemiological role of arthropods detectable in health facilities.
AB  == a total of 161 arthropod specimens were collected from 55 sites in a health care  facility during july and september 1990. of the 116 bacterial isolates obtained from their body surfaces 6% were from parasites (mosquitoes), 59% from eusynanthropic arthropods (tenebrionid beetles, flies, german cockroaches, wasps), 16% from hemisynanthropic arthropods (ants, spiders) and 19% from occasionally encountered insects (non-biting midges, moths, beetles). most (88%)  of the isolated bacteria were gram-negative rods of the species e. coli, enterobacter, klebsiella, citrobacter, proteus, serratia, pseudomonas and acinetobacter. gram-positive cocci accounted for 13% of isolates and were primarily represented by coagulase-negative staphylococci. the highest isolation  rates were from body surfaces of flies, german cockroaches, non-biting midges (chironomids) and tenebrionid beetles. about one third of all isolates were resistant to more than three antimicrobials using a standard disc diffusion assay. the presence of multiple resistance to antibiotics was observed in two thirds of enterobacter isolates, namely those of enterobacter cloacae from the body surface of germany cockroaches, in 13% of citrobacter spp and in 8% of klebsiella spp as well as acinetobacter calcoaceticus strains. strains of morganella and hafnia species were very infrequent but all of them shared resistance to the antibiotics tested. in contrast, strains of serratia spp were relatively antibiotic-sensitive. the group of isolated gram-positive organisms was represented by two strains of staphylococcus hominis and one strain of enterococcus sp, all of them were multiply-resistant to antimicrobials.

(1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

AB  == we reviewed cases of gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis in infants and children treated with cefotaxime at texas children's hospital from january, 1984, through june, 1989. seventeen of 20 children had an underlying condition predisposing to the development of meningitis. the etiologic organisms in these 20 children (2 days to 12 years old; median, 12 days old) were klebsiella sp, 9;  escherichia coli, 4; enterobacter cloacae, 3; citrobacter diversus, 2; other, 2.  with the exception of one isolate of acinetobacter, all isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime. in addition to cefotaxime 17 children received an aminoglycoside intravenously. children with meningitis caused by klebsiella sp. or non-klebsiella organisms received cefotaxime for 31 +/- 14 and 37 +/- 17 days, respectively. aminoglycosides were administered for 16 +/- 10 days in both groups. five children in each group also received intraventricular doses (1 to 25) of an aminoglycoside (9) or colistimethate (1). the mean durations of positive lumbar, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid or brain abscess cultures were 5.8 +/- 4.7 and 7.2 +/- 5.0 days after start of therapy in the klebsiella and non-klebsiella meningitis patients, respectively. only three children were normal at the time of discharge or follow-up. gram-negative enteric meningitis remains difficult to treat despite the excellent in vitro activity of cefotaxime against  gram-negative enterics, in part as a result of the predisposing conditions resulting in the development of this infection.

AB  == cefminox (cmnx), a new cephamycin, was administered by one shot intravenous injection twice daily with a dose of 1,000 mg each time for 5 days to seven healthy male volunteers whose ages ranged from 21 to 28 years (mean: 25 years) and body weights were from 60 to 92 kg mean: 72 kg). the effect of the drug on fecal bacterial flora was investigated and the concentrations of the drug in feces were measured on 5th day before the treatment, on 0, 3rd, and 5th day (the  final day of the treatment) during the treatment, and on 3rd, 5th, and 10th day after the treatment. antibiotic susceptibility tests of cmnx, cefmetazole (cmz) and cefotaxime (ctx) against several strains of organisms isolated from feces of  the seven volunteers were performed. clinical adverse reactions and effect on laboratory examinations were also investigated. the results of the study are described as follows. among enterobacteriaceae, populations of e. coli, klebsiella sp. and citrobacter sp. temporarily disappeared during the treatment of cmnx. after 5-day-treatment, that of citrobacter sp. transiently increased and the isolation of enterobacter sp. increased during treatment and up to 5 days after treatment, while those of proteus sp., h. alvei, or serratia sp. did not show a definite change. the mean enterobacteriaceae population in general was 10(8) to 10(9) cells/g feces, showing almost no variation, on all examination days except 5th day during treatment when these organisms were not isolated from  only one subject. no remarkable change was not found in populations of other isolated organisms including gram-negative bacilli; aeromonas sp., pseudomonas sp. and acinetobacter sp., and gram-positive bacteria; staphylococcus sp., enterococcus sp., micrococcus sp. and candida sp. among anaerobes, the mean population of bacteroides sp. was 10(10) to 10(11) cells/g feces, showing almost  no variation, and c. difficile was not isolated from any subject, however the toxin was detected in samples from 5 of 7 subjects; one subject showed always positive for toxin on all examination days; 1 on 5th day during treatment to 10th day after treatment; 2 on 5th and 10th day after treatment, and 1 only on 10th day after treatment.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  == ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. of all strains tested, only three (1 acinetobacter sp. and 2 pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin  resistant. ciprofloxacin was more active against escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter sp., proteus sp., shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. it was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa. it was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. it was as active as cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. the minimal  inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc's). ciprofloxacin's mic was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced  by anaerobic conditions. decrease of the medium ph increased the mic substantially. ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. these favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

AB  == susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (fos) was tested with mueller-hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms fos + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (g6p) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). for 3 411 strains, inhibition  zone diameters were recorded. almost all e. coli, citrobacter, salmonella and s.  aureus were susceptible to fos as well as 70% of serratia, e. cloacae, p. mirabilis and 50% of klebsiella and enterobacter sp. only 27% of p. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive proteus and 8% of acinetobacter were sensitive to fos. e.  coli, citrobacter and s. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to fos. sensitivity rates of e. cloacae, serratia, p. aeruginosa, and especially klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. this method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate g6p concentrations at this point of the disk.

TI  == [multicenter study of the antibacterial activity of a new cephalosporin: cm 40874].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of cm were evaluated on 2 548 bacterial strains isolated in 8 hospitals. cm demonstrated high activity on enterobacteriaceae, the mic being less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for 71% of the 1 362 strains tested, less than or equal to 1 for 99.6%, and less than or equal to 4 for 99.9%. mode mic varies little among the different groups of enterobacteriaceae (from 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms/ml), with the exception of serratia sp. (mode mic : 0.25) and klebsiella oxytoca (mode mic : 0.03). most of  enterobacter, serratia, and citrobacter sp. strains not inhibited by cefotaxime are readily inhibited by cm at the same concentrations than susceptible strains.  cm has less activity on p. aeruginosa (mic 2-32 micrograms/ml) and acinetobacter  sp. (mic 8-128). staphylococci (mic 32) and enterococci are not susceptible. variable activity is found against other streptococci. cm inhibits haemophilus sp. at mics of 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml and gonococci at mics of 0.03 to 0.5 (whether the strains produce beta-lactamase or not). meningococci have a mode mic of 0.03 micrograms/ml (range 0.008 to 0.25). thus, cm 40874 is a new third generation cephalosporin with high activity on enterobacteriaceae, including those strains not susceptible to cefotaxime and good activity on haemophilus sp.  and neisseria sp. this additional activity is probably supported by enhanced resistance to enzymatic inactivation by beta-lactamases.

TI  == [pathogen distribution in waste water sprinkler irrigation].
AB  == the spray irrigation with pretreated wastewater was investigated on the sewage farm of the braunschweig sewage utilization association. the emission of airborne bacteria was measured by means of andersen sampler (as), reuter centrifugal sampler (rcs), and sedimentation plates (sp). there was a good correlation of results obtained by parallel measurings of as and rcs. the rcs was more effective by the factor 11.5 than the as sampling airborne microorganisms. however, the as  gaves the distribution curve of differently big airborne particulates (table 1).  the medium decrease of bacteria from the sprinkler determined by as and sp was similar (fig. 1). with low wind velocity, an aerosol containing enterobacteria was yet detectable at a distance of 60-160 m down-wind from the spray sprinkler.  the transport of bacteria as a function of the wind velocity is given in fig. 2 increasing about 25 m for an increase of the wind velocity of 1 m/sec. during the spray irrigation, the composition of bacteria in the airborne particles is varying continuously. the following order of succession of die-away rates was found: aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio greater than acinetobacter, pseudomonas greater than enterobacter greater than citrobacter greater than e. coli greater than klebsiella greater than gram-positive bacteria (table 3). only seldom and under extreme conditions, gram-negative bacteria were detected in a range between 200-300 m beyond of concentrations as they were found also in controls without irrigation. this result substantiates a minimum protective distance of 300 m between sprinkler and human settlements.

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftizoxime on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == the susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. additionally, the mic of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. the majority of enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at  a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode mic varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. a few enterobacter and citrobacter strains are resistant. little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively).  haemophilus sp. (mic 0.01-0.03) and neisseria (mic less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. the mic of methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other streptococci and pneumococci have low mics (less than  0.008-0.025). the susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; mic ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for bacteroides sp.

TI  == inhibitory and bactericidal activities of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the activity of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound, against 147 strains of microorganisms was studied and was compared with the activities of cinoxacin, trimethoprim, amikacin, and four beta-lactam antimicrobials. the minimal concentration at which 90% of strains were inhibited by amifloxacin was lowest for escherichia coli and klebsiella sp (less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml), followed by proteus sp (less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml),  enterobacter sp and citrobacter sp (less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml), providencia sp (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia sp, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus var anitratus (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). when compared with the ranges of activity of seven  reference antimicrobials, the range of amifloxacin activity was lowest for p aeruginosa, citrobacter sp, proteus sp, and a calcoaceticus var anitratus and similar to aztreonam's activity against enterobacter sp. for amikacin-resistant p aeruginosa, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of amifloxacin ranged from 1 to 16 micrograms/ml. the mics and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of amifloxacin were similar. for all strains tested, microbial susceptibilities to amifloxacin were greater than those to currently available oral antimicrobial drugs, such as cinoxacin and trimethoprim.

TI  == direct dilution sampling, quantitation, and microbial assessment of open-system ventilation circuits in intensive care units.
AB  == in a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (bennett ma-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (apha guidelines) dilutions. the paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (p less than 0.001). seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. the direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) cfu/ml. high densities of organisms frequently  were found. sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. the contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas maltophilia, and flavobacterium meningosepticum. fermenters were klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and enterobacter agglomerans. infrequently, gram-positive streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were noted.

AB  == a quantitative culture technique (hand washed in a glove containing broth for 30  s) was used to determine the frequency of hand carriage of aerobic gram-negative  rods by various groups of health care workers and 104 control subjects. overall,  31% of health care workers carried aerobic gram-negative rods on their hands compared to 59% of control subjects (p < 0.001). enterobacter agglomerans accounted for 40% of the isolates, and other enterobacter spp. 7%. other organisms included acinetobacter calcoaceticus 21%, serratia spp. 11%, klebsiella spp. 10%, moraxella spp. 3%, pseudomonas spp. 3%, proteus spp. 1.5%, escherichia  coli 1%; morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, aeromonas sp. and an isolate  that was not speciated accounted for 0.5% each. we conclude that endemic hand carriage of aerobic gram-negative rods by health care personnel is common, but significantly less than that of control subjects. enterobacter agglomerans is found so frequently on the hands of control subjects that it must be considered part of the normal hand flora.

TI  == reliability of early identifications obtained with enterobacteriaceae-plus biochemical cards in the automicrobic system.
AB  == the automicrobic system (ams) is capable of identifying most enterobacteriaceae within 8 h and many glucose-nonfermenting, gram-negative bacilli after 13 h of incubation. early preliminary results can be readily obtained from the computer as the tests incubate. data with 1,023 bacterial isolates were reviewed to determine the relative accuracy of 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 13-h identifications. all automicrobic system identifications with probability (p) values of less than 0.80 were considered equivocal responses which needed supplementary tests before a final report could be issued. analysis of our data suggests that early identifications of morganella morganii, acinetobacter sp., yersinia spp., salmonella spp. (other than salmonella typhi), shigella spp. (other than shigella sonnei), enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas spp. (other than pseudomonas aeruginosa or pseudomonas maltophilia), klebsiella spp. (other than klebsiella pneumoniae or klebsiella oxytoca), citrobacter amalonauticus, serratia liquefaciens, or vibrio spp. should be considered nonspecific responses, even when p greater than or equal to 0.80. other identifications reported after 4 h were 96% accurate. at least half of our isolates (60% of our enterobacteriaceae)  could be identified reliably within 4 h, the remaining isolates required longer incubation.

TI  == homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the mrna for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the ecori and one of the hindiii restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total dna from nine bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae: e. coli, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes,  edwardsiella tarda, serratia marcescens, and erwinia amylovora. however, among the enterobacteriaceae, dna from two species of proteus (p. mirabilis and p. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized  with the e. coli lipoprotein mrna. furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in  four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae: pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp. ho1-n, caulobacter crescentus, and myxococcus xanthus. envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified e. coli free-form lipoprotein in the ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. both species of proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. all of the above four bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-e. coli lipoprotein serum. from these results, the rate of  evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that  observed for various soluble enzymes of the enterobacteriaceae.
