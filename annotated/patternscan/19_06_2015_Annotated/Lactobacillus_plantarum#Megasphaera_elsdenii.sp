TI  == changes in ruminal bacterial community composition following feeding of alfalfa ensiled with a lactic acid bacterial inoculant.
AB  == some silage inoculants help to improve silage quality and promote an increase in  milk production, possibly through altering the rumen microflora. we hypothesized  that rumen bacterial community composition (bcc) would be different in cows fed alfalfa ensiled with the inoculant lactobacillus plantarum mtd/1 (lp) compared with those fed alfalfa ensiled without the inoculant (ctrl). eight ruminally cannulated holstein cows were allotted to 2 diets (ctrl or lp) in a double crossover design with four 28-d periods. diets were formulated to contain (% dry  matter basis) 28.0% neutral detergent fiber and 16.2% crude protein, and contained alfalfa silage, 50.9; corn silage, 20.6; high-moisture shelled corn, 21.4; soy hulls, 4.7; plus minerals and vitamins, 2.4. ruminal digesta were collected just before feeding on 3 consecutive days near the end of each period,  and were separated into solid and liquid phases. microbial dna was extracted from each phase, amplified by pcr using domain-level bacterial primers, and subjected  to automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis. the ph was 4.56 and 4.86 and the lactate-to-acetate ratio 9.8 and 4.4, respectively, for the treated and untreated alfalfa silages. dry matter intakes and milk production data were not influenced by diets but showed a cow effect. total volatile fatty acids (mm) tended to be greater for lp compared with ctrl. individual volatile fatty acids were not influenced by diets but showed a significant cow effect. ruminal acetate (mol/100 mol) and acetate-to-propionate ratio were lower and propionate (mol/100  mol) greater for the 2 milk fat-depressed (mfd; <3.2% fat content) cows compared  with the other 6 cows. correspondence analysis of the 265 peaks in the automated  ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis profile across the 188 samples revealed that the first 2 components contributed 7.1 and 3.8% to the total variation in the profile. the ordination points representing the liquid and solid phases clustered separately, indicating that these phases differed in bcc. the analysis of similarity data showed differences between ctrl and lp. the lactic acid bacterial counts (log(10) cfu/g of wet silage) were 3.94 and 4.53 for the untreated and treated silage, respectively, at ensiling. the relative population size (rps) of  l. plantarum, determined by real-time pcr of 16s rrna gene copies, was greater in lp compared with ctrl. the ordination points corresponding to certain individual  cows clustered separately, and the most distinctive bacterial communities were those associated with mfd cows. the rps of megasphaera elsdenii was greater in 1  of the 2 mfd cows, although mean rps of m. elsdenii did not differ between the treatments. in addition to the differences in rumen bcc between lp and ctrl, mfd  cows also displayed differences in bcc compared with cows with normal milk fat yield.

TI  == oral administration of lactobacillus plantarum lq80 and megasphaera elsdenii inp-001 induces efficient recovery from mucosal atrophy in the small and the large intestines of weaning piglets.
AB  == weaning causes atrophy of intestinal mucosa and a drop of iga protection in piglets which increases vulnerability to pathogenic infections. probiotic lactobacilli may support recovery from such weaning stresses. butyrate-produce bacteria may support the growth of colonic mucosa. megasphaera elsdenii, a lactate-utilizing butyrate producer, may help butyrate production particularly when combined with lactobacilli. weaned piglets (experiment 1: 20 days old, experiment 2: 28 days old) were orally dosed once a day with either (l) 10(10) (cell/dose) l. plantarum lq80, or (lm) 10(10) (cell/dose) lq80 with 10(9) (cell/dose) m. elsdenii inp-001. lq80 was contained in capsules resistant to gastric digestion. m. elsdenii was contained in capsules resistant to gastric and intestinal digestion. an untreated control (c) was also prepared. after 2 weeks of administration, l. plantarum enhanced the recovery from the villous atrophy in both experiments. the rectal and colonic iga tended to be higher in l and lm than in c in experiment 1. colonic butyrate was higher in lm than in the others in experiment 1. the thickness of the colonic mucosa was greater in lm than in the others in experiment 1. in early weaned piglets, the effects of l. plantarum and  m. elsdenii were clear.
