TI  == heterologous gene expression in campylobacter coli: the use of bacterial luciferase in a promoter probe vector.
AB  == a novel promoter probe plasmid (psp73) was constructed to allow the analysis of environmentally regulated gene expression in campylobacter. the vector utilizes the luxab genes from xenorhabdus luminescens, which encode a thermostable luciferase, as reporters of gene expression. the utility of this reporter system  was demonstrated by placing the expression of luxab under the transcriptional control of the flaa gene promoter.
