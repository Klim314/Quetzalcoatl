TI  == multidrug resistance gene deficient (mdr1a-/-) mice have an altered caecal microbiota that precedes the onset of intestinal inflammation.
AB  == aim: to compare caecal microbiota from mdr1a(-/-) and wild type (fvb) mice to identify differences in the bacterial community that could influence the intestinal inflammation. methods and results: caecal microbiota of mdr1a(-/-) and fvb mice were evaluated at 12 and 25 weeks of age using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and quantitative real-time pcr. dgge fingerprints of fvb and mdr1a(-/-) mice (with no intestinal inflammation) at 12 weeks revealed differences in the presence of dna fragments identified as bacteroides fragilis,  b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus and an uncultured alphaproteobacterium. escherichia coli and acinetobacter sp. were only identified in dgge profiles of mdr1a(-/-) mice at 25 weeks (with severe intestinal inflammation), which also had a lower number of total bacteria in the caecum compared with fvb mice at same age. conclusions: differences found in the caecal microbiota of fvb and mdr1a(-/-) mice (12 weeks) suggest that the lack of abcb1 transporters in intestinal cells due to the disruption of the mdr1a gene might lead to changes in the caecal microbiota. the altered microbiota along with the genetic defect could contribute to the development of intestinal inflammation in mdr1a(-/-) mice. significance and impact of the study: differences in caecal microbiota of mdr1a(-/-) and fvb mice (12 weeks) suggest genotype specific colonization. the results provide evidence that abcb1 transporters may regulate host interactions with commensal bacteria. future work is needed to identify the mechanisms involved in this possible cross-talk between the host intestinal cells and microbiota.

TI  == new antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  == background: surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. methods: this paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition.  results: patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring  healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against mrsa, vre, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csssi) and intra-abdominal infections. oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for csssi due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. ci-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against gram-positive aerobic organisms including staphylococcus aureus (mics 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mics 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (mics 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (mics 2 mg/l). all three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas sp., haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly less than 1 mg/l). the other gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for acinetobacter and  pseudomonas aeruginosa mics seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. ci-934 was more active than enoxacin against gardnerella vaginalis (mics 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. bacteroides species (including about half of the  fragilis group) were susceptible to ci-934 (mics mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin  had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to ci-934 (mics 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less  susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.

TI  == [multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (n-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of 230 clinical isolates, including 55 anaerobic bacteria, was tested with ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin. ceftazidime was the most active drug against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. against enterobacteriaceae, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were similar to cefotaxime, moxalactam, and cefoperazone and more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin. cefoxitin and moxalactam were significantly more active against bacteroides fragilis than were the other beta-lactam drugs. against staphylococcus aureus, ceftriaxone showed moderate activity, while ceftazidime was relatively inactive. these results indicate a potential role for ceftazidime  and ceftriaxone against infections involving facultative and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
