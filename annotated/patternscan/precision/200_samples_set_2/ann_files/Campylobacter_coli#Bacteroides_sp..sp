TI  == gastrointestinal symptoms in travellers.
AB  == diarrhoea is probably the single most common medical complaint in returning travellers. the most common pathogens are entero-toxigenic escherichia coli, shigella, salmonella and campylobacter. viruses, toxigenic arcobacter and bacteroides fragilis, as well as parasites such as cryptosporidium sp, are increasingly recognised but are not tested for in most diagnostic laboratories. blood in stools is a sign of invasive disease and should trigger exclusion of invasive amoebic disease. the use of empiric antibiotics may shorten illness but  is complicated by the diversity of bacterial causes and emerging resistance.

TI  == [traveller's diarrhea: epidemiology, clinical practice guideline for the prevention and treatment].
AB  == bacterial causes are predominant: enterotoxigenic (etec) ou enteroadherent escherichia coli, salmonella sp., shigella sp., campylobacter jejuni, acrobacter  sp., enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis. prevention relies on the hand and food hygiene standards (heat-cooked meals). watery diarrhea (toxigenic enterocolitis)  is the most frequent clinical presentation associated with a risk of dehydration; the body temperature is normal except in cases of severe dehydration. less frequent are invasive enterocolitis presenting as acute febrile diarrhea with dysentery (abdominal cramps, tenesmus, stools blended with mucus and blood): salmonellosis, shigellosis. bacteremia may occur in immunocompromised patients. early rehydration is essential with oral rehydration solutions (ors) consisting of salt, sugar and water. antibiotics should be reserved for invasive enterocolitis with fever and dysentery, profuse diarrhea with more than three liquid stools within 12 hours. duration of antibiotherapy varies from 1 to 5 days.

TI  == helicobacter acinonyx sp. nov., isolated from cheetahs with gastritis.
AB  == four strains of a novel helicobacter species were isolated from the stomachs of cheetahs (acinonyx jubilatus) with gastritis. these isolates were phenotypically  similar to helicobacter pylori. the isolates were gram-negative, spiral bacteria  which grew under microaerophilic conditions at 37 degrees c, but not at 25 or 42  degrees c, and produced urease, catalase, oxidase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. the isolates did not ferment glucose, mannitol, inositol, sorbitol, rhamnose, sucrose, melibiose, amygdalin, or arabinose; hydrolyze hippurate or indoxyl acetate; or reduce nitrate. they did not produce h2s from triple sugar iron agar, and they did not grow in the presence of 1.0% glycine or 1.5% nacl. they were resistant to nalidixic acid and sensitive to cephalothin and metronidazole. cells were typically 0.3 by 2.0 microns and possessed tufts of two to five sheathed, monopolar flagella. the g+c content of strain 90-119 was 30 mol%. cluster analysis of densitometry scans of polyacrylamide protein gels revealed more than 70% similarity of the cheetah isolates to h. pylori, less than 60% similarity to helicobacter felis, and less than 50% similarity to helicobacter mustelae. complete 16s rrna sequences were determined for two of the cheetah isolates. phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the cheetah sequences to those of 19 reference strains, including h. pylori, h. felis (two strains), h. mustelae, helicobacter muridarum, "flexispira  rappini," wolinella succinogenes, campylobacter coli, campylobacter concisus, campylobacter curvus, campylobacter fetus, campylobacter hyointestinalis, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter lari, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum subsp. bubulus, a campylobacter sp. (pig isolate), [bacteroides] gracilis, and [bacteroides] ureolyticus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == revision of campylobacter, helicobacter, and wolinella taxonomy: emendation of generic descriptions and proposal of arcobacter gen. nov.
AB  == hybridization experiments were carried out between dnas from more than 70 strains of campylobacter spp. and related taxa and either 3h-labeled 23s rrnas from reference strains belonging to campylobacter fetus, campylobacter concisus, campylobacter sputorum, campylobacter coli, and campylobacter nitrofigilis, an unnamed campylobacter sp. strain, and a wolinella succinogenes strain or 3h- or 14c-labeled 23s rrnas from 13 gram-negative reference strains. an immunotyping analysis of 130 antigens versus 34 antisera of campylobacters and related taxa was also performed. we found that all of the named campylobacters and related taxa belong to the same phylogenetic group, which we name rrna superfamily vi and which is far removed from the gram-negative bacteria allocated to the five rrna superfamilies sensu de ley. there is a high degree of heterogeneity within this rrna superfamily. organisms belonging to rrna superfamily vi should be reclassified in several genera. we propose that the emended genus campylobacter should be limited to campylobacter fetus, campylobacter hyointestinalis, campylobacter concisus, campylobacter mucosalis, campylobacter sputorum, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli, campylobacter lari, and "campylobacter  upsaliensis." wolinella curva and wolinella recta are transferred to the genus campylobacter as campylobacter curvus comb. nov. and campylobacter rectus comb. nov., respectively. bacteroides gracilis and bacteroides ureolyticus are generically misnamed and are closely related to the genus campylobacter. campylobacter nitrofigilis, campylobacter cryaerophila, and an unnamed campylobacter sp. strain constitute a new genus, for which the name arcobacter is proposed; this genus contains two species, arcobacter nitrofigilis comb. nov. (type species) and arcobacter cryaerophilus comb. nov. wolinella succinogenes so  far is the only species of the genus wolinella. the genus helicobacter is also emended; campylobacter cinaedi and campylobacter fennelliae are included in this  genus as helicobacter cinaedi comb. nov. and helicobacter fennelliae comb. nov.,  respectively. the genus "flexispira," with "flexispira rappini" as the only species, is closely related to the genus helicobacter. the free-living, sulfur-reducing campylobacters do not belong to any of these genera; they probably constitute a distinct genus within rrna superfamily vi.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == in vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. a total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). ofloxacin was highly active against e. coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, salmonella sp., campylobacter jejuni, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, eubacterium sp., propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus sp. pseudomonas sp., serratia sp. and proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. high percentages of resistance to ofloxacin  were found only for providencia sp., proteus rettgeri and bacteroides fragilis. with regard to streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and mic determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
