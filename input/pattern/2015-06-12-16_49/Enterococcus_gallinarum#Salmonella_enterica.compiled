TI  - Analysis of bacterial diversity during the fermentation of inyu, a high-temperature fermented soy sauce, using nested PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and the plate count method.
AB  - The diversity of bacteria associated with the fermentation of inyu, also known as black soy sauce, was studied through the nested PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of samples collected from the fermentation stages of the inyu production process. The DGGE profiles targeted the bacterial 16S rDNA and revealed the presence of Citrobacter farmeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pantoea agglomerans, Salmonella enterica, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus sciuri and Weissella confusa. The bacterial compositions of 4 fermented samples were further elucidated using the plate count method. The bacteria isolated from the koji-making stage exhibited the highest diversity; Brachybacterium rhamnosum, E. hormaechei, K. pneumoniae, Kurthia gibsonii, Pantoea dispersa, Staphylococcus gallinarum, Staphylococcus kloosii and S. sciuri were identified. Koji collected during the preincubation stage presented the largest cell counts, and E. hormaechei, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and Enterobacter pulveris were identified. In brine samples aged for 7 and 31 days, the majority of the bacteria isolated belonged to 4 Bacillus species, but 4 Staphylococcus species and Delftia tsuruhatensis were also detected. This study demonstrates the benefits of using a combined approach to obtain a more complete picture of microbial populations and provides useful information for the control or development of bacterial flora during inyu fermentation.
TI  - Expression of the avian-specific toll-like receptor 15 in chicken heterophils is  mediated by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, but not TLR agonists.
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a critical component of the innate immune response of mammalian and avian species. While most mammalian TLRs have been well characterized, the chicken-specific TLR15 has not been extensively studied. We recently demonstrated that TLR15 is differentially expressed between Salmonella-susceptible-and-resistant chickens, indicating a potential role in the innate immune response to infection with Salmonella. The aim of the present study was to gain better insight into the nature of the ligand for TLR15 by characterizing gene expression patterns of TLR15 by heterophils in response to numerous bacterial-derived TLR agonists LPS, flagellin, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, lipotechoic acid (LTA), peptidoglycan (PGN), and Pam3CSK4 (PAM), stimulation with live Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE-used as a positive control), chicken isolates of Escherichia coli (EC) and Enterococcus gallinarum (EG), the equine-specific pathogen Rhodococcus equi, and stimulation with heat-killed, and formalin-killed SE, EC, and EG. TLR15 expression increased significantly in response to stimulation with live, heat-killed and formalin-killed SE, EC, and EG, but was unaffected by stimulation with known TLR agonists and R. equi. Overall, these observations demonstrate that the individual TLR agonists are not the ligand for TLR15, and that TLR15 recognizes a unique, non-secreted, heat-stabile component of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria commonly found in and/or capable of causing disease in chickens.
TI  - Detoxification of benzidine-based azo dye by E. gallinarum: time-course study.
AB  - Direct black 38 (DB38) dye is a well-established toxic and carcinogenic compound. Present investigation reports isolation of an Enterococcus gallinarum strain capable of decolorizing and degrading it. Changes in toxicity and mutagenicity of DB38 and its metabolites were also determined using a battery of carefully selected tests (cytotoxicity, respiration inhibition test and Ames test). Toxicity assays were carried out on E. gallinarum itself as this also gave information about suitability of this strain for the dye decolorization operation. The strain was found to reduce both toxicity and mutagenicity of DB38 metabolites. Benzidine and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) were identified as the DB38 metabolites, responsible for its toxic and mutagenic properties, by HPLC-MS analysis. Further degradation of benzidine and 4-ABP was found to result in the decrease in toxicity and mutagenicity.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of Enterococcus strains obtained from a probiotic product on in vitro growth of Salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis strain IFO3313.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus gallinarum strains were isolated from a commercial probiotic product and the effects of these strains on the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis strain IFO3313 were investigated. Viable cell counts of Salmonella Enteritidis in mixed cultures with the probiotic product isolate of E. faecium were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than those in pure cultures after 6, 8, and 24 h when the cultures were incubated in heart infusion broth at 37 and 41 degrees C. Significant differences in viable cell counts of Salmonella Enteritidis in mixed cultures with the probiotic product isolate of E. gallinarum and those in pure cultures were also observed after 8 and 24 h at 37 and 41degrees C. Similar observations were shown in mixed cultures of Salmonella Enteritidis with the reference strains of E. faecium GIFU8355 and E. gallinarum ATCC 49573. Significant differences in viable cell counts of these enterococcal strains were not shown among pure and mixed cultures with Salmonella Enteritidis. The pH values in pure and mixed cultures were 7.0 or 7.5 throughout the experiments. E. faecium strains were found to harbor the genes encoding enterocins A and B and showed inhibitory zones with a diameter of 4 to 6 mm against growth of Salmonella Enteritidis in the enterocin production assays. However, the E. gallinarum strains possessed neither of the enterocin genes tested and exhibited no inhibition zone in the enterocin production assays. These results indicated that enterococcal strains exhibit inhibitory effects on the growth of Salmonella Enteritidis and these effects were due to both enterocin and nonenterocin factors.
TI  - Detection of low levels of Listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  - Biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. An antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of Listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. The principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture Listeria cells on the fiber. Capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. A cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, C11E9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by launching a 635-nm laser light from an Analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. This immunosensor was specific for L. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other Listeria species or other microorganisms, including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Lactobacillus plantarum, Carnobacterium gallinarum, Hafnia alvei, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. Fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. The sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) CFU/ml for a pure culture of L. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees C. When L. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees C with 3.5% NaCl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) CFU/ml, respectively. In less than 24 h, this method could detect L. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 CFU/g after enrichment in buffered Listeria enrichment broth.
