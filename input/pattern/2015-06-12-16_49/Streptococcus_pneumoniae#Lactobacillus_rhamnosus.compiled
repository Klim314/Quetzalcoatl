TI  - A tyrosine phosphorylation switch controls the interaction between the transmembrane modulator protein Wzd and the tyrosine kinase Wze of Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: One proposed mechanism for assembly of secreted heteropolysaccharides by many Gram positive bacteria relies on the coordinated action of a polymerization complex through reversible phosphorylation events. The role of the tyrosine protein kinase transmembrane modulator is, however, not well understood. RESULTS: The protein sequences deduced from the wzb, wzd and wze genes from Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 9595 and RW-9595 M contain motifs also found in corresponding proteins CpsB, CpsC and CpsD from Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 (serotype 2). Use of an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody demonstrated that both Wzd and Wze can be found in tyrosine phosphorylated form. When tyrosine 266 was mutated to phenylalanine, WzdY266F showed slightly less phosphorylated protein than those produced by using eight other tyrosine mutated Wzd genes, when expressed along with Wze and Wzb in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363. In order to demonstrate the importance of ATP for the interactions among these proteins, native and fusion Wzb, Wzd and Wze proteins were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli cultures. The modulator protein, Wzd, binds with the phosphotyrosine kinase Wze, irrespective of its phosphorylation status. However, Wze attained a higher phosphorylation level after interacting with phosphorylated Wzd in the presence of 10 mM ATP. This highly phosphorylated Wze did not remain in close association with phosphorylated Wzd. CONCLUSION: The Wze tyrosine kinase protein of Lactobacillus rhamnosus thus carries out tyrosine phosphorylation of Wzd in addition to auto- and trans- phosphorylation of the kinase itself.
TI  - Non-viable immunobiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 and its peptidoglycan improve systemic and respiratory innate immune response during recovery of immunocompromised-malnourished mice.
AB  - The effect of non-viable Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 and its cell wall and peptidoglycan on respiratory immunity in malnourished mice was studied. Weaned mice were malnourished with a protein-free diet for 21d and received BCD during 7d (BCD) or BCD with nasal non-viable L. rhamnosus CRL1505 (BCD+UV) or its cell wall (BCD+CW) or peptidoglycan (BCD+PG) supplementation during last 2d of the treatment. Malnourished mice without treatment (MNC) and well-nourished mice (WNC) were used as controls. Mice were infected nasally with Streptococcus pneumoniae after treatments. Resistance against pneumococci was reduced in MNC mice. Repletion with BCD reduced lung and blood bacterial cell counts when compared to MNC mice but the counts did not reach the levels of the WNC group. However, when malnourished mice received BCD+UV, BCD+CW or BCD+PG, pneumococci was not detected in lung or blood samples. Pneumococcal infection increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10 in the respiratory tract, however the values were lower in MNC than in WNC mice. BCD+UV and BCD+PG groups showed values of phagocytes, IL-1beta and IL-6 that were similar to WNC mice, while TNF-alpha was significantly higher in those groups when compared to WNC mice. Moreover, BCD+UV and BCD+PG treatments improved levels of respiratory IL-10, reaching values that were superior to those observed in WNC mice. The work demonstrates for the first time that non-viable probiotic bacteria or their cellular fractions could be an interesting alternative as mucosal immunomodulators, especially in immunocompromised hosts in which the use of live bacteria might be dangerous.
TI  - Modulation of the inflammation-coagulation interaction during pneumococcal pneumonia by immunobiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505: role of Toll-like receptor 2.
AB  - The present study evaluated the effect of nasally given Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 on the immunocoagulative response during pneumococcal infection in immunocompetent mice. In addition, we aimed to gain insight into the mechanism involved in the immunomodulatory effect of the L. rhamnosus CRL1505 strain by evaluating the role of TLR2. Results showed that nasally given L. rhamnosus CRL1505 effectively regulates inflammation and hemostatic alterations during the pneumococcal infection. Immunobiotic treatment significantly reduced permeability of the bronchoalveolar-capillary barrier, and general cytotoxicity, decreasing lung tissue damage. The CRL1505 strain improved the production of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-10 after pneumococcal challenge. In addition, increased TM and TF expressions were found in lungs of L. rhamnosus CRL1505-treated mice. Moreover, we demonstrated, for the first time, that the TLR2 signaling pathway has a role in the induction of IFN-gamma and IL-10 and in the reduction of TF. The results also allow us to speculate that a PRR, other than TLR2, may mediate the immunobiotic activity of L. rhamnosus CRL1505 and could explain changes in TNF-alpha and TM.
TI  - Dietary supplementation with Lactobacilli improves emergency granulopoiesis in protein-malnourished mice and enhances respiratory innate immune response.
AB  - This work studied the effect of protein malnutrition on the hemato-immune response to the respiratory challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae and evaluated whether the dietary recovery with a probiotic strain has a beneficial effect in that response. Three important conclusions can be inferred from the results presented in this work: a) protein-malnutrition significantly impairs the emergency myelopoiesis induced by the generation of the innate immune response against pneumococcal infection; b) repletion of malnourished mice with treatments including nasally or orally administered Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 are able to significantly accelerate the recovery of granulopoiesis and improve innate immunity and; c) the immunological mechanisms involved in the protective effect of immunobiotics vary according to the route of administration. The study demonstrated that dietary recovery of malnourished mice with oral or nasal administration of L. rhamnosus CRL1505 improves emergency granulopoiesis and that CXCR4/CXCR12 signaling would be involved in this effect. Then, the results summarized here are a starting point for future research and open up broad prospects for future applications of probiotics in the recovery of immunocompromised malnourished hosts.
TI  - Structural determinants for ligand capture by a class II preQ1 riboswitch.
AB  - Prequeuosine (preQ1) riboswitches are RNA regulatory elements located in the 5' UTR of genes involved in the biosynthesis and transport of preQ1, a precursor of the modified base queuosine universally found in four tRNAs. The preQ1 class II (preQ1-II) riboswitch regulates preQ1 biosynthesis at the translational level. We present the solution NMR structure and conformational dynamics of the 59 nucleotide Streptococcus pneumoniae preQ1-II riboswitch bound to preQ1. Unlike in the preQ1 class I (preQ1-I) riboswitch, divalent cations are required for high-affinity binding. The solution structure is an unusual H-type pseudoknot featuring a P4 hairpin embedded in loop 3, which forms a three-way junction with the other two stems. (13)C relaxation and residual dipolar coupling experiments revealed interhelical flexibility of P4. We found that the P4 helix and flanking adenine residues play crucial and unexpected roles in controlling pseudoknot formation and, in turn, sequestering the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Aided by divalent cations, P4 is poised to act as a "screw cap" on preQ1 recognition to block ligand exit and stabilize the binding pocket. Comparison of preQ1-I and preQ1-II riboswitch structures reveals that whereas both form H-type pseudoknots and recognize preQ1 using one A, C, or U nucleotide from each of three loops, these nucleotides interact with preQ1 differently, with preQ1 inserting into different grooves. Our studies show that the preQ1-II riboswitch uses an unusual mechanism to harness exquisite control over queuosine metabolism.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 beneficially modulates the immuno-coagulative response after pneumococcal infection in immunocompromised malnourished mice.
AB  - This work evaluated the effect of orally or nasally administered Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 on the resistance of immunocompromised protein-malnourished mice to pneumococcal infection. In particular, we aimed to gain knowledge of the mechanism involved in the immunomodulatory effect of L. rhamnosus CRL1505 in malnourished hosts by evaluating its impact on the immuno-coagulative response. Malnutrition significantly increased lung tissue damage caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Lung damage was associated with a deregulated activation of coagulation and an altered inflammatory response. Pneumococcal colonization of lung and bacteremia were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in malnourished mice receiving the CRL1505 strain. Moreover, mice repleted with supplemental L. rhamnosus CRL1505 showed the least alteration of the alveolar-capillary barrier and cell damage in lungs after the infectious challenge, especially when the CRL1505 strain was administered by nasal route. Besides, mice treated with L. rhamnosus CRL1505 showed an improved respiratory innate immune response and a lower activation of coagulation. The results of this work indicate that L. rhamnosus CRL1505 is able to beneficially modulate the inflammation-coagulation interaction after respiratory infections in malnourished hosts.
TI  - Inhibition of Streptococcus pneumoniae adherence to human epithelial cells in vitro by the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colonization of the nasopharynx by Streptococcus pneumoniae is considered a prerequisite for pneumococcal infections such as pneumonia and otitis media. Probiotic bacteria can influence disease outcomes through various mechanisms, including inhibition of pathogen colonization. Here, we examine the effect of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) on S. pneumoniae colonization of human epithelial cells using an in vitro model. We investigated the effects of LGG administered before, at the same time as, or after the addition of S. pneumoniae on the adherence of four pneumococcal isolates. RESULTS: LGG significantly inhibited the adherence of all the pneumococcal isolates tested. The magnitude of inhibition varied with LGG dose, time of administration, and the pneumococcal isolate used. Inhibition was most effective when a higher dose of LGG was administered prior to establishment of pneumococcal colonization. Mechanistic studies showed that LGG binds to epithelial cells but does not affect pneumococcal growth or viability. Administration of LGG did not lead to any significant changes in host cytokine responses. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that LGG can inhibit pneumococcal colonization of human epithelial cells in vitro and suggest that probiotics could be used clinically to prevent the establishment of pneumococcal carriage.
TI  - Nasally administered Lactobacillus rhamnosus accelerate the recovery of humoral immunity in B lymphocyte-deficient malnourished mice.
AB  - The ability of nasally administered Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 to accelerate the recovery of respiratory B cell-mediated immunity against pneumococcal infection in replete malnourished mice was evaluated. Weaned mice were malnourished after consumption of a protein-free diet for 21 d. Malnourished mice were fed a balanced conventional diet (BCD) for 7 d (BCD group) or a BCD for 7 d with supplemental L. rhamnosus CRL1505 by the nasal route during the last 2 d (BCD+Lr group). Nonreplete malnourished and normal mice were used as the malnourished (MNC) and the well-nourished (WNC) control groups, respectively. Mice were challenged with Streptococcus pneumoniae at the end of each dietary treatment. The immune response was studied before the challenge and at different times postinfection. The MNC mice had less resistance to pneumococcal infection, fewer mature and immature B cells in lung and spleen, and a reduced production of specific antibodies compared with WNC mice. The BCD treatment did not induce a complete normalization of the number B cell populations and antibody amounts. However, the BCD+Lr group had normal numbers of spleen and lung B cells. Moreover, the BCD+Lr mice had a significantly lower susceptibility to S. pneumoniae infection and higher amounts of anti-pneumococcal antibodies. Although further studies are necessary to clarify the effect of malnutrition and nasally administered lactobacilli in other immune cell populations involved in the protection against respiratory pathogens, this work gives evidence of the importance of using nasal priming with probiotics to accelerate the recovery of respiratory immunity in immunocompromised malnourished hosts.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Immunomodulatory activity of Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains isolated from goat milk: impact on intestinal and respiratory infections.
AB  - The immune stimulation induced by Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 (Lr05) and L. rhamnosus CRL1506 (Lr06) on the resistance to infection with an intestinal pathogen (Salmonella typhimurium) and a respiratory pathogen (Streptococcus pneumoniae) was studied in swiss-albine mice experimental models. The cytokine profiles that induced the innate and specific immune response in both infectious processes were investigated. Both strains were able to improve resistance against the intestinal pathogen. Only Lr05 was able to induce a significant decrease in the number of S. pneumoniae in the lung, prevent its dissemination into the blood and induce a significant increase in Th1 (INF-gamma) and Th2 (IL-6, IL-4 and IL-10) cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL). The changes in the cytokines profiles in BAL were associated with an increase in the number and activity of phagocytic cells and with the increase in specific antibodies in serum and BAL, which would explain the increased resistance to the challenge. The administration of Lr06 did not induce significant effects at the respiratory mucosal level. The results described in the present paper showed that certain LAB strains can share certain functional properties, although some of them can perform a functional role better than others, so that it is important to perform careful studies on specific strains, according to their therapeutic use.
TI  - spr1630 is responsible for the lethality of clpX mutations in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The Clp protease ATPase subunit and chaperone ClpX is dispensable in some bacteria, but it is thought to be essential in others, including streptococci and lactococci. We confirm that clpX is essential in the Rx strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae but show that the requirement for clpX can be relieved by point mutations, frame shifts, or deletion of the gene spr1630, which is found in many isolates of S. pneumoniae. Homologs occur frequently in Staphylococcus aureus as well as in a few strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus johnsonii, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. In each case, the spr1630 homolog is accompanied by a putative transcriptional regulator with an HTH DNA binding motif. In S. pneumoniae, the spr1630-spr1629 gene pair, accompanied by a RUP element, occurs as an island inserted between the trpA and cclA genes in 15 of 22 sequenced genomes.
TI  - Characterization and site-directed mutagenesis of Wzb, an O-phosphatase from Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reversible phosphorylation events within a polymerisation complex have been proposed to modulate capsular polysaccharide synthesis in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Similar phosphatase and kinase genes are present in the exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthesis loci of numerous lactic acid bacteria genomes. RESULTS: The protein sequence deduced from the wzb gene in Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 9595 reveals four motifs of the polymerase and histidinol phosphatase (PHP) superfamily of prokaryotic O-phosphatases. Native and modified His-tag fusion Wzb proteins were purified from Escherichia coli cultures. Extracts showed phosphatase activity towards tyrosine-containing peptides. The purified fusion protein Wzb was active on p-nitrophenyl-phosphate (pNPP), with an optimal activity in presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA 1%) at pH 7.3 and a temperature of 75 degrees C. At 50 degrees C, residual activity decreased to 10 %. Copper ions were essential for phosphatase activity, which was significantly increased by addition of cobalt. Mutated fusion Wzb proteins exhibited reduced phosphatase activity on p-nitrophenyl-phosphate. However, one variant (C6S) showed close to 20% increase in phosphatase activity. CONCLUSION: These characteristics reveal significant differences with the manganese-dependent CpsB protein tyrosine phosphatase described for Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as with the polysaccharide-related phosphatases of Gram negative bacteria.
TI  - Treatment of acute otitis media with probiotics in otitis-prone children-a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised study.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: To examine whether probiotics would reduce the occurrence or duration of acute otitis media (AOM), or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children. METHODS: During this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 24-week intervention, 309 otitis-prone children (10 months-6 years) consumed either one probiotic capsule (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and LC705, Bifidobacterium breve 99 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii JS) (n=155) or placebo (n=154) daily. Clinical examinations were carried out and nasopharyngeal samples taken three times. Parents recorded the symptoms of upper respiratory infection (URI) in a diary. RESULTS: Probiotic treatment did not reduce the occurrence (probiotic vs. placebo: 72% vs. 65%, OR=1.48, 95% CI 0.87-2.52, p=n.s.) or the recurrence ( three) of AOM episodes (18% vs. 17%, OR=1.04, 95% CI 0.55-1.96, p=n.s.). The median duration of AOM episodes was 5.6 (IQR 3.5-9.4) vs. 6.0 (IQR 4.0-10.5) days, respectively (p= n.s.). There was a tendency showing a reduction in the occurrence of recurrent (4 to 6) respiratory infections in the probiotic group (OR for 4 URIs: 0.56, 95%CI 0.31-0.99, p=0.046; OR for 6 URIs: 0.59, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.03, p=n.s.). Probiotics did not affect the carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae, but increased the prevalence of Moraxella catarrhalis (OR=1.79, 95% CI 1.06-3.00, p=0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics did not prevent the occurrence of AOM or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children. A tendency showing a reduction in recurrent respiratory infections must be confirmed in further studies.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the novel LysM domain-containing surface protein Sep from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in Lactobacillus and Lactococcus.
AB  - Examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kDa protein termed Sep. The amino-terminal sequence of Sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. Sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Lactobacillus plantarum. The carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of Sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (APF) surface proteins of Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii. The mature amino terminus of Sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding LysM domain, thereby making it distinct from APF proteins. We have identified a common motif within LysM domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding YG motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. Sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in L. fermentum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. Modified Sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, and L. lactis hosts. Sep as well as the previously described surface protein BspA were used to express and secrete in L. fermentum or L. rhamnosus a fragment of human E-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for Listeria monocytogenes. This study demonstrates that Sep has potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.
