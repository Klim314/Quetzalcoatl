TI  - Epidemiology and Microbiology of Secondary Peritonitis Caused by Viscus Perforation: A Single-Center Retrospective Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complicated intra-abdominal infections are serious conditions that require urgent source control and antibiotic treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology and bacterial causation of such infections using blood and peritoneal cultures of Korean patients with peritonitis originating from viscus perforation. METHODS: The medical records of 419 consecutive patients who underwent emergency surgery because of bowel perforation from January 2007 to December 2011 were analyzed. Clinical characteristics, peri-operative conditions, perforation sites, and mortality data were obtained. Bacterial distributions and antibiotic resistance were evaluated using blood and peritoneal culture reports. RESULTS: The most common perforation site was the colon (165; 39.4%), and the overall mortality rate was 11.2%. Blood cultures were performed in 182 patients, and 20 patients (11.0%) had a positive culture. Blood culture positivity was significantly higher for colon perforations (17.7%) than perforations elsewhere (p=0.039). A peritoneal culture was performed for each of 210 patients (50.1%), and 145 of those patients (69.0%) had a positive culture. Enterococcus faecium (35.2%) was the most common gram-positive bacterium, and Escherichia coli was the most common gram-negative organism. There were 276 community-acquired infections (CAI) (65.9%) and 143 hospital-acquired infections (HAI) (34.1%). Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were more common in the HAI than in the CAI group (p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: The compositions and antibiotic resistances of micro-organisms found in this study are similar to those reported previously. A multicenter prospective study is needed of this disease state in South Korea.
TI  - Study of Lactic Acid Bacteria Community From Raw Milk of Iranian One Humped Camel and Evaluation of Their Probiotic Properties.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Camel milk is amongst valuable food sources in Iran. On the other hand, due to the presence of probiotic bacteria and bacteriocin producers in camel milk, probiotic bacteria can be isolated and identified from this food product. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present research were the isolation and molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria from camel milk and evaluation of their probiotic properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of ten samples of camel milk were collected from the Golestan province of Iran under aseptic conditions. Bacteria were isolated by culturing the samples on selective medium. Isolates were identified by amplification of the 16S rDNA and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and were then screened and grouped by the Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) method. To evaluate probiotic properties, representative isolates of different ARDRA profiles were analyzed. The antimicrobial activity of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) against Pediococcus pentosaceus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus was examined by the agar diffusion assay. Acid and bile tolerance of isolates were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 64 isolates were analyzed based on biochemical tests and morphological characteristics. The most frequently isolated LAB was Enterococci. Weissella, Leuconostoc, Lactobacilli and Pediococci were less frequently found. Based on restriction analysis of the ITS, the isolates were grouped into nine different ARDRA patterns that were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing as P. pentosaceus, Enterococcus faecium strain Y-2, E. faecium strain JZ1-1, E. faecium strain E6, E. durans, E. lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus casei and Weissella cibaria. The results showed that antimicrobial activity of the tested isolates was remarkable and P. pentosaceus showed the most antibacterial activity. In addition, E. durans, E. lactis, L. casei and P. pentosaceus were selected as probiotic bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the presence of bacteriocin-producing bacteria and probiotic bacteria in camel milk from the Golestan province of Iran.
TI  - Nosocomial Infections and Microbiologic Spectrum after Major Elective Surgery of  the Pancreas, Liver, Stomach, and Esophagus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of infections treated by surgeons are nosocomial infections (NI). The frequency of these infections in relation to the organ operated on as well as the organisms involved are not well defined. Detailed knowledge of these issues is essential for optimal care of surgical patients. This study aimed to determine infection rates and the responsible pathogens after major elective surgery of the pancreas, liver, stomach, and esophagus. METHODS: Between January 1, 2005 and August 31, 2007, the records of all patients of the Department of General, Abdominal and Vascular Surgery, University Hospital Magdeburg (Germany) with elective resection of the pancreas, liver, stomach, and esophagus were evaluated retrospectively. Study parameters were: Patient number, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, indication for resection, operation duration, length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in hospital, mortality, organ-related rate and kind of NI, and microbiologic spectrum. Nosocomial infections were defined as: Surgical site infection (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 1 or 2) and intra-abdominal infection (CDC 3), urinary tract infection, clinical sepsis, blood stream and catheter-related infection, respiratory tract infection, and pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 358 patients were included: 150 (42%) with pancreas resection, 91 (25%) with liver resection, 105 (29%) with gastric resection, and 12 (3%) with esophagus resection. Median LOS in the ICU for all groups was 48.8 h (interquartile range [IQR] 24.9-91.8 h), median LOS in hospital was 16 d (IQR 13-23 d), and in-hospital mortality was 4.5%. Patients with NI had significantly greater in-hospital death and prolonged stay in hospital and ICU (p<0.001). In 120 (33.5%) patients, one or more NI occurred (range, 83% in esophagus patients to 21% in liver patients). Intra-abdominal (16.5%) and surgical site infections (12.3%) were most frequent; 80.8% of the NI were culture-positive. The most frequent clinically relevant isolates were Escherichia coli (12.4%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (12.2%), and Enterococcus faecium (9.7%). The highest resistance rates were found for Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] 29.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.5%). CONCLUSIONS: For patients undergoing elective surgery of the pancreas, liver, stomach, and esophagus, considerable differences in demographic factors, frequency, and kind of NI exist. The consequences of NI force surgeons to analyze pre-operative risk factors carefully, assess indications for operation thoroughly, and optimize all controllable parameters.
TI  - [Bloodstream infections in southwestern China: 2012 Whire Union report on bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the susceptibility of blood culture isolates to antibiotics in a sample of hospitals in Southwestern China in 2012. METHODS: Blood culture samples were taken and tested from the patients under the Whire Union surveillance in three tertiary hospitals in Southwestern China in 2012. We performed antimicrobial susceptibility analyses on the blood culture isolates using WHONET5. 5 and SPSS19.0. RESULTS: A total of 1745 isolates were identified: 877 Gram-positive (50.26%); 868 Gram-negative (49.74%). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcius (CNS, 541 strains, 31.00%), Escherichia coli (ECO, 379 strains, 21.72%), Klebsiella spp. (170 strains, 9.74%), Enterococcus spp. (143 strains, 8.20%) and Staphylococcus aureus (SAU, 128 strains, 7.34%) comprised the majority of isolates. Methicillin-resistant was found in 37.5% of S. aureus and 85.4% of CNS, respectively. Zero and 6.3% resistance to vancomycin were found for Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, respectively,compared with a 1.4% and 7.9% resistance to linezolid, respectively. Imipenem-resistance occurred in 0.7% E. coli, 3.6% Klebsiella spp., and 11.1% Enterobacter spp.. Nonfermenters were highly resistant to carbapenems, with an imipenem resistance rate of 25.0% in P. aeruginosa and 79.1% in Acinetobacter baumannii. Antimicrobial usage and critical-care units were identified as risk factors for MRSA and multi-drug-resistant A. baumannii infections. Patients undergoing tracheotomy/endotracheal intubation were likely to develop multi-drug-resistant A. baumannii infections than others. CONCLUSION: CNS, E. coli,Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp. and S. aureus were the predominant organisms in bloodstream infections in Southwestern China. Low methicillin-resistant rate was found in Staphylococcus aureus. But vancomycin-resistant rate was high in E. faecium. Imipenem-resistant rates varied in Enterobacteriaceae: higher in non-fermenting bacteria especially in Acinetobacter spp. Use of abtimicrobial drugs and invasive procedures can lead to development of antimicrobial drugs-resistance.
TI  - Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 modulates epithelial integrity, heat shock protein, and proinflammatory cytokine response in intestinal cells.
AB  - Probiotics have shown positive effects on gastrointestinal diseases; they have barrier-modulating effects and change the inflammatory response towards pathogens in studies in vitro. The aim of this investigation has been to examine the response of intestinal epithelial cells to Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 (E. faecium), a probiotic positively affecting diarrhea incidence in piglets, and two pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains, with specific focus on the probiotic modulation of the response to the pathogenic challenge. Porcine (IPEC-J2) and human (Caco-2) intestinal cells were incubated without bacteria (control), with E. faecium, with enteropathogenic (EPEC) or enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) each alone or in combination with E. faecium. The ETEC strain decreased transepithelial resistance (TER) and increased IL-8 mRNA and protein expression in both cell lines compared with control cells, an effect that could be prevented by pre- and coincubation with E. faecium. Similar effects were observed for the increased expression of heat shock protein 70 in Caco-2 cells. When the cells were challenged by the EPEC strain, no such pattern of changes could be observed. The reduced decrease in TER and the reduction of the proinflammatory and stress response of enterocytes following pathogenic challenge indicate the protective effect of the probiotic.
TI  - Evaluation of regional antibiograms to monitor antimicrobial resistance in Hampton Roads, Virginia.
AB  - We studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the Hampton Roads area, Virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated with Eastern Virginia Medical School. The data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram- positive and E. coli the most common Gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. Overall 53% of S.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. There was a broad scatter of MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and MIC of 4 mug/mL was reported in 2012. Penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of Enterococcus faecium and 2% of Enterococcus faecalis respectively. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant Gram negative organism in the data compiled. Among the Escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole ( SXT) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. We found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. Based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.
TI  - Effects of the Probiotic Enterococcus faecium and Pathogenic Escherichia coli Strains in a Pig and Human Epithelial Intestinal Cell Model.
AB  - The aim of this study has been to elucidate the effect of the probiotic Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 on epithelial integrity in intestinal epithelial cells and whether pre- and coincubation with this strain can reproducibly prevent damage induced by enterotoxigenic (ETEC) and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). Porcine (IPEC-J2) and human (Caco-2) intestinal epithelial cells were incubated with bacterial strains and epithelial integrity was assessed by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and mannitol flux rates. E. faecium alone increased TEER of Caco-2 cells without affecting mannitol fluxes whereas the E. coli strains decreased TEER and concomitantly increased mannitol flux rates in both cell lines. Preincubation with E. faecium had no effect on the TEER decrease induced by E. coli in preliminary experiments. However, in a second set of experiments using a slightly different protocol, E. faecium ameliorated the TEER decrease induced by ETEC at 4 h in IPEC-J2 and at 2, 4, and 6 h in Caco-2 cells. We conclude that E. faecium positively affected epithelial integrity in monoinfected Caco-2 cells and could ameliorate the damage on TEER induced by an ETEC strain. Reproducibility of the results is, however, limited when experiments are performed with living bacteria over longer periods.
TI  - Analysis of in vitro and in vivo effects of probiotics against Campylobacter spp.
AB  - Campylobacter (C.) spp. are well recognised as the leading cause of bacterial food-borne diarrheal disease worldwide, with C. jejuni and C. coli as the most important species: C. coli is highly abundant in pigs and pork meat has often been implicated as a source for human infection. Intestinal colonisation of C. coli in pigs plays a role in carcass contamination during slaughter. Different pre-harvest intervention measures are proposed to reduce the C. coli burden in the porcine intestine. Among others, the use of probiotics to prevent or reduce the colonisation of intestinal pathogens is discussed. One aim of this study was to screen a variety of probiotics to evaluate their inhibitory activity against Campylobacter spp. in vitro. Therefore, cell-free culture supernatants of Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Enterococcus (E.) faecium NCIMB 10415, and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 were tested against C. jejuni and C. coli by a well-diffusion agar assay. Seven out of eleven Lactobacillus strains showed an inhibitory activity against at least one of the three tested Campylobacter strains. This antagonistic activity against Campylobacter spp. was caused by the production of organic acids that lowered the pH. Application with pH neutralised cell-free culture supernatants abolished this inhibitory effect. Other tested strains with probiotic properties showed no inhibitory activity against any Campylobacter spp. strain. The strain E. faecium NCIMB 10415 was chosen to test its inhibitory activity against C. coli in vivo. Twenty weaned piglets were allocated into two groups, a probiotic group and a control group.The diet of the probiotic group was supplemented with E. faecium NCIMB 10415 (10(9) cfu/kg feed, Cylactin) since weaning, whereas the control group received no probiotic treatment. All piglets were naturally colonised with C. coli. The excretion load of C. coli was monitored for 28 days. The results indicate that dietary supplementation of E. faecium NCIMB 10415 did not significantly affect C. coli excretion levels in pigs. In this study, E. faecium NCIMB 10415 showed no antagonistic activity against C. coli in vitro and in vivo and had no impact on the growth performance of weaned piglets.
TI  - Persistent strongyloidiasis complicated by recurrent meningitis in an HTLV seropositive peruvian migrant resettled in Italy.
AB  - We describe a case of persistent strongyloidiasis complicated by recurrent meningitis, in a human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) seropositive Peruvian migrant adult resettled in Italy. He was admitted with signs and symptoms of acute bacterial meningitis, reporting four other meningitis episodes in the past 6 years, with an etiological diagnosis of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium in two cases. He had been previously treated with several antihelmintic regimens not including ivermectin, without eradication of strongyloidiasis, and he had never been tested for HTLV before. During the described episode, the patient was treated for meningitis with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and 200 mug/kg/dose oral ivermectin once daily on day 1, 2, 15 and 16 with full recovery and no further episodes of meningitis. The presented case underlines several critical points concerning the management of poorly known neglected diseases such as strongyloidiasis and HTLV infection in low-endemic areas. Despite several admissions for meningitis and strongyloidiasis, the parasitic infection was not adequately treated and the patient was not previously tested for HTLV. The supply of ivermectin and the choice of treatment scheme was challenging since ivermectin is not approved in Italy and there are no standardized guidelines for the treatment of severe strongyloidiasis in HTLV seropositive subjects.
TI  - Prevalence, resistance patterns, and risk factors for antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from retail chicken meat in Colombia.
AB  - As a step toward implementing the Colombian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial  Resistance Surveillance (COIPARS), this study aimed to establish the baseline antimicrobial resistance patterns of Salmonella serovars, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus spp. isolates in retail poultry meat from independent stores and from a main chain distributor center. MICs of the isolates were determined for antimicrobials used both in humans and animals, using an automated system. Salmonella serovars were isolated from 26% of the meat samples and E. coli from 83%, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were detected in 81 and 13% of the meat samples, respectively. A principal finding of concern in this study was that almost 98% of isolates tested were multidrug resistant. Ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline were the antimicrobials that showed the highest frequency of resistance among Salmonella and E. coli isolates. For enterococci, 61.5% of E. faecium isolates were found to be resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin; this is significant because it is used to treat nosocomial infections when vancomycin resistance is present. Vancomycin resistance was detected in 4% of the E. faecalis isolates. The results of our study highlight the need for rapid implementation of an integrated program for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance by the Colombian authorities in order to monitor trends, raise awareness, and help promote practices to safeguard later generation antimicrobial agents.
TI  - The stability, and efficacy against penicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, of the plectasin peptide efficiently produced by Escherichia coli.
AB  - Plectasin, the first defensin extracted from a fungus (the saprophytic ascomycete Pseudoplectania nigrella), is attractive as a prospective antimicrobial agent. The purpose of this study was to establish a bacterium-based production system and evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the resulting plectasin. A gene encoding plectasin, with the codon preference of Escherichia coli, was optimized based on its amino acid sequence, synthesized using gene-splicing with overlap extension PCR, and inserted into the expression vector pGEX-4T-1. The fusion protein was expressed in the soluble fraction of E. coli and purified using glutathione S-transferase affinity chromatography. Plectasin was cleaved from the fusion protein with thrombin and purified by ultrafiltration. The purified plectasin showed strong, concentration-dependent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria including antibiotic resistant bacteria, especially penicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. This antimicrobial activity was equal to chemically synthesized plectasin and was maintained over a wide range of pHs and temperatures. This soluble recombinant expression system in E. coli is effective for producing plectasin at a relatively lower cost, and higher purity and efficiency than prior systems, and might provide a foundation for developing a large-scale production system. Overall, plectasin shows potential as a novel, high performance, and safe antibiotic for the treatment of refractory diseases caused by drug-resistant bacterial strains.
TI  - New antimicrobial contact catalyst killing antibiotic resistant clinical and waterborne pathogens.
AB  - Microbial growth on medical and technical devices is a big health issue, particularly when microorganisms aggregate to form biofilms. Moreover, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the clinical environment is dramatically growing, making treatment of bacterial infections very challenging. In search of an alternative, we studied a novel antimicrobial surface coating based on micro galvanic elements formed by silver and ruthenium with surface catalytic properties. The antimicrobial coating efficiently inhibited the growth of the nosocomial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium as demonstrated by the growth inhibition on agar surface and in biofilms of antibiotic resistant clinical E. faecalis, E. faecium, and S. aureus isolates. It also strongly reduced the growth of Legionella in a drinking water pipeline and of Escherichia coli in urine. We postulate a mode of action of the antimicrobial material, which is independent of the release of silver ions. Thus, the novel antimicrobial coating could represent an alternative to combat microbial growth avoiding the toxic side effects of high levels of silver ions on eukaryotic cells.
TI  - N-terminus three residues deletion mutant of human beta-defensin 3 with remarkably enhanced salt-resistance.
AB  - In this study, we designed and synthesized three N-terminal deletion analogs of human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3), namely, hBD-3Delta4, hBD-3Delta7, and hBD-3Delta10, to determine the effect of N-terminal residues on the antibacterial activity and salt resistance of these peptides. The antibacterial activities and salt resistance of hBD-3 and its analogs were tested against a broad range of standard and clinically isolated strains. The deletion of nine N-terminal residues significantly reduced the antibacterial activity of hBD-3 against most of tested strains, particularly Klebsiella pneumonia. Compared with hBD-3 and other analogs, the analog with a deletion of three residues, hBD-3Delta4, exhibited significantly higher antimicrobial activity against almost all the tested strains, especially Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium, at high NaCl concentrations. Given its broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and high salt resistance, hBD-3Delta4 could serve as a promising template for new therapeutic antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) directly from positive blood culture flasks allows rapid identification of bloodstream infections in immunosuppressed hosts.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In immunosuppressed hosts, rapid identification of microorganisms of bloodstream infections is crucial to ensuring effective antimicrobial therapy. Conventional culture requires up to 72 h from sample collection to pathogen identification. METHODS: We used the SepsiTyper Kit and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF; Microflex, Bruker) directly from positive blood culture (BacT/ALERT 3D, FN/FA vials; bioMerieux) in comparison to standard culture methodology (VITEK 2; bioMerieux) for species identification. RESULTS: A total of 62 consecutive positive blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients (solid organ or hematopoietic transplant recipients, or with febrile neutropenia) were analyzed. Culture yielded gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in 27/62 (43.5%) and gram-positive (GPB) in 35/62 (56.5%) vials. For GNB, the predominant species identified by MALDI-TOF and confirmed by VITEK were Escherichia coli (16/16 correctly identified) and Enterobacter cloacae (4/4), with a sensitivity and specificity of 92.6% and 100%, respectively. For GPB, predominant species were Staphylococcus aureus (3/3), coagulase-negative staphylococci (12/24), and Enterococcus faecium (6/6) with a sensitivity of 100%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. The median time from blood collection to species identification was 27.4 h with MALDI-TOF identification and 46.6 h with conventional methodology. CONCLUSION: Using MALDI-TOF directly from positive blood cultures allowed a shorter time to identification with high sensitivity and specificity in immunosuppressed patients.
TI  - Spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  - Ac-GF(A6c)G(A6c)K(A6c)G(A6c)F(A6c)G(A6c)GK(A6c)KKKK-amide (A6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43muM. Spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this AMP interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. CD and 2D-(1)H NMR experiments indicated this AMP on binding to SDS and DPC micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages of helical and random coil conformers. CD investigations in the presence of three phospholipid SUVs consisting of POPC, 4:1 POPC/POPG, and 60% POPE/21%POPG/19%POPC revealed: (1) The interactions occurring with POPC SUVs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the AMP yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) The interactions with 4:1 POPC/POPG, and 60% POPE/21%POPG/19%POPC SUVs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the CD spectra. (3) The presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of SUVs as was the case with micelles. This data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this AMP are very different from the diversity of conformations adopted by this AMP on insertion into the lipid bilayer. CD spectra of this AMP in the presence of SUVs consisting of LPS isolated from P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.
TI  - Utilization of blood cultures in Danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  - This national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (BCs). A primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. From the Danish Microbiology Database, we retrieved all BCs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the National Patient Registry. In total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one BC was taken. Almost 50% of BCs were taken at admission. The chance of having a BC taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. Data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one BC was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. Ten species, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. An increase in BCs and positive BCs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. BCs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for S. pneumoniae particularly. A predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to S. aureus, E. faecium and K. pneumoniae. Minor differences in BCs and positive BCs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. The study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.
TI  - Update on linezolid in vitro activity through the Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program, 2013.
AB  - Linezolid showed MIC50s and MIC90s of 1 mug/ml (for both) against Staphylococcus  aureus. Two S. aureus strains exhibited higher MICs (4 to 8 mug/ml) caused by cfr and/or target site mutations, including the first detection of cfr in Poland. Linezolid (MIC50 and MIC90, 0.5 and 1 mug/ml) had potent MICs against coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Four CoNS had MICs of 16 to 128 mug/ml due to alterations in 23S rRNA and/or L3/L4. Linezolid inhibited all enterococci and streptococci at </=2 mug/ml, except for one Enterococcus faecium strain (MIC, 8 mug/ml; G2576T [Escherichia coli numbering] mutation).
TI  - End group modification: Efficient tool for improving activity of antimicrobial peptide analogues towards Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Increased incidence of infections with multidrug-resistant bacterial strains warrants an intensive search for novel potential antimicrobial agents. Here, an antimicrobial peptide analogue with a cationic/hydrophobic alternating design displaying only moderate activity against Gram-positive pathogens was optimized. Generally, introduction of hydrophobic moieties at the N-terminus resulted in analogues with remarkably increased activity against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Interestingly, the potency against Escherichia coli strains was unaffected, whereas modification with hydrophobic moieties led to increased activity towards the Gram-negative Acinetobacter baumannii. Despite increased cytotoxicity against murine fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, the optimized peptide analogues exhibited significantly improved cell selectivity. Overall, the most favorable hydrophobic activity-inducing moieties were found to be cyclohexylacetyl and pentafluorophenylacetyl groups, while the presence of a short PEG-like chain had no significant effect on activity. Introduction of cationic moieties conferred no effect or merely a moderate activity-promoting effect to the analogues.
TI  - [The urinary bacterial flora in patients with cutaneous ureterostomy].
AB  - Twenty-four patients with cutaneous ureterostomy at least 6 months after surgery  were included in this study. Single-J ureteral catheters were indwelt in 7 patients. Pouch urine was cultured and analyzed from asymptomatic patients and from those with pyelonephritis. Forty-eight bacterial strains were isolated from asymptomatic patients. Thirty-five of these strains consisting of 18 species were isolated from the patients without ureteral catheters. Enterococcus (E.) faecalis (20.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Proteus (P.) mirabilis (11. 4%) were isolated at high frequency. One methicilline-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) strain was isolated. Thirteen bacterial strains consisting of 8 species were isolated from the patients with ureteral catheters. E. faecalis (23.1%), Eschericia (E.) coli (23.1%) and Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa (15.4%) were isolated at high frequency. One E. coli strain harboring extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) and one MRCNS strain were isolated. Pyelonephritis occurred in 5 patients 14 times during follow-up for at least 6 months after surgery. The patients with ureteral catheters suffered from pyelonephritis (4/7, 57.1%) more frequently as compared to the patients without catheters (1/17, 5.9%) (p = 0.014). P. aeruginosa (26.9%), E. faecium (15.4%), and P. mirabilis (11.5%) were isolated inhigh frequency. One E. coli strain harboring ESBL and one P. mirabilis strain harboring ESBL were isolated. In conclusion, insertion of ureteral catheters in a cutaneous ureterostomy is a strong risk factor for pyelonephritis and development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, urine culture is important in these patients who are under surveillance.
TI  - In vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  - Pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. Bacterial isolates from the 2013 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (DFI) and Gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth. The MIC50 and MIC90 against all organisms tested from DFI were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MIC values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. Pexiganan MIC values among Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. Pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or P. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. Decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against S. aureus or E. faecium. Enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (MIC, 32 to 256 mug/ml). The "all organism" MIC90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.
TI  - Crosstalk between the microbiome and cancer cells by quorum sensing peptides.
AB  - To date, the precise role of the human microbiome in health and disease states remains largely undefined. Complex and selective crosstalk systems between the microbiome and mammalian cells are also not yet reported. Research up till now mainly focused on bacterial synthesis of virulence factors, reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and hydrogen sulphide, as well as on the activation of exogenous mutagen precursors by intestinal bacteria. We discovered that certain quorum sensing peptides, produced by bacteria, interact with mammalian cells, in casu cancer cells: Phr0662 (Bacillus sp.), EntF-metabolite (Enterococcus faecium) and EDF-derived (Escherichia coli) peptides initiate HCT-8/E11 colon cancer cell invasion, with Phr0662 also promoting angiogenesis. Our findings thus indicate that the human microbiome, through their quorum sensing peptides, may be one of the factors responsible for cancer metastasis.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - The impact of hospital-acquired infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria in an oncology intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe overall site-specific hospital-acquired infection (HAI) rates and to describe the microbiological and antibiotic resistance profiles of infecting pathogens, together with their impact on multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria-associated mortality. METHODS: We conducted a 5-year retrospective descriptive study of HAI in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a cancer center in Mexico from January 2007 to December 2011. The following information was collected: patient characteristics and comorbidities, data related to the neoplasm and its treatment, microbiology, and the resistance pattern of all isolates. RESULTS: During the study period, 1418 patients were admitted to the ICU; 134 of them developed 159 infections, with an incidence of 11.2/100 hospitalized patients and 32.2/per 1000 patient-days. Two hundred sixty-six microorganisms were isolated. The overall prevalence of MDR-HAI was 39.5%. The most frequent organisms were as follows: 54 (20%) Escherichia coli (94.4% of these were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers), 32 (12%) Staphylococcus aureus (90.6% of these were methicillin-resistant), 32 (12%) Enterococcus faecium (18.7% of these were vancomycin-resistant), and 20 (6%) Acinetobacter baumannii (all were MDR). Among patients admitted to the ICU, 252 (17.8%) died. Death was related to the HAI in 58 (23%) of these patients (p<0.001) and 51 (88%) had a MDR organism isolated (p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of MDR bacteria poses a difficult task for physicians, who have limited therapeutic options. Critically ill cancer patients admitted to the ICU are at major risk of a bacterial MDR-HAI that will impact adversely on mortality.
TI  - Effects of the probiotic Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 on selected lactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria in co-culture.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 is used as a probiotic for piglets and has been  shown to modify the porcine intestinal microbiota. However, the mode of action of this probiotic modification is still unclear. One possible explanation is the direct growth inhibiting or stimulating effect of the probiotic on other indigenous bacteria. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the growth interactions of the probiotic with different indigenous porcine bacteria in vitro. Reference strains were cultivated with the probiotic E. faecium strain NCIMB10415 (SF68) in a checkerboard assay with 102 to 105 cells/ml inoculum per strain. Growth kinetics were recorded for 8 h and used to determine specific growth of the co-cultures. Additionally, total DNA was extracted from the co-cultures at the end of the incubation to verify which strain in the co-culture was affected. Co-cultivation with eight Enterococcus spp. tester strains showed strain-specific growth differences. Three of four E. faecium strains were not influenced by the probiotic strain. PCR results showed reduced growth of the probiotic strain in co-culture with E. faecium DSM 6177. Three of four Enterococcus faecalis strains showed reduced specific growth in co-culture with the probiotic strain. However, E. faecalis DSM 20478 impaired growth of the probiotic E. faecium strain. The growth of Lactobacillus johnsonii DSM 10533 and Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 20016 was enhanced in co-culture with the probiotic strain, but co-cultivations with Lactobacillus mucosae DSM13345 or Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM10533 showed no differences. Co-cultures with the probiotic E. faecium showed no impact on the growth rate of four different enterobacterial reference strains (2 strains of Salmonella enterica and 2 strains of Escherichia coli), but PCR results showed reduced cell numbers for a pathogenic E. coli isolate at higher concentration of the probiotic strain. As the in vitro effect of the probiotic E. faecium on enterococci was strain specific and the growth of certain Lactobacillus spp. was enhanced by the probiotic, these results indicate a direct effect of the probiotic on certain members of the porcine gastro intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic studies of nitrofurantoin against common uropathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index that best correlates to nitrofurantoin's antibacterial effect, we studied nitrofurantoin activity against common causative pathogens in uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI). METHODS: Five isolates [two Escherichia coli (one isolate producing the ESBL CTX-M-15), two Enterococcus faecium (including one that was vancomycin resistant) and one Staphylococcus saprophyticus] were used. The MICs of nitrofurantoin were determined by Etest. Time-kill curves with different concentrations of nitrofurantoin (based on multiples of isolate-specific MICs) were followed over 24 h. An in vitro kinetic model was used to simulate different time-concentration profiles, exposing E. coli to nitrofurantoin for varying proportions of the dosing interval. The outcome parameters reduction in cfu 0-24 h (Deltacfu0-24) and the area under the bactericidal curve (AUBC), were correlated with time over MIC (T>MIC) and area under the antibiotic concentration curve divided by the MIC (AUC/MIC). RESULTS: A bactericidal effect at varying static drug concentrations was achieved for all isolates. All isolates showed similar kill curve profiles. In the kinetic model, the effect of nitrofurantoin on E. coli displayed a 4 log reduction in cfu/mL within 6 h at 8 x MIC. The outcome parameters Deltacfu0-24 and AUBC had a good correlation with T>MIC (R approximately 0.83 and R approximately 0.67, respectively), whereas log(AUC/MIC) was significantly poorer (R approximately 0.39 and R approximately 0.53, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Nitrofurantoin was highly effective against E. coli and S. saprophyticus isolates; the killing effect against E. faecium was not as rapid, but still significant. Against E. coli, nitrofurantoin was mainly associated with a concentration-dependent action; this was confirmed in the kinetic model, in which T>MIC displayed the best correlation.
TI  - [Trends in antibiotic resistance in Medellin and municipalities of the Metropolitan Area between 2007 and 2012: Results of six years of surveillance].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial resistance is a global phenomenon, but it presents geographic and temporal variations; this is the importance of local surveillance programs. OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in antibiotic resistance in hospitals between 2007 and 2012 in Medellin and its Metropolitan Area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Percentages of antibiotic resistance between 2007 and 2012 in 22 institutions were obtained using WHONET 5.6 program. For interpretation of susceptibility results, CLSI standards of 2009 and 2012 were used. Using the Epi-Info 6.04 program a trends analysis of antibiotic resistance was done using the chi-square for linear trend with a confidence level of 95%, a value of p=0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In six years of surveillance of antibiotic resistance we found a decrease of oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (p=0.0006) and an increase of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium (p=0.0000). In Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens an increase of resistance to ceftazidime was found, in contrast to a decrease in Klebsiella pneumoniae (p=0.0000) and Enterobacter cloacae (p=0.058). K. pneumoniae , S. marcescens and E. cloacae showed an increase of carbapenem resistance in contrast to a reduction of carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii . CONCLUSIONS: The resistance surveillance identified important findings as the emergence of E. faecium resistant to vancomycin and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae . It is essential to determine the antibiotic use in the region to establish their influence on the resistance profiles, as well as ensuring the quality of information and microbiological procedures in the microbiology laboratories.
TI  - Removal of total and antibiotic resistant bacteria in advanced wastewater treatment by ozonation in combination with different filtering techniques.
AB  - Elimination of bacteria by ozonation in combination with charcoal or slow sand filtration for advanced sewage treatment to improve the quality of treated sewage and to reduce the potential risk for human health of receiving surface waters was investigated in pilot scale at the sewage treatment plant Eriskirch, Baden-Wuerttemberg/Germany. To determine the elimination of sewage bacteria, inflowing and leaving wastewater of different treatment processes was analysed in a culture-based approach for its content of Escherichia coli, enterococci and staphylococci and their resistance against selected antibiotics over a period of 17 month. For enterococci, single species and their antibiotic resistances were identified. In comparison to the established flocculation filtration at Eriskirch, ozonation plus charcoal or sand filtration (pilot-scale) reduced the concentrations of total and antibiotic resistant E. coli, enterococci and staphylococci. However, antibiotic resistant E. coli and staphylococci apparently survived ozone treatment better than antibiotic sensitive strains. Neither vancomycin resistant enterococci nor methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were detected. The decreased percentage of antibiotic resistant enterococci after ozonation may be explained by a different ozone sensitivity of species: Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, which determined the resistance-level, seemed to be more sensitive for ozone than other Enterococcus-species. Overall, ozonation followed by charcoal or sand filtration led to 0.8-1.1 log-units less total and antibiotic resistant E. coli, enterococci and staphylococci, as compared to the respective concentrations in treated sewage by only flocculation filtration. Thus, advanced wastewater treatment by ozonation plus charcoal or sand filtration after common sewage treatment is an effective tool for further elimination of microorganisms from sewage before discharge in surface waters.
TI  - [Recurrent meningitis due to anatomical defects: The bacteria indicates its origin].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recurrent meningitis is a rare disease. Anatomical abnormalities and immunodeficiency states are predisposing factors. Four cases, in which immunodeficiency was excluded, are presented. The causal microorganism led to the detection of the anatomical defect responsible for the recurrences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 4 cases with clinical diagnosis of recurrent bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Case 1: a thirty month-old boy with unilateral hearing loss, diagnosed with Mondini abnormality by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 2 episodes of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. Surgical repair after third recurrence. Case 2: fourteen year-old girl diagnosed by MRI with cribriform plate defect after 3 episodes of meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Case 3: girl with meningitis due to Staphylococcus aureus at 2 and 7 months. MRI shows occipital dermal sinus requiring excision. Complication with cerebellar abscesses because of a coexisting dermoid cyst. Case 4: child with meningitis due to Streptococcus bovis at 9 days and Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli at 7 months, with positive cultures to Citrobacter freundii and E. faecium later on. Spinal MRI led to the diagnosis of Currarino syndrome with CSF fistula, which was surgically repaired. The 4 patients had undergone image studies reported as normal during the first episodes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recurrent meningitis the possibility of an anatomical defect should be considered. The isolated microorganism should help to locate it. It is essential to know the normal flora of the different anatomical sites. The definitive treatment is usually surgical.
TI  - In-vitro screening of Malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial activity of Malaysian honey is still limited. In this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of Malaysian monofloral honey from Koompassia excelsa (Becc.) Taub (Tualang), Melaleuca cajuputi Powell (Gelam) and Durio zibethinus Murr. (Durian). Honey samples were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6518 and ATCC25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC12228, Enterococcus faecium LMG16192, Enterococcus faecalis LMG16216 and ATCC29212, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC14028 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC13883. RESULTS: Marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. Durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas Tualang and Gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). CONCLUSION: Present findings suggested Gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested Malaysian honey samples.
TI  - Three-year study of health care-associated infections in a Turkish pediatric ward.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health care-associated infections (HCAIs) can cause an increase in  morbidity, mortality and costs, especially in developing countries. As information on the epidemiology of HCAIs in pediatric patientsinTurkey is limited, we decided to study the annual incidence and antibiotic resistance patterns in our pediatric ward at Marmara University Hospital. METHODOLOGY: All hospitalized patients in the pediatric ward were assessed with regard to HCAIs between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010. Data was prospectively collected according to standard protocols of the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System (NosoLINE). RESULTS: A total of 16.5% of all hospitalized patients developed HCAIs in the three years studied. The most frequent HCAIs were urinary tract infections (UTI) (29.3%), bloodstream infections (27%) and pneumonias (21%). While the most frequent agent isolatedfrom UTI was Escherichia coli (26%), the most common agent in blood stream infections was Staphylococcus epidermidis (30.4%). Vancomycin resistance was found in 73.3% of all Enterococcus faecium strains. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was detected in 58.3% of Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Continual HCAI surveillance is important to determineits rate. Knowledge of the HCAI incidence can influence people's use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and encourage antibiotic rotation. Moreover, the knowledge of HCAI incidence may support the infection control programmes, including education and isolation methods which ultimately may help to reducethe rate of the HCAIs.
TI  - Blood infections in patients treated at transplantation wards of a clinical hospital in Warsaw.
AB  - Establishment of the etiology in blood infection is always advisable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of different bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures of patients hospitalized in transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital between 2010 and 2012. A total of 1994 blood samples from patients who were treated at one of two transplantation wards of a large hospital in Warsaw were analyzed using an automated blood culture system, BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux, France). The 306 bacterial strains were obtained from the examined samples. The highest proportion were bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae (112 strains; 36.6%) with Escherichia coli (61 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (30 strains), and Enterobacter cloacae (10 strains) most commonly isolated. The non-fermenting bacilli constituted 21.6% (66 strains), with most common Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), Achromobacter spp. (12 strains), and Acinetobacter baumannii (3 strains). Most frequent Gram-positive bacteria were staphylococci (25.2%). Of 77 staphylococcal strains, 56 were coagulase-negative staphylococci and 21 Staphylococcus aureus. Other Gram-positive bacteria included enterococci (14 strains) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain). Obligatory anaerobic bacteria were represented by 19 strains (6.2% of total isolates). Among all Enterobacteriaceae, 49 isolates (43.7%) produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (ESBLs). Resistance to methicillin was detected in 62% of S aureus isolates and in 46% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Of 14 enterococci cultured from blood samples, 2 strains (14.3%) were resistant to vancomycin. Both were Enterococcus faecium. Resistant strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are significant problems for patients in the transplantation ward.
TI  - Use of probiotics to reduce faecal shedding of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia  coli in sheep.
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are zoonotic, foodborne pathogens of humans. Ruminants, including sheep, are the primary reservoirs of STEC and there is a need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the entry of STEC into the food chain. The initiation of the majority of bacterial, enteric infections involves colonisation of the gut mucosal surface by the pathogen. However, probiotic bacteria can serve to decrease the severity of infection via a number of mechanisms including competition for receptors and nutrients, and/or the synthesis of organic acids and bacteriocins that create an environment unfavourable for pathogen development. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the administration of a probiotic mixture to sheep experimentally infected with a non-O157 STEC strain, carrying stx1, stx2 and eae genes, was able to decrease faecal shedding of the pathogen. The probiotic mixture contained Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecium. The numbers of non-O157 STEC in faecal samples collected from sheep receiving daily doses of the probiotic mixture were significantly lower at the 3rd, 5th and 6th week post-inoculation when compared to the levels recorded in untreated animals. It was concluded that administration of the probiotic mixture reduced faecal shedding of non-O157 STEC in sheep, and holds potential as a pre-harvest intervention method to reduce transmission to humans.
TI  - Identification of peptidoglycan-associated proteins as vaccine candidates for enterococcal infections.
AB  - Infections by opportunistic bacteria have significant contributions to morbidity  and mortality of hospitalized patients and also lead to high expenses in healthcare. In this setting, one of the major clinical problems is caused by Gram-positive bacteria such as enterococci and staphylococci. In this study we extract, purify, identify and characterize immunogenic surface-exposed proteins present in the vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) strain Enterococcus faecium E155 using three different extraction methods: trypsin shaving, biotinylation and elution at high pH. Proteomic profiling was carried out by gel-free and gel-nanoLC-MS/MS analyses. The total proteins found with each method were 390 by the trypsin shaving, 329 by the elution at high pH, and 45 using biotinylation. An exclusively extracytoplasmic localization was predicted in 39 (10%) by trypsin shaving, in 47 (15%) by elution at high pH, and 27 (63%) by biotinylation. Comparison between the three extraction methods by Venn diagram and subcellular localization predictors (CELLO v.2.5 and Gpos-mPLoc) allowed us to identify six proteins that are most likely surface-exposed: the SCP-like extracellular protein, a low affinity penicillin-binding protein 5 (PBP5), a basic membrane lipoprotein, a peptidoglycan-binding protein LysM (LysM), a D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase (DdcP) and the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PpiC). Due to their close relationship with the peptidoglycan, we chose PBP5, LysM, DdcP and PpiC to test their potential as vaccine candidates. These putative surface-exposed proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified proteins were able to induce specific opsonic antibodies that mediated killing of the homologous strain E. faecium E155 as well as clinical strains E. faecium E1162, Enterococcus faecalis 12030, type 2 and type 5. Passive immunization with rabbit antibodies raised against these proteins reduced significantly the colony counts of E. faecium E155 in mice, indicating the effectiveness of these surface-related proteins as promising vaccine candidates to target different enterococcal pathogens.
TI  - Immunomodulatory effect of non-viable components of probiotic culture stimulated  with heat-inactivated Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus on holoxenic mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Competition of probiotic bacteria with other species from the intestinal microbiota involves different mechanisms that occur regardless of probiotics' viability. The objective of this paper was to assess the cytokine serum levels in holoxenic mice after oral administration of non-viable components (NVC) of Enterococcus faecium probiotic culture stimulated with heat-inactivated Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus in comparison to NVC of unstimulated E. faecium probiotic culture. METHODS: Probiotic E. faecium CMGb 16 culture, grown in the presence of heat-inactivated cultures of E. coli and B. cereus CMGB 102, was subsequently separated into supernatant (SN) and heat-inactivated cellular sediment (CS) fractions by centrifugation. Each NVC was orally administered to holoxenic mice (balb C mouse strain), in three doses, given at 24 hours. Blood samples were collected from the retinal artery, at 7, 14, and 21 days after the first administration of the NVC. The serum concentrations of IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) interleukins were assessed by ELISA method. RESULTS: After the oral administration of SN component obtained from the probiotic culture stimulated with heat-inactivated cultures of B. cereus CMGB 102 and E. coli O28, the serum concentrations of IL-12 were maintained higher in the samples collected at 7 and 14 days post-administration. No specific TNF-alpha profile could be established, depending on stimulated or non-stimulated probiotic culture, NVC fraction, or harvesting time. CONCLUSION: The obtained results demonstrate that non-viable fractions of probiotic bacteria, stimulated by other bacterial species, could induce immunostimulatory effects mediated by cytokines and act, therefore, as immunological adjuvants.
TI  - Thiouracil-Forming Bacteria Identified and Characterized upon Porcine In Vitro Digestion of Brassicaceae Feed.
AB  - In recent years, the frequent detection of the banned thyreostat thiouracil (TU)  in livestock urine has been related to endogenous TU formation following digestion of glucosinolate-rich Brassicaceae crops. Recently, it was demonstrated that, upon in vitro digestion of Brassicaceae, fecal bacteria induce TU detection in livestock (porcine livestock > bovines). Therefore, the present study was intended to isolate and identify bacteria involved in this intestinal TU formation upon Brassicaceae digestion and to gain more insight into the underlying mechanism in porcine livestock. Twenty porcine fecal inocula (gilts and multiparous sows) were assessed through static in vitro colonic-digestion simulations with rapeseed. After derivatization and extraction of the fecal suspensions, TU was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS(2)). On average, lower TU concentrations were observed in fecal colonic simulations in gilts (8.35 ng g(-1) rapeseed +/- 3.42 [mean +/- standard deviation]) than in multiparous sows (52.63 ng g(-1) +/- 16.17), which correlates with maturation of the gut microbial population with age. Further exploration of the mechanism showed cell-dependent activity of the microbial conversion and sustained TU-forming activity after subjection of the fecal inoculum to moderate heat over a time span of up to 30 min. Finally, nine TU-producing bacterial species were successfully isolated and identified by a combination of biochemical and molecular techniques as Escherichia coli (n = 5), Lactobacillus reuteri (n = 2), Enterococcus faecium (n = 1), and Salmonella enterica subsp. arizonae (n = 1). This report demonstrates that endogenous formation of TU is Brassicaceae induced and occurs under colonic conditions most likely through myrosinase-like enzyme activity expressed by different common intestinal bacterial species.
TI  - Impact of minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints on local cumulative bacterial susceptibility data and antibiotic consumption.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. The current study was performed in order to test the influence of different AST standards on local cumulative AST data and on antibiotic consumption. METHODS: Automated AST was performed with clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. From each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and MIC data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by DIN and EUCAST, respectively. In addition cumulative AST data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new EUCAST MIC breakpoints. RESULTS: The susceptibility rate of P. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of C. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of E. cloacae, S. marcescens, and M. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from DIN to EUCAST MIC breakpoints. These changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of EUCAST MIC breakpoints. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that changes of AST breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative AST data and on antibiotic consumption.
TI  - [Prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. METHOD: The incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 449 positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. Samples separated from patients with community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. Most community-aquired infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. Samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples. Respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. Skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were Gram-negative (66.9%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (13.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and Klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), Enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. Samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by Gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia/Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. The resistance to Acinetobacter baumannii was serious. Multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant A. baumannii acountted for 74% of all A. Baumannii infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. Also, 22 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. Finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. Among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. Fourteen of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. There were 61 samples proved to be bacteria colonization. Nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. Nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. Once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.
TI  - Bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  - The ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. Fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. The frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. Experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. A specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. Much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. The use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial maximum non-inhibitory and minimum inhibitory concentrations of different water activity depressing solutes.
AB  - The NaCl MNICs (maximum non-inhibitory concentrations) and MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) for growth of various strains of six bacterial species were determined and then compared with those obtained for seven other solutes. The influence of prior growth conditions on the MNICs and MICs was also evaluated. No significant changes on the MNICs and MICs were found among the strains studied within each species. Among all factors investigated, only growth phase -for Gram-negatives- and growth at high NaCl concentrations led to a change in the NaCl MNICs. Species could be classified depending on its NaCl MNICs and MICs (in decreasing order) as follows: Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Cronobacter sakazakii, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium. Similar results were obtained for KCl, LiCl, and sodium acetate, but not for the remaining solutes investigated (sucrose, glycerol, MgCl2 and CaCl2). Results obtained indicate that, in general, Gram-negatives showed lower MNICs and MICs than Gram-positives for all the solutes, S. aureus being the most solute tolerant microorganism. When compared on a molar basis, glycerol showed the highest MNICs and MICs for all the microorganisms -except for S. aureus- and LiCl the lowest ones. NaCl MNICs and MICs were not significantly different from those of KCl when compared on a molar basis. Therefore, the inhibitory action of NaCl could not be linked to the specific action of Na(+). Results also showed that the Na(+) tolerance of some species was Cl(-) dependent whereas for others it was not, and that factors others than aw-decrease contribute to the inhibitory action of LiCl, CaCl2 and MgCl2.
TI  - Transformation of human cathelicidin LL-37 into selective, stable, and potent antimicrobial compounds.
AB  - This Letter reports a family of novel antimicrobial compounds obtained by combining peptide library screening with structure-based design. Library screening led to the identification of a human LL-37 peptide resistant to chymotrypsin. This d-amino-acid-containing peptide template was active against Escherichia coli but not methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It possesses a unique nonclassic amphipathic structure with hydrophobic defects. By repairing the hydrophobic defects, the peptide (17BIPHE2) gained activity against the ESKAPE pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species. In vitro, 17BIPHE2 could disrupt bacterial membranes and bind to DNA. In vivo, the peptide prevented staphylococcal biofilm formation in a mouse model of catheter-associated infection. Meanwhile, it boosted the innate immune response to further combat the infection. Because these peptides are potent, cell-selective, and stable to several proteases, they may be utilized to combat one or more ESKAPE pathogens.
TI  - Increase in the Prevalence of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter Isolates and Ampicillin-Resistant Non-Typhoidal Salmonella Species in Korea: A KONSAR Study Conducted in 2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial surveillance is important for providing an up-to-date understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance and for creating a forum for rational drug development. In this study, we analyzed antimicrobial test data generated in 2011 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the Korean Nationwide Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance program (KONSAR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on the results of susceptibility tests conducted in 32 hospitals and two commercial laboratories were analyzed. Data on isolates from patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and those admitted to other wards were compared. Intermediate susceptibility was not analyzed and duplicate isolates were excluded. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most prevalent organism identified in both the hospital and commercial laboratories. Among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin G-non-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium remained as prevalent as they were in 2009. The proportion of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VR-EFM) slightly decreased from 29% in 2009 to 23% in 2011. Resistance rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime, cefoxitin, fluoroquinolone, and amikacin were 24%, 14%, 27%, and 8%, respectively. Resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to fluoroquinolone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and amikacin were 33%, 20%, 22%, and 16%, respectively, whereas those of Acinetobacter spp. resistance were 71%, 66%, 64, and 51%, respectively. The prevalence of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa, MRSA, and VR-EFM among ICU isolates was higher than those among non-ICU isolates. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae, imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, and VR-EFM were more prevalent among isolates from commercial laboratories than those from hospitals. Resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to ceftazidime and amikacin decreased from 32% and 24% in 2005 to 24% and 8% in 2011, respectively. The resistance rate of P. aeruginosa to amikacin decreased from 22% in 2005 to 16% in 2011. The proportion of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased from 16% in 2005 to 64% in 2011. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MRSA, penicillin G-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant E. faecium among clinical isolates tested in laboratories remained high. Multidrug resistance was more prevalent among isolates from ICUs. The prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant and amikacin-resistant K. pneumoniae and amikacin-resistant P. aeruginosa decreased after 2005, while the prevalence of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Medilox(R) super-oxidized water.
AB  - AIM: Super-oxidized water is one of the broad spectrum disinfectants, which was introduced recently. There are many researches to find reliable chemicals which are effective, inexpensive, easy to obtain and use, and effective for disinfection of microorganisms leading hospital infections. Antimicrobial activity of super-oxidized water is promising. The aim of this study was to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of Medilox(R) super-oxidized water that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as high level disinfectant. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, super-oxidized water obtained from Medilox(R) [Soosan E & C, Korea] device, which had been already installed in our hospital, was used. Antimicrobial activities of different concentrations of super-oxidized water (1/1, 1/2, 1/5, 1/10, 1/20, 1/50, 1/100) at different exposure times (1, 2, 5, 10, 30 min) against six ATCC strains, eight antibiotic resistant bacteria, yeasts and molds were evaluated using qualitative suspension test. Dey-Engley Neutralizing Broth [Sigma-Aldrich, USA] was used as neutralizing agent. RESULTS: Medilox(R) was found to be effective against all standard strains (Acinetobacter baumannii 19606, Escherichia coli 25922, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Klebsiella pneumoniae 254988, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853, Staphylococcus aureus 29213), all clinical isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Myroides spp.), and all yeastsat 1/1 dilution in >/=1 minute. It was found to be effective on Aspergillus flavus at 1/1 dilution in >/=2 minutes and on certain molds in >/=5 minutes. CONCLUSION: Medilox(R) super-oxidized water is a broad spectrum, on-site producible disinfectant, which is effective on bacteria and fungi and can be used for the control of nosocomial infection.
TI  - Effects of Citrus junos by-products fermented with multistrain probiotics on growth performance, immunity, caecal microbiology and meat oxidative stability in broilers.
AB  - 1. The present study was conducted to develop Citrus junos probiotics (CJP), using by-products of Citrus junos fermented with multispecies probiotic bacteria including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bacillus subtilis. The effects of dietary CJP on the growth performance, immune status, caecal microbiology and meat oxidative stability of broiler were investigated. 2. A total of 240 one-day-old Ross broiler chicks were used in a 35-d experiment in which the chicks were randomly allotted to one of the 4 dietary treatments (0, 5, 10 and 20 g CJP/kg diet) in a completely randomised design. 3. Dietary supplementation of 5 g/kg CJP significantly increased body weight, average daily gain and average daily feed intake of broiler during the overall experimental period. 4. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig)M concentration was significantly increased by 10 and 20 g/kg CJP, whereas the IgG and IgA concentration remained unaffected. In addition, 20 g/kg CJP significantly inhibited proliferation of Escherichia coli without affecting the concentration of Lactobacillus or Bacillus spp. 5. A significant reduction in the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values of breast and thigh meat was observed in response to increasing concentration of dietary CJP. 6. Thus, the results suggest that CJP up to a concentration of 20 g/kg can be used in the diet of broilers to improve immunity and to reduce caecal E. coli and TBARS values of breast and thigh meat without any adverse effects on growth performance.
TI  - A broad-spectrum antibiofilm peptide enhances antibiotic action against bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Biofilm-related infections account for at least 65% of all human infections, but  there are no available antimicrobials that specifically target biofilms. Their elimination by available treatments is inefficient since biofilm cells are between 10- and 1,000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics than planktonic cells. Here we describe the synergistic interactions, with different classes of antibiotics, of a recently characterized antibiofilm peptide, 1018, to potently prevent and eradicate bacterial biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens. Combinations of peptide 1018 and the antibiotic ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or tobramycin were synergistic in 50% of assessments and decreased by 2- to 64-fold the concentration of antibiotic required to treat biofilms formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, in flow cell biofilm studies, combinations of low, subinhibitory levels of the peptide (0.8 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (40 ng/ml) decreased dispersal and triggered cell death in mature P. aeruginosa biofilms. In addition, short-term treatments with the peptide in combination with ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation and reduced P. aeruginosa PA14 preexisting biofilms. PCR studies indicated that the peptide suppressed the expression of various antibiotic targets in biofilm cells. Thus, treatment with the peptide represents a novel strategy to potentiate antibiotic activity against biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Treated asymptomatic bacteriuria during first year after renal transplantation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are widespread in renal transplant (RTx) recipients with asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) as the predominant form. It is necessary to determine if AB is a risk factor for symptomatic UTIs. METHODS: We analyzed clinical data and urine cultures performed within the first 12 months after RTx in 209 consecutive patients undergoing RTx at Gdansk Transplantation Center between January 2007 and December 2009. RESULTS: We observed 170 AB episodes in 83 patients. This accounted for 53% of all diagnosed UTIs in 111 patients, with more than half of AB episodes occurring during the first month post transplant. The most prevalent uropathogen was Enterococcus faecium (36.8%, n = 32) and, from the second month after RTx, Escherichia coli (54.2%, n = 45). Female gender, use of induction with anti-thymocyte globulin, comorbidity measured by Charlson Comorbidity Index, history of acute rejection, and cytomegalovirus infection were risk factors for developing AB, and no differences in risk factors were seen for developing a symptomatic UTI vs. an AB after RTx. All patients with AB received antibiotic therapy. AB was an independent risk factor for symptomatic UTIs, but only 21 of 152 episodes of symptomatic UTIs were preceded by AB with the same causative agent. CONCLUSIONS: AB is a common finding in the RTx population and AB episodes may be considered a risk factor for symptomatic infections. It remains to be determined if the treatment of AB in RTx patients is in fact helpful or harmful in preventing symptomatic infections.
TI  - [Our experience in Fournier's gangrene with severe septic shock].
AB  - Fournier's gangrene is a rare, rapidly progressing necrotizing fasciitis, which involves the genital area and perineum, progresses towards the thighs and abdominal wall through fascial plains. In our surgical department we treated seven patients with Fournier's gangrene between 2007 and 2011. Early diagnosis, immediate radical surgical debridement, necrosectomy, appropriate antibiotics and intensive care are all required and necessary for the successful treatment. Despite appropriate therapy, two patients were lost in septic shock.
TI  - [Tactics for the correction of intestinal microbiocenotic disorders in the combination therapy of patients with chronic liver diseases].
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of the symbiotic Linex used in the combination therapy of liver cirrhosis (LC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy-four patients with LC, including 44 who received additionally the symbiotic Linex and 30 who had conventional therapy, were examined. All the patients underwent clinical and biochemical blood tests, abdominal ultrasonography, fecal test for bacteria, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the blood composition of microbial markers, number connecting test, and quality-of-life assessment (SF-36). RESULTS: The symbiotic-treated patients showed a significant improvement in biochemical parameters (decreases in transaminase activities, bilirubin levels, hepatic protein-synthetic function--there were elevations in the concentrations of total protein from 74.0 +/- 0.50 to 78.1 +/- 0.80 g/l (p < 0.05) and albumin from 30.6 +/- 1.7 to 35.5 +/- 1.6 g/l (p < 0.05). There were also increases in the count of bifidobacteria from 8.7 +/- 0.1 to 9.1 +/- 0.1 Ig CFU/g (p < 0.05), lactobacilli from 5.0 +/- 0.2 to 5.2 +/- 0.2 Ig CFU/g (p < 0.05) and in the total count of Escherichia coli from 7.6 +/- 0.3 to 7.9 +/- 0.3 Ig CFU/g (p < 0.05); a tendency for normalization of microbial markers was revealed by mass spectrometry; the manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy were alleviated (the number connecting test showed a reduction from 51.0 +/- 3.58 to 29.7 +/- 4.10 sec (p < 0.05)), and the quality of life improved. CONCLUSION: By normalizing enteric microbiocenosis, the symbiotic Linex positively affects the course and prognosis of LC and it is both a symptomatic and pathogenetic agent for the treatment of patients.
TI  - Development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-LipL32-coupled gold nanoparticles for Leptospira detection.
AB  - Detection of antibody specific to Leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. However, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. Molecular techniques are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for Leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. In this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to LipL32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic Leptospira. This coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for Leptospira detection. We demonstrated that the sensitivity of Leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). There was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic Leptospira, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus group B, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium. These data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to LipL32 could be used for Leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.
TI  - Use of accuracy profile procedure to validate a real-time PCR method to quantify  bacteria in feces.
AB  - This study describes a novel validation procedure of real-time PCR based on accuracy profile to estimate bacterial concentrations in fecal samples. To assess the performance of the method, measurements of axenic fecal samples spiked with a measured quantity of known bacterial species (Bacteroides fragilis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Enterococcus faecium, and Escherichia coli) were performed under repeatability and intermediate precision conditions. Data collected were used to compute a tolerance interval that was compared to a defined acceptance interval. It is concluded that the method is valid and relevant for the studied validation range of 8.20-10.24 and 7.43-9.47 log10 CFU/g of feces to ensure proper measurement of B. fragilis and E. coli, respectively. The LOQ is 8.20 and 7.43 log10 CFU/g of feces. In contrast, the method is not valid for the quantification of E. faecium and B. adolescentis, but by applying a correction factor of +0.63 log10 CFU/g, it can be considered valid for E. faecium. This correction is included in the final results. In conclusion, the accuracy profile is a statistical tool that is easy to use and totally adapted to validate real-time PCR.
TI  - Probing the global and local dynamics of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases using all-atom and coarse-grained simulations.
AB  - Coarse-grained simulations have emerged as invaluable tools for studying conformational changes in biomolecules. To evaluate the effectiveness of computationally inexpensive coarse-grained models in studying global and local dynamics of large protein systems like aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, we have performed coarse-grained normal mode analysis, as well as principle component analysis on trajectories of all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations for three aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases--Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase, Thermus thermophilus leucyl-tRNA synthetase, and Enterococcus faecium prolyl-tRNA synthetase. In the present study, comparison of predicted dynamics based on B-factor and overlap calculations revealed that coarse-grained methods are comparable to the all-atom simulations in depicting the intrinsic global dynamics of the three enzymes. However, the principal component analyses of the motions obtained from the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations provide a superior description of the local fluctuations of these enzymes. In particular, the all-atom model was able to capture the functionally relevant substrate-induced dynamical changes in prolyl-tRNA synthetase. The alteration in the coupled dynamics between the catalytically important proline-binding loop and its neighboring structural elements due to substrate binding has been characterized and reported for the first time. Taken together, the study portrays comparable and contrasting situations in studying the functional dynamics of large multi-domain aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases using coarse-grained and all-atom simulation methods.
TI  - Investigation of antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli and enterococci isolated from Tibetan pigs.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli and enterococci isolated from free-ranging Tibetan pigs in Tibet, China, and analyzed the influence of free-ranging husbandry on antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: A total of 232 fecal samples were collected from Tibetan pigs, and the disk diffusion method was used to examine their antimicrobial resistance. Broth microdilution and agar dilution methods were used to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations for antimicrobial agents for which disks were not commercially available. RESULTS: A total of 129 E. coli isolates and 84 Enterococcus isolates were recovered from the fecal samples. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and 40.4% were resistant to tetracycline. A small number of isolates were resistant to florfenicol (27.9%), ampicillin (27.9%), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (19.4%), nalidixic acid (19.4%), streptomycin (16.2%) and ceftiofur (10.9%), and very low resistance rates to ciprofloxacin (7.8%), gentamicin (6.9%), and spectinomycin (2.3%) were observed in E. coli. All Enterococcus isolates, including E. faecium, E. faecalis, E. hirae, and E. mundtii, were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and vancomycin, but showed high frequencies of resistance to oxacillin (92.8%), clindamycin (82.1%), tetracycline (64.3%), and erythromycin (48.8%). Resistance rates to florfenicol (17.9%), penicillin (6.0%), ciprofloxacin (3.6%), levofloxacin (1.2%), and ampicillin (1.2%) were low. Only one high-level streptomycin resistant E. faecium isolate and one high-level gentamicin resistant E. faecium isolate were observed. Approximately 20% and 70% of E. coli and Enterococcus isolates, respectively, were defined as multidrug-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, E. coli and Enterococcus isolated from free-ranging Tibetan pigs showed relatively lower resistance rates than those in other areas of China, where more intensive farming practices are used. These results also revealed that free-range husbandry and absence of antibiotic use could decrease the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance to some extent.
TI  - High inhibition of Paenibacillus larvae and Listeria monocytogenes by Enterococcus isolated from different sources in Tunisia and identification of their bacteriocin genes.
AB  - A total of 300 isolates of Enterococcus, from different sources including faeces  of poultry, cow and sheep, raw milk, ricotta cheese and water, in Tunisia, were screened for their antibacterial activity. Amongst them, 59 bacteriocin-producing strains were detected and identified by molecular methods. Genes encoding for entA, entP, entB, entL50A/B, AS-48 and bac31 bacteriocins were targeted by PCR. The bacteriocin-producing strains were assigned to the species Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus mundtii and Enterococcus durans, respectively, 34, 19, 3, 2 and 1 isolates. Antimicrobial activity was specifically observed against different spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Listeria ivanovii, Escherichia coli, Ent. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and Paenibacillus larvae. The inhibitory activity was totally lost after proteinase K treatment, thereby revealing the proteinaceous nature of the antimicrobial compound. Only three bacteriocin genes, namely entP, entA and entL50A/B were detected in the isolates included in this study. Enterocins A and P were the most frequent genes and they were found in 55 (93.2%) and 39 isolates (66.1%), respectively, followed by enterocin L50A/B present in 27 isolates (45.7%). These newly identified bacteriocin-producing enterococci have the potential to be used in bio-preservation of food as well as biological control of foulbrood disease. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Enterococci possess interesting properties not only for the food industry, but also for animal and human health. The antimicrobial potential of these bacteria includes principally bacteriocin-like molecules. With the aim of identifying bacteriocinogenic strains, a collection of 300 enterococci isolated from different origins were screened and their spectrum of action, as well as the gene encoding the bacteriocin, was determined. Fifty-nine bacteriocin-producing Enterococcus showed high activity against Listeria monocytogenes and Paenibacillus larvae, the causative agent of American foulbrood. Enterocins A, P and L50A/B were found in various combinations. The most important finding of this study is the growth inhibition of P. larvae due to bacteriocin-producing Enterococcus, which opens up the possibility to use these strains to control the disease in honeybees.
TI  - Qualitative detection of class IIa bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria from traditional Chinese fermented food using a YGNGV-motif-based assay.
AB  - In the present study, a YGNGV-motif-based assay was developed and applied. Given  that there is an increasing demand for natural preservatives, we set out to obtain lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that produce bacteriocins against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We here isolated 123 LAB strains from 5 types of traditional Chinese fermented food and screened them for the production of bacteriocins using the agar well diffusion assay (AWDA). Then, to acquire LAB producing class IIa bacteriocins, we used a YGNGV-motif-based assay that was based on 14 degenerate primers matching all class IIa bacteriocin-encoding genes currently deposited in NCBI. Eight of the LAB strains identified by AWDA could inhibit Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; 5 of these were YGNGV-amplicon positive. Among these 5 isolates, amplicons from 2 strains (Y31 and Y33) matched class IIa bacteriocin genes. Strain Y31 demonstrated the highest inhibitory activity and the best match to a class IIa bacteriocin gene in NCBI, and was identified as Enterococcus faecium. The bacteriocin from Enterococcus avium Y33 was 100% identical to enterocin P. Both of these strains produced bacteriocins with strong antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis, hence these bacteriocins hold promise as potential bio-preservatives in the food industry. These findings also indicated that the YGNGV-motif-based assay used in this study could identify novel class IIa bacteriocinogenic LAB, rapidly and specifically, saving time and labour by by-passing multiple separation and purification steps.
TI  - Heterologous expression and characterization of tyrosine decarboxylase from Enterococcus faecalis R612Z1 and Enterococcus faecium R615Z1.
AB  - Tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC) is responsible for tyramine production and can catalyze phenylalanine to produce beta-phenylethylamine. Enterococcus strains are a group of bacteria predominantly producing tyramine and beta-phenylethylamine in water-boiled salted duck. In this study, the heterologous expression and characterization of two TDCs from Enterococcus faecalis R612Z1 (612TDC) and Enterococcus faecium R615Z1 (615TDC) were studied. The recombinant putative proteins of 612TDC and 615TDC were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. 612TDC is a 620-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 70.0 kDa, whereas 615TDC is a 625-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 70.3 kDa. Both 612TDC and 615TDC showed an optimum temperature of 25 degrees C for the tyrosine and phenylalanine substrates. However, 612TDC revealed maximal activity at pH 5.5, whereas 615TDC revealed maximal activity at pH 6.0. Kinetic studies showed that 612TDC and 615TDC exhibited higher specificity for tyrosine than for phenylalanine. The catalysis abilities of both 612TDC and 615TDC for phenylalanine were restrained significantly with the increase in NaCl concentration, but this was not the case for tyrosine. This study revealed that the enzyme properties of the purified recombinant 612TDC and 615TDC were similar, although their amino acid sequences had 84% identity.
TI  - Enterococci as Indicators of Environmental Fecal Contamination
AB  - Enterococci are found in high concentrations in human feces, usually between 104  and 106 bacteria per gram wet weight (Layton, Walters, Lam, & Boehm, 2010; Slanetz & Bartley, 1957; Zubrzycki & Spaulding, 1962); see also Enterococcus Diversity, Origins in Nature, and Gut Colonization). Although enterococci usually represent less than 1% of the flora (Tendolkar, Baghdayan, & Shankar, 2003), they are usually present in the fecal consortium, but are outnumbered by other bacteria, including Escherichia coli, clostridia, and the Bacteroidales (Zubrzycki & Spaulding, 1962). Due to their ubiquity in human feces and persistence in the environment, enterococci have been adopted as indicators of human fecal pollution in water. More recently, their densities on human hands have been used as indicators of hand hygiene. The use of enterococci as indicators of human fecal pollution or contamination can be problematic, however, because enterococci are also found in animal feces (Harwood, Whitlock, & Withington, 2000; Layton, Walters, Lam, & Boehm, 2010), in soils (Byappanahalli & Fujioka, 2004; Goto & Yan, 2011), and on plants (Byappanahalli, Shively, Nevers, Sadowsky, & Whitman, 2003; Imamura, Thompson, Boehm, & Jay, 2011; Muller, Ulrich, Ott, & Muller, 2001). Although there is debate about the extent to which this happens in nature, there is evidence that enterococci are capable of replicating in extra-enteric environments, such as on beach sands (Bahirathan, Puente, & Seyfried, 1998; Zubrzycki & Spaulding, 1962) and in water containing kelp (Byappanahalli, Shively, Nevers, Sadowsky, & Whitman, 2003; Imamura, Thompson, Boehm, & Jay, 2011) and plankton (Mote, Turner, & Lipp, 2012). Identification of human-specific enterococcal species or genotypes could aid in the discrimination of human fecal contamination from other environmental sources of the organisms. Some data suggest that Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis may be more prevalent in human feces than other enterococcal species, while Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus mundtii may be more abundant in environmental reservoirs (such as on plants) than other species (Bahirathan, Puente, & Seyfried, 1998; Ferguson, Moore, Getrich, & Zhowandai, 2005; Wheeler, Hartel, Godfrey, Hill, & Segars, 2002). However, a number of species of Enterococcus have been isolated from human feces (Layton, Walters, Lam, & Boehm, 2010); Enterococcus Diversity, Origins in Nature, and Gut Colonization), so it will be difficult to derive a single host-specific indicator. It has been suggested that E. faecium that contains the enterococcal surface protein (esp) gene may be human-specific (Scott, Jenkins, Lukasik, & Rose, 2005), but esp-containing E. faecium can also be found in select animal hosts (Layton, Walters, & Boehm, 2009; Whitman, Przybyla-Kelly, Shively, & Byappanahalli, 2007). Fecal enterococci from the GI tract consortia of healthy humans are generally not virulent. Nevertheless, multidrug-resistant Enterococcus strains have emerged as leading causes of hospital-acquired infections (Tendolkar, Baghdayan, & Shankar, 2003). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci are particularly important pathogens (Willems, et al., 2005), as are esp-containing E. faecalis (Shankar, Baghdayan, Huycke, Lindahl, & Gilmore, 1999) and E. faecium (Willems, et al., 2001), as well as other types of E. faecalis and E. faecium (Wisplinghoff, Bischoff, Tallent, Seifert, Wenzel, & Edmond, 2004). It is estimated that there are 800,000 cases of enterococcal infection in the US each year, adding $500,000,000 to annual healthcare costs (Tendolkar, Baghdayan, & Shankar, 2003). Therefore, the presence of enterococci in the environment and on hands may have important direct health implications.
TI  - Plantaricin LD1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of Lactobacillus plantarum LD1.
AB  - Plantaricin LD1, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LD1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. Bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees C for 20 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a pH range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. The crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase K showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. The molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kDa, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. It inhibited not only related strains but also other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B-4562, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis NRRL B-1821, Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354, Enterobacter cloacae NRRL B-14298, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, urogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Vibrio sp. These properties of plantaricin LD1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
TI  - Etiology of peritonitis.
AB  - AIM: To determine the etiology of peritonitis, as well as the sensitivity of isolated bacteria to antibiotics. METHODS: Study was performed at the Surgical Clinic, Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Department of Microbiology, Department of Clinical Pharmacology of University Clinical Centre (UCC) Tuzla. In a prospective study, starting from 1.6.2009. to 30.6.2010., was 60 patients analyzed who underwent surgery for acute peritonitis in the Surgical Clinic, UCC Tuzla. RESULTS: After microbiological processing of the content of the operative field, wound swabs and smears of drainage, we isolated Gram positive coccid bacteria: Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in 18.36%, Staphylococcus aureus in 12.6%, while Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecum were found in 3.44% isolates. In the group of Gram-negative bacteria we isolated: Escherichia coli in 15.51%, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 10.34% of the cases. The sensitivity of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was largest to vancomycin (100%), and lowest to penicillin (10%) and Staphylococcus aureus sensitivity was largest to vancomycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate (100%) and lowest to penicillins (3.7%). Sensitivity of the facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli was highest to carbapenems 95-100%, and lowest to penicillin preparations 0-56%. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of microbiological findings of 83.33% patients empirical antibiotic therapy was appropriately involved, and in 16.67% was inadequate and later changed, following the results of microbiological findings. This study indicates the importance and validity of microbiological diagnostics to determine the etiology of peritonitis and appropriate selection of antibiotics to treat these infections, with the required surgical treatment.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of indicator bacteria isolated from chickens in Southeast Asian countries (Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand).
AB  - To determine the prevalence of indicator bacteria resistant to antimicrobials among poultry in three Southeast Asian countries (Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand), we examined the antimicrobial susceptibilities of commensal bacteria isolated from chickens. In total, 125, 117 and 180 isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively, were used to test for antimicrobial susceptibility. Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial treatment was most frequently observed with oxytetracycline with a prevalence of 73.6% (E. coli), 69.2% (E. faecalis) and 92.2% (E. faecium). Resistance to fluoroquinolones, which are critically important medicines, was also frequently observed in E. coli (48.8%), E. faecalis (17.9%) and E. faecium (82.8%). The prevalence of indicator bacteria resistant to most of the antimicrobials tested in these countries was higher than those for developed countries. The factors underlying antimicrobial resistance may include inappropriate and/or excessive use of antimicrobials. These results highlight the need for monitoring the emergence and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in developing countries.
TI  - Evaluation of epidemiological cut-off values indicates that biocide resistant subpopulations are uncommon in natural isolates of clinically-relevant microorganisms.
AB  - To date there are no clear criteria to determine whether a microbe is susceptible to biocides or not. As a starting point for distinguishing between wild-type and resistant organisms, we set out to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) distributions for four common biocides; triclosan, benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite for 3319 clinical isolates, with a particular focus on Staphylococcus aureus (N = 1635) and Salmonella spp. (N = 901) but also including Escherichia coli (N = 368), Candida albicans (N = 200), Klebsiella pneumoniae (N = 60), Enterobacter spp. (N = 54), Enterococcus faecium (N = 53), and Enterococcus faecalis (N = 56). From these data epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) are proposed. As would be expected, MBCs were higher than MICs for all biocides. In most cases both values followed a normal distribution. Bimodal distributions, indicating the existence of biocide resistant subpopulations were observed for Enterobacter chlorhexidine susceptibility (both MICs and MBCs) and the susceptibility to triclosan of Enterobacter (MBC), E. coli (MBC and MIC) and S. aureus (MBC and MIC). There is a concern on the potential selection of antibiotic resistance by biocides. Our results indicate however that resistance to biocides and, hence any potential association with antibiotic resistance, is uncommon in natural populations of clinically relevant microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro activity of rifaximin against isolates from patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  - Rifaximin, a non-absorbable rifamycin derivative, has published clinical efficacy in the alleviation of symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is associated with the pathogenesis of IBS. This study describes for the first time the antimicrobial effect of rifaximin against SIBO micro-organisms from humans. Fluid was aspirated from the third part of the duodenum from 567 consecutive patients; quantitative cultures diagnosed SIBO in 117 patients (20.6%). A total of 170 aerobic micro-organisms were isolated and the in vitro efficacy of rifaximin was studied by (i) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing by a microdilution technique and (ii) time-kill assays using bile to simulate the small intestinal environment. At a breakpoint of 32 mug/mL, rifaximin inhibited in vitro 85.4% of Escherichia coli, 43.6% of Klebsiella spp., 34.8% of Enterobacter spp., 54.5% of other Enterobacteriaceae spp., 82.6% of non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negative spp., 100% of Enterococcus faecalis, 100% of Enterococcus faecium and 100% of Staphylococcus aureus. For the time-kill assays, 11 E. coli, 15 non-E. coli Gram-negative enterobacteria and three E. faecalis isolates were studied. Rifaximin produced a >3 log10 decrease in the starting inoculum against most of the tested isolates at 500 mug/mL after 24h of growth. The results indicate that rifaximin has a potent effect on specific small bowel flora associated with SIBO. This conclusion should be regarded in light of the considerable time-kill effect at concentrations lower than those achieved in the bowel lumen after administration of conventional doses in humans.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates collected from the Middle East and Africa between 2004 and 2011.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) was established in 2004 to monitor longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to numerous antimicrobial agents, specifically tigecycline. In this study, susceptibility among Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates between 2004 and 2011 from the Middle East and Africa was examined. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) interpretive criteria, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution methods. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved breakpoints were used for tigecycline. In total, 2967 Gram-positive and 6322 Gram-negative isolates were examined from 33 participating centres. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including meticillin-resistant S. aureus, were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin. Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline and levofloxacin were highly active (>97.6% susceptibility) against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-non-susceptible strains. All Enterococcus faecium isolates were susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid, including 32 vancomycin-resistant isolates. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were produced by 16.6% of Escherichia coli and 32.9% of Klebsiella pneumoniae. More than 95% of E. coli and Enterobacter spp. were susceptible to amikacin, tigecycline, imipenem and meropenem. The most active agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were amikacin (88.0% susceptible) and minocycline (64.2% susceptible), respectively; the MIC90 (MIC required to inhibit 90% of the isolates) of tigecycline against A. baumannii was low at 2mg/L. Tigecycline and carbapenem agents were highly active against most Gram-negative pathogens. Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin showed good activity against most Gram-positive pathogens from the Middle East and Africa.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Novel method to identify the optimal antimicrobial peptide in a combination matrix, using anoplin as an example.
AB  - Microbial resistance is an increasing health concern and a true danger to human well-being. A worldwide search for new compounds is ongoing, and antimicrobial peptides are promising lead candidates for tomorrow's antibiotics. The decapeptide anoplin (GLLKRIKTLL-NH2) is an especially interesting candidate because of its small size as well as its antimicrobial and nonhemolytic properties. Optimization of the properties of an antimicrobial peptide such as anoplin requires multidimensional searching in a complex chemical space. Typically, such optimization is performed by labor-intensive and costly trial-and-error methods. In this study, we show the benefit of fractional factorial design for identification of the optimal antimicrobial peptide in a combination matrix. We synthesized and analyzed a training set of 12 anoplin analogs, representative of 64 analogs in total. Using MIC, hemolysis, and high-performance liquid chromatography retention time data, we constructed analysis-of-variance models that describe the relationship between these properties and the structural characteristics of the analogs. We show that the mathematical models derived from the training set data can be used to predict the properties of other analogs in the chemical space. Hence, this method provides an efficient means of identification of the optimal peptide in the searched chemical space.
TI  - Neutralization of the antimicrobial effect of glyphosate by humic acid in vitro.
AB  - In the present study, the neutralization ability of the antimicrobial effect of glyphosate by different humic acids was investigated. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of glyphosate for different bacteria such as Bacillus badius, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Escherichia coli, E. coli 1917 strain Nissle, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium were determined in the presence or absence of different concentrations of humic acid (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg mL(-1)). Our findings indicated that humic acids inhibited the antimicrobial effect of glyphosate on different bacteria. This information can help overcome the negative impact of glyphosate residues in feed and water.
TI  - Epidemiology and clinical features of bloodstream infections in hematology wards: one year experience at the catholic blood and marrow transplantation center.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features and epidemiology of bloodstream infections (BSIs) in 2 distinctive hematological wards of the Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation (BMT) center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical data of patients who developed BSIs from June 2009 to May 2010 in 2 hematologic wards at the Catholic BMT center. Ward A is a 44-bed unit mainly conducting conventional high dose chemotherapy and ward B is a 23-bed unit exclusively conducting BMT. RESULTS: Overall, 222 BSI episodes were developed from 159 patients. Acute myeloid leukemia in ward A and multiple myeloma in ward B were more frequent than in ward B and A, respectively. Sex, age, presence of neutropenia, shock, Pitt bacteremia score, type of central catheter, level of C-reactive protein, duration of admission days, type of BSI, overall mortality and distribution of organisms were not different between the 2 wards. There were 202 monomicrobial and 20 polymicrobial BSI episodes, including 2 fungemia episodes. The incidence rate of overall BSIs per 1,000 patient-days was higher in ward A than in ward B (incidence rate ratio 2.88, 95% confidence interval 1.97-4.22, P<0.001). Among 243 organisms isolated, the number of gram positives, gram negatives and fungi were 122, 119 and 2, respectively. Escherichia coli was the most common organism in both ward A and B (27.6% and 42.4%), followed by viridians streptococci (18.6% and 15.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.3% and 9.0%). Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers accounted for 31.9% (23/72) of E. coli and 71.0% (22/31) of K. pneumoniae. Out of 19 Enterococcus faecium, 7 isolates (36.8%) were resistant to vancomycin. The crude mortality rates at 7 and 30 days after each BSI episode were 4.5% (10/222) and 13.1% (29/222), and were significantly higher in the patients with shock compared with those without shock (20.5% vs. 1.1%, P<0.001 and 38.5% vs. 7.7%, P<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rate of BSIs was higher in patients receiving chemotherapy than those receiving BMT, but the distribution of organisms was not different between the 2 wards. E. coli was the most common causative BSI organism in hematologic wards followed by viridians streptococci and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Adherence of bacteria to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract of heifers and cows.
AB  - In the present study, we examined the adherence of indigenous vaginal bacteria, probiotic strains, and metritis pathogens to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tracts of heifers and cows and compared their adherence with the bacterial adherence to mucus collected from the stomach and large intestine of pigs. Most of the vaginal strains adhered to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract and strongly adhered to gastric mucus, with the exception of Lactobacillus buchneri 24S8. Only Lactobacillus mucosae 29S8, Enterococcus faecium E21, and E. faecium EAC adhered to colonic mucus. Probiotic strains adhered strongly to mucus collected from the reproductive tract and gastric mucus but did not adhere to colonic mucus. Pathogenic strains were adherent to vaginal, uterine horn, and gastric mucus, except Escherichia coli O8:K88ab:H9 (65), Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Gardnerella vaginalis, which adhered to uterine cervix mucus. Only Kocuria kristinae and G. vaginalis adhered to uterine body mucus; E. coli O149:K88ac (EC) adhered to colonic mucus. The strains did not exhibit host specificity but rather strain specificity. The ability to adhere to mucus was a characteristic unique to each strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding in vitro adherence of GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) lactobacilli isolated from different sources to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract.
TI  - Epidemic Escherichia coli ST131 and Enterococcus faecium ST17 in coastal marine sediments from an Italian beach.
AB  - Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are used worldwide to assess water quality in coastal environments, but little is known about their genetic diversity and pathogenicity. This study examines the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and genetic diversity of FIB isolated from marine sediments from a central Adriatic seaside resort. FIB, recovered from 6 out of 7 sites, were significantly more abundant at sampling stations 300 m offshore than close to the shore. Escherichia coli accounted for 34.5% of fecal coliforms, and Enterococcus faecalis accounted for 32% of enterococci. Most isolates (27% of E. coli and 22% of enterococci) were recovered from the sediments that had the highest organic content. Multidrug-resistant E. coli (31%) and enterococci (22%) were found at nearly all sites, whereas 34.5% of E. coli and 28% of enterococci harboring multiple virulence factors were recovered from just two sites. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing showed wide genetic diversity among isolates. Human epidemic clones ( E. coli ST131 and Enterococcus faecium ST17) were identified for the first time by multilocus sequence typing in an area where bathing had not been prohibited. These clones were from sites far removed from riverine inputs, suggesting a wide diffusion of pathogenic FIB in the coastal environment and a high public health risk.
TI  - Prevalence of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase genes aph(3')-IIIa and aph(3')-IIa in Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and Staphylococcus aureus isolates in Austria.
AB  - The aminoglycoside phosphotransferase aph(3')-IIa primarily inactivates kanamycin and neomycin, whilst aph(3')-IIIa also inactivates amikacin. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of both resistance genes in major human pathogens to obtain their baseline prevalence in the gene pool of these bacterial populations in Austria. In total, 10 541 Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and Staphylococcus aureus isolates were collected representatively without selection bias between 2008 and 2011. Isolates were analysed by aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII- and aph(3')-IIa/nptII-specific TaqMan real-time PCR. For positive strains, MICs using Etests were performed and resistance gene sequences were determined. The overall prevalence of aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII was 1.62 % (95 % confidence interval: 1.38-1.88 %). In Escherichia coli, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, P. aeruginosa and Salmonella spp., the aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII prevalence was 0.47 % (0-1.47 %), 37.53 % (32.84-42.40 %), 2.90 % (1.51-5.02 %), 0 % (0-0.32 %) and 0 % (0-0.037 %), respectively. Eleven of a total of 169 carriers showed single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the resistance allele. The overall prevalence of aph(3')-IIa/nptII was 0.0096 % (0-0.046 %). Escherichia coli (0-0.70 %), enterococci (0-0.75 %), Staphylococcus aureus (0-0.73 %) and P. aeruginosa (0-0.32 %) did not carry aph(3')-IIa. A single Salmonella isolate was positive, resulting in an aph(3')-IIa prevalence of 0.013 % (0-0.058 %). aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII carriers were moderately prevalent in the strains tested except for in enterococci, which appeared to be an important reservoir for aph(3')-IIIa. aph(3')-IIa/nptII genes were detected at clinically irrelevant frequencies and played no significant role in the aminoglycoside resistance gene pool during the observation period.
TI  - Effects of a probiotic, Enterococcus faecium, on growth performance, intestinal morphology, immune response, and cecal microflora in broiler chickens challenged with Escherichia coli K88.
AB  - The effects of feeding dehydrated Enterococcus faecium on growth performance, immune response, and cecal microflora in broiler chickens challenged with Escherichia coli K88 were investigated. Two hundred eighty-eight 1-d-old birds were randomly assigned to 4 treatments: negative control birds (N-con) fed a basal diet and not challenged with E. coli K88; positive control birds (P-con) fed a basal diet and challenged with E. coli K88; birds fed a basal diet including dehydrated E. faecium (Ef) at 1 x 10(9) cfu/kg of feed and challenged with E. coli K88; and birds fed a basal diet including the antibiotic colistine sulfate (Anti) at 10 mg/kg of feed and challenged with E. coli K88. Birds fed E. faecium had greater (P < 0.05) BW on d 14, 21, and 28 and greater (P < 0.05) jejunal villus height on d 21 and 28 compared with birds on the other treatments. Jejunal crypt depth was decreased (P < 0.05) in birds fed either E. faecium or antibiotic compared with P-con treatment birds on d 10, 21, and 28. Birds fed E. faecium had a greater (P < 0.05) concentration of IL-4 in their jejunal mucosa than did those in the N-con treatment group on d 10, 14, and 21. Infected birds, with or without E. faecium feeding, had a higher (P < 0.05) tumor necrosis factor-alpha and secreted IgA in their jejunal mucosa than did those in the N-con treatment group on d 10 and 14. Birds fed E. faecium had lower (P < 0.05) concentrations of E. coli on d 14 and 28, less (P < 0.05) Clostridium perfringens on d 28, greater Lactobacillus counts on d 14 and 21, and greater (P < 0.05) Bifidobacterium in their cecal contents on d 21 than did the P-con birds. These results suggest that E. faecium can promote growth performance, improve intestinal morphology, and beneficially manipulate the cecal microflora in broilers challenged with E. coli K88.
TI  - Feeding the probiotic Enterococcus faecium strain NCIMB 10415 to piglets specifically reduces the number of Escherichia coli pathotypes that adhere to the gut mucosa.
AB  - Feed supplementation with the probiotic Enterococcus faecium for piglets has been found to reduce pathogenic gut microorganisms. Since Escherichia coli is among the most important pathogens in pig production, we performed comprehensive analyses to gain further insight into the influence of E. faecium NCIMB 10415 on porcine intestinal E. coli. A total of 1,436 E. coli strains were isolated from three intestinal habitats (mucosa, digesta, and feces) of probiotic-supplemented and nonsupplemented (control) piglets. E. coli bacteria were characterized via pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for clonal analysis. The high diversity of E. coli was reflected by 168 clones. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to determine the phylogenetic backgrounds, revealing 79 sequence types (STs). Pathotypes of E. coli were further defined using multiplex PCR for virulence-associated genes. While these analyses discerned only a few significant differences in the E. coli population between the feeding groups, analyses distinguishing clones that were uniquely isolated in either the probiotic group only, the control group only, or both groups (shared group) revealed clear effects at the habitat level. Interestingly, extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC)-typical clones adhering to the mucosa were significantly reduced in the probiotic group. Our data show a minor influence of E. faecium on the overall population of E. coli in healthy piglets. In contrast, this probiotic has a profound effect on mucosa-adherent E. coli. This finding further substantiates a specific effect of E. faecium strain NCIMB 10415 in piglets against pathogenic E. coli in the intestine. In addition, these data question the relevance of data based on sampling fecal E. coli only.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - In-vitro experimental evaluation of skin-to-surface recovery of four bacterial species by antibacterial and non-antibacterial medical examination gloves.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of bacteria recovered from a stainless steel coupon after  touching a pigskin substrate with an examination glove coated on its outside with polyhexanide (PHMB), as compared to the number of bacteria recovered in the same manner with non-coated control gloves was evaluated. METHODS: Suspensions containing 1 x 109 colony-forming units of 4 clinically relevant bacterial species (Enterococcus faecium ATCC #51559; Escherichia coli ATCC #25922; Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC #4352; and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC #33591) were used to contaminate Gamma-irradiated pigskin substrates. Bacterial recoveries from the pigskin substrate, stainless steel coupons, and each glove swatch were performed. A difference in the bacterial recovery from the stainless steel coupons after touching with coated and uncoated control gloves was measured. RESULTS: For E. faecium, the coated glove showed a reduction of 4.63 log10 cfu recovery, when compared to control gloves. For E. coli, the coated glove showed 5.48 log10 cfu, for K. pneumoniae 5.03 log10 cfu, and for S. aureus 5.72 log10 cfu recovery, when compared to the non-coated control glove. CONCLUSION: An in-vitro experiment designed to mimic cross-contamination of clinically relevant bacteria in a simulated healthcare setting following glove contact with a contaminated biological surface and cross-transfer to a stainless steel surface has demonstrated that an examination glove coated on its outside surface with PHMB was able to reduce bacterial recovery from a contaminated surface by > 4 log10 cfu, compared to a control non-coated examination glove. These elaborated results may encourage further clinical investigation on the clinical impact of an antibacterial examination glove.
TI  - Evidence for phenylalanine zipper-mediated dimerization in the X-ray crystal structure of a magainin 2 analogue.
AB  - High-resolution structure elucidation has been challenging for the large group of host-defense peptides that form helices on or within membranes but do not manifest a strong folding propensity in aqueous solution. Here we report the crystal structure of an analogue of the widely studied host-defense peptide magainin 2. Magainin 2 (S8A, G13A, G18A) is a designed variant that displays enhanced antibacterial activity relative to the natural peptide. The crystal structure of magainin 2 (S8A, G13A, G18A), obtained for the racemic form, features a dimerization mode that has previously been proposed to play a role in the antibacterial activity of magainin 2 and related peptides.
TI  - Update of contemporary antimicrobial resistance rates across China: reference testing results for 12 medical centers (2011).
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (R) surveillance across Asia and especially in China has documented unique patterns and mechanisms. This 2011 study reports results for 2278 isolates from 12 hospitals in China (94-216 strains/site); most from bacteremia (20.4%), pneumonias (29.1%), or skin and skin structure infections (20.9%). Samples were tested by reference broth microdilution methods, interpreted by published susceptibility (S) breakpoints. The most common species were Staphylococcus aureus (343, 45.8% MRSA), Escherichia coli (EC; 288), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA; 221), Klebsiella spp. (KSP; 208), acinetobacters (ACB; 178), enterobacters (155), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN; 154, 46.8% penicillin-S), and enterococci (ENT; 137). Among 849 Gram-positive (GP) cocci, linezolid, tigecycline (TIG), daptomycin, and vancomycin provided best antimicrobial coverage (>/=99.7% S). Resistance patterns of concern were 0.3% VISA, 15.4% teicoplanin non-S coagulase-negative staphylococci, 1.5% vancomycin-R ENT (all Enterococcus faecium), 1.9% levofloxacin-R beta-haemolytic streptococci, and 35.1 and 12.7% ceftriaxone-non-S rates for SPN and viridans group streptococci, respectively. For Gram-negative bacilli, R among Enterobacteriaceae was highest against beta-lactams (extended spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains at 73.6 and 42.8% in EC and KSP, respectively; carbapenem-R was only 2.1-4.3% with KPC and IMP type enzymes detected in KSP). The widest spectrum agents were cefoperazone/sulbactam (79.5-86.1%), piperacillin/tazobactam (88.9-92.0%), TIG (98.6-100%), amikacin (AMK; 91.8-93.7%), and meropenem (95.7-97.1% S). PSA was most inhibited by AMK (90.5% S) and colistin (COL; 99.5%), with cefepime (67.9%) best among the tested beta-lactams. Only COL (100% S) and TIG (MIC90, 2 mug/mL) showed significant potencies against ACB. In conclusion, R among pathogens from 12 Chinese hospitals illustrates several agents active against GP pathogens, but more serious R problems were noted among Enterobacteriaceae, PSA, and ACB. Combination treatment for the latter multidrug-R strains appears necessary, guided by local antibiograms and national surveillance results applying reference methods.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Dissemination of antibiotic resistant Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli from wild birds of Azores Archipelago.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant is profoundly important to human and animal health, but the  environmental reservoirs of resistance determinants are poorly understood, in particular in wild environments in remote Archipelagos. Moreover, the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in wild bird populations is rather unknown. In the present study, we used the Azores Islands as a model study for antimicrobial resistance in a remote Archipelago, and examined the antibiotic resistance profile in enterococci and Escherichia coli recovered from faecal samples of wild birds collected in this Archipelago. A total of 138 enterococci and 115 E. coli isolates were analyzed for resistance to antimicrobial agents. Of the enterococcal isolates, Enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent detected species (59 isolates), followed by Enterococcus faecium (40 isolates), Enterococcus durans (27 isolates) and Enterococcus hirae (12 isolates). The enterococci strains showed high percentages of resistance to tetracycline (32.6%), to ciprofloxacin (19.6%) and to erythromycin (11.6%). Lower level of resistance (<10%) was detected for ampicillin, chloramphenicol and teicoplanin. One vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis isolate was detected and harbored the vanA resistant gene. Resistance genes detected included tet(M) and/or tet(L), ermB in all tetracycline and erythromycin-resistant isolates. Resistance in E. coli isolates was detected for ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, streptomycin, and tobramycin. The blaTEM, aadA, aadA5, strA, strB, tet(A) and/or tet(B), and the intI genes were found in all ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim-resistant isolates respectively. The data shown in this study are essential to improve knowledge about the dissemination of resistant strains through wild birds from remote archipelagos such as the Azores Archipelago and the possible implications involved in transferring these resistances either to other animals or to humans.
TI  - Microbiological quality of ready-to-eat salads: an underestimated vehicle of bacteria and clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  - The increase demand for fresh vegetables is causing an expansion of the market for minimally processed vegetables along with new recognized food safety problems. To gain further insight on this topic we analyzed the microbiological quality of Portuguese ready-to-eat salads (RTS) and their role in the spread of bacteria carrying acquired antibiotic resistance genes, food products scarcely considered in surveillance studies. A total of 50 RTS (7 brands; split or mixed leaves, carrot, corn) were collected in 5 national supermarket chains in Porto region (2010). They were tested for aerobic mesophilic counts, coliforms and Escherichia coli counts as well as for the presence of Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes. Samples were also plated in different selective media with/without antibiotics before and after enrichment. The E. coli, other coliforms and Enterococcus recovered were characterized for antibiotic resistance profiles and clonality with phenotypic and genetic approaches. A high number of RTS presented poor microbiological quality (86%--aerobic mesophilic counts, 74%--coliforms, 4%--E. coli), despite the absence of screened pathogens. In addition, a high diversity of bacteria (species and clones) and antibiotic resistance backgrounds (phenotypes and genotypes) were observed, mostly with enrichment and antibiotic selective media. E. coli was detected in 13 samples (n=78; all types and 4 brands; phylogenetic groups A, B1 and D; none STEC) with resistance to tetracycline [72%; tet(A) and/or tet(B)], streptomycin (58%; aadA and/or strA-strB), sulfamethoxazole (50%; sul1 and/or sul2), trimethoprim (50%; dfrA1 or dfrA12), ampicillin (49%; blaTEM), nalidixic acid (36%), ciprofloxacin (5%) or chloramphenicol (3%; catA). E. coli clones, including the widespread group D/ST69, were detected in different samples from the same brand or different brands pointing out to a potential cross-contamination. Other clinically relevant resistance genes were detected in 2 Raoultella terrigena carrying a bla(SHV-2) and 1 Citrobacter freundii isolate with a qnrB9 gene. Among Enterococcus (n=108; 35 samples; Enterococcus casseliflavus--40, Enterococcus faecalis--20, Enterococcus faecium--18, Enterococcus hirae--9, Enterococcus gallinarum--5, and Enterococcus spp.--16) resistance was detected for tetracyclines [6%; tet(M) and/or tet(L)], erythromycin [3%; erm(B)], nitrofurantoin (1%) or ciprofloxacin (1%). The present study places ready-to-eat salads within the spectrum of ecological niches that may be vehicles for antibiotic resistance bacteria/genes with clinical interest (e.g. E. coli-D-ST69; bla(SHV-2)) and these findings are worthy of attention as their spread to humans by ingestion cannot be dismissed.
TI  - Amino acid residues crucial for specificity of toxin-antitoxin interactions in the homologous Axe-Txe and YefM-YoeB complexes.
AB  - Toxin-antitoxin complexes are ubiquitous in bacteria. The specificity of interactions between toxins and antitoxins from homologous but non-interacting systems was investigated. Based on molecular modeling, selected amino acid residues were changed to assess which positions were crucial in the specificity of toxin-antitoxin interaction in the related Axe-Txe and YefM-YoeB complexes. No cross-interactions between wild-type proteins were detected. However, a single amino acid substitution that converts a Txe-specific residue to a YoeB-specific residue reduced, but did not abolish, Txe interaction with the Axe antitoxin. Interestingly, this alteration (Txe-Asp83Tyr) promoted functional interactions between Txe and the YefM antitoxin. The interactions between Txe-Asp83Tyr and YefM were sufficiently strong to abolish Txe toxicity and to allow effective corepression by YefM-Txe-Asp83Tyr of the promoter from which yefM-yoeB is expressed. We conclude that Asp83 in Txe is crucial for the specificity of toxin-antitoxin interactions in the Axe-Txe complex and that swapping this residue for the equivalent residue in YoeB relaxes the specificity of the toxin-antitoxin interaction.
TI  - Synthetic analogs of anoplin show improved antimicrobial activities.
AB  - We present the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of the decapeptide anoplin  and 19 analogs thereof tested against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 33591 (MRSA), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (ATCC 700221) (VRE), and Candida albicans (ATCC 200955). The anoplin analogs contain substitutions in amino acid positions 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. We use these peptides to study the effect of altering the charge and hydrophobicity of anoplin on activity against red blood cells and microorganisms. We find that increasing the charge and/or hydrophobicity improves antimicrobial activity and increases hemolytic activity. For each strain tested, we identify at least six anoplin analogs with an improved therapeutic index compared with anoplin, the only exception being Enterococcus faecium, against which only few compounds are more specific than anoplin. Both 2Nal(6) and Cha(6) show improved therapeutic index against all strains tested.
TI  - Characterization of probiotic properties of Enterococcus faecium NHRD IHARA isolated from porcine feces.
AB  - We examined in vitro the adhesion of Enterococcus faecium NHRD IHARA (NHRD IHARA) to porcine small intestinal mucin (PSIM) and inhibition of the adherence of enteropathogenic bacteria due to pre-incubation of PSIM with NHRD IHARA. NHRD IHARA exhibited an effective barrier function in porcine small intestinal mucus layer.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured Cu-SiO2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
AB  - There is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (HCAI). One method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial materials. The antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in HCAI. The structure of the coatings was determined using Scanning Electron Microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. Antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on BS ISO 22196:2007. The coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. SEM showed nano-structured aggregates of Cu within a silica matrix. A log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. The results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. The coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.
TI  - Food-borne zoonotic pathogens and antimicrobial resistance of indicator bacteria  in urban wild boars in Barcelona, Spain.
AB  - Wildlife is increasingly abundant in urban environments, but little is known about the zoonotic pathogens carried by these populations. Urban wild boars are of particular concern because this species is well-known as a pathogen reservoir, and thus, we studied selected zoonotic pathogens in urban wild boars in Barcelona, Spain (n=41). Salmonella enterica was found in 5.00% (95% CI 0.61-16.91) and Campylobacter coli in 4.88% (95% CI 0.6-16.53) of the animals. E. coli O157:H7 and C. jejuni were not found. Other thermophilic Campylobacter were moderately prevalent (19.51%, 95% CI 8.82-34.87). Additionally, we screened for antimicrobial resistance in indicator bacteria: resistance was most frequent in Enterococcus faecium (95% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (50%) and Escherichia coli (10%). For the first time resistance to linezolid in bacteria carried by wildlife is reported. These findings pose a concern for public health, and thus, further research is needed on wildlife in urban environments.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and epidemiology of female urinary tract infections in South Korea, 2010-2011.
AB  - This study aimed to (i) investigate the antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria that cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) in outpatient and inpatient settings and (ii) evaluate the risk factors for emerging antimicrobial drug resistance in UTIs in South Korea. In total, 3,023 samples without duplication were collected from females between 25 and 65 years of age who had been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection. Multicenter patient data were collected using a Web-based electronic system and then evaluated. The isolation rates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecium in the outpatient setting were 78.1, 4.7, and 1.3%, respectively; in the inpatient setting, the isolation rates of these microorganisms were 37.8, 9.9, and 14.8%, respectively. The susceptibilities of E. coli to amikacin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem in the outpatient setting were 99.4, 79.8, 89.4, 92.8, 69.8, 96.9, and 100.0%, respectively; in the inpatient setting, the susceptibilities to these antibiotics were 97.8, 73.9, 73.7, 82.1, 53.6, 93.2, and 100.0%, respectively. The most unique and common risk factor for emerging antimicrobial-resistant E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and E. faecium was previous exposure to antimicrobials. On the basis of these data, the use of fluoroquinolones should be reserved until culture data are available for the treatment of UTIs in South Korea. The present study will serve as a useful reference for Far Eastern Asia.
TI  - Specificity of the neutralizers as the cause of errors in evaluating disinfectant efficacy: an assessment of triclosan.
AB  - One of the most commonly used methods for assessing disinfectants in vitro is the dilution-neutralization test. Although it is known that using an effective neutralizer is essential for obtaining reliable results, in the case of disinfectants like triclosan, whose neutralization is more complicated, an adequate neutralizer is not always used. Here, we compare the efficacy of different neutralizers described previously, and others that have been modified, against several antiseptic formulations of triclosan. The strains of reference used were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The solutions of antiseptic were triclosan 2% aqueous solution, and three alcoholic solutions containing 2, 0.068 and 0.5% triclosan, respectively. In the dilution-neutralization test, six neutralizers with different degrees of complexity were assayed. Our results show that the antiseptic solutions studied are effective against the strains of reference, with the exception of triclosan 2% aqueous solution against Ps. aeruginosa. Most neutralizers proved ineffective, depending on the antiseptic solution and the bacterial species, particularly in the case of Staph. aureus. These findings confirm a need to test every neutralizer specifically for each disinfectant, at the maximum concentration used, and for every specific bacterial strain. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The choice of an adequate neutralizing agent is essential for obtaining precise results in the evaluation of disinfectants using the dilution-neutralization method. In this study, we show that the neutralization of triclosan and some of its commercial solutions is not a simple task, requiring complex neutralizers. Moreover, the action of the neutralizer is shown to depend on the micro-organism tested. Specificity in view of the disinfectant and the micro-organism calls for performing the neutralizing assay in each particular case of application of the dilution-neutralization method. We also demonstrate that some of the neutralizers described for triclosan in previous studies are not sufficiently effective.
TI  - Effects of probiotic supplementation in different energy and nutrient density diets on performance, egg quality, excreta microflora, excreta noxious gas emission, and serum cholesterol concentrations in laying hens.
AB  - This 6-wk study was conducted to determine the effects of probiotic (Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134) supplementation of different energy and nutrient density diets on performance, egg quality, excreta microflora, excreta noxious gas emission, and serum cholesterol concentrations in laying hens. A total of 432 Hy-Line brown layers (40 wk old) were allotted into 4 dietary treatments with 2 levels of probiotic supplementation (0 or 0.01%) and 2 levels of energy (2,700 or 2,800 kcal ME/kg) and nutrient density. Weekly feed intake, egg quality, and daily egg production were determined. Eighteen layers per treatment (2 layers/replication) were bled to determine serum cholesterol concentrations at wk 3 and 6. Excreta microbial shedding of Lactobacillus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella and noxious gas emission were determined at the end of the experiment. Hens fed the high-energy and high-nutrient-density diets had less (P < 0.01) ADFI than those fed the low-energy and low-nutrient-density diets throughout the experimental period. During wk 4 to 6 and overall, hens fed the diets supplemented with the probiotic had greater (P < 0.01) egg production, egg weight, and eggshell thickness than hens fed the diets without the probiotic. Dietary supplementation of the probiotic increased (P = 0.01) excreta Lactobacillus counts and decreased (P = 0.02) Escherichia coli counts compared with hens fed the diets without the probiotic. The excreta ammonia emission was decreased (P = 0.02) in hens fed the probiotic diets compared with hens fed the diets without the probiotic. Serum total cholesterol concentration was decreased (P < 0.01) by feeding hens with the probiotic at wk 3 and 6. Layers fed the probiotic-incorporated diets had greater (P < 0.01) high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and lower (P = 0.03) low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations than hens fed the nonsupplemented diets at wk 6. Interactive effects (P < 0.05) of energy and nutrient density and the probiotic on excreta Lactobacillus counts and serum HDL cholesterol concentration were observed at wk 6. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of 0.01% probiotic improved egg production and egg quality and decreased excreta ammonia emission. The use of a probiotic in the high-energy and high-nutrient-density diets may be more favorable than the low-energy and low-nutrient-density diets in laying hens.
TI  - Bacteremia in patients with acute pancreatitis as revealed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based techniques*.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To define the characteristic of bacteremia in patients with acute pancreatitis and determine its possible association with the disease severity. DESIGN: A prospective controlled study. SETTING: ICU of Jinling Hospital, China. PATIENTS: A total of 48 patients with mild or severe acute pancreatitis were enrolled in the study. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Samples of peripheral blood were collected from the patients at 4 or 5 and 9 or 10 days after acute pancreatitis was definitely diagnosed. Resulting DNA from the blood was analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and separated fragments were sequenced for identification of bacterial species. Bacterial DNA was detected in peripheral blood from 68.8% of patients with acute pancreatitis, and more than half (60.4%) of the patients encountered polymicrobial flora. Translocated bacteria in patients with acute pancreatitis were primarily constituted of opportunistic pathogens derived from the gut, including Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacteriaceae bacterium, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Bacillus coagulans, and Enterococcus faecium. The species of circulating bacteria shifted remarkably among the patients with different severity. The presence of the bacteremia correlated positively with the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II scores of patients with acute pancreatitis (r = 0.7918, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a detailed description on the prevalence of bacteremia and characteristic of bacterial species in patients with acute pancreatitis. We demonstrate an association between the bacteremia and the disease severity, which enables us to better understand a potential role of bacterial translocation in the pathogenesis of septic complication in acute pancreatitis.
TI  - Rapid bacterial whole-genome sequencing to enhance diagnostic and public health microbiology.
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The latest generation of benchtop DNA sequencing platforms can provide an accurate whole-genome sequence (WGS) for a broad range of bacteria in less than a day. These could be used to more effectively contain the spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens. OBJECTIVE: To compare WGS with standard clinical microbiology practice for the investigation of nosocomial outbreaks caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, the identification of genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance, and typing of other clinically important pathogens. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A laboratory-based study of hospital inpatients with a range of bacterial infections at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, a secondary and tertiary referral center in England, comparing WGS with standard diagnostic microbiology using stored bacterial isolates and clinical information. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Specimens were taken and processed as part of routine clinical care, and cultured isolates stored and referred for additional reference laboratory testing as necessary. Isolates underwent DNA extraction and library preparation prior to sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Bioinformatic analyses were performed by persons blinded to the clinical, epidemiologic, and antimicrobial susceptibility data. RESULTS: We investigated 2 putative nosocomial outbreaks, one caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and the other by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae; WGS accurately discriminated between outbreak and nonoutbreak isolates and was superior to conventional typing methods. We compared WGS with standard methods for the identification of the mechanism of carbapenem resistance in a range of gram-negative bacteria (Acinetobacter baumannii, E cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). This demonstrated concordance between phenotypic and genotypic results, and the ability to determine whether resistance was attributable to the presence of carbapenemases or other resistance mechanisms. Whole-genome sequencing was used to recapitulate reference laboratory typing of clinical isolates of Neisseria meningitidis and to provide extended phylogenetic analyses of these. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The speed, accuracy, and depth of information provided by WGS platforms to confirm or refute outbreaks in hospitals and the community, and to accurately define transmission of multidrug-resistant and other organisms, represents an important advance.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes in Escherichia coli and enterococci  from red foxes (Vulpes vulpes).
AB  - The aims of the study were to analyse the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance  and the mechanisms implicated, as well as the virulence factors, in faecal Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. from red foxes. From 52 faecal samples, 22 E. coli (42.3%) and 50 enterococci (96.2%) isolates were recovered (one/sample). A high percentage of E. coli isolates exhibited resistance to streptomycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or ampicillin (54-27%), and they harboured the aadA, tet(A) and/or tet(B), sul1 and blaTEM resistance genes, respectively. The E. coli isolates were ascribed to the 4 major phylogroups, D (41% of isolates), A (31.8%), B1 (18.2%) and B2 (9.1%), and carried the fimA (63.3%) or aer (13.6%) virulence genes. Among enterococcal isolates, Enterococcus faecium was the most prevalent species (50%). A high percentage of enterococcal isolates showed tetracycline resistance (88%) harbouring different combinations of tet(M) and tet(L) genes. The erm(B) or the aph(3')-IIIa gene were identified in most of our erythromycin- or kanamycin-resistant enterococci, respectively. This report suggests the role of red foxes from rural areas in the cycle of transmission and spread of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli and enterococci into the environment, representing a reservoir of these antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a UV-stable bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) produced by Enterococcus faecium strain DSH20 against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The narrow spectrum of action of most bacteriocins is an important limitation for their application as antimicrobial agents. The current study describes a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) that display extended spectrum antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains. METHODS: Acquired resistance profiles of Enterococcus isolates determined based on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition as multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and pandrug resistant (PDR). BLIS activity of Enterococcus isolates was investigated against Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) ATCC 29212 as the indicator strain and clinical isolates including VRE, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative bacteria containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). RESULTS: Among 273 Enterococcus isolates, 27 and 2 VRE isolates, respectively, were XDR and PDR and eight isolates had BLIS activity against the indicator strain. One of these isolates, identified as E. faecium strain DSH20 based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties, as well as its 16S rRNA gene sequence, had potent BLIS production against all 29 VRE strains, but had no activity against MRSA, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, and E. coli strains. It was heat stable up to 121 degrees C for 15 minutes (autoclave condition), active within the pH range of 3-9 and had UV stability, but its activity disappeared by treatment with proteinase K, pepsin, and trypsin, demonstrating its proteinaceous nature. It was designated as an approximately 35kDa peptide using the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method. CONCLUSION: This peptide is a potential agent for use as an alternative antibacterial agent for the treatment of drug-resistant strains of VRE infection.
TI  - Resistance mechanisms and epidemiology of multiresistant pathogens in Europe and  efficacy of tigecycline in observational studies.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial drug resistance is a growing problem in Europe and, even with differences in epidemiology, it is of great concern. The treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) is hindered further by pathogens that are resistant to methicillin, carbapenems, third-generation cephalosporins and glycopeptides. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An analysis of the microbiological results from five European observational studies (July 2006 to October 2011) evaluating the efficacy of tigecycline (prescribed as monotherapy or in combination with other antibacterials) for the treatment of cSSTI and cIAI is presented. RESULTS: In total, 213 cSSTI and 623 cIAI patients were included; 34.4% and 56.6%, respectively, were critically ill in intensive care units. At baseline, at least one pathogen was isolated in 167 (78.4%) cSSTI and 464 (74.5%) cIAI patients, and 32.9% and 49.1% of infections were polymicrobial. In cSSTI, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (52.7% and 18.0%, respectively) were the most frequently isolated pathogens, whereas in cIAI most infections were due to E. coli (41.8%), Enterococcus faecium (40.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis (21.1%). Clinical response was observed in >80% of patients with E. coli in both cIAI and cSSTI. In cSSTI patients, the clinical response rate to S. aureus was 80.8%. For cIAI, 77.4% of E. faecium and 79.5% of E. faecalis patients responded to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline when given alone or in combination with other antibacterials appeared to be efficacious against multiple pathogens, affirming its role in real-life clinical practice as a broad-spectrum antibacterial for the treatment of patients with cSSTI and cIAI, including the critically ill, across Europe.
TI  - Efficacy of tigecycline for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections in real-life clinical practice from five European observational studies.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic approved for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs). The efficacy of tigecycline when administered as monotherapy or in combination with other antibacterials in the treatment of cIAIs in routine clinical practice is described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual patient-level data were pooled from five European observational studies (July 2006 to October 2011). RESULTS: A total of 785 cIAI patients who received tigecycline were included (mean age 63.1 +/- 14.0 years). Of these, 56.6% were in intensive care units, 65.6% acquired their infection in hospital, 88.1% had at least one comorbidity and 65.7% had secondary peritonitis. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores at the beginning of treatment were 16.9 +/- 7.6 (n = 614) and 7.0 +/- 4.2 (n = 108), respectively, indicating high disease severity. Escherichia coli (41.8%), Enterococcus faecium (40.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis (21.1%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens; 49.1% of infections were polymicrobial and 17.5% were due to resistant pathogens. Overall, 54.8% (n = 430) received tigecycline as monotherapy and 45.2% (n = 355) as combination therapy for a mean duration of 10.6 days. Clinical response rates at the end of treatment were 77.4% for all patients (567/733), 80.6% for patients who received tigecycline as monotherapy (329/408), 75.2% for patients with a nosocomial infection (354/471), 75.8% for patients with an APACHE II score >15 (250/330) and 54.2% (32/59) for patients with a SOFA score >/= 7. CONCLUSIONS: In these real-life studies, tigecycline, alone and in combination, achieved favourable clinical response rates in patients with cIAI with a high severity of illness.
TI  - Efficacy of tigecycline for the treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections in real-life clinical practice from five European observational studies.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tigecycline is an approved treatment for complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs). The efficacy of tigecycline as monotherapy or in combination with other antibacterials in the treatment of cSSTI in routine practice is described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual patient-level data were pooled from five European observational studies (July 2006 to October 2011). RESULTS: A total of 254 cSSTI patients who received tigecycline were included (mean age 63.2 +/- 14.9 years). Of these, 34.4% were in intensive care units, 54.5% acquired their infection in hospital and 90.9% had at least one comorbidity. Infection most commonly affected the limbs (62.4%) and 43.8% of infections were classified as necrotizing. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores at the beginning of treatment were 15.0 +/- 7.9 (n = 205) and 5.8 +/- 3.9 (n = 32), respectively, indicating high disease severity. Staphylococcus aureus (52.7%), Escherichia coli (18.0%) and Enterococcus faecium (12.0%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens; 32.9% of infections were polymicrobial and 30.5% were due to resistant pathogens. Overall, 71.8% received tigecycline as monotherapy and 28.2% as combination therapy for a mean duration of 12 days. Clinical response rates at the end of treatment were 79.6% for all patients who received the standard dosage (183/230), 86.7% for patients who received tigecycline as monotherapy (143/165), 75.0% for patients with a nosocomial infection (96/128), 75.3% for patients with an APACHE II score >15 (61/81) and 58.3% for patients with a SOFA score >/= 7 (7/12). CONCLUSIONS: In these real-life studies, tigecycline, alone and in combination, achieved favourable clinical response rates in patients with cSSTI with a high severity of illness.
TI  - Effect of in-feed paromomycin supplementation on antimicrobial resistance of enteric bacteria in turkeys.
AB  - Histomoniasis in turkeys can be prevented by administering paromomycin sulfate, an aminoglycoside antimicrobial agent, in feed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of in-feed paromomycin sulfate supplementation on the antimicrobial resistance of intestinal bacteria in turkeys. Twelve flocks of breeder turkeys were administered 100 ppm paromomycin sulfate from hatching to day 120; 12 flocks not supplemented with paromomycin were used as controls. Faecal samples were collected monthly from days 0 to 180. The resistance of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus to paramomycin and other antimicrobial agents was compared in paromomycin supplemented (PS) and unsupplemented (PNS) flocks. E. coli from PS birds had a significantly higher frequency of resistance to paromomycin, neomycin and kanamycin until 1 month after the end of supplementation compared to PNS birds. Resistance to amoxicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also more frequent in PS turkeys. Resistance was mainly due to the presence of aph genes, which could be transmitted by conjugation, sometimes with streptomycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, trimethoprim or sulfonamide resistance genes. Resistance to kanamycin and streptomycin in E. faecium was significantly different in PS and PNS breeders on days 60 and 90. Significantly higher frequencies of resistance to paromomycin, kanamycin, neomycin and tobramycin were observed in S. aureus isolates from PS birds. Paromomycin supplementation resulted in resistance to aminoglycosides in bacteria of PS turkeys. Co-selection for resistance to other antimicrobial agents was observed in E. coli isolates.
TI  - Bacteremia in the Patients With Acute Pancreatitis as Revealed by 16S Ribosomal RNA Gene-Based Techniques.
AB  - OBJECTIVES:: To define the characteristic of bacteremia in the patients with acute pancreatitis and determine its possible association with the disease severity. DESIGN:: A prospective controlled study. SETTING:: ICU of Jinling Hospital, China. PATIENTS:: A total of 48 patients with mild or severe acute pancreatitis were enrolled in this study. INTERVENTIONS:: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: Samples of peripheral blood were collected from the patients at 4 or 5 and 9 or 10 days after acute pancreatitis was definitely diagnosed. Resulting DNA from the blood was analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and separated fragments were sequenced for identification of bacterial species. Bacterial DNA was detected in peripheral blood from 68.8% of patients with acute pancreatitis, and more than half (60.4%) of the patients encountered polymicrobial flora. Translocated bacteria in patients with acute pancreatitis were primarily constituted of opportunistic pathogens derived from the gut, including Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacteriaceae bacterium, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Bacillus coagulans, and Enterococcus faecium. And the species of circulating bacteria shifted remarkably among the patients with different severity. The presence of the bacteremia correlated positively with the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II scores of patients with acute pancreatitis (r = 0.7918, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS:: This study provides a detailed description on the prevalence of bacteremia and characteristic of bacterial species in patients with acute pancreatitis. We demonstrate an association between the bacteremia and the disease severity, which enables us to better understand a potential role of bacterial translocation in the pathogenesis of septic complication in acute pancreatitis.
TI  - Continuous increase of the antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative pathogens causing bacteremia: a nationwide surveillance study by the Korean Network for Study on Infectious Diseases (KONSID).
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility data for all microorganisms isolated from blood culture were collected from 13 institutions in Korea from June to September 2011. Data were compared with our previous studies performed during 2006-2007 and 2008. The prevalence of MRSA in 2011 has rebounded to 63.7% after a slight decrease in 2008. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium declined to 24.1%. The resistance rates of Acinetobacter baumannii to imipenem and meropenem increased from 25.4% and 28.8% to 55.4% and 37.5%, respectively. Ciprofloxacin resistance of Escherichia coli has increased from 23.9% to 30.8%. The resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae to ciprofloxacin has increased from 17.7% to 26.5%. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae have also seen increased levels of resistance, from 8.6% to 18.4% and 13.6% to 28.5%, respectively. An overall increase in antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative pathogens has been observed. Continued surveillance and intervention to slow the propagation of resistance are necessary.
TI  - Retrospective analysis of Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus in animal feed ingredients.
AB  - The presence and antimicrobial susceptibility of foodborne pathogens and indicator organisms in animal feed are not well understood. In this study, a total of 201 feed ingredient samples (animal byproducts, n=122; plant byproducts, n=79) were collected in 2002 and 2003 from representative rendering plants and the oilseed (or cereal grain) industry across the United States. The occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of four bacterial genera (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus) were determined. Salmonella isolates were further characterized by serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). None of the samples yielded Campylobacter or E. coli O157:H7, whereas Salmonella, generic E. coli, and Enterococcus were present in 22.9%, 39.3%, and 86.6% of samples, respectively. A large percentage (47.8%) of Salmonella-positive samples harbored two serovars, and the vast majority (88.4%) of Enterococcus isolates were E. faecium. Animal byproducts had a significantly higher Salmonella contamination rate (34.4%) than plant byproducts (5.1%) (p<0.05). Among 74 Salmonella isolates recovered, 27 serovars and 55 PFGE patterns were identified; all were pan-susceptible to 17 antimicrobials tested. E. coli isolates (n=131) demonstrated similar susceptibility to these antimicrobials except for tetracycline (15.3% resistance), sulfamethoxazole (7.6%), streptomycin (4.6%), ampicillin (3.8%), and nalidixic acid (1.5%). Enterococcus isolates (n=362) were also resistant to five of 17 antimicrobials tested, ranging from 1.1% to penicillin to 14.6% to tetracycline. Resistance rates were generally higher among isolates recovered from animal byproducts. Taken together, our findings suggest that diverse populations of Salmonella, E. coli, and Enterococcus are commonly present in animal feed ingredients, but antimicrobial resistance is not common. Future large-scale studies to monitor these pathogenic and indicator organisms in feed commodities is warranted.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from milkmen and cows with clinical mastitis in and around Kampala, Uganda.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identification of pathogens associated with bovine mastitis is helpful in treatment and management decisions. However, such data from sub-Saharan Africa is scarce. Here we describe the distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from cows with clinical mastitis in Kampala, Uganda. Due to high concern of zoonotic infections, isolates from milkmen are also described. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ninety seven milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis and 31 nasal swabs from milkmen were collected (one sample per cow/human). Fifty eight (60%) Gram-positive isolates namely Staphylococci (21), Enterococci (16), Streptococci (13), Lactococci (5), Micrococci (2) and Arcanobacteria (1) were detected in cows; only one grew Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, 24 (25%) coliforms namely Escherichia coli (12), Klebsiella oxytoca (5), Proteus vulgaris (2), Serratia (2), Citrobacter (1), Cedecea (1) and Leclercia (1) were identified. From humans, 24 Gram-positive bacteria grew, of which 11 were Staphylococci (35%) including four Staphylococcus aureus. Upon susceptibility testing, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were prevalent; 57%, 12/21 in cows and 64%, 7/11 in humans. However, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was not detected. Furthermore, methicillin and vancomycin resistant CoNS were detected in cows (Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis) and humans (Staphylococcus scuiri). Also, vancomycin and daptomycin resistant Enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively) were detected in cows. Coliforms were less resistant with three pan-susceptible isolates. However, multidrug resistant Klebsiella, Proteus, Serratia, Cedecea, and Citrobacter were detected. Lastly, similar species grew from human and bovine samples but on genotyping, the isolates were found to be different. Interestingly, human and bovine Staphylococcus aureus were genetically similar (spa-CC435, spa-type t645 corresponding to ST121) but with different susceptibility patterns. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: CoNS, Enterococci, Streptococci, and Escherichia coli are the predominant pathogens associated with clinical bovine-mastitis in Kampala, Uganda. Multidrug resistant bacteria are also prevalent. While similar species occurred in humans and cows, transmission was not detected.
TI  - Identification of human and animal fecal contamination after rainfall in the Han  River, Korea.
AB  - We investigated the effect of rainfall on the levels and sources of microbial contamination in the Han River, Korea. Thirty-four samples were collected at two sampling sites located upstream and downstream in the river from July 2010 to February 2011. Various fecal indicator microorganisms, including total coliform, fecal coliform, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., somatic and male-specific (F+) coliphage, and four major enteric viruses were analyzed. Rainfall was positively correlated with the levels of fecal coliform and norovirus at both sampling sites. Additionally, rainfall was positively correlated with the levels of total coliform, E. coli, Enterococcus spp., and F+ coliphage at the upstream site. To identify the source of fecal contamination, microbial source tracking (MST) was conducted using both male-specific (F+) RNA coliphage and the Enterococcus faecium esp gene as previously described. Our results clearly indicated that the majority of fecal contamination at the downstream Han River site was from a human source. At the upstream sampling site, contamination from human fecal matter was very limited; however, fecal contamination from non-point animal sources increased following rainfall. In conclusion, our data suggest that rainfall significantly affects the level and source of fecal contamination in the Han River, Korea.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in patients with or without cancer in a large community hospital.
AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer is associated with an increased risk of acquiring bloodstream infection (BSIs). Most knowledge on pathogens and outcome are derived from specialised cancer centres. We here sought to compare causative micro-organisms in BSIs in patients with or without cancer in a 600-bed teaching community hospital. METHODS: We analysed all positive blood cultures from adult patients between January 2005 and January 2011. RESULTS: A total of 4,918 episodes of BSI occurred in 2,891 patients, of whom 13.4% had a diagnosis of cancer (85.5% with a solid tumour). In both patient groups, Gram-positive isolates were more prevalent (58.7 and 61.4% in patients with and without cancer, respectively) than Gram-negative isolates (31.8 and 32.3%, respectively). Amongst Gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci were the most frequently isolated in both patient groups; in cancer patients, twice as many BSIs were caused by Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Amongst Gram-negative organisms, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate; in cancer patients, twice as many BSIs were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae. Yeasts were grown from 3.0% of blood cultures from cancer patients compared to 1.5% of cultures from non-cancer patients. Cancer patients had a 90-day mortality of 35.8% following BSI compared to 23.5% in patients without cancer. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate distinct BSI pathogens and impaired outcomes in patients with cancer in the setting of a large community teaching hospital.
TI  - Identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  - Traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. Depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target DNA/RNA. In the current study, the applicability of FISH was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. To remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to FISH, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. FISH was performed using oligonucleotides specific for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Trueperella (Arcanobacterium) pyogenes. The enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of FISH were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. Bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) CFU/ml or higher. However, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) CFU/ml were not detectable in all cases. The ability of FISH to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.
TI  - Isolation, characterization, and effect of administration in vivo, a novel probiotic strain from pig feces.
AB  - From porcine rectal swabs or feces, we isolated lactic acid bacteria and used porcine Peyer's patch cells to select them for inducibility of IgA production as an indicator of probiotic effects. The strain selected as a new probiotic was named 'Enterococcus faecium NHRD IHARA'. To verify the probiotic effects of this strain in vivo, 536 piglets at age 25 days were assigned to either the trial group, which administrated the strain, or the control group. An increase in IgA in the feces was observed at age 45 days (P < 0.05 compared with the control group); a significant increase in serum IgA was also observed at the end of the study (P < 0.01) in the trial group. In addition, significant differences between the groups in terms of body weight (P < 0.05) and average daily gain (P < 0.01) were observed. The rate of detection of swine-pathogenic Escherichia coli gene in the feces tended to be lower in the trial group than in the controls. The novel probiotic strain; E. faecium NHRD IHARA may have beneficial effects on swine growth by inducing IgA production and reducing rates of colonization by pathogens in the body.
TI  - Spectrum of pathogens in acute cholangitis in patients with and without biliary endoprosthesis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of bacterial spectrum for acute cholangitis is essential for adequate empiric antibiotic treatment. Main focus of the study was to analyse the spectrum of pathogens in acute cholangitis with and without biliary endoprosthesis. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 1024 patients with acute cholangitis treated at a German tertiary center. RESULTS: 447 cholangitis episodes with positive bile and/or blood cultures obtained from 388 patients were studied. In total, 1088 pathogen were isolated. The predominant strains were Enterococcus species (25%), followed by Escherichia coli (18%) and Klebsiella species (14%). Bacteraemia was mainly caused by E. coli (91/282; 32%) and Enterococcus species (550/282; 18%). The incidences of Enterococcus species [121(74%) vs. 89(60%); p = 0.011] and non-fermenters [41(25%) vs. 16(11%); p = 0.001] were significantly higher in cholangitis episodes with biliary endoprosthesis compared to cholangitis episodes without biliary endoprosthesis. In particular, more Pseudomonas aeruginosa [27(16%) vs. 12(8%); p = 0.027] and Enterococcus faecium [59(36%) vs. 34(23%); p = 0.013] were isolated from patients with a biliary endoprosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike cholangitis without stent, the presence of biliary endoprosthesis in patients with cholangitis can serve as a surrogate indicator of nosocomial pathogens and therefore should be considered, when selecting empiric antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria collected from countries in Eastern Europe: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) 2004-2010.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) commenced in 2004 to longitudinally monitor global changes in bacterial susceptibility to a suite of antimicrobial agents. The current study examined the activity of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected across Eastern Europe between 2004 and 2010. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution methodologies. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using CLSI interpretive criteria, and tigecycline susceptibility was established using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. This study included 10 295 Gram-negative and 4611 Gram-positive isolates from 42 centres. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were reported among 15.3% of Escherichia coli and 39.3% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; the highest rates were observed in Turkey (30.9%) and Bulgaria (53.8%), respectively. Imipenem-non-susceptible K. pneumoniae were identified only in Turkey. ESBL-positive E. coli were highly susceptible to imipenem (95.1%), meropenem (98.0%) and tigecycline (98.5%). Most antimicrobials showed poor activity against Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Vancomycin resistance was noted among 0.9% of Enterococcus faecalis and 11.7% of Enterococcus faecium isolates. High rates of susceptibility were reported for linezolid (99.7%) and tigecycline (100%) against E. faecium. One-quarter of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), with the highest rate in Romania (51.5%); all MRSA were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. Antimicrobial resistance is high in much of Eastern Europe, with considerable variation seen among countries. Tigecycline and the carbapenems retain excellent activity against many pathogens from Eastern Europe; linezolid and vancomycin are active against most Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Detection of antibiotic resistant enterococci and Escherichia coli in free range  Iberian Lynx (Lynx pardinus).
AB  - Thirty fecal samples from wild specimens of Iberian lynx were collected and analyzed for Enterococcus spp. (27 isolates) and Escherichia coli (18 isolates) recovery. The 45 isolates obtained were tested for antimicrobial resistance, molecular mechanisms of resistance, and presence of virulence genes. Among the enterococci, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus hirae were the most prevalent species (11 isolates each), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (5 isolates). High percentages of resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin (33% and 30%, respectively) were detected among enterococcal isolates. The tet(M) and/or tet(L), erm(B), aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia, ant(6)-Ia, or aph(3')-IIIa genes were detected among resistant enterococci. Virulence genes were detected in one E. faecalis isolate (cpd, cylB, and cylL) and one E. hirae isolate (cylL). High percentages of resistance were detected in E. coli isolates to tetracycline (33%), streptomycin (28%), nalidixic acid (28%), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT, 22%). Additionally, the blaTEM, tet(A), aadA, cmlA, and different combinations of sul genes were detected among most ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol and SXT-resistant isolates, respectively. Two isolates contained a class 1 integron with the gene cassette arrays dfrA1 + aadA1 and dfrA12 + aadA2. The E. coli isolates were ascribed to phylo-groups A (n=5); B1 (n=4); B2 (n=6), and D (n=3), with the virulence gene fimA present in all E. coli isolates. This study found resistance genes in wild specimens of Iberian lynx. Thus, it is important to notice that multiresistant bacteria have reached species as rare and completely non-synanthropic as the Iberian lynx. Furthermore, the susceptibility of this endangered species to bacterial infection may be affected by the presence of these virulence and resistance genes.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of Enterococcus species from meat and fermented meat products isolated by a PCR-based rapid screening method.
AB  - Enterococci are predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, but species commonly resident on vegetation are known. Their presence in large numbers in foods may indicate a lapse in sanitation and their ability to serve as a genetic reservoir of transferable antibiotic resistance is of concern. Conventional culture methods for identification of enterococci are slow and sometimes give false results because of the biochemical diversity of the organisms in this genus. This work reports the development of a PCR-based assay to detect enterococci at the genus level by targeting a 16S rRNA sequence. Published 16S rRNA sequences were aligned and used to design genus specific primers (EntF and EntR). The primers were able to amplify a 678 bp target region from Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 7080 and 20 other strains of enterococci from 11 different species, but there was no amplification by 32 species from closely related genera (Pediococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Listeria) or species of Escherichia coli and Salmonella. The PCR positive samples were plated, screened by a colony patch technique and their identities were confirmed by API 20 Strep panels and sequencing. When dry fermented sausage and ham as well as fresh meat batter for dry cured sausage manufacture were tested for enterococci by the method, 29 Enterococcus strains (15 E. faecalis, 13 E. faecium, and one E. gallinarum) were identified. When susceptibility of these enterococci to 12 antibiotics was tested, the highest incidence of resistance was to clindamycin (89.6%), followed by tetracycline hydrochloride (65.5%), tylosin (62%), erythromycin (45%), streptomycin and neomycin (17%), chloramphenicol (10.3%), penicillin (10.3%), ciprofloxacin (10.3%) and gentamicin (3.4%). None was resistant to the clinically important drugs vancomycin or ampicillin. Most strains (27/29) were resistant to more than one antibiotic while 17 of 29 strains were resistant to three to 8 antibiotics. The molecular method developed was validated for speciation of enterococci and was useful in assessing uncooked processed meat products as a reservoir for multi-drug resistant Enterococcus species.
TI  - The effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. A completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. The highest count of faecal Enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log CFU g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. The highest count of Lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the Enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log CFU g(-1)). Moreover, the MALDI TOF MS Biotyper identified the following genera: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, as well as Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. fermentum and L. salivarius from the Lactobacilli group and Enterococcus avium, E. casseliflavus, E. cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus from the Enterococci group. Additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of chickens were tested. The best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against K. oxytoca.
TI  - Cloning, expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of the N-terminal domain of serine glutamate repeat A (SgrA) protein from Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Serine glutamate repeat A (SgrA) protein is an LPxTG surface adhesin of Enterococcus faecium and is the first bacterial nidogen-binding protein identified to date. It has been suggested that it binds to human nidogen, the extracellular matrix molecule of basal lamina, and plays a key role in the invasion and colonization of eukaryotic host cells. SgrA(28-288), having both a putative ligand-binding A domain and repetitive B domain, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using Ni-affinity and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Further, the putative ligand-binding region, rSgrA(28-153), was subcloned, overexpressed and purified in both native and selenomethionine-derivative forms. The native rSgrA(28-153) protein crystallized in the monoclinic space group P2(1) and diffracted to 3.3 A resolution using an in-house X-ray source, with unit-cell parameters a = 35.84, b = 56.35, c = 60.20 A, beta = 106.5 degrees .
TI  - Safety assessment and probiotic evaluation of Enterococcus faecium YF5 isolated from sourdough.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium YF5, a strain previously isolated from sourdough, was assessed for safety and probiotic potential. Its virulence and antibiotic resistant phenotypes (cytolysin and gelatinase production, antibiotic susceptibility) and genes (cylA, gelE, ace, agg, esp, and vanA) were surveyed. Results indicated that the tested virulence determinants were nontoxic. In addition, E. faecium YF5 was sensitive to 3 antibiotics such as amoxicillin, vancomycin, and chloramphenicol. Furthermore, results of in vivo animal acute oral toxicity of E. faecium YF5 studies were similar to the control group that indicated no abnormalities. In addition, E. faecium YF5 stably survived in low pH, bile salts, gastric, and intestinal fluids in vitro. Moreover, E. faecium YF5 was found to adhere to human colon cancer cell line HT-29 at 3.39 (+/-0.67) x 10(5) CFU/mL. When cocultured with pathogenic organisms (Enterobacter sakazakii CMCC45402, Escherichia coli CMCC44102, enterohemorrhage Escherichia coli O157: H7 CMCC44828, Salmonella Typhimurium CMCC50071, Shigella flexneri 301, and Shigella sonnei ATCC 29930) and 2 gram-positive strains (Listeria monocytogenes CMCC54001 and Staphylococcus aureus CMCC 26003), it inhibited these foodborne pathogens with exception of S. aureus. Therefore, E. faecium YF5 can be regarded as a safe strain and it may be used as a probiotic preparation or for microecologics.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - Bactericidal Activity of Methanol Extracts of Crabapple Mangrove Tree (Sonneratia caseolaris Linn.) Against Multi-Drug Resistant Pathogens.
AB  - The crabapple mangrove tree, Sonneratia caseolaris Linn. (Family: Sonneratiaceae), is one of the foreshore plants found in estuarine and tidal creek areas and mangrove forests. Bark and fruit extracts from this plant have previously been shown to have an anti-oxidative or cytotoxic effect, whereas flower extracts of this plant exhibited an antimicrobial activity against some bacteria. According to the traditional folklore, it is medicinally used as an astringent and antiseptic. Hence, this investigation was carried out on the extract of the leaves, pneumatophore and different parts of the flower or fruit (stamen, calyx, meat of fruit, persistent calyx of fruit and seeds) for antibacterial activity using the broth microdilution method. The antibacterial activity was evaluated against five antibiotic-sensitive species (three Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria) and six drug-resistant species (Gram-positive i.e. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Gram-negative i.e. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-Escherichia coli, multidrug-resistant-Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acenetobacter baumannii). The methanol extracts from all tested parts of the crabapple mangrove tree exhibited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but was mainly a bactericidal against the Gram-negative bacteria, including the multidrug-resistant strains, when compared with only bacteriostatic on the Gram-positive bacteria. Using Soxhlet apparatus, the extracts obtained by sequential extraction with hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate revealed no discernable antibacterial activity and only slightly, if at all, reduced the antibacterial activity of the subsequently obtained methanol extract. Therefore, the active antibacterial compounds of the crabapple mangrove tree should have a rather polar structure.
TI  - Echinoderms from Azores islands: an unexpected source of antibiotic resistant Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli isolates.
AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic resistance and the implicated mechanisms of resistance were evaluated in Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli, isolated from a total of 250 faecal samples of echinoderms collected from Azorean waters (Portugal). A total of 144 enterococci (120 Enterococcus faecium, 14 E. hirae, 8 E. faecalis, 2 E. gallinarum) and 10 E. coli were recovered. High percentages of resistance in enterococci were found for erythromycin, ampicillin, tetracyclin and ciprofloxacin. The erm(A) or erm(B), tet(M) and/or tet(L), vat(D), aac(6')-aph(2'') and aph(3')-IIIa genes were found in isolates resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin, high-level gentamicin and high-level kanamycin, respectively. Resistance in E. coli isolates was detected for streptomycin, amikacin, tetracycline and tobramycin. The aadA gene was found in streptomycin-resistant isolates and tet(A)+tet(B) genes in tetracycline-resistant isolates. The data recovered are essential to improve knowledge about the dissemination of resistant strains through marine ecosystems and the possible implications involved in transferring these resistances either to other animals or to humans.
TI  - Microbiological survey of imported produce available at retail across Canada.
AB  - Increasing consumption and year-round consumer demand for fresh, minimally processed green vegetables have been observed in Canada and other developed countries. However, in the past two decades, produce has been increasingly implicated in outbreaks and correspondingly recognized as a vector for the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms. To this end, we examined the microbiological quality of imported produce available at retail across Canada during a period of limited domestic availability. In total, 106 samples obtained from five Canadian cities were purchased from retail outlets and subjected to microbiological analyses, including aerobic plate (APC) and coliform counts, and enrichments for enterococci, indicator Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. Also, recovered Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were screened for antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Overall, samples included herbs (n=61), leafy greens (n=25), and spinach (n=20) deriving from five countries (Columbia, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States [US]). APCs were consistent across commodities regardless of country, ranging from mean log10 CFU/g of 6.1 to 7.4, with no significant differences observed. Excluding a single leafy green sample from Guatemala, the lowest prevalence of coliforms was for Mexican herbs (22.2%), with a high of 66.7% on US leafy greens. With the exception of spinach, concentrations of coliforms varied widely, ranging from undetectable to too numerous to count (>8.5 log10 CFU/g). Of the commodities assessed, Mexican and US spinach had the lowest coliform concentrations (undetectable to 4.0 log10 CFU/g). Organic herbs and conventional leafy greens possessed significantly lower (p<0.05) prevalence of coliforms compared to conventional herbs and organic leafy greens, respectively. The most frequent recovery of indicator E. coli was observed for herbs, with 11.1, 8.3, and 3.7% prevalence observed in samples from Columbia, US, and Mexico, respectively. For spinach, 0 and 6.7% of Mexican and US samples tested positive, while no leafy green samples from either country were positive. No E. coli O157:H7 or Salmonella spp. were detected. E. faecium and E. faecalis were recovered from 15.1 and 5.7% of samples, respectively. Although no glycopeptide resistance was observed, resistance to other clinically relevant antibiotics was noteworthy in both species. Overall, though microbiological quality indicators were frequently high, E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella were not detected. However, the presence of resistance and reduced susceptibility to clinically relevant antimicrobials in recovered enterococci demonstrate imported fresh produce may serve as a vehicle for the transmission of antimicrobial resistance across national borders.
TI  - Effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  - The composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. Changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term consequences for host health. The large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. To facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Clostridium butyricum, C. perfringens, C. bifermentans, C. innocuum, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. Ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats operated at different dilution rates (D; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (D = 0.21 h(-1)). Perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a 48-h period. Lactobacillus acidophilus and C. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. Ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and C. perfringens populations at both dilution rates. Metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. The bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. Several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. The growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.
TI  - Effect of Ottoman Viper (Montivipera xanthina (Gray, 1849)) Venom on Various Cancer Cells and on Microorganisms.
AB  - Cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects of Montivipera xanthina venom against LNCaP,  MCF-7, HT-29, Saos-2, Hep3B, Vero cells and antimicrobial activity against selected bacterial and fungal species: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli O157H7, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Enterococcus faecium DSM 13590, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, S. typhimirium CCM 5445, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 6957 and Candida albicans ATCC 10239 were studied for evaluating the potential medical benefit of this snake venom. Cytotoxicity of venom was determined using MTT assay. Snake venom cytotoxicity was expressed as the venom dose that killed 50 % of the cells (IC50). The antimicrobial activity of venom was studied by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disc diffusion assay. MIC was determined using broth dilution method. The estimated IC50 values of venom varied from 3.8 to 12.7 or from 1.9 to 7.2 mug/ml after treatment with crude venom for 24 or 48 h for LNCaP, MCF-7, HT-29 and Saos-2 cells. There was no observable cytotoxic effect on Hep3B and Vero cells. Venom exhibited the most potent activity against C. albicans (MIC, 7.8 mug/ml and minimal fungicidal concentration, 62.5 mug/ml) and S. aureus (MIC, 31.25 mug/ml). This study is the first report showing the potential of M. xanthina venom as an alternative therapeutic approach due to its cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) polyphenols.
AB  - We investigated the antimicrobial properties of polyphenol-rich fractions derived from raw shelled and roasted salted pistachios. American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), food and clinical isolates, of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas mirabilis), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus), the yeasts Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis and the fungus Aspergillus niger were used. Pistachio extracts were active against Gram-positive bacteria with a bactericidal effect observed against L. monocytogenes (ATCC strains and food isolates), S. aureus and MRSA clinical isolates. Extracts from raw shelled pistachios were more active than those from roasted salted pistachios. The bactericidal activity of pistachio extracts could be used to help control the growth of some microorganisms in foods to improve safety and may find application as a topical treatment for S. aureus.
TI  - Candidaemia detected on direct blood smears.
AB  
TI  - [Selective detection of viable pathogenic bacteria in water using reverse transcription quantitative PCR].
AB  - A reverse transcription q quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay method was established, which can quantify the copy numbers of RNA in pathogenic bacteria of E. coli and Enterococcus faecium. The results showed that cDNA was generated with the RT-PCR reagents, target gene was quantified with the qPCR, the copy numbers of RNA were stable at about 1 copies x CFU(-1) for E. coli and 7.98 x 10(2) copies x CFU(-1) for Enterococcus faecium respectively during the stationary grow phase for the both indicator bacteria [E. coli (6-18 h) and Enterococcus faecium (10-38 h)]. The established RT-qPCR method can quantify the numbers of viable bacteria through detecting bacterial RNA targets. Through detecting the heat-treated E. coli and Enterococcus faecium by three methods (culture method, qPCR, RT-qPCR), we found that the qPCR and RT-qPCR can distinguish 1.43 lg copy non-viable E. coli and 2.5 lg copy non-viable Enterococcus faecium. These results indicated that the established methods could effectively distinguish viable bacteria from non-viable bacteria. Finally we used this method to evaluate the real effluents of the secondary sedimentation of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), the results showed that the correlation coefficients (R2) between RT-qPCR and culture method were 0.930 (E. coli) and 0.948 (Enterococcus faecium), and this established RT-PCR method can rapidly detect viable pathogenic bacteria in genuine waters.
TI  - Using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
AB  - New advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. Rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. These data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. In addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. Tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. This review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify Staphylococcus species, Enterococcus faecalis,Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Clostridium difficile, and Candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
TI  - Distribution of pathogens in central line-associated bloodstream infections among patients with and without neutropenia following chemotherapy: evidence for a proposed modification to the current surveillance definition.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many bloodstream infections (BSIs) occurring in patients with febrile  neutropenia following cytotoxic chemotherapy are due to translocation of intestinal microbiota. However, these infections meet the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definition of central line-associated BSIs (CLABSIs). We sought to determine the differences in the microbiology of NHSN-defined CLABSIs in patients with and without neutropenia and, using these data, to propose a modification of the CLABSI definition. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Two large university hospitals over 18 months. METHODS: All hospital-acquired BSIs occurring in patients with central venous catheters in place were classified using the NHSN CLABSI definition. Patients with postchemotherapy neutropenia (500 neutrophils/mm(3) or lower) at the time of blood culture were considered neutropenic. Pathogens overrepresented in the neutropenic group were identified to inform development of a modified CLABSI definition. RESULTS: Organisms that were more commonly observed in the neutropenic group compared with the nonneutropenic group included Escherichia coli (22.7% vs 2.5%; P < .001) but not other Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus faecium (18.2% vs 6.1%; P = .002), and streptococci (18.2% vs 0%; P < .001). Application of a modified CLABSI definition (removing BSI with enterococci, streptococci, or E. coli) excluded 33 of 66 neutropenic CLABSIs and decreased the CLABSI rate in one study hospital with large transplant and oncology populations from 2.12 to 1.79 cases per 1,000 line-days. CONCLUSIONS: Common gastrointestinal organisms were more common in the neutropenia group, suggesting that many BSIs meeting the NHSN criteria for CLABSI in the setting of neutropenia may represent translocation of gut organisms. These findings support modification of the NHSN CLABSI definition.
TI  - Influence of different probiotic lactic Acid bacteria on microbiota and metabolism of rats with dysbiosis.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are often used for prevention and treatment of dysbiosis. However, the action of various strains of LAB on metabolism and digestion under these conditions are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of probiotic LAB on metabolism, digestion and microbiota in animals with dysbiosis. After administration of ampicillin and metronidazole male Wistar rats, were fed products containing Enterococcus faecium L3 (E.f.), Lactobacillus fermentum Z (L.f.) or milk (control 1). Animals in control group 2 were fed milk, after water instead of antibiotics. Dyspeptic symptoms disappeared after administration of probiotic compared with control 1. At the end of the experiment, an increase in the content of enterococci and lactobacilli in the proximal part of the small intestine was found in the animals treated with E.f. and L.f., respectively. After the introduction of probiotic enterococci, the quantity of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the intestines of rats increased, and the content of Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli decreased in comparison with the control group 1 and the group fed lactobacilli. The activity of alkaline phosphatase and aspartate transaminase was greater in blood serum of rats with dysbiosis receiving milk and lactobacilli. Intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity increased in the epithelium and chyme in the jejunum of the animals treated with L. f. and in the chyme only in the animals treated with E. f. Thus, the specific effects of different strains of probiotic LAB on the microbiota, and on metabolism and digestion of various nutrients were demonstrated.
TI  - Production of bacteriocin E50-52 by small ubiquitin-related modifier fusion in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Bacteriocin E50-52, a class IIa bacteriocin with a wide antibacterial spectrum, and has a huge potential to be a substitute for convention. antibiotics. In this research, the bacteriocin E50-52 gene was cloned into the expression vector pET SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) and introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant fusion protein SUMO-bacteriocin E50-52 expressed in a soluble form was purified to a purity of more than 90% by Ni-NTA sepharose column and 117 mg fusion protein was obtained per liter of fermentation culture. The fusion protein was cleaved with SUMO protease and re-applied to a Ni-NTA Sepharose column. Finally, about 16 mg recombinant bacteriocin E50-52 (rbE50-52) was obtained from a 1-liter fermentation culture with no less than 95% purity. The rbE50-52 had similar antimicrobial properties and molecular weight as the native bacteriocin E50-52 and showed very low hemolytic activity.
TI  - Additional risk factors for infection by multidrug-resistant pathogens in healthcare-associated infection: a large cohort study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of consensus regarding the definition of risk factors for healthcare-associated infection (HCAI). The purpose of this study was to identify additional risk factors for HCAI, which are not included in the current definition of HCAI, associated with infection by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, in all hospitalized infected patients from the community. METHODS: This 1-year prospective cohort study included all patients with infection admitted to a large, tertiary care, university hospital. Risk factors not included in the HCAI definition, and independently associated with MDR pathogen infection, namely MDR Gram-negative (MDR-GN) and ESKAPE microorganisms (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species, carbapenem-hydrolyzing Klebsiella pneumonia and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species), were identified by logistic regression among patients admitted from the community (either with community-acquired or HCAI). RESULTS: There were 1035 patients with infection, 718 from the community. Of these, 439 (61%) had microbiologic documentation; 123 were MDR (28%). Among MDR: 104 (85%) had MDR-GN and 41 (33%) had an ESKAPE infection. Independent risk factors associated with MDR and MDR-GN infection were: age (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.7 and 1.5, p = 0.001 and p = 0.009, respectively), and hospitalization in the previous year (between 4 and 12 months previously) (adjusted OR = 2.0 and 1,7, p = 0.008 and p = 0.048, respectively). Infection by pathogens from the ESKAPE group was independently associated with previous antibiotic therapy (adjusted OR = 7.2, p < 0.001) and a Karnofsky index <70 (adjusted OR = 3.7, p = 0.003). Patients with infection by MDR, MDR-GN and pathogens from the ESKAPE group had significantly higher rates of inadequate antibiotic therapy than those without (46% vs 7%, 44% vs 10%, 61% vs 15%, respectively, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the inclusion of additional risk factors in the current definition of HCAI for MDR pathogen infection, namely age >60 years, Karnofsky index <70, hospitalization in the previous year, and previous antibiotic therapy, may be clinically beneficial for early diagnosis, which may decrease the rate of inadequate antibiotic therapy among these patients.
TI  - Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. associated with chronic and self-medicated urinary tract infections in Vietnam.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common infections  among women worldwide. E. coli often causes more than 75% of acute uncomplicated UTI, however, little is known about how recurrent UTIs and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials affect the aetiology of UTIs. This study aimed to establish the aetiology of UTI in a population of recurrent and self-medicated patients referred from pharmacies to a hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam and to describe genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of the associated bacterial pathogens. The aetiology of bacterial pathogens associated with UTI (defined as >/= 104 CFU/ml urine) was established by phenotypic and molecular methods. Enterococcus faecalis isolates were typed by Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. METHODS: Urine samples from 276 patients suffering symptoms of urinary tract infection were collected and cultured on Flexicult agar(R) allowing for detection of the most common urine pathogens. Patients were interviewed about underlying diseases, duration of symptoms, earlier episodes of UTI, number of episodes diagnosed by doctors and treatment in relation to UTI. All tentative E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates were identified to species level by PCR, 16S rRNA and partial sequencing of the groEL gene. E. faecalis isolates were further characterized by Multi Locus Sequence Typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Mean age of 49 patients was 48 yrs (range was 11-86 yrs) and included 94% women. On average, patients reported to have suffered from UTI for 348 days (range 3 days-10 years, and experienced 2.7 UTIs during the previous year). Cephalosporins were reported the second drug of choice in treatment of UTI at the hospital. E. faecalis (55.1%), E. coli (12.2%) and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (8.2%) were main bacterial pathogens. MIC testing of E. faecalis showed susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin, but high-level resistance against gentamicin (48.1%). MLST revealed 12 Sequence Types (ST) of which ST 16 made up 44.5% and showed closely related PFGE types. CONCLUSION: The different aetiology of UTI compared with reports elsewhere, where E. coli dominates, may be a result of chronic and recurrent UTIs together with indiscriminate use of antimicrobials. The similar genotypes shown by epidemiologically unrelated ST 16 isolates in Vietnam and elsewhere, suggest that E. faecalis ST 16 might represent a globally distributed clone. Treatment of UTI with cephalosporins may select for E. faecalis as it is intrinsic resistant and further studies are needed to establish the source(s) and role of E. faecalis ST 16 in acute UTI.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  - Postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (LVFX) has been conducted continuously since 1992. The present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in Japan to 30 selected antibacterial agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (FQs). The common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to FQs. In contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among S pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Regarding H. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). Enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to FQs, however, prevalence of LVFX-resistant Escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. Nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of LVFX-resistant E. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence of LVFX 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. Another Enterobacteriaceae member, Klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to FQs, in contrast with E. coli. In methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the percentage of FQ-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other FQs. However, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were highly susceptible to FQs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. The prevalence of FQs-resistant isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of FQ-resistance in MRSA. The prevalence of FQs-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (UTIs) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in P. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (RTIs). While this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were noted in the prevalence of FQ-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates derived from UTIs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from UTIs and 0.3% among isolates from RTIs, a decrease from the results of 2007. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance of 81.3-82.5%, to FQs. Ceftriaxone (CTRX) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to CTRX in some clinical isolates. The result of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, P. aeruginosa from UTIs, N. gonorrhoeae, and E. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the FQs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. While FQ resistance has been prevailing in E. coli, E. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to FQs. The other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against FQs.
TI  - Ultraviolet disinfection of antibiotic resistant bacteria and their antibiotic resistance genes in water and wastewater.
AB  - Disinfection of wastewater treatment plant effluent may be an important barrier for limiting the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARBs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). While ideally disinfection should destroy ARGs, to prevent horizontal gene transfer to downstream bacteria, little is known about the effect of conventional water disinfection technologies on ARGs. This study examined the potential of UV disinfection to damage four ARGs, mec(A), van(A), tet(A), and amp(C), both in extracellular form and present within a host ARBs: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), Escherichia coli SMS-3-5, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 01, respectively. An extended amplicon-length quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was developed to enhance capture of ARG damage events and also to normalize to an equivalent length of target DNA ( approximately 1000 bp) for comparison. It was found that the two Gram-positive ARBs (MRSA and VRE) were more resistant to UV disinfection than the two Gram-negative ARBs (E. coli and P. aeruginosa). The two Gram-positive organisms also possessed smaller total genome sizes, which could also have reduced their susceptibility to UV because of fewer potential pyrimidine dimer targets. An effect of cell type on damage to ARGs was only observed in VRE and P. aeruginosa, the latter potentially because of extracellular polymeric substances. In general, damage of ARGs required much greater UV doses (200-400 mJ/cm(2) for 3- to 4-log reduction) than ARB inactivation (10-20 mJ/cm(2) for 4- to 5-log reduction). The proportion of amplifiable ARGs following UV treatment exhibited a strong negative correlation with the number of adjacent thymines (Pearson r < -0.9; p < 0.0001). ARBs surviving UV treatment were negatively correlated with total genome size (Pearson r < -0.9; p < 0.0001) and adjacent cytosines (Pearson r < -0.88; p < 0.0001) but positively correlated with adjacent thymines (Pearson r > 0.85; p < 0.0001). This suggests that formation of thymine dimers is not the sole mechanism of ARB inactivation. Overall, the results indicate that UV is limited in its potential to damage ARGs and other disinfection technologies should be explored.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of cardiolipin synthase mutations associated with daptomycin resistance in enterococci.
AB  - Daptomycin (DAP) resistance in enterococci has been linked to mutations in genes  that alter the cell envelope stress response (CESR) (liaFSR) and changes in enzymes that directly affect phospholipid homeostasis, and these changes may alter membrane composition, such as that of cardiolipin synthase (Cls). While Cls substitutions are observed in response to DAP therapy, the effect of these mutations on Cls activity remains obscure. We have expressed, purified, and characterized Cls enzymes from both Enterococcus faecium S447 (residues 52 to 482; Cls447a) and Enterococcus faecalis S613 (residues 53 to 483; Cls613a) as well as Cls variants harboring a single-amino-acid change derived from DAP-resistant isolates of E. faecium. E. faecium Cls447a and E. faecalis Cls613a are tightly associated with the membrane and copurify with their substrate, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and product, cardiolipin (CL). The amount of PG that copurifies with Cls is in molar excess to protein, suggesting that the enzyme localizes to PG-rich membrane regions. Both Cls447a(H215R) and Cls447a(R218Q) showed an increase in V(max) (muM CL/min/muM protein) from 0.16 +/- 0.01 to 0.26 +/- 0.02 and 0.26 +/- 0.04, respectively, indicating that mutations associated with adaptation to DAP increase Cls activity. Modeling of Cls447a to Streptomyces sp. phospholipase D indicates that the adaptive mutations Cls447a(H215R) and Cls447a(R218Q) are proximal to the phospholipase domain 1 (PLD1) active site and near the putative nucleophile H217. As mutations to Cls are part of a larger genomic adaptation process, increased Cls activity is likely to be highly epistatic with other changes to facilitate DAP resistance.
TI  - Estimating the burden of healthcare-associated infections caused by selected multidrug-resistant bacteria Finland, 2010.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) and antibiotic resistance is important for resource allocation in infection control. Although national surveillance networks do not routinely cover all HAIs due to multidrug-resistant bacteria, estimates are nevertheless possible: in the EU, 25,000 patients die from such infections annually. We assessed the burden of HAIs due to multidrug-resistant bacteria in Finland in 2010. METHODS: By combining data from the National Infectious Disease Registry on the numbers of bacteremias caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., and susceptibility data from the National Antimicrobial Resistance Network and the Finnish Hospital Infection Program, we assessed the numbers of healthcare-associated bacteremias due to selected multidrug-resistant bacteria. We estimated the number of pneumonias, surgical site and urinary tract infections by applying the ratio of these infections in the first national prevalence survey for HAI in 2005. Attributable HAI mortality (3.2%) was also derived from the prevalence survey. RESULTS: The estimated annual number of the most common HAIs due to the selected multidrug-resistant bacteria was 2804 (530 HAIs per million), 6% of all HAIs in Finnish acute care hospitals. The number of attributable deaths was 89 (18 per million). CONCLUSIONS: Resources for infection control should be allocated not only in screening and isolation of carriers of multidrug-resistant bacteria, even when they are causing a small proportion of all HAIs, but also in preventing all clinical infections.
TI  - Influence of the N- and C-terminal regions of antimicrobial peptide pleurocidin on antibacterial activity.
AB  - Pleurocidin, a 25-mer antimicrobial peptide, has been known to exhibit potent antibacterial activity. To investigate the functional roles in N- and C-terminal regions of pleurocidin on the antibacterial activity, we designed four truncated analogs. The antibacterial susceptibility testing showed that pleurocidin and its analogs exerted antibacterial effect against various bacterial strains and further possessed specific activity patterns corresponding with their hydrophobic scale [pleurocidin &gt; Anal 3 (1-22) > Anal 1 (4-25) > Anal 4 (1-19) > Anal 2 (7-25)]. Fluorescence experiments using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide [diSC3(5)] indicated that the differences in antibacterial activity of the peptides were caused by its membrane-active mechanisms including membrane disruption and depolarization. Blue shift in tryptophan fluorescence demonstrated that the decrease in net hydrophobicity attenuates the binding affinity of pleurocidin to interact with plasma membrane. Therefore, the present study suggests that hydrophobicity in the N- and C-terminal regions of pleurocidin plays a key role in its antibacterial activity.
TI  - Crustin, a WAP domain containing antimicrobial peptide from freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii: immune characterization.
AB  - Crustin (MrCrs) was sequenced from a freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii.  The MrCrs protein contains a signal peptide region at N-terminus between 1 and 22 and a long whey acidic protein domain (WAP domain) at C-terminus between 57 and 110 along with a WAP-type 'four-disulfide core' motif. Phylogenetic results show that MrCrs is clustered together with other crustacean crustin groups. MrCrs showed high sequence similarity (77%) with crustin from Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei and Japanese spiny lobster Panulirus japonicas. I-TASSER uses the best structure templates to predict the possible structures of MrCrs along with PDB IDs such as 2RELA and 1FLEI. The gene expressions of MrCrs in both healthy M. rosenbergii and those infected with virus including infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) and bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila (Gram-negative) and Enterococcus faecium (Gram-positive) were examined using quantitative real time PCR. To understand its biological activity, the recombinant MrCrs gene was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant MrCrs protein agglutinated with the bacteria considered for analysis at a concentration of 25 mug/ml, except Lactococcus lactis. The bactericidal results showed that the recombinant MrCrs protein destroyed all the bacteria after incubation, even less than 6 h. These results suggest that MrCrs is a potential antimicrobial peptide, which is involved in the defense system of M. rosenbergii against viral and bacterial infections.
TI  - A comparative study to determine the recovery rate of microorganisms of bloodstream infections: two versus three blood culture specimens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There has been a development of automated and continuous-monitoring blood culture systems that are more sensitive than conventional systems for the detection of microorganisms. Whether two or three blood culture specimens obtained during a 24-hour period using these automated systems achieving a higher recovery rate of microorganism remains to be determined. The present study was aimed to compare the recovery rates of microorganism of blood-stream infections (BSIs) using two and three blood culture specimens. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective investigator-blinded study was carried out in patients who needed to have blood cultures in medicine wards and intensive care units as well as an emergency room of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between October 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011. Three blood culture specimens were obtained from each patient during a 24-hour period. Each specimen was inoculated into an aerobic bottle of blood culture broth (TREK Diagnostics, Cleveland, OH, US), and then incubated at 37 degrees C for seven days. RESULTS: Of 568 patients, there were 116 (20.4%) unimicrobial episodes with three blood cultures obtained during a 24-hour period. There were 70 (12.3%) and 46 (8.1%) episodes of true pathogen and contaminant, respectively. The recovery rates of true pathogen were 75.7% (53 isolates), 87.1% (61 isolates), and 100% (70 isolates) with the first, second, and third blood culture specimens, respectively (p < 0.05 between the recovery rate with the first two and the third blood culture specimens). There were 25 (35.7%), 38 (58.6%) isolates, and four (5.7%) of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi, respectively. Among 25 Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate (10, 14.3%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (5, 7.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (3, 10% each). Among 38 Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate (13, 18. 6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8, 11.4%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.6%). The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using two blood culture specimens were 85.7% and 92.3%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using three blood culture specimens were 100% and 90.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: To the best of the authors'knowledge, the present study is the first prospective study to compare the recovery rate of microorganisms of BSIs between the two and three blood culture specimens using the VersaTREK blood culture system. Three blood culture specimens are required to achieve the recovery rate of more than 99%.
TI  - Exposure to clinical X-ray radiation does not alter antibiotic susceptibility or  genotype profile in gram-negative and gram-positive clinical pathogens.
AB  - Inadvertent exposure of bacterial pathogens to X-ray radiation may be an environmental stress, where the bacterium may respond by increasing mutational events, thereby potentially resulting in increased antibiotic resistance and alteration to genotypic profile. In order to examine this, four clinical pathogens, including the Gram-negative organisms Escherichia coli O157:H7 NCTC12900 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC10662, as well as the Gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus NCTC6571 and Enterococcus faecium were exposed to X-rays (35,495 cGy/cm2) over a seven-day period. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed before, during and after exposure by examining susceptibility, as quantified by E-test with six antibiotics, as well as to a further 11 antibiotics by measurement of susceptibility zone sizes (mm). Additionally, the DNA profile of each organism was compared before, during and after exposure employing the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction (ERIC PCR). Results indicated that exposure of these organisms to this amount of X-ray radiation did not alter their antibiotic susceptibility, nor their genomic DNA profile. Overall, these data indicate that exposure of bacteria to X-ray radiation does not alter the test organisms' antibiotic susceptibility profiles, nor alter genomic DNA profiles of bacteria, which therefore does not compromise molecular epidemiological tracking of bacteria within healthcare environments in which patients have been exposed to X-ray radiation.
TI  - Therapy of 1,025 severely ill patients with complicated infections in a German multicenter study: safety profile and efficacy of tigecycline in different treatment modalities.
AB  - This large prospective non-interventional study investigated the effects of tigecycline either as single agent or in combination with other antimicrobial agents in 1,025 patients treated in clinical routine at German hospitals. Sixty-five percent of the patients had APACHE II scores > 15, indicating high overall disease severity. Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) or complicated skin and skin tissue infections (cSSTI) were the most common indications, with Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and Escherichia coli being the most frequently isolated pathogens. Clinical success was reported at the end of tigecycline therapy in 74.2% of the total population, in 75.4% of the cIAI and in 82.2% of the cSSTI patients. The subpopulation (28.0% of the patients) infected with multidrug-resistant pathogens (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers and vancomycin-resistant enterococci) were treated with similar success rates as the overall population. Tigecycline was generally well tolerated. Drug-related adverse events (AEs) were reported in 7.7% of the total population; 2.5% had serious AEs mostly attributable to inefficacy of therapy or deterioration of the disease. Mortality rates were consistent with the types of infection and severity of illness. There was no indication of excessive mortality associated with tigecycline as had been suggested in previously performed meta-analyses. In this large non-interventional study performed in the clinical routine setting, tigecycline achieved favorable clinical success rates in a patient population with high severity of illness and a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens and showed a good safety and tolerability profile.
TI  - The changing epidemiology of bacteraemias in Europe: trends from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System.
AB  - We investigated bacteraemia trends for five major bacterial pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and determined how expanding antimicrobial resistance influenced the total burden of bacteraemias in Europe. Aetiological fractions of species and antibiotic phenotypes were extracted from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) database for laboratories, which consistently reported between 2002 and 2008. Trend analyses used generalized linear models. Robustness of results was assessed by iterative analysis for different geographic regions. From 2002 to 2008, the overall number of reports increased annually by 6.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.2-6.5%), from 46 095 to 67 876. In the subset of laboratories providing denominator information, the overall incidence increased from 0.58/1000 patient-days to 0.90/1000 patient-days (7.2% per year; 95% CI 6.9-7.5%). The frequency of reported bacteraemia isolates of S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae increased moderately, while increase in E. coli and Enterococcus faecium was more pronounced. Bacteraemias caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus increased until 2005 (7.6% per year; 95% CI 6.1-9.1%), and then decreased (-4.8% per year; 95% CI -6.1 to -3.5%), whereas the number attributable to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus increased continuously (3.4% per year; 95% CI 3.0-3.7). Increasing rates of E. coli were mainly caused by antibiotic-resistant phenotypes. Our data suggest that the burden of bacterial bloodstream infection has been increasing for all species during EARSS surveillance. Trends were mainly driven by resistant strains and clearly dissociated between resistant and susceptible isolates. It appears that infections with resistant clones add to rather than replace infections caused by susceptible bacteria. As a consequence, expansion of antibiotic resistance creates an additional strain on healthcare systems.
TI  - Adenylate kinase release as a high-throughput-screening-compatible reporter of bacterial lysis for identification of antibacterial agents.
AB  - Adenylate kinase (AK) is a ubiquitous intracellular enzyme that is released into  the extracellular space upon cell lysis. We have shown that AK release serves as a useful reporter of bactericidal agent activity and can be exploited for antimicrobial screening purposes. The AK assay exhibits improved sensitivity over that of growth-based assays and can detect agents that are active against bacteria in clinically relevant growth states that are difficult to screen using conventional approaches, such as small colony variants (SCV) and bacteria within established biofilms. The usefulness of the AK assay was validated by screening a library of off-patent drugs for agents that exhibit antimicrobial properties toward a variety of bacterial species, including Escherichia coli and all members of the "ESKAPE" pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species). The assay detected antibiotics within the library that were expected to be active against the organism screened. Moreover, 38 drugs with no previously reported antibacterial activity elicited AK release. Four of these were acquired, and all were verified to exhibit antimicrobial activity by standard susceptibility testing. Two of these molecules were further characterized. The antihistamine, terfenadine, was active against S. aureus planktonic, SCV population, and biofilm-associated cells. Tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist, was active toward E. faecium in vitro and also reduced E. faecium pathogenesis in a Galleria mellonella infection model. Our data demonstrate that the AK assay provides an attractive screening approach for identifying new antimicrobial agents. Further, terfenadine and tamoxifen may represent novel antimicrobial drug development scaffolds.
TI  - Comparative analysis of classical and molecular microbiology methods for the detection of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. in well water.
AB  - The microbiological quality of 165 1 litre well water samples collected in the Quebec City region was assessed by culture-based methods (mFC agar, Chromocult coliform agar, Colilert((R)), MI agar, Chromocult enterococci, Enterolert, and mEI agar) and by a molecular microbiology strategy, dubbed CRENAME-rtPCR, developed for the detection of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis/faecium, and Bacillus atrophaeus subsp. globigii. In these drinking water samples, approved culture-based methods detected E. coli at rates varying from 1.8 to 3.6% and Enterococcus spp. at rates varying from 3.0 to 11.5%, while the molecular microbiology approach for E. coli was found to be as efficient, detecting contamination in 3.0% of samples. In contrast, CRENAME-rtPCR detected Enterococcus spp. in 27.9% of samples while the E. faecalis/faecium molecular assay did not uncover a single contaminated sample, thereby revealing a discrepancy in the coverage of waterborne enterococcal species detected by classical and molecular microbiology methods. The validation of the CRENAME-E. coli rtPCR test as a new tool to assess the quality of drinking water will require larger scale studies elaborated to demonstrate its equivalence to approved methods.
TI  - [Spectrum and drug sensitivity of pathogenic bacteria in children with nephrotic  syndrome complicated by urinary tract infection: an analysis of 97 cases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum and drug sensitivity of pathogenic bacteria in children with nephrotic syndrome (NS) complicated by urinary tract infection (UTI). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the spectrum and drug sensitivity of pathogenic bacteria in 97 children with NS complicated by UTI, who hospitalized from January to December, 2011. RESULTS: The incidence of UTI in children with NS was 36.5%. It was significantly more common in children with recurrent NS than in those with primary NS (44.0% vs 31.9%; P<0.05). These cases mainly presented with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Enterococcus was the most common pathogenic bacteria (50.5%), including Enterococcus faecium (29.4%) and Enterococcus faecalis (21.1%), followed by Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (15.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.7%). Enterococcus was highly sensitive to nitrofurantoin, vacomycin and linezolid, but was highly resistant to tetracycline and moxifloxacin. More multi-resistant strains were detected in Enterococcus faecium than in Enterococcus faecalis (72% vs 17%; P<0.05). Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were highly sensitive to amikacin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. Of the Gram-negative bacteria, 25% produced extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). ESBLs-producing bacteria had 100% sensitivity to imipenem, amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam but were highly resistant to ampicillin, cefazolin and ceftriaxone. CONCLUSIONS: Children with recurrent NS are more susceptible to UTI than those with primary NS. Enterococcus is becoming major pathogenic bacteria for UTI in children with NS and has relatively high drug resistance, and most strains of Enterococcus faecium are multi-resistant.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  - The biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic LAB from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.LAB were isolated using MRS and M17 media. The agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) producing LAB using Lactobacillus sakei and Listeria innocua as indicator organisms. Out of 138 LAB isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C against L. innocua, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against Penicillium expansum, Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. The effect of selected LAB strains on L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.Twenty percent of our isolates produced BLS inhibiting the growth of L. innocua and/or Lact. sakei. Organic acids and/or H2O2 produced by LAB and not the BLS had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of E. coli. Ent. faecium, Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. Bacteriocinogenic LAB present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
TI  - Synergistic effects between silver nanoparticles and antibiotics and the mechanisms involved.
AB  - Silver nanoparticles (nano-Ags), which have well-known antimicrobial properties,  are used extensively in various medical and general applications. In this study, the combination effects between nano-Ags and the conventional antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol and kanamycin against various pathogenic bacteria were investigated. The MIC and fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) were determined to confirm antibacterial susceptibility and synergistic effects. The results showed that nano-Ags possessed antibacterial effects and synergistic activities. The antibiofilm activities of nano-Ags alone or in combination with antibiotics were also investigated. Formation of biofilm is associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents and chronic bacterial infections. The results indicated that nano-Ags also had antibiofilm activities. To understand these effects of nano-Ags, an ATPase inhibitor assay, permeability assay and hydroxyl radical assay were conducted. The antibacterial activity of nano-Ags was influenced by ATP-associated metabolism rather than by the permeability of the outer membrane. Additionally, nano-Ags generated hydroxyl radicals, a highly reactive oxygen species induced by bactericidal agents. It was concluded that nano-Ags have potential as a combination therapeutic agent for the treatment of infectious diseases by bacteria.
TI  - Assessment of sources of human pathogens and fecal contamination in a Florida freshwater lake.
AB  - We investigated the potential for a variety of environmental reservoirs to harbor or contribute fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), DNA markers of human fecal contamination, and human pathogens to a freshwater lake. We hypothesized that submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), sediments, and stormwater act as reservoirs and/or provide inputs of FIB and human pathogens to this inland water. Analysis included microbial source tracking (MST) markers of sewage contamination (Enterococcus faecium esp gene, human-associated Bacteroides HF183, and human polyomaviruses), pathogens (Salmonella, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and enteric viruses), and FIB (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and enterococci). Bayesian analysis was used to assess relationships among microbial and physicochemical variables. FIB in the water were correlated with concentrations in SAV and sediment. Furthermore, the correlation of antecedent rainfall and major rain events with FIB concentrations and detection of human markers and pathogens points toward multiple reservoirs for microbial contaminants in this system. Although pathogens and human-source markers were detected in 55% and 21% of samples, respectively, markers rarely coincided with pathogen detection. Bayesian analysis revealed that low concentrations (<45 CFU x 100 ml(-1)) of fecal coliforms were associated with 93% probability that pathogens would not be detected; furthermore the Bayes net model showed associations between elevated temperature and rainfall with fecal coliform and enterococci concentrations, but not E. coli. These data indicate that many under-studied matrices (e.g. SAV, sediment, stormwater) are important reservoirs for FIB and potentially human pathogens and demonstrate the usefulness of Bayes net analysis for water quality assessment.
TI  - [Interaction of Bifidobacterium bifidum with members of normal microflora in human intestine microsymbiocenosis].
AB  - AIM: Study the influence of exometabolites of B. bifidum on biological properties of bacteria that are the members of normoflora and their ability to interact with associative microsymbionts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial strains that are members of the normal microflora of human intestine: B. bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcusfaecium and Escherichia coli lactose positive non-hemolytic (lac "+"/hly "-") were used. As opportunistic microorganisms cultures of E. coli lactose negative hemolytic (lac "-"/hly "+"), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were used. Isolation and identification of microorganisms was performed by generally accepted methods according to guidances. In the first series of experiments influence of B. bifidum metabolites on biological properties of microorganisms that are members ofnormoflora was studied. In the second series--the influence of bifidobacteria supernatants on interrelations of B. bifidum, L. acidophilus and E. coli lac "+"/hly "-" with opportunistic associants. Growth properties (GP), biofilm formation (BFF) and anti-lysozyme activity (ALA) of microorganisms was studied photometrically. Optical density measurement were performed on ELx808 (BioTek, U.S.A.) photometer. The data obtained were treated by nonparametric method using Mann-Whitney criteria. RESULTS: B. bifidum supernatant was established to stimulate in 33.3-66.7% of cases or did not alter growth/reproduction, BFF and ALA of microorganisms that are characteristic for eubiosis of intestine including bacteria of the same species that could have implications for realization by bifidobacteria ofbiotope colonization resistance. Features of interaction ofexometabolites of bifidobacteria with microorganisms that are characteristic for eubiosis of human intestine consisting in enchantment or changes of effects of the influence of normoflora members on BFF of associants were revealed. The maximum enchantment of inhibitory effect of indigenous strains under the influence ofbifidobacteria was noted in associations E. coli lac "+"/hly "-" E. coli lac "-"/hly "+" as well as E. faecium--S. aureus. CONCLUSION: Thus, the data obtained may be used for detection of mechanisms of functioning of normal microsymbiocenosis in human associative symbiosis.
TI  - Changes in the aerobic faecal flora of patients treated with antibiotics for acute intra-abdominal infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An open observational study was performed to investigate changes in the rectal flora and antibiotic susceptibility among faecal bacteria in patients treated with antibiotics for acute intra-abdominal infection. METHODS: One hundred and forty patients with acute intra-abdominal infection requiring antibiotic treatment and hospitalization were included. Eight surgical units from the southern part of Sweden participated, between January 2006 and November 2007. Antibiotic treatments were according to local guidelines. Rectal swabs were obtained on admission (sample 1) and 2-14 days after the end of antibiotic treatment (sample 2). Aerobic bacteria and yeasts were analysed. The material was divided into 2 groups: 1 group with Enterobacteriaceae and 1 group with non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria. The susceptibility to antibiotics in each group was compared between samples 1 and 2. RESULTS: The main finding of this study on patients with severe intra-abdominal infections was a shift in the aerobic faecal flora following antibiotic treatment, from Escherichia coli to other more resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus faecium, and yeasts. The susceptibility to cephalosporins and piperacillin-tazobactam decreased in Enterobacteriaceae. CONCLUSIONS: Following antibiotic treatment, a shift in the aerobic rectal flora to species with intrinsic antibiotic resistance was observed. This indicates that the emergence of resistance is not due to new mutations, but rather to selection of more resistant species. This should be taken into account when designing treatments for secondary intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Clinical study of distribution and drug resistance of pathogens in patients with  severe acute pancreatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous researches about necrotic pancreatic tissue infections are numerous, but the study on systemic infection related to the severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) treatment period is limited. This study aimed to investigate the distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria in patients who had hepatobiliary surgery for SAP during the past three years. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on the distribution, category and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria in patients who had hepatobiliary surgery for SAP from 2008 to 2011. RESULTS: A total of 594 pathogenic bacteria samples were isolated. Among them 418 isolates (70.4%) were Gram bacteria negative, 142 isolates (23.9%) were Gram bacteria positive, and 34 isolates (5.7%) were found fungi. The most common Gram negative bacteria were Escherichia coli (19.8%), and the dominant Gram positive pathogenic bacteria were Enterococcus faecium. The distribution of SAP-related infectious pathogens was mainly in peritoneal drainage fluid, sputum, bile, and wound secretions. Almost all the Gram negative pathogenic bacteria were sensitive to carbapenum. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) producing strains were more resistant to penicillins and cephalosprins than the ESBLs non-producing strains. Staphylococcus was sensitive to vancomycin and linezolid. The drug resistance of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus (MRS) to commonly used antibiotics was higher than meticillin-sensitive streptococcus (MSS). Enterococcus sp. exhibited lower drug-resistance rates to vancomycin and linezolid. CONCLUSIONS: Gram negative bacteria were the dominant SAP-related infection after hepatobiliary surgery. A high number of fungal infections were reported. Drug resistant rates were high. Rational use of antibiotics according to the site of infection, bacterial species and drug sensitivity, correctly executing the course of treatment and enhancing hand washing will contribute to therapy and prevention of SAP-related infection and decrease its mortality.
TI  - Evidence for occurrence, persistence, and growth potential of Escherichia coli and enterococci in Hawaii's soil environments.
AB  - High densities of Escherichia coli and enterococci are common in freshwaters on Oahu and other Hawaiian Islands. Soil along stream banks has long been suspected as the likely source of these bacteria; however, the extent of their occurrence and distribution in a wide range of soils remained unknown until the current investigation. Soil samples representing the seven major soil associations were collected on the island of Oahu and analyzed for fecal coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci by the most probable number method. Fecal coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci were found in most of the samples analyzed; log mean densities (MPN +/- SE g soil(-)(1)) were 1.96 +/- 0.18, n=61; 1.21 +/- 0.17, n=57; and 2.99 +/- 0.12, n=62, respectively. Representative, presumptive cultures of E. coli and enterococci collected from the various soils were identified and further speciated using the API scheme; at least six species of Enterococcus, including Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, were identified. In mesocosm studies, E. coli and enterococci increased by 100-fold in 4 days, after mixing sewage-spiked soil (one part) with autoclaved soil (nine parts). E. coli remained metabolically active in the soil and readily responded to nutrients, as evidenced by increased dehydrogenase activity. Collectively, these findings indicate that populations of E. coli and enterococci are part of the natural soil microflora, potentially influencing the quality of nearby water bodies.
TI  - The variability of bacterial aerosol in poultry houses depending on selected factors.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study is aimed at evaluation of bacterial air contamination in intensive poultry breeding. The evaluation was based on the determined levels of bacterial concentrations and qualitative identification of isolated microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study covered 5 poultry houses: two hatcheries and three hen houses with the litter bed system. The air was sampled in three measurement series in the central part of the investigated workplace at the height of about 1.5 m over the ground, using portable measuring sets consisting of a GilAir 5 (Sensidyne, USA) pump and a measuring head filled with a glass microfibre filter (Whatman, UK). For the quantitative and qualitative analysis of microorganisms were used appropriate microbiological media. RESULTS: The total concentrations of airborne mesophilic bacteria inside the poultry breeding houses ranged from 4.74 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.89 x 10(8) cfu/m(3). For Gram-negative bacteria, the range comprised the values from 4.33 x 10(2) cfu/m(3) to 4.29 x 10(6) cfu/m(3). The concentrations of the cocci of Enterococcus genus ranged from 1.53 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.09 x 10(7) cfu/m(3), whereas those of other Gram-positive bacteria from 3.78 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 6.65 x 10(7) cfu/m(3). The lowest concentrations of each group of the examined microorganisms were noted in the second measurement series when the air exchange in the breeding houses was over twice higher than in first and third measurement series because the mechanical ventilation was supported by natural ventilation (opened gates in the buildings). The lowest concentrations of total bacteria were obtained in those buildings where one-day old chickens were kept. Gram-positive bacteria of the genera: Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Corynebacterium, Brevibacterium, Micrococcus, Cellulomonas, Bacillus, Aerococcus, and Gram-negative bacteria of the genera: Pseudomonas, Moraxella, Escherichia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Pasteurella, Pantoea were isolated. It was shown that for most of the investigated livestock premises the total bacteria concentrations exceeded the reference value of 1.0 x 10(5) cfu/m(3). Furthermore, pathogenic microorganisms which are a potential threat to human health (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. ozaenae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium) were found among the identified bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the hygienic conditions of the working environment connected with litter bed system production of poultry are affected by changes of the efficiency of ventilation and create a direct health risk to employees. They should use personal protective measures to protect their respiratory tract, especially when the gates in the hen houses are closed.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of propolis on the microbiota from gastrointestinal tract of chickens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of propolis extracts on the microbial colonization of chicken gastrointestinal tract in vivo. The propolis was administered to both feed mixtures in various amounts except of the control group. The addition of 150 mg propolis to 1 kg of feed was included in the first experimental group, the addition of 450 mg.kg(-1) in the second experimental group, the addition of 600 mg.kg(-1) the third experimental group and 800 mg kg(-1) in the fourth one. The highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the third group (8.6 cfu.g(-1)) where 600 mg of propolis to 1 kg was added to the feed mixture. The highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the fourth experimental group (8.83 cfu.g(-1)) where was 800 mg of propolis added to 1 kg of feed mixture and number of Enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in control group (8.73 cfu.g(-1)). With RTQ PCR detected species from the genus Enterococcus were: E. avium, E. casseliflavus, E cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus and from genus Lactobacillus were: Lactobacillus crispatus, L. acidophilus and L. salivarius. With MALDI TOF MS Biotyper from Enterobacteriaceae genera were identified Citrobacter braakii, Raoultella ornithinolytica, Serratia fonticola, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella oxytoca. Antimicrobial activities In vitro of six species of bacteria isolated from gastrointestinal tract of chickens were also tested. The best antimicrobial effect of Citrobacter braakii on ethanolic propolis extract in all concentrations were found.
TI  - Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the aminoglycoside-6'-acetyltransferase AAC(6')-Im.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotics is primarily the result of enzymatic deactivation of the drugs. The aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases (AACs) are a large family of bacterial enzymes that are responsible for coenzyme-A-facilitated acetylation of aminoglycosides. The gene encoding one of these enzymes, AAC(6')-Im, has been cloned and the protein (comprising 178 amino-acid residues) was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized as the kanamycin complex. Synchrotron diffraction data to approximately 2.0 A resolution were collected from a crystal of this complex on beamline BL12-2 at SSRL (Stanford, California, USA). The crystals belonged to the hexagonal space group P6(5), with approximate unit-cell parameters a = 107.75, c = 37.33 A, and contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Structure determination is under way using molecular replacement.
TI  - Persistence of nosocomial pathogens on various fabrics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fabrics can become contaminated with high numbers of microorganisms that may be pathogenic to patients in a hospital setting and can play an important role in the chain of infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the survival of several clinical bacterial and fungal isolates on several fabrics commonly used in hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial and fungal survival was tested on the following materials, each of which are commonly used in our hospital: 100% smooth cotton, 60% cotton-40% polyester, 100% wool and 100% silk. One isolate each of Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Geotrichum candidum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive Escherichia coli, inducible beta-lactamase (IBL) positive Pseudomonas aeruginosa, IBL-positive Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were used to contaminate fabrics. The survival of these microorganisms was studied by testing the fabric swatches for microbial growth. RESULTS: The median survival times for all the tested bacteria and fungi were as follows: 26 days on cotton, 26.5 days on cotton-polyester, 28 days on silk, and 30 days on wool. Among the bacterial species tested, E. faecium had the longest survival time on cotton-polyester fabrics. For the fungal isolates, it was observed that C. tropicalis and C. krusei survived for the shortest amount of time on cotton fabrics in the present study. CONCLUSION: This survival data indicate that pathogenic microorganisms can survive from days to months on commonly used hospital fabrics. These findings indicate that current recommendations for the proper disinfection or sterilization of fabrics used in hospitals should be followed to minimize cross-contamination and prevent nosocomial infections.
TI  - Wild birds as biological indicators of environmental pollution: antimicrobial resistance patterns of Escherichia coli and enterococci isolated from common buzzards (Buteo buteo).
AB  - A total of 36 Escherichia coli and 31 enterococci isolates were recovered from 42 common buzzard faecal samples. The E. coli isolates showed high levels of resistance to streptomycin and tetracycline. The following resistance genes were detected: bla(TEM) (20 of 22 ampicillin-resistant isolates), tet(A) and/or tet(B) (16 of 27 tetracycline-resistant isolates), aadA1 (eight of 27 streptomycin-resistant isolates), cmlA (three of 15 chloramphenicol-resistant isolates), aac(3)-II with/without aac(3)-IV (all seven gentamicin-resistant isolates) and sul1 and/or sul2 and/or sul3 [all eight sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim-resistant (SXT) isolates]. intI1 and intI2 genes were detected in four SXT-resistant isolates. The virulence-associated genes fimA (type 1 fimbriae), papC (P fimbriae) and aer (aerobactin) were detected in 61.1, 13.8 and 11.1% of the isolates, respectively. The isolates belonged to phylogroups A (47.2%), B1 (8.3%), B2 (13.9%) and D (30.5%). For the enterococci isolates, Enterococcus faecium was the most prevalent species (48.4%). High levels of tetracycline and erythromycin resistance were found among our isolates (87 and 81%, respectively). Most of the tetracycline-resistant strains carried the tet(M) and/or tet(L) genes. The erm(B) gene was detected in 80% of erythromycin-resistant isolates. The vat(D) and/or vat(E) genes were found in nine of the 17 quinupristin-dalfopristin-resistant isolates. The enterococcal isolates showing high-level resistance for kanamycin, gentamicin and streptomycin contained the aph(3')-IIIa, aac(6')-aph(2'') and ant(6)-Ia genes, respectively. This report reveals that common buzzards seem to represent an important reservoir, or at least a source, of multi-resistant E. coli and enterococci isolates, and consequently may represent a considerable hazard to human and animal health by transmission of these isolates to waterways and other environmental sources via their faecal deposits.
TI  - Effect of mannoproteins on the growth, gastrointestinal viability, and adherence  to Caco-2 cells of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Yeast cell wall (YCW) preparations and yeast mannoprotein extracts have been effective against some enteropathogenic bacteria as Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella, and they can affect the population of beneficial lactic acid bacteria (LAB). In this work, we studied the effect of a mannoprotein extract on five strains of LAB. This extract was metabolised by the bacteria, enhancing their survival in simulated gastrointestinal juice, and increasing the adherence of Lactobacillus plantarum, L. salivarius, and Enterococcus faecium to Caco-2 cells. Yeast mannoproteins are promising naturally occurring compounds that could be used to enhance LAB intestinal populations and control pathogens.
TI  - [Trends of bacterial resistance phenotypes in high-complexity public and private  hospitals in Colombia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Describe and compare the frequency of bacterial resistance phenotypes  of microorganisms obtained from patients in intensive care units (ICU) and other (non-ICU) high-complexity public and private hospital services in Colombia. METHODS: A retrospective observational, analytical, multicenter study was conducted. The records from January 2007 to December 2009 on bacterial isolates and bacterial resistance phenotypes of microorganisms obtained from ICU and non-ICU patients in 79 high-complexity public and private hospitals were consolidated. The information was analyzed with the WHONET((R)) 5.5 (WHO) software, following the 2009 recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, and summarized on an Excel((R)) spreadsheet. A descriptive analysis with the calculation of proportions was performed. The trends were analyzed with Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: The 2007-2009 trends for bacterial resistance phenotypes show increased percentages of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, imipenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin-resistant K. pneumoniae, ceftazidime-resistant Escherichia coli and cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacter cloacae (r = 1, P < 0.01), and reduced percentages of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli, ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (r = -1, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The trend analysis presented in this study is the baseline for establishing a national epidemiological surveillance subsystem. The trends observed reveal that bacterial resistance to antimicrobial drugs in hospitals in Colombia is a dynamic phenomenon, with evidence of the emergence of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and imipenem-resistant K. pneumoniae phenotypes in the hospitals.
TI  - A simple method for primary screening of antibacterial peptides in plant seeds.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Regarding the importance of finding new antibacterial  drugs, screening of plants as a promising resource are now conducted worldwide. In this study, we report the application of a simple previously described method for screening of different plant seeds in order to find the best resources of plant antimicrobial peptides. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total water soluble protein of 10 different plant seeds were extracted and subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent agar-overlay bioassays. Standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and Escherichia coli were included in the bioassays. This method also was used for total proteins precipitated by Ammonium sulphate which ensure the protein nature of the test substances. Molecular size and the amounts of effective peptides were estimated using Tricin-SDS-PAGE and densitometry. RESULTS: Two different plant seeds showed noticeable antibacterial activities against tested Gram positive bacteria and a moderate inhibitory effect on Gram negative ones. Based on the results of Tricin-SDS-PAGE analysis which were carried out in parallel to bioassays, it was concluded that effective antibacterial substances are peptides with molecular weight of slightly larger than 5 kDa. CONCLUSION: On the basis of results of agar-overlay experiments and by screening of 10 different herbal seeds, we could introduce seeds of M. sativa L. and Onobrychis sativa Lam., as great sources of putative plant antibacterial peptides. The proposed screening method can be used for screening of large number of different plant seeds and even other parts of the plant body, regarding some necessary modification in total water soluble protein extraction steps.
TI  - Mechanism of Honey Bacteriostatic Action Against MRSA and VRE Involves Hydroxyl Radicals Generated from Honey's Hydrogen Peroxide.
AB  - It has been recently reported that honey hydrogen peroxide in conjunction with unknown honey components produced cytotoxic effects resulting in bacterial growth inhibition and DNA degradation. The objective of this study was twofold: (a) to investigate whether the coupling chemistry involving hydrogen peroxide is responsible for a generation of hydroxyl radicals and (b) whether (*)OH generation affects growth of multi-drug resistant clinical isolates. The susceptibility of five different strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and four strains of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) isolates from infected wounds to several honeys was evaluated using broth microdilution assay. Isolates were identified to genus and species and their susceptibility to antibiotics was confirmed using an automated system (Vitek((R)), Biomerieux((R))). The presence of the mec(A) gene, nuc gene and van(A) and (B) genes were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Results showed that no clinical isolate was resistant to selected active honeys. The median difference in honeys MICs against these strains ranged between 12.5 and 6.25% v/v and was not different from the MIC against standard Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Generation of (*)OH during bacteria incubation with honeys was analyzed using 3'-(p-aminophenyl) fluorescein (APF) as the (*)OH trap. The (*)OH participation in growth inhibition was monitored directly by including APF in broth microdilution assay. The growth of MRSA and VRE was inhibited by (*)OH generation in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure of MRSA and VRE to honeys supplemented with Cu(II) augmented production of (*)OH by 30-fold and increased honey bacteriostatic potency from MIC(90) 6.25 to MIC(90)< 0.78% v/v. Pretreatment of honeys with catalase prior to their supplementation with Cu ions fully restored bacterial growth indicating that hydroxyl radicals were produced from H(2)O(2) via the Fenton-type reaction. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that bacteriostatic effect of honeys on MRSA and VRE was dose-dependently related to generation of (*)OH from honey H(2)O(2).
TI  - Hematological: Low all-cause mortality and low occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in hematological patients with bacteremia receiving no antibacterial prophylaxis: a single-center study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteremia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological malignancies. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to define temporal trends in species distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility, and all-cause mortality in bacteremic hospitalized patients receiving no antibacterial prophylaxis during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. METHODS: A total of 677 clinical episodes of bacteremia were identified in 463 patients during 2002-2008, and the results were compared with those published from the same institution during 1980-86 and 1988-2001. No major changes in patient selection were introduced during this period. RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2008, the dominating pathogens were Escherichia coli (18%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (15%), viridans streptococci (14%), Klebsiella spp. (10%), and Enterococcus faecium (8%). The 7-d crude mortality rate was 5.2%. Polymicrobial bacteremia was seen in 25.7% of the patients who died within 7 d and in 13.1% of the survivors (P = 0.04). Acquired resistance was rarely observed, but a statistically significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli was observed. Comparing 2002-2008 with historical data from the same institution, the proportion of Gram-positive isolates remained stable at 53-55% from 1988. CONCLUSIONS: The avoidance of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis may have contributed to a stable proportion of Gram-positive bacteremia. The crude mortality was low in an international perspective. Acquired resistance was uncommon, but ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli increased significantly. We believe that an indiscriminate use of antibacterial prophylaxis could be avoided in neutropenic patients without a negative impact on mortality.
TI  - [Microbial "friend-foe" identification in human intestine microsymbiocenosis].
AB  - AIM: Development of methodical approach of evaluation of microbial "friend-foe" identification in human intestine microsymbiocenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 9 bifidobacteria cultures (dominants) and 18 opportunistic microorganism strains (associants) isolated from patients during examination for intestine dysbiosis and identified by conventional methods were used. Evaluation of microbial "friend-foe" identification in microsymbiocenosis was performed by author developed technique that is based on determination of growth factors (GF), anti-lysozyme activity (ALA) and formation of biofilms (BFF) of associants co-incubated with exometabolites of dominants. GF, ALA, BFF were studied photometrically (Bukharin O.V., 1999, 2009; O'Toole G.A., 2000). The data were statistically analyzed by Fisher-Student criteria. RESULTS: The detected opposite (increase/reduction) phenomenon of the "dominant-associant" pair allowed realization of the "friend-foe" identification in microsymbiocenosis. Associants (E. coli and Enterococcus faecium) were "friend" species, in which bifidobacteria exometabolites did not change growth properties and stimulated ALA (by 17,5--32%) and BFF (by 25 - 39%). Associants (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans) were "foe" microsymbiont species, in which bifidoflora exometabolites decreased GF (by 20,7--68%), ALA (by 22,7--54%) and BFF (by 22,5 --39%). CONCLUSION: Indigenous microflora during microsymbiocenosis formation can participate in "friend-foe" identification, the basis of which is determined by microsymbiont exometabolites. The data obtained open a perspective of understanding mechanisms of intramicrobial interactions and can be used for both diagnostics and optimal selection of "candidates" during creation of new probiotics and synbiotics.
TI  - Mechanisms of resistance and clinical relevance of resistance to beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in a growing problem of antimicrobial resistance in the community and hospital settings. Antimicrobial classes for which resistance has become a major problem include the beta-lactams, the glycopeptides, and the fluoroquinolones. In gram-positive bacteria, beta-lactam resistance most commonly results from expression of intrinsic low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins. In gram-negative bacteria, expression of acquired beta-lactamases presents a particular challenge owing to some natural spectra that include virtually all beta-lactam classes. Glycopeptide resistance has been largely restricted to nosocomial Enterococcus faecium strains, the spread of which is promoted by ineffective infection control mechanisms for fecal organisms and the widespread use of colonization-promoting antimicrobials (especially cephalosporins and antianaerobic antibiotics). Fluoroquinolone resistance in community-associated strains of Escherichia coli, many of which also express beta-lactamases that confer cephalosporin resistance, is increasingly prevalent. Economic and regulatory forces have served to discourage large pharmaceutical companies from developing new antibiotics, suggesting that the antibiotics currently on the market may be all that will be available for the coming decade. As such, it is critical that we devise, test, and implement antimicrobial stewardship strategies that are effective at constraining and, ideally, reducing resistance in human pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Genomic and SNP analyses demonstrate a distant separation of the hospital and community-associated clades of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Recent studies have pointed to the existence of two subpopulations of Enterococcus faecium, one containing primarily commensal/community-associated (CA) strains and one that contains most clinical or hospital-associated (HA) strains, including those classified by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) as belonging to the CC17 group. The HA subpopulation more frequently has IS16, pathogenicity island(s), and plasmids or genes associated with antibiotic resistance, colonization, and/or virulence. Supporting the two clades concept, we previously found a 3-10% difference between four genes from HA-clade strains vs. CA-clade strains, including 5% difference between pbp5-R of ampicillin-resistant, HA strains and pbp5-S of ampicillin-sensitive, CA strains. To further investigate the core genome of these subpopulations, we studied 100 genes from 21 E. faecium genome sequences; our analyses of concatenated sequences, SNPs, and individual genes all identified two distinct groups. With the concatenated sequence, HA-clade strains differed by 0-1% from one another while CA clade strains differed from each other by 0-1.1%, with 3.5-4.2% difference between the two clades. While many strains had a few genes that grouped in one clade with most of their genes in the other clade, one strain had 28% of its genes in the CA clade and 72% in the HA clade, consistent with the predicted role of recombination in the evolution of E. faecium. Using estimates for Escherichia coli, molecular clock calculations using sSNP analysis indicate that these two clades may have diverged >/=1 million years ago or, using the higher mutation rate for Bacillus anthracis, approximately 300,000 years ago. These data confirm the existence of two clades of E. faecium and show that the differences between the HA and CA clades occur at the core genomic level and long preceded the modern antibiotic era.
TI  - Efficacy of multiple metals against copper-resistant bacterial strains.
AB  - AIMS: The antibacterial efficacy of zeolites containing copper (Cu) or silver (Ag) ions or a combination was assessed against several reported copper-resistant (Cu(R)) bacterial strains. METHODS AND RESULTS: Comparison strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection that had no documented metal resistance. Reductions in bacterial populations were determined after exposure time intervals of 3, 6 and 24 h. All three Cu(R) strains of Salmonella enterica exhibited resistance to Cu, Ag and Cu/Ag after three and 6 h of exposure. Both the Cu(R) and comparison strain of Enterococcus faecium were resistant to both metals and the metal combination. Cu(R) Pseudomonas putida was significantly reduced by all zeolites within 3 h. The Cu(R) Escherichia coli strain was more sensitive to Cu, but more resistant to Ag than the comparison strain; however, significant reductions were achieved within 3 h with both Cu and Cu/Ag, and within 24 h with Ag. CONCLUSIONS: Some strains with reported resistance to Cu were also resistant to Ag, suggestive of a shared resistance mechanism such as an indiscriminate Cu efflux pump. Ent. faecium appears to have innate resistance to both metals. In general, Ent. faecium was the most resistant species to the individual metals and the combination of metals, Ps. putida the least resistant, and the Salmonella strains were more resistant than E. coli. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Several of the comparison strains with no reported copper resistance were resistant to one or both metals. This may call into question the methods for determining bacterial metal resistance, which typically use nutrient-rich media containing metals to assess the ability of the bacteria to grow in comparison with a wild-type strain. Nevertheless, all the Cu(R) strains evaluated in this study, with the exception of Ent. faecium, were reduced using the Cu and Ag zeolite combination.
TI  - An N-halamine-based rechargeable antimicrobial and biofilm controlling polyurethane.
AB  - An N-halamine precursor, 5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DMH), was covalently linked to the surface of polyurethane (PU) with 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) as the coupling agent. The reaction pathways were investigated using propyl isocyanate (PI) as a model compound. The results suggested that the imide and amide groups of DMH have very similar reactivities toward the isocyanate groups on PU surfaces activated with HDI. After bleach treatment the covalently bound DMH moieties were transformed into N-halamines. The new N-halamine-based PU provided potent antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacterium), Escherichia coli (Gram-negative bacterium), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, drug-resistant Gram-positive bacterium), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE, drug-resistant Gram-positive bacterium), and Candida albicans (fungus), and successfully prevented bacterial and fungal biofilm formation. The antimicrobial and biofilm controlling effects were stable for longer than 6 months under normal storage in open air. Furthermore, if the functions were lost due to prolonged use they could be recharged by another chlorination treatment. The recharging could be repeated as needed to achieve long-term protection against microbial contamination and biofilm formation.
TI  - Production of two bacteriocins in various growth conditions produced by gram-positive bacteria isolated from chicken cecum.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum CLP29 and Enterococcus faecium CLE34 isolated from the cecal contents of young broiler chicks were identified based on physiological and biochemical characteristics, and identification was confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Both bacteria showed a broad range of inhibitory action against bacteria such as Salmonella and Escherichia coli and produced two peptides, plantaricin CLP29 and enterocin CLE34. Treatment with proteinase K, trypase, or benase resulted in the loss of activity of the two peptides, confirming their proteinaceous nature. The highest activity levels for both bacteria were recorded in de Man - Rogosa - Sharpe agar at pH 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0, at 37 degrees C. Carbon and nitrogen sources affected the antibacterial activities of the two bacteriocins in different combinations, which suggested that the antibacterial abilities of different bacteriocins produced in nutrient sources were various.
TI  - Pan-European monitoring of susceptibility to human-use antimicrobial agents in enteric bacteria isolated from healthy food-producing animals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter and Enterococcus from cattle, pigs and chickens across the European Union (EU) using uniform methodology. METHODS: Intestinal samples (1624) were taken at slaughter across five EU countries. Bacteria were isolated in national laboratories, whilst MICs were determined in a central laboratory for key antimicrobials used in human medicine. Clinical resistance was based on CLSI breakpoints and decreased susceptibility based on European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)/EUCAST epidemiological cut-off values. RESULTS: Isolation rates were high for E. coli (n=1540), low for Salmonella (n=201) and intermediate for Campylobacter (n=940) and Enterococcus (n=786). For E. coli and Salmonella, clinical resistance to newer compounds (cefepime, cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin) was absent or low, but decreased susceptibility was apparent, particularly in chicken strains. Resistance to older compounds (except gentamicin) was variable and higher. Colistin resistance was absent for E. coli, but apparent for Salmonella. For Campylobacter jejuni, ciprofloxacin resistance was markedly prevalent for chickens, whereas clinical resistance and decreased susceptibility to erythromycin was absent or very low. For Campylobacter coli, resistance was notably higher. None of the Enterococcus faecium strains was resistant to linezolid, but some were resistant to ampicillin or vancomycin. Resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance patterns varied widely depending on bacterial species, antibiotics, hosts and region. Resistance varied among countries, particularly for older antimicrobials, but clinical resistance to newer antibiotics used to treat foodborne disease in humans was generally very low. In the absence of resistance to newer compounds in E. coli and Salmonella, the apparent decreased susceptibility should be monitored.
TI  - Colicin M hydrolyses branched lipids II from Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Lipids II found in some Gram-positive bacteria were prepared in radioactive form  from l-lysine-containing UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. The specific lateral chains of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus (di-L-alanine, D-isoasparagine, and pentaglycine, respectively) were introduced by chemical peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemistry. The branched nucleotides obtained were converted into the corresponding lipids II by enzymatic synthesis using the MraY and MurG enzymes. All of the lipids were hydrolysed by Escherichia coli colicin M at approximately the same rate as the meso-diaminopimelate-containing lipid II found in Gram-negative bacteria, thereby opening the way to the use of this enzyme as a broad spectrum antibacterial agent.
TI  - Characterization of fecal indicator bacteria in sediments cores from the largest  freshwater lake of Western Europe (Lake Geneva, Switzerland).
AB  - This study characterized the fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), including Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enteroccocus (ENT), disseminated over time in the Bay of Vidy, which is the most contaminated area of Lake Geneva. Sediments were collected from a site located at approximately 500 m from the present waste water treatment plant (WWTP) outlet pipe, in front of the former WWTP outlet pipe, which was located at only 300 m from the coastal recreational area (before 2001). E. coli and ENT were enumerated in sediment suspension using the membrane filter method. The FIB characterization was performed for human Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) and human specific bacteroides by PCR using specific primers and a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Bacterial cultures revealed that maximum values of 35.2 x 10(8) and 6.6 x 10(6)CFU g(-1) dry sediment for E. coli and ENT, respectively, were found in the sediments deposited following eutrophication of Lake Geneva in the 1970s, whereas the WWTP started operating in 1964. The same tendency was observed for the presence of human fecal pollution: the percentage of PCR amplification with primers ESP-1/ESP-2 for E. faecalis and E. faecium indicated that more than 90% of these bacteria were from human origin. Interestingly, the PCR assays for specific-human bacteroides HF183/HF134 were positive for DNA extracted from all isolated strains of sediment surrounding WWPT outlet pipe discharge. The MALDI-TOF MS confirmed the presence of general E. coli and predominance E. faecium in isolated strains. Our results demonstrated that human fecal bacteria highly increased in the sediments contaminated with WWTP effluent following the eutrophication of Lake Geneva. Additionally, other FIB cultivable strains from animals or adapted environmental strains were detected in the sediment of the bay. The approaches used in this research are valuable to assess the temporal distribution and the source of the human fecal pollution in aquatic environments.
TI  - Trends in the susceptibility of clinically important resistant bacteria to tigecycline: results from the Tigecycline In Vitro Surveillance in Taiwan study, 2006 to 2010.
AB  - The Tigecycline In Vitro Surveillance in Taiwan (TIST) study, a nationwide, prospective surveillance during 2006 to 2010, collected a total of 7,793 clinical isolates, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n = 1,834), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) (n = 423), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (n = 219), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (n = 1,141), ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1,330), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1,645), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 903), from different specimens from 20 different hospitals in Taiwan. MICs of tigecycline were determined following the criteria of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST-2011). Among drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, all of the PRSP isolates were susceptible to tigecycline (MIC(90), 0.03 mug/ml), and only one MRSA isolate (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and three VRE isolates (MIC(90), 0.125 mug/ml) were nonsusceptible to tigecycline. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, the tigecycline susceptibility rates were 99.65% for ESBL-producing E. coli (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and 96.32% for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (MIC(90), 2 mug/ml) when interpreted by FDA criteria but were 98.7% and 85.8%, respectively, when interpreted by EUCAST-2011 criteria. The susceptibility rate for A. baumannii (MIC(90), 4 mug/ml) decreased from 80.9% in 2006 to 55.3% in 2009 but increased to 73.4% in 2010. A bimodal MIC distribution was found among carbapenem-susceptible A. baumannii isolates, and a unimodal MIC distribution was found among carbapenem-nonsusceptible A. baumannii isolates. In Taiwan, tigecycline continues to have excellent in vitro activity against several major clinically important drug-resistant bacteria, with the exception of A. baumannii.
TI  - Characterization of temperature inducible promoters from a novel rolling circle replicating plasmid of Enterococcus faecium DJ1.
AB  - Limited studies have been performed on the characterization of small size plasmids of Enterococcus faecium with the intention of evaluating the strength of their promoters in Escherichia coli. The complete nucleotide sequence (3.825 Kb) and structural organization of E. faecium DJ1 cryptic plasmid pNJAKD is presented. Seven promoter sequences from the pNJAKD plasmid of E. faecium have been identified. The regions coding for the putative promoters were either amplified using PCR based techniques or chemically synthesized as oligonucleotides of different sizes. These were subsequently cloned in the pEGFP vector at the Pvu II site. The efficiency of putative promoter fragments were measured using the intensity of eGFP fluorescence in E. coli JM101, DH5alpha and BL21(DE3), among which AKD3 exhibited moderate to strongest promoter activity at temperatures of 30, 37, and 42 degrees C.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  - The antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. Consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. Little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different pH values. Consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of pH on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (SA) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. Forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MDR Vibrio sp, MDR Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (ESBL) producing Salmonella sp, ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, ESBL producing Proteus mirabilis, ESBL producing Escherichia coli and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (CZOI)]. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-positive isolates at a pH of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. A mean CZOI of 5 mm was recorded for the SCMC dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the SA dressing. At a pH of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. However, at a pH of 8.5 the mean CZOI of the SCMC dressing was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the SA dressing for a select number of isolates. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the Gram-positive bacteria. Susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. Interestingly, when pH was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (P < 0.05). Overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all pH ranges. In addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when pH became more acidic. The findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role pH plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
TI  - Identification of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase gene (NDM-1) from a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter junii in China.
AB  - New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is a novel type of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) responsible for bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Acinetobacter junii was previously shown to possess a MBL phenotype; however, the genes responsible for this phenotype were not identified. In this study, we reported the identification of NDM-1 gene in a clinical isolate of A. junii from a child patient in China, which was resistant to all beta-lactams except aztreonam but sensitive to aminoglycosides and quinolones. The cloned NDM-1 gene contained an open reading frame of 813 bp and had a nucleotide sequence 99.9% identical (812/813) to reported NDM-1 genes carried by Acinetobacter baumannii , Enterococcus faecium , Escherichia coli , and Klebsiella pneumoniae . Recombinant NDM-1 protein was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21, and antibiotic sensitivities of the NDM-1-producing E. coli were largely similar to the A. junii 1454 isolate. The findings of this study raise attention to the emergence and spread of NDM-1-carrying bacteria in China.
TI  - Agreement assessment of tigecycline susceptibilities determined by the disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods among commonly encountered resistant bacterial isolates: results from the Tigecycline In Vitro Surveillance in Taiwan (TIST) study, 2008 to 2010.
AB  - The Tigecycline In Vitro Surveillance in Taiwan (TIST) study, initiated in 2006,  is a nationwide surveillance program designed to longitudinally monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline against commonly encountered drug-resistant bacteria. This study compared the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 3,014 isolates of clinically important drug-resistant bacteria using the standard broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods. Species studied included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 759), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE; n = 191), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (n = 602), ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 736), and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 726) that had been collected from patients treated between 2008 and 2010 at 20 hospitals in Taiwan. MICs and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted according to the currently recommended U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria. The MIC(90) values of tigecycline against MRSA, VRE, ESBL-producing E. coli, ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii were 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 2, and 8 mug/ml, respectively. The total error rates between the two methods using the FDA criteria were high: 38.4% for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and 33.8% for A. baumannii. Using the EUCAST criteria, the total error rate was also high (54.6%) for A. baumannii isolates. The total error rates between these two methods were <5% for MRSA, VRE, and ESBL-producing E. coli. For routine susceptibility testing of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii against tigecycline, the broth microdilution method should be used because of the poor correlation of results between these two methods.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance monitoring in Lower Saxony (ARMIN): first trends for MRSA, ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and VRE from 2006 to 2010].
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is one of the most important health topics of the past few years. To identify regional trends of antimicrobial resistance in inpatient and outpatient care, the Governmental Institute of Public Health of Lower Saxony (Germany) launched the sentinel system ARMIN (Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring in Lower Saxony). Currently 9 laboratories participate as sentinel sites and contribute single case data of their microbiological results. Data are presented by an interactive data query in the internet. From 2006 to 2010 laboratories reported about 800 000 diagnostic test results. The proportion of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) among all Staphylococcus aureus increased from 19.5% in 2006 to 23.4% in 2010 for inpatient care in Lower Saxony. During the same period Escherichia coli resistance to cefotaxime for inpatient care increased from 3.0% to 8.8%. Enterococcus faecium resistance to vancomycin decreased from 13.6% to 5.6%. Currently the emphasis of ARMIN is on the description of trends and on the information of prescribing physicians. A quality circle was established to improve standardisation.
TI  - Activity of tigecycline and comparators against skin and skin structure pathogens: global results of the Tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial, 2004-2009.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This analysis from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) reports on 24 784 isolates collected from integumentary culture sources between 2004 and 2009. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and susceptibility were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (US Food and Drug Administration breakpoints applied against tigecycline). RESULTS: All methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. MIC(90)s for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium ranged between 0.12 mg/l and 0.25mg/l. Resistance to the carbapenems and tigecycline was low among the Enterobacteriaceae, with resistance at </= 2.0% between 2004 and 2009 for tigecycline against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp, and Serratia marcescens, for imipenem against E. coli and Enterobacter spp, and for meropenem against E. coli, Enterobacter spp, and S. marcescens. Against the Acinetobacter baumannii collected in 2009, resistance to amikacin, ceftazidime, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam was >30%; between 2004 and 2009 resistance to minocycline varied between 1.4% and 4.8%, and tigecycline MIC(90)s were </= 2mg/l. Against the Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected, MIC(90)s were greater than the susceptibility breakpoint for cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, levofloxacin, and meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: The problem of antimicrobial resistance is demonstrated by the data presented. T.E.S.T. continues to provide valuable information on antimicrobial resistance globally.
TI  - Evaluation of the nifH gene marker of Methanobrevibacter smithii for the detection of sewage pollution in environmental waters in Southeast Queensland, Australia.
AB  - This study aimed at evaluating the host-specificity and -sensitivity of the nifH  gene marker of Methanobrevibacter smithii by screening 272 fecal and wastewater samples from 11 animal species including humans in Southeast Queensland (SEQ), Australia. In addition, environmental water samples (n = 21) were collected during the dry and wet weather conditions and tested for the presence of the nifH marker along with other sewage-associated markers, namely, enterococci surface protein (esp) found in Enterococci faecium, Bacteroides HF183, adenoviruses (AVs), and polyomaviruses (PVs). The overall host-specificity of the nifH marker to differentiate between human and animal feces was 0.96 (maximum value of 1), while the overall sensitivity of this marker in human sourced feces and wastewater was 0.81 (maximum value of 1). Among the 21 environmental water samples tested, 2 (10%), 3 (14%), 12 (57%), 6 (29%), and 6 (29%) were positive for the nifH, esp, HF183, AVs and PVs markers, respectively. The prevalence of the nifH marker in environmental water samples, however, was low compared to other markers, suggesting that the use of this marker alone may not be sensitive enough to detect fecal pollution in environmental waters. The nifH marker, however, appears to be sewage-specific in SEQ, Australia, and therefore, it is recommended that this marker should be used as an additional marker in combination with the HF183 or viral markers such as AVs or PVs for accurate and sensitive detection of fecal pollution in SEQ waterways.
TI  - Urinary tract infections in renal transplant recipients.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are most common infections in renal transplant recipients and are considered a potential risk factor for poorer graft outcomes. AIM: To evaluate incidence, clinical manifestations, microbiology, risk factors for UTIs, and the influence of UTIs on long-term renal graft function. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed urine cultures with reference to clinical data of patients who received a renal transplantation from January to December 2009 with a 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: The 1170 urine cultures were correlated with clinical data from 89 renal transplant recipients, including 58.4% males and on overall mean age of 48+/-14 years. The 151 episodes in 49 patients consisted of asymptomatic bacteriuria (65%, n=98); lower UTIs (13%, n=19); and upper UTIs (22%, n=34), as well as five cases of bacteremia. Nearly 48% of UTIs were diagnosed during the first month posttransplantation. The most frequently isolated uropathogens were Enterococcus faecium (33%, n=24) and Escherichia coli (31%, n=23). Beginning from the second month, most frequently found bacterium in urine cultures was E coli (65% n=51). Risk factors for posttransplant UTIs were female gender and a history of an acute rejection episode and/or a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. All patients with vesicoureteral reflux of strictures at the ureterovesical junction suffered recurrent UTIs (n=7). The evolution of renal graft function did not differ significantly between patients with versus without UTIs. CONCLUSIONS: UTIs a frequent problem after kidney transplantation most commonly exist as asymptomatic bacteriuria. E coli and E faecium are ther predominant pathogens. Exposure to intensified immunosuppression due to acute rejection episodes or CMV infections represents a risk factor for UTIs. Vesicoureteral reflux or strictures at the ureterovesical junction are risk factors for recurrent UTIs. UTIs did not impair 1-year graft function.
TI  - Identification of SagA as a novel vaccine target for the prevention of Enterococcus faecium infections.
AB  - Infections caused by multiresistant Gram-positive bacteria represent a major health burden in the community as well as in hospitalized patients. Enterococci, especially Enterococcus faecium, are well-known pathogens of hospitalized patients and are frequently linked with resistance against multiple antibiotics, which compromises effective therapy. Rabbit immune serum raised against heat-killed E. faecium E155, a HiRECC clone, was used in an opsonophagocytic assay, an inhibition assay and a mouse bacteraemia model to identify targets of opsonic and protective antibodies. Serum against whole heat-killed bacteria was opsonic and recognized a protein of about 72 kDa that was abundantly secreted. This protein, identified as SagA by LC-ES-MS/MS, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Rabbit serum raised against the purified protein showed opsonic killing activity that was inhibited by almost 100% using 100 microg purified protein ml(-1). In a mouse bacteraemia model, a statistically significant reduction of the colony counts in blood was shown with immune rabbit serum compared with preimmune serum using the homologous and a heterologous vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) strain. These results indicate that SagA could be used as a promising vaccine target to treat and/or prevent VRE bacteraemia.
TI  - Molecular characterization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-containing Escherichia coli isolates in wild birds from the Azores Archipelago.
AB  - To study the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-containing Escherichia coli isolates, and the mechanisms of resistance implicated, 220 faecal samples from wild birds were collected between 2006 and 2010 in the Azores Archipelago. Samples were spread on Slanetz-Bartley agar plates supplemented with 4 mg/l vancomycin and on Levine agar plates supplemented with 2 mg/l cefotaxime for VRE and ESBL-containing E. coli isolation, respectively. vanA-containing enterococcal isolates (four Enterococcus faecium and two Enterococcus durans) and vanC-1 Enterococcus gallinarum isolates were detected in six and seven faecal samples, respectively. VRE isolates showed ampicillin (n=11), ciprofloxacin (n=9), tetracycline (n=6), erythromycin (n=5), quinupristin/dalfopristin (n=3) and high-level kanamycin resistance (n=1). The tet(L) and/or tet(M) gene was found in all tetracycline-resistant isolates and the erm(B) gene in all erythromycin-resistant isolates. Three vanA-containing E. faecium and two E. gallinarum presented specific sequences of the Tn5397 transposon. Four VRE isolates harboured the ace virulence gene. One faecal sample revealed one ESBL-containing E. coli isolate that belongs to the A phylogenetic group, showed a phenotype of resistance to beta-lactams and tetracycline, and harboured the bla (CTX-M-14), bla (SHV-12) and the tet(A) genes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on defining the prevalence of VRE and/or ESBL-containing E. coli strains in wild birds from the Azores. The data recovered are essential to improve knowledge about the dissemination of resistant strains through wild ecosystems and their possible implications by transferring these resistances to other animals or to humans.
TI  - Controlled performance evaluation of the DiversiLab repetitive-sequence-based genotyping system for typing multidrug-resistant health care-associated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Fast, reliable, and versatile typing tools are essential to differentiate among related bacterial strains for epidemiological investigation and surveillance of health care-associated infection with multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. The DiversiLab (DL) system is a semiautomated repetitive-sequence-based PCR system designed for rapid genotyping. The DL system performance was assessed by comparing its reproducibility, typeability, discriminatory power, and concordance with those of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and by assessing its epidemiological concordance on well-characterized MDR bacterial strains (n = 165). These included vanA Enterococcus faecium, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii, and ESBL- or metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. The DL system showed very good performance for E. faecium and K. pneumoniae and good performance for other species, except for a discrimination index of <95% for A. baumannii and E. coli (93.9% and 93.5%, respectively) and incomplete concordance with MLST for P. aeruginosa (78.6%) and E. coli (97.0%). Occasional violations of MLST assignment by DL types were noted for E. coli. Complete epidemiological concordance was observed for all pathogens, as all outbreak-associated strains clustered in identical DL types that were distinct from those of unrelated strains. In conclusion, the DL system showed good to excellent performance, making it a reliable typing tool for investigation of outbreaks caused by study pathogens, even though it was generally less discriminating than PFGE analysis. For E. coli and P. aeruginosa, MLST cannot be reliably inferred from DL type due to phylogenetic group violation or discordance.
TI  - Further increases in carbapenem-, amikacin-, and fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates of Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa in Korea: KONSAR study 2009.
AB  - PURPOSE: The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria has become a serious worldwide problem. The aim of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance data generated in 2009 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the Korean Nationwide Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Susceptibility data were collected from 24 hospitals and two commercial laboratories. In the analysis, resistance did not include intermediate susceptibility. Duplicate isolates were excluded from the analysis of hospital isolates, but not from the commercial laboratory isolates. RESULTS: Among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin G-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae based on meningitis breakpoint, and ampicillin- resistant Enterococcus faecium remained highly prevalent. The proportion of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium gradually increased to 29%. Ceftazidime-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae increased to 17% and 33%, respectively, and fluoroquinolone-resistant K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased to 33%, 67% and 39%, respectively. Amikacin-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased to 48%. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa increased to 51% and 26%, respectively. Higher resistance rates were observed in intensive care unit (ICU) isolates than in non-ICU isolates among the isolates from hospitals. Resistance rates were higher in hospital isolates than in clinic isolates among the isolates from commercial laboratories. CONCLUSION: Among the hospital isolates, ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae and fluoroquinolone- resistant K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., and P. aeruginosa further increased. The increase in imipenem resistance was slight in P. aeruginosa, but drastic in Acinetobacter spp. The problematic antimicrobial-organism combinations were much more prevalent among ICU isolates.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Wheat- and barley-based diets with or without additives influence broiler chicken performance, nutrient digestibility and intestinal microflora.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, there is scant literature on comparative broiler response to cereal diets high in soluble non-starch polysaccharides without or with enzyme, prebiotic, probiotic or synbiotic supplementation. In the present study, the effects of a wheat- and barley-based diet with or without supplemental xylanase plus beta-glucanase, inulin, Enterococcus faecium or inulin plus Enterococcus faecium, on bird performance, digesta viscosity, nutrient digestibility and intestinal microflora were compared to a maize-based diet. RESULTS: In comparison to a maize-based diet, the wheat- and barley-based diet reduced (P < 0.05) body weight gain and feed intake, but did not affect to the feed-to-gain ratio. Apparent digestibility of crude fat and various fatty acids were decreased (P < 0.05) as well as apparent metabolisable energy corrected to zero nitrogen retention content. There was an increase (P < 0.05) in the viscosity of jejunal digesta and in the caecal numbers of Escherichia coli and lactobacilli, and a decrease in the ileal numbers of E. coli and lactobacilli. Performance parameters and nutrient digestibility were not affected (P > 0.05) by dietary inclusion of the additives used, with the exception that exogenous enzyme improved (P < 0.05) the apparent digestibility of crude fat and decreased the viscosity of jejunal digesta. Enzyme and Enterococcus faecium supplementation increased intestinal lactic acid bacteria, whereas inulin addition reduced the number of E. coli (P < 0.05). Addition of inulin-Enterococcus faecium decreased E. coli and increased bifidobacteria numbers in the caeca. CONCLUSION: Enzyme supplementation to a wheat- and barley-based diet significantly improved the apparent digestibility of dietary fat. All four additives had a beneficial effect on the intestinal microflora of broilers.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of two essential oils.
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of essential oils in vitro for possible application to reduce the content of microorganisms in the air of animal houses. The essential oils of Cymbopogon citrarus L. and Malaleuca alternifolia L. were screened against bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and yeast Candida albicans. The minimal inhibitory concentration of the active essential oils was tested using broth dilution assay. The essential oils concentrations ranged from 0.1-50.0%. The combined effects of essential oils were tested for Malaleuca alternifolia L. and Cymbopogon citrarus L. concentrations ranged from 0.005-50.0%. The oils showed a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity. Concentrations of 0.1-0.5% of Cymbopogon citrarus L. and Malaleuca alternifolia L. reduced total microorganisms count of Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans. High antibacterial activity was also revealed for Cymbopogon citrarus L. with bactericidal concentrations of 0.8% for Escherichia coli, 5.0% for Enterococcus faecium, 5.0% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 8.0% for Staphylococcus aureus. Bactericidal concentrations of Malaleuca alternifolia L. were 5.0% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecium, and 8.0% for Staphylococcus aureus. The essential oils of Cymbopogon citrarus and Malaleuca alternifolia may be a promising alternative of air disinfection in animal houses.
TI  - Modulation of virulence and antibiotic susceptibility of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains by Enterococcus faecium probiotic strain culture fractions.
AB  - The increasing rate of antimicrobial resistance drastically reduced the efficiency of conventional antibiotics and led to the reconsideration of the interspecies interactions in influencing bacterial virulence and response to therapy. The aim of the study was the investigation of the influence of the soluble and cellular fractions of Enterococcus (E.) faecium CMGB16 probiotic culture on the virulence and antibiotic resistance markers expression in clinical enteropathogenic Escherichia (E.) coli strains. The 7 clinical enteropathogenic E. coli strains, one standard E. coli ATCC 25,922 and one Bacillus (B.) cereus strains were cultivated in nutrient broth, aerobically at 37 degrees C, for 24 h. The E. faecium CMGB16 probiotic strain was cultivated in anaerobic conditions, at 37 degrees C in MRS (Man Rogosa Sharpe) broth, and co-cultivated with two pathogenic strains (B. cereus and E. coli O28) culture fractions (supernatant, washed sediment and heat-inactivated culture) for 6 h, at 37 degrees C. After co-cultivation, the soluble and cellular fractions of the probiotic strain cultivated in the presence of two pathogenic strains were separated by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 10 min), heat-inactivated (15 min, 100 degrees C) and co-cultivated with the clinical enteropathogenic E. coli strains in McConkey broth, for 24 h, at 37 degrees C, in order to investigate the influence of the probiotic fractions on the adherence capacity and antibiotic susceptibility. All tested probiotic combinations influenced the adherence pattern of E. coli tested strains. The enteropathogenic E. coli strains susceptibility to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and quinolones was increased by all probiotic combinations and decreased for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. This study demonstrates that the plurifactorial anti-infective action of probiotics is also due to the modulation of virulence factors and antibiotic susceptibility expression in E. coli pathogenic strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  - We studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. Species studied included 3 common species of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. MICs and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria for urinary tract isolates of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria for Enterobacteriaceae. Tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by CLSI or EUCAST. Escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. A. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of MIC breakpoint. New tentative zone diameter criteria for K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, S. aureus, and E. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by CLSI and EUCAST.
TI  - Impact of medicated feed on the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria at integrated pig-fish farms in Vietnam.
AB  - Integrated livestock-fish aquaculture utilizes animal excreta, urine, and feed leftovers as pond fertilizers to enhance the growth of plankton and other microorganisms eaten by the fish. However, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria may be transferred and develop in the pond due to selective pressure from antimicrobials present in animal feed, urine, and feces. In an experimental pig-fish farm located in periurban Hanoi, Vietnam, nine piglets were provided feed containing 5 mug of tetracycline (TET)/kg pig weight/day and 0.45 mug of enrofloxacin (ENR)/kg pig weight/day during the second and fourth (last) months of the experiment. The aim of this study was to determine the association between the provision of pig feed with antimicrobials and the development of antimicrobial resistance, as measured in a total of 520 Escherichia coli and 634 Enterococcus strains isolated from pig manure and water-sediment pond samples. MIC values for nalidixic acid (NAL) and ENR showed that E. coli and Enterococcus spp. overall exhibited significant higher frequencies of resistance toward NAL and ENR during the 2 months when pigs were administered feed with antimicrobials, with frequencies reaching 60 to 80% in both water-sediment and manure samples. TET resistance for both indicators was high (>80%) throughout the study period, which indicates that TET-resistant E. coli and Enterococcus spp. were present in the piglets before the initiation of the experiment. PCR-based identification showed similar relative occurrences of Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and other Enterococcus spp. in the water-sediment and manure samples, suggesting that Enterococcus spp. isolated in the ponds originated mainly from the pig manure. The development of antimicrobial resistance in integrated animal husbandry-fish farms and possible transfers and the impact of such resistance on food safety and human health should be further assessed.
TI  - [Bacterial strains isolated from systemic infections and reported for evaluation  and antibiotic resistance surveillance by the "Dr. Victor Babes" Clinical Hospital for Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Bucharest].
AB  - AIM: Testing antibiotic resistance of bacterial strains (compulsor, reported for  EARSS surveillance) isolated from patients hospitalised for systemic infection in the "Dr. V. Babe" Hospital for Infectious and Tropical Diseases during 01.01.2005-11.11.2009, for a dynamic evaluation and for the surveillance of resistance emergence for certain classes of antibiotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial isolation: BacT/ALERT system; strain identification in classic and automated system (ATB Expression. VITEK 2C): antibioresistance: disk-difussion method (NCCLS 2005--CLSI 2009), MIC (E-Test, ATB/ Expression, VITEK 2C). Screening of ESBL-producing strains performed with double disk-difussion method (DDD). Reference strains used: S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, E. coli A TCC 25922, Enterococcus fiecalis ATCC 29212. RESULTS: During the studied period, 245 bacterial strains have been isolated, identified and tested (Staphylococcus aureus / 70, Streptococcus pneumoniae / 61, Enterococcus faecalis / 18, Enterococcus faecium / 5, Neisseria meningitidis / 18, E. coli / 73). out of 166 hemocultures and 79 cerebrospinal fluids / CSF. The average incidence of MRSA strains in systemic infections was 34.28%. 44.28% of the S. aureus strains were resistant to erythromycin, 17.14% to cyprofloxacyne, 15.71% to rifampicine, 14.49% to gentamycine. No strain resistant to vancomycine and linezolide. Streptococcus pneumoniae presented an average high resistance to penicillin G of 11.47%. and a 1.63% resistance to third generation cephalosporines. 0% resistance to vancomycine and rifampicine. 7/ 18 Enterococcus faecalis strains and 4/5 Enterococcus faecium strains presented high level resistance to gentamycine (CN 120 microg/disk) and no strain was resistant to vancomycine, teicoplanin or linezolid. The 18 Neisseria meningitidis strains were all sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones and cloramphenicol. For the 73 Escherichia coli strains, the average incidence of ESBL-producing isolates was 10.95%, the average resistance to ampicillin was 58.90%, to gentamycine--13.88% and to cyprofloxacin--20.83%. No strain resistant to carbapenemes and amikacine. CONCLUSIONS: For the systematic surveillance of antibiotic resistance there is a need for a harmonised protocol of data gathering and strain selection and the rigurous implementation of correct evaluating methods for antibiotic resistance in the microbiology laboratory. Carbapenemes. glycopeptides and oxazolidinones still present a major effectiveness in the first intention treatment of systemic infections.
TI  - [Trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in Romania. Experience of participation in EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System), 2002-2008].
AB  - EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and CSF), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecium/faecalis, Str. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae. Romania reported data to EARSS since 2002 so far. Though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for EARSS. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. This issue is related to the particular position of Romania in the European context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. Our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. During the 2002-2008 interval, Romania reported to EARSS a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 S aureus, 369 E. coli, 128 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 Enterococcus spp.. 71 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the EARSS protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. It is difficult to describe trends, specially in Enterococcus, Streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in invasive isolates is a real problem in Romanian hospitals, like in other Central, Southern and South Eastern European countries: more than 25% of S. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of Enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing on burn wound isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the antimicrobial effectiveness of a silver alginate dressing  on opportunistic pathogens, namely meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Chryseobacterium indologenes, Proteus vulgaris and Acinetobacter baumannii. METHOD: In total, 40 microorganisms were isolated from patients attending three burn centres in the US and evaluated for their susceptibility to a silver alginate wound dressing, employing a corrected zone of inhibition assay, conducted on Mueller Hinton agar (MHA). RESULTS: The sizes of the corrected zones of inhibition varied between and within genera. For example, all Acinetobacter baumannii strains were found to be sensitive to ionic silver at pH 7, with a mean of 2.8mm, compared with 3.5mm at pH 5.5. The silver alginate dressing also demonstrated activity on all strains of Enterobacter and Escherichia coli, with susceptibility to the silver alginate dressing enhanced at pH 5.5. For Enterococcus spp. the average corrected zone of inhibition at pH 7 was 3.6mm, versus 4.9mm at pH 5.5. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing. The average corrected zone of inhibition was 6.9mm at pH 7, compared with 8mm at pH 5.5. For MRSA and Staphylococcus aureus, it ranged from 4.5mm to 7.5mm at pH 7. When the pH was decreased to 5.5, the corrected zone of inhibition increased. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the activity of a silver alginate dressing on a wide range of burn isolates, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, isolated from three different burn centres in the US. It also highlights the possible importance of pH and its potential effects on antimicrobial performance and microbial susceptibility. However, more extensive testing is required to substantiate this.

TI  - Clinical course and outcomes of single-organism Enterococcus peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Enterococci are part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract. They can cause enteric peritonitis, which is a serious complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). However, the clinical course and outcome of PD-related Enterococcus peritonitis remains unclear. METHODS: We reviewed all Enterococcus peritonitis episodes occurring in our dialysis unit from 1995 to 2009. RESULTS: During the study period, 1421 episodes of peritonitis were recorded. Of 29 episodes (2.0%) that were attributable to single-organism Enterococcus, 12 episodes were caused by E. faecalis; 9, by E. faecium; and the remaining 8, by other Enterococcus species. The overall rate of ampicillin resistance was 41.4%. Recent use of antibiotics was associated with the development of ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus (ARE) peritonitis (hazard ratio: 12.53; p = 0.04). The primary response rate of Enterococcus peritonitis was significantly higher than that of Escherichia coli peritonitis (89.7% vs. 69.9%, p = 0.038), but the primary response rate was not significantly lower for ARE peritonitis than for ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus (ASE) peritonitis (83.3% vs. 94.1%, p = 0.553). However, significantly more patients with ARE had received vancomycin (83.3% vs. 23.5%, p = 0.003), with a longer mean duration of vancomycin treatment (11.8 +/- 6.9 days vs. 3.7 +/- 6.8 days, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Recent use of antibiotics was a risk factor for the development of ARE peritonitis. Outcomes in ASE and ARE peritonitis were similar, but vancomycin was required during treatment for ARE peritonitis, in turn possibly predisposing the patients to infections caused by vancomycin-resistant organisms.
TI  - Identification of a tetraene-containing product of the indanomycin biosynthetic pathway.
AB  - The indanomycin biosynthetic gene (idm) cluster was recently identified from Streptomyces antibioticus NRRL 8167. The disruption of one of these genes, idmH, and the increased production of a previously unreported metabolite in this mutant is reported. The structure of this compound was elucidated and was shown to possess a linear tetraene. This metabolite is not a logical biosynthetic intermediate of indanomycin but instead is likely an alternate product of the pathway.
TI  - Persistence and diversity of faecal coliform and enterococci populations in faecally polluted waters.
AB  - AIM: To assess the persistence and diversity of faecal bacterial populations (faecal coliforms and enterococci) that have recently been included in microbial source tracking (MST) predictive models. METHODS AND RESULTS: The analysed bacterial populations included members of the enterococci group (ENT) [Enterococcus faecium (FM), Enterococcus faecalis (FS) and Enterococcus hirae (HIR)] and the faecal coliform group (FC) [diverse Escherichia coli phenotypes (ECP) and cellobiose-negative faecal coliforms (CNFC)]. The inactivation of these distinct groups was monitored over time on-site in river by biochemical fingerprinting, and diversity indices were calculated. Among the different analysed species belonging to the ENT group, HIR persisted longer and was able to replicate in the environment at a higher rate. On the other hand, ECP and NCFC showed a similar persistence throughout the different seasons. The diversity index (Di) for FC increased substantially in the summer after 96 h to a maximum value of 0.96. On the other hand, the Di for ENT diminished over the same period to a value of 0.86, suggesting a different persistence for the different species integrating this group. CONCLUSIONS: The persistence of ECP, CNFC, FM and FS in the aquatic environment is high, particularly for the members of the FC and in the summer season. On the contrary, HIR is able to replicate in the environment at a high rate even in winter, and therefore, its inclusion in MST predictive models is discouraged. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: ECP, CNFC, FMFS and HIR have been proposed as additional variables in MST predictive models. However, the different persistence of HIR compared with the other variables should be taken into account for the development of such models.
TI  - The activity of antimicrobial peptide S-thanatin is independent on multidrug-resistant spectrum of bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the activity of S-thanatin (an analog of antimicrobial peptide derived from thanatin) against different bacterial pathogens frequently which can cause therapeutic problems was tested. The result showed minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of S-thanatin against all isolates of the Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella ornithinolytica and Klebsiella oxytoca were in the range of 4-16mug/ml, no matter which antibiotic the bacterial was resistant or susceptible, while almost all MICs to Gram-positive bacterial were >128mug/ml except Enterococcus faecium. S-thanatin was more effective toward Gram-negative strains, especially for Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The MICs of S-thanatin were no significantly different in the same species regardless of antibiotic sensitive or -resistant isolates to single or multiple antibiotic (P>0.05). Likewise, no notable difference could be observed between E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, K. ornithinolytica which were sensitive to S-thanatin (P>0.05). It was implied that the antimicrobial activity of S-thanatin was independent on multi-drug resistance spectrum of bacteria.
TI  - Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of beta-lactam antibiotic-based imidazolium- and pyridinium-type ionic liquids.
AB  - We herein report the preparation and investigation of antibacterial activity of biocidal ionic liquids (ILs) consisting of cationic imidazolium or pyridinium and an anionic beta-lactam antibiotic. The antibacterial properties were quantified by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium. In general, the ILs had improved antibacterial activity than their parent materials, whether individually or in combination. In 83% of the experiments, the ampicillin ILs (Amp-ILs) had better antibacterial activities than their quaternary halide parent materials, whereas in 92% of the experiments, Amp-ILs outperformed the commercially available sodium ampicillin salt. Amp-ILs had up to 43 times improved antibacterial activity than sodium ampicillin. Overall, when normalized for ampicillin content, ILs had greater antimicrobial activity against E. coli O157:H7, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and E. faecium than sodium ampicillin alone.
TI  - Chemical characterization and biological properties of NVC-422, a novel, stable N-chlorotaurine analog.
AB  - During oxidative burst, neutrophils selectively generate HOCl to destroy invading microbial pathogens. Excess HOCl reacts with taurine, a semi-essential amino acid, resulting in the formation of the longer-lived biogenerated broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, N-chlorotaurine (NCT). In the presence of an excess of HOCl or under moderately acidic conditions, NCT can be further chlorinated, or it can disproportionate to produce N,N-dichlorotaurine (NNDCT). In the present study, 2,2-dimethyltaurine was used to prepare a more stable N-chlorotaurine, namely, N,N-dichloro-2,2-dimethyltaurine (NVC-422). In addition, we report on the chemical characterization, in vitro antimicrobial properties, and cytotoxicity of this compound. NVC-422 was shown effectively to kill all 17 microbial strains tested, including antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. The minimum bactericidal concentration of NVC-422 against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria ranged from 0.12 to 4 mug/ml. The minimum fungicidal concentrations against Candida albicans and Candida glabrata were 32 and 16 mug/ml, respectively. NVC-422 has an in vitro cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxicity = 1,440 mug/ml) similar to that of NNDCT. Moreover, our data showed that this agent possesses rapid, pH-dependent antimicrobial activity. At pH 4, NVC-422 completely killed both Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 min at a concentration of 32 mug/ml. Finally, the effect of NVC-422 in the treatment of an E. coli-infected granulating wound rat model was evaluated. Treatment of the infected granulating wound with NVC-422 resulted in significant reduction of the bacterial tissue burden and faster wound healing compared to a saline-treated control. These findings suggest that NVC-422 could have potential application as a topical antimicrobial.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the enniatin B, produced by Fusarium tricinctum in liquid culture, and cytotoxic effects on Caco-2 cells.
AB  - The enniatins (ENs) are bioactive compounds of hexadepsipeptidic structure produced by several strains of Fusarium sp. The EN B was purified from extracts of Fusarium tricinctum growth on liquid culture of potato dextrose broth (PDB), using a semipreparative liquid chromatography (LC) followed by an analytical LC. The purity and the structure of the isolated compound were confirmed by the determination of the extinction coefficient and with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) study. The pure fraction of EN B was utilized to determine the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally pathogens of the intestinal tract: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella enterica, Shigella dysenteriae, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, and to study the cytotoxic effects on Caco-2 differentiated and undifferentiated cells. The results obtained demonstrated that in several antibiograms, EN B induced the inhibition of the grown microorganisms tested and no significant differences over control were detected when Caco-2 cells were exposed to EN B, at any of the concentrations used.
TI  - Spectrum of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias after liver transplantation: implications for management.
AB  - Bacteremia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. The characterization of the microbiological spectrum of bacteremia after liver transplantation may help physicians in choosing the initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients presenting with sepsis. The clinical and microbiology records of patients who received liver transplantation from January 1997 to March 2006 were reviewed. One hundred twenty-three of the 737 liver recipients (16.7%) developed bacteremia during the median follow-up period of 5.8 years (interquartile range = 2.5-8.8 years); 92 patients (12.5%) had gram-positive bacteremia (GPB), whereas 47 (6.4%) had gram-negative bacteremia (GNB). Nosocomial bacteremia was significantly more frequent among patients with early-onset GPB or GNB versus patients with late-onset GPB (66.7% versus 23.7%, P < 0.001) or GNB (70.6% versus 20.0%, P = 0.001). Peritonitis (33.3% versus 7.9%, P = 0.004) and wound infections (13.0% versus 0%, P = 0.04) as sources were more common in patients with early-onset GPB versus patients with late-onset GPB. Likewise, peritonitis was a more common source of early-onset GNB than late-onset GNB (41.2% versus 6.7%, P = 0.007). Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset GPB, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus species were most common in patients with late-onset GPB. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobes were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset GNB, whereas Escherichia coli was most common in patients with late-onset GNB. In conclusion, the microbiological spectra of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias differ, and this should be considered by those determining the initial empirical treatment of liver transplant recipients suspected to have bacteremias.
TI  - Effect of calcium and magnesium on the antimicrobial action of enterocin LR/6 produced by Enterococcus faecium LR/6.
AB  - Enterococci are well-known producers of antimicrobial peptides (enterocins) that  possess potential as biopreservatives in food. In this study, divalent cations and release of intracellular potassium were used to assess the mechanism of interaction and killing of enterocin LR/6 produced by Enterococcus faecium LR/6 on three target Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, namely Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus sp. strain LR/3 and Escherichia coli K-12. Whilst treatment with enterocin LR/6 in all cases led to a significant loss of viability, suggesting a bactericidal mode of action, E. coli K-12 showed better tolerance than the other two strains. Bacteriocins have generally been reported to create pores in the membrane of sensitive cells and this function is diminished by divalent cations. In this study it was shown that Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) markedly improved the viability of enterocin LR/6-treated cells in a concentration-dependent manner. K(+) release as a sign of membrane leakiness was higher in M. luteus compared with the other two test strains. In agreement with the viability response, pre-exposure to Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) substantially reduced the amount of K(+) leakage by M. luteus and Enterococcus sp.; in the case of E. coli K-12, no leakage of K(+) was recorded. These results suggest that enterocin LR/6, which possesses good antibacterial potential, may not be very effective as a preservative in foods containing high concentrations of calcium and magnesium.
TI  - Influence of weaning on fecal shedding of pathogenic bacteria in dairy calves.
AB  - The objectives of the current research were to determine the effect of weaning on fecal shedding of Salmonella and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in dairy calves and to examine cultured isolates (to include Enterococcus) for antimicrobial susceptibility. This research was conducted on one large commercial dairy (>3000 head) in the southwestern United States. Two collections were made, during the winter (January 2009) and summer (July 2009) seasons. For the winter collection, two groups of calves were sampled (group 1: n = 18 pens, 69 head, approximately 12 weeks of age; group 2: n = 19 pens, 75 head, approximately 10 weeks of age). Fecal samples were collected from all calves via rectal palpation 2 days pre- and again 2 days postweaning. For the summer collection, one group of calves housed in 40 pens were utilized and 79 and 76 calves sampled 7 days pre- and 5 days postweaning, respectively. Fecal samples were collected into sterile palpation sleeves, placed on ice, and shipped to our laboratory for bacterial culture of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, and Enterococcus. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined on select isolates. No differences (p > 0.10) in prevalence of Salmonella or E. coli O157:H7 were observed due to weaning in the winter collection. In the summer collection, more (p < 0.01) fecal samples were Salmonella positive preweaning (15.2%) as compared to postweaning (2.6%). No differences were observed for antimicrobial susceptibility in isolates collected pre- as compared to postweaning in either winter or summer collections, with the exception that multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates preweaning were resistant to six antibiotics compared to seven or eight antibiotics postweaning (summer collection). Results of the current research indicate that the weaning of dairy calves does not increase the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria or substantially modify antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of these bacteria.
TI  - Short term urinary catheterized patients in intensive care unit (ICU)--a need to  screen.
AB  - Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) is the second most commonly reported healthcare associated infection, accounting for upto 40% of all nosocomial infections. Silent catheter associated bacteriuria comprises a huge reservoir of resistant organism in hospitals particularly in critical care units. We prospectively studied 100 newly short-term catheterized patients in a tertiary care hospital. Samples collected on day three and daily thereafter for semi quantitative urine culture and pus cell count. Antibiotic sensitivity was tested using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Out of hundred patients, 32 showed growth on fifth day and remaining 68 samples were culture negative up to seventh day. None of the culture positive samples had pus cells. Escherichia coli (35%) was the predominant isolate followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Candida spp (15% each) and Coagulase negative Staphylococcus (5%). Among the Gram negative organisms, four strains of Escherichia coli and two strains of Klebsiella pneumonia were Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamases (ESBL) producers and 33.3% were Multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Multidrug resistant pathogens in an asymptomatic short-term catheterized patient are a major reservoir in hospitals. This emphasizes the importance of periodic surveillance for nosocomial infections in hospital and the periodic screening will also help us to frame antibiotic policy in a new tertiary care hospital.
TI  - [Causative agents of intravenous catheter-related infections and their antibiotic susceptibilities].
AB  - Intravenous catheterization can lead to colonization as well as a broad spectrum  of infections ranging from catheter site infections to catheter-related blood stream infections (CRBSIs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of causative agents and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in CRBSIs and catheter site infections along with the colonization rates and colonizing microorganisms in Zonguldak Karaelmas University Hospital, Turkey. The results of cultures from catheter tips and/or intracatheter blood cultures and simultaneously taken peripheral blood cultures were sent to medical microbiology laboratory and were retrospectively investigated for 201 patients hospitalized between September 2007 and September 2009. The catheter tips were cultured by semi-quantitative and quantitative culture methods. Blood cultures from the catheters and peripheral veins were performed in BACTEC 9120 (Becton Dickinson, USA) blood culture systems. The antibiotic susceptibility tests were done by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Out of 201 patients included, 28 (13.9%) had CRBSIs and 13 (6.4%) had catheter site infections while colonization was defined for 55 (27.3%) patients. Of 28 patients with CRBSIs, Acinetobacter spp. were isolated from 11 including five carbapenem-resistant strains, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCNS) from eight, methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (MSCNS) from two, Klebsiella pneumoniae from two patients and one of each patient's cultures yielded methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli and MRCNS + Enterococcus faecium. Of 13 patients with catheter site infections, five MSCNS, two methicillin-susceptible S.aureus (MSSA), two E.coli, and one of each K.pneumoniae, MRCNS, Enterococcus spp., K.pneumoniae + P.aeruginosa were isolated. No resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin were detected among the staphylococci isolated from CRBSIs and catheter site infections. The distribution of the 55 colonizing microorganisms were as follows; 18 MSCNS, 18 MRCNS, four Acinetobacter spp., five K.pneumoniae, three E.coli, two MSSA, and one of each MRSA, P.mirabilis, P.aeruginosa, Corynebacterium spp., Candida albicans. In this study, the predominant microorganism isolated from CRBSIs was Acinetobacter spp., followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci. This unexpected distribution of the agents was related to the Acinetobacter spp. that have gained endemic potential following an Acinetobacter outbreak in our hospital in 2006. We emphasize that it is critical for any individual hospital to assess periodically the distribution and susceptibility profiles of isolates obtained from catheter-related infections to set out rational empirical treatment strategies.
TI  - Development of a DNA microarray for enterococcal species, virulence, and antibiotic resistance gene determinations among isolates from poultry.
AB  - A DNA microarray (Enteroarray) was designed with probes targeting four species-specific taxonomic identifiers to discriminate among 18 different enterococcal species, while other probes were designed to identify 18 virulence factors and 174 antibiotic resistance genes. In total, 262 genes were utilized for rapid species identification of enterococcal isolates, while characterizing their virulence potential through the simultaneous identification of endogenous antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Enterococcal isolates from broiler chicken farms were initially identified by using the API 20 Strep system, and the results were compared to those obtained with the taxonomic genes atpA, recA, pheS, and ddl represented on our microarray. Among the 171 isolates studied, five different enterococcal species were identified by using the API 20 Strep system: Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, E. durans, E. gallinarum, and E. avium. The Enteroarray detected the same species as API 20 Strep, as well as two more: E. casseliflavus and E. hirae. Species comparisons resulted in 15% (27 isolates) disagreement between the two methods among the five API 20 Strep identifiable species and 24% (42 isolates) disagreement when considering the seven Enteroarray identified species. The species specificity of key antibiotic and virulence genes identified by the Enteroarray were consistent with the literature adding further robustness to the redundant taxonomic probe data. Sequencing of the cpn60 gene further confirmed the complete accuracy of the microarray results. The new Enteroarray should prove to be a useful tool to accurately genotype strains of enterococci and assess their virulence potential.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae including metallo-beta-lactamase producers are predominant pathogens of healthcare-associated infections in an Indian teaching hospital.
AB  - PURPOSE: A study was carried out in an Indian teaching hospital in 2009 to detect the rate of surgical site infections (SSI) and peripheral vascular access site infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a point-prevalence study involving over 300 patients. The presence of infection was determined according to the CDC criteria. Swabs were taken from the infected sites and identification and sensitivity were carried out using VITEK(R) 2 automated system. Characterisation of beta-lactamase was carried out at ARRML, Colindale, London. RESULTS: The rate of SSI was 15% for the clean and clean-contaminated categories while that for the dirty contaminated category was 85% (NNIS risk index 0). Cultures yielded definite or probable pathogens from 64% (9/14) of the patients with SSI. In 1/3 rd of the cultures, Staphylococcus aureus was grown and the rest had Enterobacteriaceae, either extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers or Amp-C hyperproducers and, alarmingly, three isolates were positive for newly recognised New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1). In medicine, 87% (n = 99) of the patients had a peripheral IV access device, 55% developed associated phlebitis/infection and, in seven, probable pathogens were isolated (Candida species and Escherichia coli producing ESBL and NDM-1, respectively, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium). All ESBL and metallo-beta-lactamase producers were resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobials, the latter being sensitive only to colistin and tigecycline. The study also found that all post-operative patients were on antibiotics, 92% on IV [213 defined daily doses (DDD)/100 post-op patients] limited mainly to the third-generation cephalosporins (26%) and aminoglycosides (24%) and imidazole derivatives (30%). In medicine, 83% (n = 82) were on IV antibiotics (123 DDD/100 bed-days), limited mainly to the third-generation cephalosporins (74%). CONCLUSION: Indiscriminate use of antibiotics is a major problem predisposing patients to harm by multi-resistant pathogens. Carbapenems were in little use in this hospital, but the selection pressure exerted by cephalosporins and other unrelated classes was sufficient to select NDM-1-producing strains due to co-selection, suggesting a role of single plasmid carrying resistance genes to multiple classes.
TI  - Prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. Of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. The aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in Osogbo, Nigeria. The study was conducted between January and June 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in Osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. Appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of Enterococcus species at the Bacteriology Laboratory of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Osogbo using standard microbiological methods. There were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (HAI); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. Enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. Two species of Enterococcus were identified; Enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection (UTI) and surgical site infection (SSI) of 6 (85.7%) patients and Enterococcus faecium from UTI in 1 (14.3%) patient. Other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were Klebsiella spp 31.0%, Pseudomonas spp 20.7%, Staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, Escherichia coli 12.1%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and Serratia spp 1.7%. All the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) with the VRE strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. Other Gram-positive and Gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except E. coli and Pseudomonas spp which were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. This limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. There is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.
TI  - Intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides in Enterococcus faecium is conferred by the 16S rRNA m5C1404-specific methyltransferase EfmM.
AB  - Aminoglycosides are ribosome-targeting antibiotics and a major drug group of choice in the treatment of serious enterococcal infections. Here we show that aminoglycoside resistance in Enterococcus faecium strain CIP 54-32 is conferred by the chromosomal gene efmM, encoding the E. faecium methyltransferase, as well as by the previously characterized aac(6')-Ii that encodes a 6'-N-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase. Inactivation of efmM in E. faecium increases susceptibility to the aminoglycosides kanamycin and tobramycin, and, conversely, expression of a recombinant version of efmM in Escherichia coli confers resistance to these drugs. The EfmM protein shows significant sequence similarity to E. coli RsmF (previously called YebU), which is a 5-methylcytidine (m(5)C) methyltransferase modifying 16S rRNA nucleotide C1407. The target for EfmM is shown by mass spectrometry to be a neighboring 16S rRNA nucleotide at C1404. EfmM uses the methyl group donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine to catalyze formation of m(5)C1404 on the 30S ribosomal subunit, whereas naked 16S rRNA and the 70S ribosome are not substrates. Addition of the 5-methyl to C1404 sterically hinders aminoglycoside binding. Crystallographic structure determination of EfmM at 2.28 A resolution reveals an N-terminal domain connected to a central methyltransferase domain that is linked by a flexible lysine-rich region to two C-terminal subdomains. Mutagenesis of the methyltransferase domain established that two cysteines at specific tertiary locations are required for catalysis. The tertiary structure of EfmM is highly similar to that of RsmF, consistent with m(5)C formation at adjacent sites on the 30S subunit, while distinctive structural features account for the enzymes' respective specificities for nucleotides C1404 and C1407.
TI  - Metallic copper corrosion rates, moisture content, and growth medium influence survival of copper ion-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The rapid killing of various bacteria in contact with metallic copper is thought  to be influenced by the influx of copper ions into the cells, but the exact mechanism is not fully understood. This study showed that the kinetics of contact killing of copper surfaces depended greatly on the amount of moisture present, copper content of alloys, type of medium used, and type of bacteria. We examined antibiotic- and copper ion-resistant strains of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium isolated from pig farms following the use of copper sulfate as feed supplement. The results showed rapid killing of both copper ion-resistant E. coli and E. faecium strains when samples in rich medium were spread in a thin, moist layer on copper alloys with 85% or greater copper content. E. coli strains were rapidly killed under dry conditions, while E. faecium strains were less affected. Electroplated copper surface corrosion rates were determined from electrochemical polarization tests using the Stern-Geary method and revealed decreased corrosion rates with benzotriazole and thermal oxide coating. Copper ion-resistant E. coli and E. faecium cells suspended in 0.8% NaCl showed prolonged survival rates on electroplated copper surfaces with benzotriazole coating and thermal oxide coating compared to surfaces without anti-corrosion treatment. Control of surface corrosion affected the level of copper ion influx into bacterial cells, which contributed directly to bacterial killing.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in Swiss laying hens, prevalence and risk factors.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging concern to public health, and food-producing animals are known to be a potential source for transmission of resistant bacteria to humans. As legislation of the European Union requires to ban conventional cages for the housing of laying hens on the one hand, and a high food safety standard for eggs on the other hand, further investigations about the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in alternative housing types are required. In this study, we determined antimicrobial resistance in indicator bacteria from 396 cloacal swabs from 99 Swiss laying hen farms among four alternative housing types during a cross-sectional study. On each farm, four hens were sampled and exposure to potential risk factors was identified with a questionnaire. The minimal inhibitory concentration was determined using broth microdilution in Escherichia coli (n=371) for 18 antimicrobials and in Enterococcus faecalis (n=138) and Enterococcus faecium (n=153) for 16 antimicrobials. All antimicrobial classes recommended by the European Food Safety Authority for E. coli and enterococci were included in the resistance profile. Sixty per cent of the E. coli isolates were susceptible to all of the considered antimicrobials and 30% were resistant to at least two antimicrobials. In E. faecalis, 33% of the strains were susceptible to all tested antimicrobials and 40% were resistant to two or more antimicrobials, whereas in E. faecium these figures were 14% and 39% respectively. Risk factor analyses were carried out for bacteria species and antimicrobials with a prevalence of resistance between 15% and 85%. In these analyses, none of the considered housing and management factors showed a consistent association with the prevalence of resistance for more than two combinations of bacteria and antimicrobial. Therefore we conclude that the impact of the considered housing and management practices on the egg producing farms on resistance in laying hens is low.
TI  - Txe, an endoribonuclease of the enterococcal Axe-Txe toxin-antitoxin system, cleaves mRNA and inhibits protein synthesis.
AB  - The axe-txe operon encodes a toxin-antitoxin (TA) pair, Axe-Txe, that was initially identified on the multidrug-resistance plasmid pRUM in Enterococcus faecium. In Escherichia coli, expression of the Txe toxin is known to inhibit cell growth, and co-expression of the antitoxin, Axe, counteracts the toxic effect of Txe. Here, we report the nucleotide sequence of pS177, a 39&emsp14;kb multidrug-resistant plasmid isolated from vancomycin-resistant Ent. faecium, which harbours the axe-txe operon and the vanA gene cluster. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the axe-txe transcript is produced by strain S177 as well as by other vancomycin-resistant enteroccoci. Moreover, we determine the mechanism by which the Txe protein exerts its toxic activity. Txe inhibits protein synthesis in E. coli without affecting DNA or RNA synthesis, and inhibits protein synthesis in a cell-free system. Using in vivo primer extension analysis, we demonstrate that Txe preferentially cleaves single-stranded mRNA at the first base after an AUG start codon. We conclude that Txe is an endoribonuclease which cleaves mRNA and inhibits protein synthesis.
TI  - Investigation of human sewage pollution and pathogen analysis at Florida Gulf coast beaches.
AB  - AIMS: Water quality at two Florida beaches was compared using faecal indicator bacteria measurements, microbial source tracking (MST) methods for detecting human source pollution and the assessment of pathogen presence. These values were also compared before and after remediation of wastewater infrastructure at one beach. METHODS AND RESULTS: Faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci were enumerated in estuarine water and sediment samples. PCR assays for the human-associated esp gene of Enterococcus faecium and human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) were used to detect human sewage. Culturable Salmonella and enteric viruses were also analysed. MST identified human sewage contamination at one beach, leading to repair of a sewer main and relocation of portable restrooms. Exceedances of Florida recreational water regulatory standards were significantly reduced after remediation (by 52% for faecal coliforms and 39% for enterococci), and the frequency of detection of MST markers decreased. Coxsackie virus B4 and HPyVs were codetected following a major sewage spill, but Salmonella was not detected during the study. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that infrastructure remediation significantly reduced pollution from human sewage at the impacted beach. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A comprehensive microbial water quality study that can identify contamination sources through the use of MST markers and close collaboration with local/and state agencies can result in tangible actions to improve recreational water quality and safety.
TI  - Medical-grade honey enriched with antimicrobial peptides has enhanced activity against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  - Honey has potent activity against both antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant bacteria, and is an interesting agent for topical antimicrobial application to wounds. As honey is diluted by wound exudate, rapid bactericidal activity up to high dilution is a prerequisite for its successful application. We investigated the kinetics of the killing of antibiotic-resistant bacteria by RS honey, the source for the production of Revamil(R) medical-grade honey, and we aimed to enhance the rapid bactericidal activity of RS honey by enrichment with its endogenous compounds or the addition of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). RS honey killed antibiotic-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, and Burkholderia cepacia within 2 h, but lacked such rapid activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli. It was not feasible to enhance the rapid activity of RS honey by enrichment with endogenous compounds, but RS honey enriched with 75 muM of the synthetic peptide Bactericidal Peptide 2 (BP2) showed rapid bactericidal activity against all species tested, including MRSA and ESBL E. coli, at up to 10-20-fold dilution. RS honey enriched with BP2 rapidly killed all bacteria tested and had a broader spectrum of bactericidal activity than either BP2 or honey alone.
TI  - Effects of Enterococcus faecium supplementation and floor type on performance, morphology of erythrocytes and intestinal microbiota in broiler chickens.
AB  - 1. The experiment was to study the effects of floor type and probiotic supplementation (Enterococcus faecium) on performance, morphology of erythrocytes and intestinal microbiota of male Ross 308 broiler chickens. 2. The experimental design was a factorial 2 x 2 with 6 replicates. The factors were floor type (wire floor versus wood shaving litter) and the presence or absence of probiotic. 3. Birds housed on wood shavings exhibited significantly improved weight gain and food intake. 4. Addition of E. faecium led to significantly decreased food intake and gizzard weight. Supplementation with E. faecium positively influenced the ileal and caecal microbiota, with a significant decrease in the population of Escherichia coli. 5. Erythrocyte length decreased and erythrocyte width increased in the birds housed on wood shavings.
TI  - [Inhibition of herpes simplex virus type 1 reproduction by probiotic bacteria in  vitro].
AB  - Light and immunofluorescence microscopies were used to study the cytopathic effect of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) grown on the Vero cell cultures in the absence or presence of supernatants of Enterococcus faecium L3, Lactobacillus plantarum 8A-P3, and Escherichia coil M17. The effect of the probiotic strains was evaluated estimating the proportion of changed cells and the infective dose of the virus. The supernatants of the cultures of Lactobacillus sp. and Enterococcus sp., unlike those of E. coil, have antiviral activity. Inhibited viral replication was more evident when the supernatants were added until the cultured HSV-1 cells were infective. An enterococcal supernatant and its obtained peptide extract showed the maximum antiviral activity. This strain may be associated with the production of bacteriocins and bacteriocin-like substances.
TI  - Increase of ceftazidime- and fluoroquinolone-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and  imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. in Korea: analysis of KONSAR study data from 2005 and 2007.
AB  - PURPOSE: Antimicrobial resistance monitoring could be a useful source of information for treating and controlling nosocomial infections. We analyzed antimicrobial resistance data generated by Korean Hospitals and by a commercial laboratory in 2005 and 2007. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Susceptibility data for 2005 and 2007 were collected from 37 and 41 hospitals, respectively, and from one commercial laboratory. Intermediate susceptibility was not included in the calculation of resistance rates. RESULTS: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (64%), third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli (27%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33%), and Acinetobacter spp. (48%), and amikacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (19%) and Acinetobacter spp. (37%) were prevalent in hospitals in 2007. A gradual increase of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. was observed. Higher incidences of thirdgeneration cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae and imipenemresistant P. aeruginosa were found in the commercial laboratory than in the hospitals. CONCLUSION: Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, third-generation cephalosporin- resistant K. pneumoniae, and fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. remain prevalent in Korea, while the incidence of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. has increased gradually. The higher prevalences of third-generation cephalosporinresistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa in the commercial laboratory are a new concern.
TI  - Evaluation of the DiversiLab system for detection of hospital outbreaks of infections by different bacterial species.
AB  - Many bacterial typing methods are specific for one species only, time-consuming,  or poorly reproducible. DiversiLab (DL; bioMerieux) potentially overcomes these limitations. In this study, we evaluated the DL system for the identification of hospital outbreaks of a number bacterial species. Appropriately typed clinical isolates were tested with DL. DL typing agreed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for Acinetobacter (n = 26) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 13) isolates. With two exceptions, DL typing of Klebsiella isolates (n = 23) also correlated with PFGE, and in addition, PFGE-nontypeable (PFGE-NT) isolates could be typed. Enterobacter (n = 28) results also correlated with PFGE results; also, PFGE-NT isolates could be clustered. In a larger study (n = 270), a cluster of 30 isolates was observed that could be subdivided by PFGE. The results for Escherichia coli (n = 38) correlated less well with an experimental multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) scheme. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 52) showed only a limited number of amplification products for most isolates. When multiple Pseudomonas isolates were assigned to a single type in DL, all except one showed multiple multilocus sequence types. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus generally also showed a limited number of amplification products. Isolates that belonged to different outbreaks by other typing methods, including PFGE, spa typing, and MLVA, were grouped together in a number of cases. For Enterococcus faecium, the limited variability of the amplification products obtained made interpretation difficult and correlation with MLVA and esp gene typing was poor. All of the results are reflected in Simpson's index of diversity and adjusted Rand's and Wallace's coefficients. DL is a useful tool to help identify hospital outbreaks of Acinetobacter spp., S. maltophilia, the Enterobacter cloacae complex, Klebsiella spp., and, to a somewhat lesser extent, E. coli. In our study, DL was inadequate for P. aeruginosa, E. faecium, and MRSA. However, it should be noted that for the identification of outbreaks, epidemiological data should be combined with typing results.
TI  - Superhydrophilicity and antibacterial property of a Cu-dotted oxide coating surface.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aluminum-made settings are widely used in healthcare, schools, public facilities and transit systems. Frequently-touched surfaces of those settings are likely to harbour bacteria and be a potential source of infection. One method to utilize the effectiveness of copper (Cu) in eliminating pathogens for these surfaces would be to coat the aluminum (Al) items with a Cu coating. However, such a combination of Cu and Al metals is susceptible to galvanic corrosion because of their different electrochemical potentials. METHODS: In this work, a new approach was proposed in which electrolytic plasma oxidation (EPO) of Al was used to form an oxide surface layer followed by electroplating of Cu metal on the top of the oxide layer. The oxide was designed to function as a corrosion protective and biocompatible layer, and the Cu in the form of dots was utilized as an antibacterial material. The antibacterial property enhanced by superhydrophilicity of the Cu-dotted oxide coating was evaluated. RESULTS: A superhydrophilic surface was successfully prepared using electrolytic plasma oxidation of aluminum (Al) followed by electroplating of copper (Cu) in a Cu-dotted form. Both Cu plate and Cu-dotted oxide surfaces had excellent antimicrobial activities against E. coli ATCC 25922, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ATCC 43300 and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) ATCC 51299. However, its Cu-dotted surface morphology allowed the Cu-dotted oxide surface to be more antibacterial than the smooth Cu plate surface. The enhanced antibacterial property was attributed to the superhydrophilic behaviour of the Cu-dotted oxide surface that allowed the bacteria to have a more effective killing contact with Cu due to spreading of the bacterial suspension media. CONCLUSION: The superhydrophilic Cu-dotted oxide coating surface provided an effective method of controlling bacterial growth and survival on contact surfaces and thus reduces the risk of infection and spread of bacteria-related diseases particularly in moist or wet environments.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  - Non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. The purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. Overall, Gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than Gram-positive bacteria. For the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia and Escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. The susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. Streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. Staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the Sa 78 and ATCC 6538 strains, respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. Non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. Biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. Bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. A rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with P. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strain Sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. A 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. A 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated P. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. A statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated animals after the third day of the course. Wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. Overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of fecal indicators in municipal wastewater treatment plant.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance of fecal coliforms (n = 153) and enterococci (n = 199) isolates was investigated in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) based on activated sludge system. The number of fecal indicators (in influent and effluent as well as in the aeration chamber and in return activated sludge mixture) was determined using selective media. Susceptibility of selected strains was tested against 19 (aminoglycosides, aztreonam, carbapenems, cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, penicillines, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and 17 (high-level aminoglycosides, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, linezolid, lincosamides, nitrofuration, streptogramins, tetracycline) antimicrobial agents respectively. Among enterococci the predominant species were Enterococcus faecium (60.8%) and Enterococcus faecalis (22.1%), while remaining isolates belonged to Enterococcus hirae (12.1%), Enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum (4.5%), and Enterococcus durans (0.5%). Resistance to nitrofuration and erythromycin was common among enterococci (53% and 44%, respectively), and followed by resistance to ciprofloxacin (29%) and tetracycline (20%). The resistance phenotypes related to glycopeptides (up to 3.2%) and high-level aminoglycosides (up to 5.4%) were also observed. Most frequently, among Escherichia coli isolates the resistance patterns were found for ampicillin (34%), piperacillin (24%) and tetracycline (23%). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli was detected once, in the aeration chamber. In the study the applied wastewater treatment processes considerably reduced the number of fecal indicators. Nevertheless their number in the WWTP effluent was higher than 10(4) CFU per 100 ml and periodically contained 90% of bacteria with antimicrobial resistance patterns. The positive selection of isolates with antimicrobial resistance patterns was observed during the treatment processes. Substantial concern should be paid to the isolates resistant to 3 or more chemical classes of antimicrobials (MAR). In treated wastewater MAR E. coli and MAR enterococci constituted respectively 9% and 29% of tested isolates.
TI  - Effect of IPTG amount on apo- and holo- forms of glycerophosphate oxidase expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli has proved to be a successful host for the expression of many heterologous proteins, and much efforts have been made toward improving recombinant protein expression including the usage of strong promoters and co-expression with chaperones. But little attention was paid on the relation between expression level and function of the target protein. Glycerophosphate oxidase (GPO) is a protein with FAD cofactor (without free cysteine and disulfide bonds).It was observed that the specific activity of GPO dramatically decreased with the increase of inducer IPTG. In addition, the stability of it decreased correspondingly. The structural difference of samples expressed under varying IPTG was investigated using size-exclusion and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, together with CD spectrum. It was found that the conformation of peptide and organization of subunits were not affected. The loss of specific activity and stability were correlated to incomplete attachment of FAD onto GPO. These results revealed that synthesis speed should be controlled either by reduction of IPTG amount or using weak promoters in the production of GPO.
TI  - Highlighting new phylogenetic specificities of Crohn's disease microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) microbes play a part in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 16 healthy individuals and 16 CD patients (age- and sex-matched). The DNA extracted from these samples were subjected to two different methods of microbiome analysis. Specific bacterial groups were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods using primers designed using a high-throughput in-house bioinformatics pipeline. The same DNA extracts were also used to produce fluorescently labeled cRNA amplicons to interrogate a custom-designed phylogenetic microarray for intestinal bacteria. RESULTS: Even though the intersubject variability was high, differences in the fecal microbiomes of healthy and CD patients were detected. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Escherichia coli were more represented in healthy and ileal CD patients, respectively. Additionally, probes specific for Ruminococcus bromii, Oscillibacter valericigenes, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Eubacterium rectale produced stronger hybridization signals with the DNA samples from healthy subjects. Conversely, species overrepresented in CD patients were E. coli, Enterococcus faecium, and species from the Proteobacteria not normally found in the healthy human GI tract. Furthermore, we detected "healthy specific" molecular species or operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that are not closely related to any known species (Faecalibacterium, Subdoligranulum, and Oscillospora species), indicating that the phylogenetic dysbiosis is broader than at strain or species level. CONCLUSIONS: These two techniques of microbiome analysis provided a statistically robust new picture of the dysbiosis in fecal microbiota from ileal CD patients. Specifically, we identified a set of six species discriminant for CD, which provides a preliminary diagnostic tool.

TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - Molecular characterization of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci and Escherichia coli isolates from European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus).
AB  - A total of 44 Escherichia coli and 64 enterococci recovered from 77 intestinal samples of wild European rabbits in Portugal were analyzed for resistance to antimicrobial agents. Resistance in E. coli isolates was observed for ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, streptomycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol. None of the E. coli isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The bla(TEM), aadA, aac(3)-II, tet(A) and/or tet(B), and the catA genes were demonstrated in all ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol-resistant isolates respectively, and the sul1 and/or sul2 and/or sul3 genes in 4 of 5 sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim resistant isolates. Of the enterococcal isolates, Enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent detected species (39 isolates), followed by E. faecium (21 isolates) and E. hirae (4 isolates). More than one-fourth (29.7%) of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline; 20.3% were resistant to erythromycin, 14.1% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 10.9% were resistant to high-level-kanamycin. Lower level of resistance (<10%) was detected for ampicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin and high-level-gentamicin, -streptomycin. No vancomycin-resistance was detected in the enterococci isolates. Resistance genes detected included aac(6')-aph(2''), ant(6)-Ia, tet(M) and/or tet(L) in all gentamicin, streptomycin and tetracycline-resistant isolates respectively. The aph(3')-IIIa gene was detected in 6 of 7 kanamycin-resistant isolates, the erm(B) gene in 11 of 13 erythromycin-resistant isolates and the vat(D) gene in the quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant E. faecium isolate. This survey showed that faecal bacteria such as E. coli and enterococci of wild rabbits could be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in faecal bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp.) in feral pigeons.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the presence of antibiotic-resistant faecal Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. in feral pigeons (Columba livia forma domestica) in the Czech Republic. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cloacal swabs of feral pigeons collected in the city of Brno in 2006 were cultivated for antibiotic-resistant E. coli. Resistance genes, class 1 and 2 integrons, and gene cassettes were detected in resistant isolates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The samples were also cultivated for enterococci. Species status of enterococci isolates was determined using repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR. Resistance genes were detected in resistant enterococci by PCR. E. coli isolates were found in 203 of 247 pigeon samples. Antibiotic resistance was recorded in three (1.5%, n(E. coli) =203) isolates. Using agar containing ciprofloxacin, 12 (5%, n(samples) =247) E. coli strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were isolated. No ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were detected. A total of 143 enterococci were isolated: Ent. faecalis (36 isolates), Ent. faecium (27), Ent. durans (19), Ent. hirae (17), Ent. mundtii (17), Ent. gallinarum (12), Ent. casseliflavus (12) and Ent. columbae (3). Resistance to one to four antibiotics was detected in 45 (31%) isolates. Resistances were determined by tetK, tetL, tetM, tetO, aac(6')aph(2''), ant(4')-Ia, aph(3')-IIIa, ermB, pbp5, vanA and vanC1 genes. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic-resistant E. coli and Enterococcus spp. occurred in feral pigeons in various prevalences. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Feral pigeon should be considered a risk species for spreading in the environment antimicrobial resistant E. coli and enterococci.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  - Human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. We determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hBD-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. The native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hBD-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hBD-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. Characteristically, A. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (MDR) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hBD-2 (vLD(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-MDR (wild-type) A. baumannii strains (vLD(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). Bactericidal activity of hBD-2 was less pronounced against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. These observations give indications that the natural hBD-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting MDR phenotypes.
TI  - The influence of some probiotic supernatants on the growth and virulence features expression of several selected enteroaggregative E. coli clinical strains.
AB  - The purpose of this study was the assessment of the influence of three probiotic  supernatants (Bifidobacterium breve ATCC 15700, Enterococcus faecium ATCC 19434, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei ATCC 393) on the growth (quantified by viable cell counts) and virulence features expression (adherence ability to HEp-2 cells and inert substratum- slime test) of several selected EAggEC diarrhoeagenic strains as well as the cytotoxicity of the respective supernatants on HEp-2 cells. RESULTS: Our in vitro studies are demonstrating that the selected supernatants, when added simultaneously with the bacterial culture are generally opposing to the adherence to the cellular substratum by the EAggEC strains. When added after the pre-adherence period, the supernatants did not change the adherence indexes of the EAggEC strains, but induced slight changes in the adherence pattern, reducing the frequency and size of bacterial aggregates. Only in few cases, the bacterial growth rate was slightly increased or sustained by the probiotic supernatants, a possible explanation being that we used supernatants obtained from 24 hrs fresh cultures, which are probably still containing some nutrients and probably also other growth factors. CONCLUSION: Our results are demonstrating that soluble probiotic metabolites accumulated in culture supernatants may interfere with the first step of adherence and colonization of the cellular and inert substrata by EAggEC strains, probablyby the cross-talk between probiotic soluble molecules and quorum-sensing mediators of opportunistic strains; so, direct contact between the probiotic and pathogenic bacteria are not always necessary for the occurrence of a protective effect, that could be partly mediated by the soluble molecules secreted by specific probiotic strains.
TI  - Dramatic increase of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in German intensive care units: secular trends in antibiotic drug use and bacterial resistance, 2001 to 2008.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the present study was to analyse secular trends in antibiotic consumption and resistance data from a network of 53 intensive care units (ICUs). METHODS: The study involved prospective unit and laboratory-based surveillance in 53 German ICUs from 2001 through 2008. Data were calculated on the basis of proportions of nonduplicate resistant isolates, resistance densities (that is, the number of resistant isolates of a species per 1,000 patient-days) and an antimicrobial usage density (AD) expressed as daily defined doses (DDD) and normalised per 1,000 patient-days. RESULTS: Total mean antibiotic use remained stable over time and amounted to 1,172 DDD/1,000 patient-days (range 531 to 2,471). Carbapenem use almost doubled to an AD of 151 in 2008. Significant increases were also calculated for quinolone (AD of 163 in 2008) and third-generation and fourth-generation cephalosporin use (AD of 117 in 2008). Aminoglycoside consumption decreased substantially (AD of 86 in 2001 and 24 in 2008). Resistance proportions were as follows in 2001 and 2008, respectively: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 26% and 20% (P = 0.006; trend test showed a significant decrease), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) faecium 2.3% and 8.2% (P = 0.008), third-generation cephalosporin (3GC)-resistant Escherichia. coli 1.2% and 19.7% (P < 0.001), 3GC-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae 3.8% and 25.5% (P < 0.001), imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii 1.1% and 4.5% (P = 0.002), and imipenem-resistant K. pneumoniae 0.4% and 1.1%. The resistance densities did not change for MRSA but increased significantly for VRE faecium and 3GC-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae. In 2008, the resistance density for MRSA was 3.73, 0.48 for VRE, 1.39 for 3GC-resistant E. coli and 0.82 for K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Although total antibiotic use did not change over time in German ICUs, carbapenem use doubled. This is probably due to the rise in 3GC-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Increased carbapenem consumption was associated with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria and imipenem-resistant A. baumannii.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological spectrum of necrotizing fasciitis in surgical patients at a Philippine university medical centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study describes the clinical characteristics, bacteriology and risk factors for mortality of patients with necrotizing fasciitis (NF), seen in a university medical centre. METHODS: The medical charts of NF patients admitted to the institution from January 2004 to July 2007 were retrieved and reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: The majority of the 67 patients included in the study presented with localized nonspecific inflammatory manifestations: tenderness (94%), warmth (86%), oedema (76%), skin necrosis (75%), and ulceration (68%). Diabetes mellitus (22%) was the most common predisposing medical condition. The most frequent isolates were Escherichia coli (44%), Acinetobacter baumannii (19%), Staphylococcus aureus (15%) and Enterococcus faecium (15%). Overall mortality rate was 36%. Risk factors significantly associated with mortality were truncal involvement (p = 0.034), leukocytosis (p = 0.038), acidosis (p = 0.001), hypoalbuminaemia (p = 0.004), hypocalcaemia (p = 0.000) and hyponatraemia (p = 0.023). Logistic regression analysis revealed acidosis [p < 0.05, odds ratio (OR) = 9] and hypoalbuminaemia (p < 0.05, OR = 14) as significant independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: The identified risk factors can inform clinicians of increased mortality risks for certain patients with NF. They should serve as a trigger for more aggressive surgical and critical care, and antimicrobial therapy for these patients.
TI  - Exposure-response analysis of tigecycline in pharmacodynamic simulations using different size inocula of target bacteria.
AB  - This study explored tigecycline exposure-bacterial responses in pharmacodynamic simulations (in vitro kinetic model) using different inocula. One meticillin-resistant vancomycin-heteroresistant Staphylococcus aureus, one Enterococcus faecium and one extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli with equal tigecycline minimum inhibitory concentrations/minimum bactericidal concentrations (MICs/MBCs) (0.12/0.25 microg/mL) were used. A computerised pharmacodynamic bicompartmental model simulated three tigecycline twice-daily dosing regimens over 48h: 50mg (100mg loading dose); 100mg; and 150 mg. Areas under bacterial growth curves were calculated, and differences between the growth curve used as control and the killing curve of bacteria exposed to tigecycline (ABBC) were determined. With standard inocula [ca. 1 x 10(6)colony-forming units (CFU)/mL], linear increases in area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)/MIC (25.6 for 50mg, 53.76 for 100mg and 79.52 for 150 mg) produced linear increases in activity against Gram-positive organisms (mean ABBCs of 120.60, 143.20 and 195.80 log CFU x h/mL for S. aureus and of 95.75, 172.55 and 216.90 log CFUxh/mL for E. faecium, respectively), with the activity of the 150 mg regimen being significantly higher (P<0.01) than that of the other two regimens. ABBCs obtained with the 100mg regimen using standard inocula were similar to those obtained with the 150 mg regimen when using high inocula (ca. 1 x 10(7)CFU/mL). Against E. coli, the highest dosing regimen was required to obtain significant antibacterial activity compared with control (mean ABBCs of 145.75 log CFU x h/mL with standard inocula and 63.33 log CFU x h/mL with high inocula). An increase in tigecycline dosing appears to be an interesting therapeutic option to maximise antibacterial activity owing to its linear pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, especially when severe infections with high bacterial load are suspected.
TI  - Emergence of resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in the intestinal tract during successful treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection in rats.
AB  - Antibiotic treatment of lung infections may lead to the emergence of resistance in the gut flora. Appropriate dosing regimens could mitigate this adverse effect. In gnotobiotic rats harboring intestinal Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium populations, a lung infection by Klebsiella pneumoniae was instigated with two different sizes of inoculum to represent an early or a late initiation of antibiotic treatment. The rats were treated with marbofloxacin, an expanded-spectrum fluoroquinolone, by a single-shot administration or a fractionated regimen over 4 days. Intestinal bacterial populations were monitored during and after treatment. At the infection site, bacterial cure without any selection of resistance was observed. Whatever the dosage regimen, fluoroquinolone treatment had a transient negative impact on the E. coli gut population but not on that of E. faecium. The intestinal flora was colonized by the pathogenic lung bacteria, and there was the emergence of intestine-resistant K. pneumoniae, occurring more often in animals treated with a single marbofloxacin dose than with the fractionated dose. Bacterial cure without resistance selection at the infection site with fluoroquinolone treatment can be linked to colonization of the digestive tract by targeted pulmonary bacteria, followed by the emergence of resistance.
TI  - Effect of overnight storage of blood culture bottles on bacterial detection time  in the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Identifying the pathogens present in blood stream infections  is crucial to initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy and avoid morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of overnight storage of aerobic and anaerobic BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles on the detection time for common pathogens. METHODS: From November 2007 to July 2008, a total of 2,105 isolates were positively detected using the BACTEC 9240 system. The time to positive detection (TTD) was calculated by subtracting the time of receipt in the laboratory from the time required to detect a positive culture. The mean TTD values were calculated using the TTD value of the first positive culture bottle only. Overnight delay at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Taiwan was 15 hours (from 5 pm to 8 am). RESULTS: Of the 2,105 total isolates, 972 (46.1%) were Gram-positive bacteria, 1,024 (48.6%) were Gram-negative bacteria and 109 (5.1%) were fungi. Among the top 10 pathogens, 24.7% grew only in the aerobic bottle and 15.1% in the anaerobic bottle, including Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacteriaceae, and Gram-positive bacilli. Due to the overnight delay in loading a blood culture bottle into the instrument, for most of the pathogens (including Staphylococcus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae), a decrease in TTD by <or= 4.4 hours was observed. An increase in TTD by 20.8 hours was observed for Gram-positive bacilli. We also found that the difference between TTD in aerobic versus anaerobic bottles during the day was higher in coagulase-negative staphylococcus (12 hours) and lower in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (< 2 hours). TTD was longer than 72 hours in 20.5% of Gram-positive bacilli and 7.3% of Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: No difference in the TTD of major pathogens was observed in bottles processed during the day and after overnight delay, suggesting that the delayed entry of the blood culture bottle into the instrument may affect the detection time. Since high numbers of facultative anaerobes were detected in anaerobic bottles only, use of a single aerobic bottle might have a detrimental effect on the clinical therapy outcome.
TI  - [Investigation of the in vitro antibacterial effects of statins].
AB  - It was previously shown that statins have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-oxidant effects. This study was aimed to investigate the in-vitro antibacterial effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin. In this study antibacterial activity of the statins were tested against 16 methicillin-susceptible Stophylococcus aureus (MSSA), 16 methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA), 16 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCoNS), 9 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, 7 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecolis, 13 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, 16 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive Escherichia coli, 16 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 Acinetobacter boumannii, 15 ESBL positive Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 Stenotrophomonas maltophilio by broth microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) performance and interpretive guidelines. S. aureus ATCC 29213, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 43300, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, K.pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and E. coli ATCC 35218 were tested as control strains. The results showed that minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for all isolates were > 128 microg/ml for the two statins tested. However, MIC of simvastatin was 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 and was 64 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and was > 128 microg/ml for others, but MIC of atorvastatin was > 128 microg/mI for all standard strains. According to these results, we observed that simvastatin and atorvastain had no significant antibacterial effect in vitro. In this study, although no antibacterial effect of statins were determined in vitro, further studies are needed to investigate the combined effect of statins with antibacterial agents in the living organism.
TI  - Evaluation of efflux activity of bacteria by a semi-automated fluorometric system.
AB  - A semi-automated method that uses the common efflux pump (EP) substrate ethidium  bromide (EB) is described for the assessment of EP systems of bacteria. The method employs the Rotor-Gene(TM) 3000 thermocycler (Corbett Research) for the real-time assessment of accumulation and efflux of EB in Phosphate-Buffered Solution (PBS) under varying physiological conditions, such as temperature, pH, presence and absence of the energy source, and presence of efflux pumps inhibitors (EPIs). The method is sufficiently sensitive to characterize intrinsic EP systems of reference strains, a prime necessity if there is a need for assessment of EP-mediated multi-drug resistance (MDR). The method has been successfully applied by us to characterize intrinsic and over-expressed EP systems of Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium avium, suggesting that if the organism can be maintained in PBS, the system described may suffice for the evaluation and assessment of its EP system.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the bioactive compound beauvericin produced by Fusarium proliferatum on solid medium of wheat.
AB  - To obtain the bioactive compound beauvericin (BEA), Fusarium proliferatum CECT 20569 was grown on a solid medium of wheat, utilizing the technique of the solid state fermentation (SSF), being this mycotoxin purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a reverse phase semi-preparative column using as the mobile phase acetonitrile/water in gradient condition. The purity of the BEA was verified by analytical HPLC and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). The pure fractions of BEA were utilized to determinate the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally pathogens of the intestinal tract as: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella enterica, Shigella dysenteriae, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - [Effects of probiotics on intestinal bacterial colonization in premature infants].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the possible roles of probiotics in decreasing intestinal bacterial colonization rate and the incidence of enterogenic infections in premature infants. METHODS: Seventy premature infants were randomly assigned to two groups: probiotics and conventional treatment groups (control) (n=35 each). The probiotics treatment group was administered with oral Clostridium butyricum powder (250 mg, twice daily up to discharge) 24 hrs after birth except conventional treatment. Rectal swab cultures were done at admission, 5 and 12 days after admission, and before discharge. Clinical and laboratory findings were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The intestinal bacterial colonization rate in the probiotics treatment group was lower than that in the control group 12 days after admission (60% vs 83%; p<0.05) and before discharge (51% vs 80%; p<0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium were common colonization bacteria in the two groups. Diarrhea occurred in 7 cases (20%) in the probiotics treatment group compared with 16 cases (46%) in the control group (p<0.05). Two infants (6%) developed sepsis in the probiotics treatment group compared with 9 cases (26%) in the control group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics can decrease intestinal bacterial colonization rate and the incidence of diarrhea and sepsis in premature infants.
TI  - Sewage sludge and liquid pig manure as possible sources of antibiotic resistant bacteria.
AB  - Within the last decades, the environmental spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria has become a topic of concern. In this study, liquid pig manure (n=305) and sewage sludge (n=111) - used as agricultural fertilizers between 2002 and 2005 - were investigated for the presence of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Bacteria were tested for their resistance against 40 chemotherapeutics including several "reserve drugs". E. coli (n=613) from pig manure were at a significantly higher degree resistant to streptomycin, doxycycline, spectinomycin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol than E. coli (n=116) from sewage sludge. Enterococci (Ent. faecalis, n=387, and Ent. faecium, n=183) from pig manure were significantly more often resistant to high levels of doxycycline, rifampicin, erythromycin, and streptomycin than Ent. faecalis (n=44) and Ent. faecium (n=125) from sewage sludge. Significant differences in enterococcal resistance were also seen for tylosin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin high level, fosfomycin, clindamicin, enrofloxacin, moxifloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin. By contrast, aminopenicillins were more effective in enterococci from pig manure, and mean MIC-values of piperacillin+tazobactam and third generation cefalosporines were significantly lower in E. coli from pig manure than in E. coli from sewage sludge. 13.4% (E. coli) to 25.3% (Ent. faecium) of pig manure isolates were high-level multiresistant to substances from more than three different classes of antimicrobial agents. In sewage sludge, high-level-multiresistance reached from 0% (Ent. faecalis) to 16% (Ent. faecium). High rates of (multi-) resistant bacteria in pig manure emphasize the need for a prudent - cautious - use of antibiotics in farm animals.
TI  - How honey kills bacteria.
AB  - With the rise in prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, honey is increasingly valued for its antibacterial activity. To characterize all bactericidal factors in a medical-grade honey, we used a novel approach of successive neutralization of individual honey bactericidal factors. All bacteria tested, including Bacillus subtilis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli, ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, were killed by 10-20% (v/v) honey, whereas > or = 40% (v/v) of a honey-equivalent sugar solution was required for similar activity. Honey accumulated up to 5.62 +/- 0.54 mM H(2)O(2) and contained 0.25 +/- 0.01 mM methylglyoxal (MGO). After enzymatic neutralization of these two compounds, honey retained substantial activity. Using B. subtilis for activity-guided isolation of the additional antimicrobial factors, we discovered bee defensin-1 in honey. After combined neutralization of H(2)O(2), MGO, and bee defensin-1, 20% honey had only minimal activity left, and subsequent adjustment of the pH of this honey from 3.3 to 7.0 reduced the activity to that of sugar alone. Activity against all other bacteria tested depended on sugar, H(2)O(2), MGO, and bee defensin-1. Thus, we fully characterized the antibacterial activity of medical-grade honey.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  - A wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. The objective of this study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. Using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium and Bacillus were studied for inhibition of Clostridium perfringens type A, various serovars of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, as well as Brachyspira pilosicoli. Strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without pH neutralization, proteinase K and catalase treatment. Enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to Lactobacillus mucosae, Lactobacillus amylovorus and Bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. The Bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-Brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. Homofermentative lactobacilli and B. thermophilum could suppress the growth of B. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to L. reuteri and L. mucosae had no effect. The lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one Enterococcus faecium and L. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. The findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.
TI  - Synergistic effects between conventional antibiotics and 2-aminoimidazole-derived antibiofilm agents.
AB  - 2-aminoimidazoles are an emerging class of small molecules that possess the ability to inhibit and disperse biofilms across bacterial order, class, and phylum. Herein, we report the synergistic effect between a 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate and antibiotics toward dispersing preestablished biofilms, culminating with a 3-orders-of-magnitude increase of biofilm dispersion toward Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Furthermore, we document that the 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate will also resensitize multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria to the effects of conventional antibiotics, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
TI  - Violacein-producing Collimonas sp. from the sea surface microlayer of costal waters in Trondelag, Norway.
AB  - A new strain belonging to the genus Collimonas was isolated from the sea surface  microlayer off the coast of Trondelag, Norway. The bacterium, designated Collimonas CT, produced an antibacterial compound active against Micrococcus luteus. Subsequent studies using LC-MS identified this antibacterial compound as violacein, known to be produced by several marine-derived bacteria. Fragments of the violacein biosynthesis genes vioA and vioB were amplified by PCR from the Collimonas CT genome and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences demonstrated close relatedness of the Collimonas CT violacein biosynthetic gene cluster to those in Janthinobacterium lividum and Duganella sp., suggesting relatively recent horizontal gene transfer. Considering diverse biological activities of violacein, Collimonas CT shall be further studied as a potential producer of this compound.
TI  - [Investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  - Sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. Previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. A total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. The antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for 10 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 Escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 Proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 Proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 Enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 Enterobacter aerogenes strains. The MIC values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 32 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, 32 microg/ml for E. coli ATCC 25922 and > 128 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Sertralin has showed antibacterial activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that MIC values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Effect of probiotic bacterial strains of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus on enteroaggregative Escherichia coli.
AB  - The effects of nine probiotic strains of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus on the growth, adhesion activity, and biofilm formation of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) were examined. The culture supernatant of the E. faecium strain, with or without pH adjustment to a neutral pH, had a strong bactericidal effect on EAggEC, including induction of membrane damage and cell lysis. Supernatants of the L. casei ss. casei and L. casei ss. rhamnosus strains also had a bactericidal effect on EAggEC, but this activity was abolished by pH adjustment to a neutral pH. No inhibitory effect of the culture supernatants of Bifidobacterium or E. faecalis strains was detected. Adhesion of EAggEC to intestinal epithelial cells was not inhibited by the bacterial strains tested. Two strains of L. casei enhanced EAggEC biofilm formation, which was characterized by increased bacterial proliferation. These results suggest that the three different bacterial species; Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus, have different effects on EAggEC, and that further analysis is required for the practical use of these bacteria as probiotics against EAggEC infection.
TI  - Chemical synthesis and biological screening of 2-aminoimidazole-based bacterial and fungal antibiofilm agents.
AB  - A collection of 2-aminoimidazole/triazole amides has been synthesized and screened for antibiofilm activity. This class of small molecules was found to modulate the biofilm activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB), a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Rhodospirillum salexigens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Vibrio vulnificus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium as well as the yeast Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Furthermore, lead compounds were found to not lyse red blood cells at active concentrations.
TI  - Diagnostic microarray for human and animal bacterial diseases and their virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes.
AB  - Rapid diagnosis and treatment of disease is often based on the identification and characterization of causative agents derived from phenotypic characteristics. Current methods can be laborious and time-consuming, often requiring many skilled personnel and a large amount of lab space. The objective of our study was to develop a spotted microarray for rapid identification and characterization of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial resistance genes. Our spotted microarray consists of 489 70mer probes that detect 40 bacterial pathogens of medical, veterinary and zoonotic importance (including 15 NIAID Category A, B and C pathogens); associated genes that encode resistance for antimicrobial and metal resistance; and DNA elements that are important for horizontal gene transfer among bacteria. High specificity and reliability of the microarray was achieved for bacterial pathogens of animal and human importance by validating MDR pathogenic bacteria as pure cultures or by following their inoculation in complex and highly organic sample matrices, such as soil and manure.
TI  - Susceptibility to tigecycline of isolates from samples collected in hospitalized  patients with secondary peritonitis undergoing surgery.
AB  - Activity of tigecycline against nosocomial secondary peritonitis isolates collected along 18 months in 29 Spanish hospitals was tested by Etest in a central laboratory, considering Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC)/European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. A total of 600 facultative/aerobic isolates (392 Gram negative, 208 Gram positive) and 100 anaerobes were tested. None of the 220 Escherichia coli isolates was resistant to tigecycline (MIC(50)/MIC(90) = 0.25/0.5 microg/mL), with 0.5% (FDA breakpoint) and 3.6% (BSAC/EUCAST breakpoint) intermediate strains. All Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates (15 strains), all Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates (42 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline. No isolates resistant to tigecycline were found among Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium, but 18.9% of Enterococcus faecalis strains were intermediate following BSAC/EUCAST breakpoints. All (but 1) isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 45) were tigecycline susceptible, as well as Gram-positive anaerobes. Tigecycline offers an adequate activity profile against isolates from secondary peritonitis when tested by Etest regardless of the breakpoints used for categorization.
TI  - Safe and feasible outpatient treatment following induction and consolidation chemotherapy for patients with acute leukaemia.
AB  - Traditionally, patients with acute leukaemia are admitted to hospital during chemotherapy-induced pancytopenia, although a few recent reports have reported the feasibility and safety of outpatient treatment. We have developed an outpatient treatment programme for patients with acute leukaemia incorporating comprehensive patient education for self-care management at home during pancytopenia and involvement of patients in care of their tunnelled central venous catheter (CVC). During neutropenia, patients are treated with prophylactic ciprofloxacine, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and fluconazole. Herein, we report the results of outpatient treatment of 60 patients with acute leukaemia (54 with acute myeloid leukaemia) followed prospectively in the period from March 2004 to 2007. After induction chemotherapy, outpatient treatment was possible after 48 of 73 induction courses, with no readmission in 19 of these (40%). A total of 129 consolidation courses were administered with outpatient treatment following 116 of these, with no readmission in 69 (59%). The median number of days spent at home with neutrophils below 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 8 d per course following induction and 12 d following consolidation chemotherapy. The predominant cause of readmission was neutropenic fever, in most instances of unknown origin. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Enterococcus faecium were the most frequently identified bacteria in blood cultures, whereas only four positive blood cultures with multiresistant Escherichia coli were identified in the entire patient cohort, the latter exclusively observed in patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis. The majority of the patients were able to take care of their CVC including change in dressing and heparin flushing. There were 12 CVC-related infections. There were no treatment-related deaths. We conclude that outpatient treatment of patients with acute leukaemia is feasible and safe.
TI  - Presence of pathogens and indicator microbes at a non-point source subtropical recreational marine beach.
AB  - Swimming in ocean water, including ocean water at beaches not impacted by known point sources of pollution, is an increasing health concern. This study was an initial evaluation of the presence of indicator microbes and pathogens and the association among the indicator microbes, pathogens, and environmental conditions at a subtropical, recreational marine beach in south Florida impacted by non-point sources of pollution. Twelve water and eight sand samples were collected during four sampling events at high or low tide under elevated or reduced solar insolation conditions. The analyses performed included analyses of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, and Clostridium perfringens), human-associated microbial source tracking (MST) markers (human polyomaviruses [HPyVs] and Enterococcus faecium esp gene), and pathogens (Vibrio vulnificus, Staphylococcus aureus, enterovirus, norovirus, hepatitis A virus, Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp.). The enterococcus concentrations in water and sand determined by quantitative PCR were greater than the concentrations determined by membrane filtration measurement. The FIB concentrations in water were below the recreational water quality standards for three of the four sampling events, when pathogens and MST markers were also generally undetectable. The FIB levels exceeded regulatory guidelines during one event, and this was accompanied by detection of HPyVs and pathogens, including detection of the autochthonous bacterium V. vulnificus in sand and water, detection of the allochthonous protozoans Giardia spp. in water, and detection of Cryptosporidium spp. in sand samples. The elevated microbial levels were detected at high tide and under low-solar-insolation conditions. Additional sampling should be conducted to further explore the relationships between tidal and solar insolation conditions and between indicator microbes and pathogens in subtropical recreational marine waters impacted by non-point source pollution.
TI  - Prevalence and persistence of antimicrobial resistance in broiler indicator bacteria.
AB  - This study explored the prevalence and persistence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium from healthy broilers. In 32 broiler farms, cloacal samples were taken during two production rounds, with one production round in between. For 10 of the sampled flocks, samples from the carcasses at the slaughterhouse were also collected. For E. coli, high levels of resistance were found for ampicillin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, tetracycline, and the combination of trimethoprim and sulfonamide. Over 58% of all the isolates showed resistance to four or more antimicrobial agents. Only 4.8% were fully susceptible for all 14 drugs tested. A remarkably high resistance rate (up to 41%) to ceftiofur was found. The enterococci were frequently resistant to macrolides, tetracycline, and the combination quinopristin/dalfopristin. Over 80% displayed acquired resistance to four or more antimicrobial agents, and 3.9% were fully susceptible for the eight agents tested. Resistance was found to persist over consecutive production rounds. There was a good correlation between results obtained with cloacal samples of the live animals and caecal content samples collected in the slaughterhouse for both E. coli and E. faecium. For E. coli but not for E. faecium, the resistance profile of neck skin isolates was different from that of cloacal isolates.
TI  - Benzoxazine series of histidine kinase inhibitors as potential antimicrobial agents with activity against enterococci.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibacterial activity of three members of a benzoxazine series of histidine kinase inhibitors ( 4a , 4b and 6 ) was studied on standard strains, and with 4b also on clinical isolates of enterococci. METHODS: Susceptibility to each compound was tested using a broth macrodilution method with a range of dilutions from 0.016 to 128 microg/ml on four standard strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) and in the case of 4b also on 52 clinical isolates of enterococci (7 vancomycin-susceptible E. faecalis, 15 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium and 30 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium), and on two additional standard strains (S. aureus ATCC 43300 and E. faecalis ATCC 51299). RESULTS: Neither of the compounds inhibited the growth of E. coli ATCC 25922 or P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Compound 4b inhibited the growth of S. aureus ATCC 29213 at 8 microg/ml, S. aureus ATCC 43300 at 32 microg/ml, E. faecalis ATCC 29212, and E. faecalis ATCC 51299 at 16 microg/ml, while 4a and 6 did so at higher concentrations. For clinical isolates of enterococci, the minimal inhibitory concentrations of 4b were in the range of 0.5-16 microg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Compound 4b promises to be a potentially useful antimicrobial agent for vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci.
TI  - Impact of a change in antibiotic prophylaxis on total antibiotic use in a surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of reducing the length of antibiotic prophylaxis for cerebro spinal shunts on total antibiotic use and key resistant pathogens. METHODS: In January 2004, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis was reduced to a single shot dose with cefuroxime in an intensive care unit (ICU). Prior to this intervention, prophylaxis with second-generation cephalosporins was administered during the entire period of external cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) drainage. The effect on the antibiotic use density (AD: DDD [defined daily doses] per 1,000 patient-days[pd]) was calculated prior to (January 2002-December 2003) and following implementation of the intervention(January 2004-December 2006) by segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series. Resistance proportions(RP) and resistance densities (RD), defined as resistant pathogen/1,000 pd of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis or E. faecium, third-generation-resistant (3GC) Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Pseudomonus aeruginosa, were compared by the Fisher's exact test before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Total antibiotic use by 147 DDD/1,000 pd decreased after the intervention when pre-operative prophylaxis was changed into single shot prophylaxis, from an estimated mean of 1,036 DDD/1,000 pd before the intervention to 887DDD/1,000 pd post-intervention. This decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the amount of cefuroxime used for prophylaxis. The reduction in total antibiotic consumption was sustainable, and it did not increase again during the next 36 months. The RR and RD of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli increased after January 2004, whereas the percentage of MRSA significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: Change to single shot prophylaxis along with an ongoing antibiotic stewardship program resulted in a cut-back in total antibiotic use amounting to as much as 15%. It would therefore appear that targeting interventions aimed at reducing antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical ICUs may be very worthwhile.
TI  - Safety and functional aspects of preselected enterococci for probiotic use in Iberian dry-fermented sausages.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate enterococci for potential probiotic  use in Iberian dry-fermented sausages. A total of 15 strains isolated from Iberian dry-fermented sausages, human feces, and pig feces were evaluated for their safety and functional characteristics including biogenic amine (BA) production, antibiotic susceptibility, hemolysis, virulence determinants, cell adhesion, and antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens. The strain Enterococcus faecium SE906 was able to establish itself on the intestinal epithelium, inhibiting such pathogenic bacteria as Listeria monocytogenes in vitro. This strain was also considered safe to be used for its low aminogenic potential, and its antibiotic resistance pattern and virulence determinants, being identified as a potential probiotic meat starter culture suitable for manufacture of dry-fermented Iberian sausages.
TI  - National monitoring for antimicrobial resistance among indicator bacteria isolated from food-producing animals in Japan.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibilities of 2,205 isolates of Escherichia coli and 1,181 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (n=610) and E. faecium (n=571) from apparently healthy cattle, pigs and broiler and layer chickens collected from 2000 to 2003 were examined using an agar dilution method. Overall, the isolates from cattle and layer chickens showed a lower incidence of resistance to almost all antimicrobials studied compared with those from pigs and broiler chickens. Fluoroquinolone resistance was found at a low level in isolates of E. coli from four animal species and in E. faecalis from pigs and broiler and layer chickens. Resistance to cephalosporin was identified in isolates of E. coli from broiler chickens in 2000-2002 and from four animal species in 2003. Incidence of antimicrobial resistance in the bacteria did not vary from year to year during the investigation period.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of a newly isolated lytic bacteriophage, EFAP-1 of Enterococcus faecalis, and antibacterial activity of its endolysin EFAL-1.
AB  - AIMS: In this work, we aimed to identify an effective treatment of infections caused by Enterococcus spp. strains resistant to conventional antibiotics. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report the isolation and characterization of a new lytic bacteriophage, designated bacteriophage EFAP-1, that is capable of lysing Enterococcus faecalis bacteria that exhibit resistance to multiple antibiotics. EFAP-1 has low sequence similarity to all known bacteriophages. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that EFAP-1 belongs to the Siphoviridae family. A putative lytic protein of EFAP-1, endolysin EFAL-1, is encoded in ORF 2 and was expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant EFAL-1 had broad-spectrum lytic activity against several Gram-positive pathogens, including Ent. faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. CONCLUSIONS: The complete genome sequence of the newly isolated enterococcal lytic phage was analysed, and it was demonstrated that its recombinant endolysin had broad lytic activity against various Gram-positive pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bacteriophage EFAP-1 and its lytic protein, EFAL-1, can be utilized as potent antimicrobial agents against Enterococcus spp. strains resistant to conventional antibiotics in hospital infections and also as environmental disinfectants to control disease-causing Enterococcus spp. in dairy farms.
TI  - In vitro effect of physiological concentrations of human albumin on the antibacterial activity of tigecycline.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine C(max) tigecycline activity in the presence/absence of physiological concentrations of human albumin with free fraction concentrations as controls. METHODS: Killing curves (final inoculum: 1.0-5.0 x 10(7) cfu/mL) were performed with 0.88 mg/L final concentrations (serum C(max) after a 100 mg 1 h infusion) in Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) (MH) and in MH with 4 g/dL human albumin. Controls were curves in MH with concentrations similar to the free fraction (fC(max) = 0.17 mg/L) calculated using protein binding. Activity was measured as log(10) initial inoculum reduction (log(10) initial inoculum-log(10) at 12 h/24 h). Target strains (tigecycline MIC/MBC; mg/L) were: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus heteroresistant to vancomycin (0.12/0.25); Enterococcus faecium (0.12/0.25); Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (0.12/0.25); and Acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/1). RESULTS: At 24 h the fC(max) produced mean decreases of < or =0.1 cfu/mL for all strains, in contrast to the bactericidal activity (mean >3 log(10) reduction) provided by C(max) concentrations in the presence or absence of albumin for E. coli and E. faecium, and an activity nearly bactericidal for S. aureus (mean approximately 2.8 log(10) reduction). In the case of the A. baumannii isolate the C(max) in the presence or absence of albumin produced a mean reduction of 2.56 log(10) cfu/mL at 12 h (time of one dosing interval), with a bacteriostatic profile when considering 24 h colony counts (similar counts at 0 and 24 h). CONCLUSIONS: Correcting the total concentration for the reported literature binding values is unreliable since tigecycline antibacterial activity was greater than that suggested by the free fraction of the drug.
TI  - Comparison of molecular markers to detect fresh sewage in environmental waters.
AB  - Human-specific Bacteroides HF183 (HS-HF183), human-specific Enterococci faecium esp (HS-esp), human-specific adenoviruses (HS-AVs) and human-specific polyomaviruses (HS-PVs) assays were evaluated in freshwater, seawater and distilled water to detect fresh sewage. The sewage spiked water samples were also tested for the concentrations of traditional fecal indicators (i.e., Escherichia coli, enterococci and Clostridium perfringens) and enteric viruses such as enteroviruses (EVs), sapoviruses (SVs), and torquetenoviruses (TVs). The overall host-specificity of the HS-HF183 marker to differentiate between humans and other animals was 98%. However, the HS-esp, HS-AVs and HS-PVs showed 100% host-specificity. All the human-specific markers showed >97% sensitivity to detect human fecal pollution. E. coli, enterococci and, C. perfringens were detected up to dilutions of sewage 10(-5), 10(-4) and 10(-3) respectively. HS-esp, HS-AVs, HS-PVs, SVs and TVs were detected up to dilution of sewage 10(-4) whilst EVs were detected up to dilution 10(-5). The ability of the HS-HF183 marker to detect fresh sewage was 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than that of the HS-esp and viral markers. The ability to detect fresh sewage in freshwater, seawater and distilled water matrices was similar for human-specific bacterial and viral marker. Based on our data, it appears that human-specific molecular markers are sensitive measures of fresh sewage pollution, and the HS-HF183 marker appears to be the most sensitive among these markers in terms of detecting fresh sewage. However, the presence of the HS-HF183 marker in environmental waters may not necessarily indicate the presence of enteric viruses due to their high abundance in sewage compared to enteric viruses. More research is required on the persistency of these markers in environmental water samples in relation to traditional fecal indicators and enteric pathogens.
TI  - Detection of antibiotic resistant E. coli and Enterococcus spp. in stool of healthy growing children in Portugal.
AB  - From stool specimens of 118 healthy children's (1-14 years) in Portugal 92 E. coli and 101 Enterococcu s spp. strains have been isolated. Almost half (40.2%) of the E. coli isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 25.0% were resistant to tetracycline and 26.1% were resistant to streptomycin. Resistance genes detected by specific PCR included bla(TEM) and/or bla(SHV) and/or bla(CTX-M) (33 of 37 ampicillin and/or cefotaxime resistant isolates), tet (A) and/or tet (B) (16 of 23 tetracycline-resistant isolates), aad A (19 of 24 streptomycin-resistant isolates), cml A (in the two chloramphenicol-resistant isolates), aac (3)-II with/without aac (3)-IV (in the four gentamicin-resistant isolates), sul 1 and/or sul 2 and/or sul 3 (in all trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistant isolates). The majority of the resistant E. coli isolates (69.1%) belonged to phylogenetic group B2. Of the enterococci isolates E. faecium (n = 53), E. faecalis (n = 41), E. hirae (n = 4) and E. durans (n = 3) more than one-fourth (28.7%) of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline; 21.8% were resistant to erythromycin and 8.9% were resistant to kanamycin. Resistance genes detected by PCR in enterococci included aph (3)'-IIIa (in all kanamycin-resistant isolates), aac (6') (in all gentamicin-resistant isolates), tet (M) and/or tet (L) (26 of 29 tetracycline-resistant isolates), erm (B) (17 of 22 erythromycin-resistant isolates). This survey showed that faecal bacteria such as E. coli and enterococci of healthy growing children's could be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes.
TI  - Intraoperative blood salvage and leukocyte depletion during liver transplantation with bacterial contamination.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination is considered to be a contraindication for intraoperative blood salvage (IBS) during OLT. The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficiency of the autotransfusion device with an additional leukocyte depletion filter (LDF) for eliminating bacterial contaminations, and its clinical outcomes in terms of post-operative infections during OLT. METHODS: Forty-five patients with end-stage liver disease and cirrhotic ascites were enrolled in this study. The blood from the surgical field was collected and processed by an autotransfusion device (Cell Saver 5) and a LDF for bacteriological analysis. Among them, 12 patients with chronic severe hepatitis B received autologous transfusion for analysis of the effect on post-operative infections. RESULTS: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) (p < 0.05, OR = 20.1) and a long duration of operation (p < 0.01, OR = 8.3) were found to be critical risk factors for contamination. Autotransfusion devices with an additional LDF significantly eliminated bacterial contaminants from shed blood (p < 0.05). About 33% (4/12) of the patients who received autologous transfusion with salvaged and filtered erythrocytes got post-operative bacterial infection. CONCLUSIONS: Autotransfusion devices with an additional LDF could significantly eliminate bacterial contaminants of shed blood during OLT. The new mode of IBS might be a good option in reducing post-operative infections, and deserves a large-scale clinical trial.
TI  - Influence of oral hygiene in patients with fixed appliances in the oral carriage  of antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli and Enterococcus isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim was to study the oral carriage of Enterococcus and Escherichia coli isolates and their content in antimicrobial-resistance and virulence genes in patients with fixed appliances and in healthy volunteers. STUDY DESIGN: Samples from supragingival plaques/tooth surfaces/fixed orthodontic appliances were taken in patients with fixed appliances (n = 46) and in healthy volunteers (n = 55). Samples were seeded on specific media for enterococcal and E. coli recovery, and 1 isolate of each type per sample was selected. Antimicrobial susceptibility and the presence of genes encoding antimicrobial resistance, bacteriocins, and virulence factors were checked by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Enterococci or E. coli were not recovered from healthy volunteers. Nevertheless, 10 isolates (5 E. faecium, 3 E. faecalis, and 2 E. coli) were obtained from 19.5% of patients with fixed appliances, and poor oral hygiene was evidenced in all of the these patients. Percentages of antimicrobial resistance and the resistance genes detected among the enterococci were: erythromycin: 100%, erm(B); kanamycin: 75%, aph(3')-IIIa; tetracycline: 50%, tet(L) with/without tet(M); streptomycin: 37%, ant(6)-Ia; chloramphenicol: 12%, catA. One E. coli isolate showed a phenotype of multiresistance containing 5 resistance genes and class 1 and 2 integrons. All enterococci produced gelatinase, and 4 isolates contained genes encoding enterocins L50A/B and P. The esp virulence gene was found in 1 multiresistant E. faecalis isolate. CONCLUSIONS: Poor or improper oral hygiene in individuals with fixed appliances favors the oral carriage of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli and enterococci. Additional investigations are needed to assess its implication in human health.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - Genetic detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-containing Escherichia coli isolates and vancomycin-resistant enterococci in fecal samples of healthy children.
AB  - One hundred twelve fecal samples of healthy children were recovered in Portugal during October 2007 and February 2008 and were tested for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) containing Escherichia coli isolates and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Three of the 112 fecal samples (2.7%) harbored ESBL-positive E. coli isolates and the bla(CTX-M-1), bla(TEM-52), and bla(SHV-12) genes were identified in these isolates. The bla(TEM-52)-containing isolate showed a phenotype of multiresistance that included fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol; sul1, sul3, and cmlA genes were detected in this isolate, in addition to two amino acid changes in GyrA (Ser83Leu + Asp87Asn) and one in ParC protein (Ser80Ile). The ESBL isolates corresponded to phylogroup A (one isolate), B1 (one isolate), and D (one isolate). vanA-containing Escherichia faecium isolates were detected in 13 of the 112 fecal samples (11.6%), and vanC-1 isolates were found in 2 samples. A diversity of resistance genes [(tet(M), tet(L), erm(B), aph(3')-IIIa, ant(6)-Ia, catA, and vat(E)] were found in VRE isolates. These results show that the intestinal tract of healthy children constitutes a reservoir of ESBL-containing E. coli and VRE isolates.
TI  - Aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit staphylococcal and enterococcal biofilm formation.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus are the leading causative agents of indwelling medical device infections because of their ability to form biofilms on artificial surfaces. Here we describe the antibiofilm activity of a class of small molecules, the aryl rhodanines, which specifically inhibit biofilm formation of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and E. gallinarum but not the gram-negative species Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The aryl rhodanines do not exhibit antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial strains tested and are not cytotoxic against HeLa cells. Preliminary mechanism-of-action studies revealed that the aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit the early stages of biofilm development by preventing attachment of the bacteria to surfaces.
TI  - Rapid QPCR-based assay for fecal Bacteroides spp. as a tool for assessing fecal contamination in recreational waters.
AB  - Concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB; e.g. Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus sp.) can only be used in limited ways for determining the source of fecal contamination in recreational waters because they cannot distinguish human from non-human fecal contamination. Several Bacteroides spp. have been suggested as potential alternative indicators. We have developed a rapid, culture-independent method for quantifying fecal Bacteroides spp. using quantitative PCR (QPCR) targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The assay specifically targets and quantifies the most common human Bacteroides spp. The details of the method are presented, including analyses of a wide range of fecal samples from different organisms. Specificity and performance of the QPCR assay were also tested via a laboratory experiment where human sewage and gull guano were inoculated into a range of environmental water samples. Concentrations of fecal Bacteroides spp., total Enterococcus sp., Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus casseliflavus were measured using QPCR, and total Enterococcus sp. and E. coli were quantified by membrane filtration (MF). Samples spiked with gull guano were highly concentrated with total Enterococcus sp., E. coli, E. faecalis, and E. casseliflavus, demonstrating that these indicators are prominent in animal feces. On the other hand, fecal Bacteroides spp. concentrations were high in samples containing sewage and were relatively low in samples spiked with gull guano. Sensitivity and specificity results suggest that the rapid fecal Bacteroides spp. QPCR assay may be a useful tool to effectively predict the presence and concentration of human-specific fecal pollution.
TI  - [A clinical study of bile cultures and antibiotic susceptibility test in the patients with operation on biliary tract].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To illustrate the bacteriology and their susceptibility to antibiotics in patients with biliary tract diseases and provide information for antibiotic choices. METHODS: The bile specimens were cultured and pathogens' susceptibility to antibiotics was obtained intraoperatively from 195 patients undergoing operations on biliary tract and 24 healthy liver donors from June 2007 to March 2008. RESULTS: Among 195 bile specimens collected from the patients intraoperatively, 44 ones were found bacterial growth by culture (22.6%), in which 11 ones were mixed infections (25.0%). Fifty-five bacterial strains belonging to 16 species were identified from these bile specimens. They included 34 Gram negative strains (61.8%), 19 Gram positive strains (34.6%) and 2 fungal strains (3.6%). The commonest pathogens were Escherichia coli (27.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (12.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.7%) and Enterococcus faecium (10.9%). Among 24 bile specimens collected from the healthy liver donors, one was found Escherichia coli growth by culture (4.2%). The results of susceptibility test showed that the resistant rates of Gram negative strains to Meropenem was 2.8%, followed by Imipenem (5.6%), Sulperazone (22.8%) and Amikacin (28.7%). In this study Gram negative strains were highly resistant to Penicillins, Quinolones, some third generation Cephalosporins and so on (>50.0%). None of Gram positive strains were resistant to Vancomycin and Teicoplanin. They were highly resistant to Penicillins, Quinolones, Clindamycin and so on (>40.0%). CONCLUSIONS: (1) Gram negative strains remain the commonest pathogens in biliary tract infection in Renji Hospital and the commonest pathogen is Escherichia coli. The infection of enterococcus is going up. The mixed infection cases happen mostly in acute biliary infection. (2) To treat biliary infection the broad-spectrum antibiotics which are effective to Escherichia coli are optimal choices. Ceftazidime or Ciprofloxacin may be used in mild biliary infection. Sulperazone or Amikacin may be used in severe biliary infection. Imipenem and Vancomycins may be used as second choice to treat the infection which other drugs are ineffective to.
TI  - [Bacterial composition and resistance from urinary tract infections in females].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial composition and antibacterial resistance in female urinary tract infections (UTI) in China. METHODS: The disc diffusion test, minimum inhibition concentration (MIC), test or E-test was used to detect the antimicrobial susceptibility in 86 tertiary hospitals in China from June 1, 2006 to May 31, 2007. WHONET 5.4 was applied for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 6071 pathogenic germs were collected from urine cultures of UTI female patients in the surveillance period, which included 5958 bacterial isolates. Escherichia coli 3529 strains (59.23%), Enterococcus spp 938 strains (15.74%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae 394 strains (6. 61%) were the most common pathogens. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae had 35.7% and 34.0% extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) positive rates, and their resistant rates to quinolones were about 70% and 40%, respectively. Enterococcus faecium was much more resistant to almost all the antibiotics than Enterococcus faecalis. 0.9% Escherichia faecalis and 3. 8% Escherichia faecium were resistant to vancomycin, whereas 2.7% and 4.8% were resistant to teicoplanin. Staphylococcus epdermidis was more common in UTI than Staphylococcus aureus, 79.1% and 75.0% of the isolates being methicillin-ressitant Staphylococcus epdermidis (MRSE) or methicillin-ressitant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), respectively. No vancomycin intermediate or resistant staphylococcus was detected, but 4.9% teicoplanin intermediate rate was found in Staphylococcus epdermidis. The resistant rates to quinolones increased with the patient age. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial resistance in UTI in Chinese females is a severe problem, which could be resulted from antimicrobial irrational use. In the selection of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of UTI, doctors should refer to the results of bacterial resistant surveillance.
TI  - Inhibition of uropathogens by lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy foods and  cow's intestine in western Nigeria.
AB  - A total of 96 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from African indigenous fermented products and cow's intestines to study their inhibitory capability against multi-drug-resistant uropathogens. Escherichia coli accounted for approximately 45% of isolated uropathogens, followed by Staphylococcus spp. (20%). The Gram negative uropathogens were highly resistant to quinolones, co-trimoxazole, teicoplanin and some beta-lactams, while the Staphylococcus spp. showed high resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and macrolides. Twenty-four LAB isolates were selected based on their antimicrobial activity against two uropathogenic Staphylococcus aureus strains and bacteriocin production. LAB strains showing antimicrobial activity were grouped into smaller groups through amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). Representative strains were identified as Weissella spp., Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus brevis through sequencing of 16S rDNA. The Weissella spp. and L. brevis strains demonstrated remarkable inhibitory activity against seven strains of Gram negative uropathogens. Two strains of L. lactis produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance active against Lactobacillus sakei. In this study, an unusual high rate of co-trimoxazole, quinolones and macrolides resistance among uropathogens from south west Nigeria was discovered. Based on their sensitivity to Weissella spp., there is a potential for using these LAB as a natural approach for the protection against the uropathogens assayed.
TI  - Bacterial diversity of Darfiyeh, a Lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  - In order to contribute to the preservation of the Lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the Darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. Three independent batches of Darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. Mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. In order to explore the Darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. The latter included Polymerase Chain Reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE), classical PCR and quantitative PCR. These methods revealed the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus malodoratus, group D Streptococcus sp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp./Eubacterium tenue. Real-time PCR enabled quantification of E. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. The present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of Darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of Lebanese artisanal dairy products.
TI  - Streptomyces polyantibioticus sp. nov., isolated from the banks of a river.
AB  - As part of an antibiotic-screening programme, an actinomycete, designated strain  SPR(T), was isolated from soil collected from the banks of the Umgeni River, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. The isolate produced branching vegetative mycelia with sporangiophores bearing sporangia developing at a late stage of growth. The sporangia contained smooth, almond-shaped, non-motile spores. Strain SPR(T) exhibited antibiosis against various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterococcus faecium VanA (a vancomycin-resistant strain), Mycobacterium aurum A+ and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. The chemotaxonomic characteristics of the strain, with the exception of the phospholipid pattern, corresponded with those of the members of the family Streptomycetaceae Waksman and Henrici 1943. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA genes showed that the strain was closely related to members of the genus Streptomyces, which supports its classification in the family Streptomycetaceae. Thus strain SPR(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces polyantibioticus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SPR(T) (=DSM 44925(T)=NRRL B-24448(T)).
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of tigecycline against resistant Gram-negative bacilli and enterococci by time-kill assay.
AB  - This time-kill study was performed with 65 genetically unique clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli and enterococci to further define the antibacterial activity of tigecycline. To our knowledge, this is the largest published time-kill study evaluating tigecycline activity to date. Isolates evaluated were 10 meropenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii; 15 Escherichia coli, including 10 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers; 15 Klebsiella pneumoniae, including 10 ESBL producers; 20 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), including 10 that were linezolid resistant; and 5 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis. Time-kill testing was performed using tigecycline concentrations of 1x, 2x, and 4x MIC with colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter determined at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Tigecycline MICs (microg/mL) were < or =1 for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, regardless of the isolates' ESBL production; A. baumannii, 0.06 to 4; 9/10 (90%) were < or =2; E. faecalis < or =0.12; and VRE < or =0.25, regardless of linezolid susceptibility. In the time-kill assay, tigecycline significantly inhibited bacterial growth when compared with the growth control. The reduction in growth was <3 log(10) CFU/mL for all isolates, indicative of a bacteriostatic effect.
TI  - MurF inhibitors with antibacterial activity: effect on muropeptide levels.
AB  - MurF catalyzes the last cytoplasmic step of bacterial cell wall synthesis and is  essential for bacterial survival. Our previous studies used a pharmacophore model of a MurF inhibitor to identify additional inhibitors with improved properties. We now present the characterization of two such inhibitors, the diarylquinolines DQ1 and DQ2. DQ1 inhibited Escherichia coli MurF (50% inhibitory concentration, 24 microM) and had modest activity (MICs, 8 to 16 microg/ml) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-defective E. coli and wild-type E. coli rendered permeable with polymyxin B nonapeptide. DQ2 additionally displayed activity against gram-positive bacteria (MICs, 8 to 16 microg/ml), including methicillin (meticillin)-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolates. Treatment of LPS-defective E. coli cells with >or=2x MIC of DQ1 resulted in a 75-fold-greater accumulation of the MurF substrate compared to the control, a 70% decline in the amount of the MurF product, and eventual cell lysis, consistent with the inhibition of MurF within bacteria. DQ2 treatment of S. aureus resulted in similar effects on the MurF substrate and product quantities. At lower levels of DQ1 (<or=1x MIC), the level of accumulation of the substrate was less pronounced (15-fold greater compared to the amount for the control). However, a 50% increase in the amount of the MurF product compared to the control was reproducibly observed, consistent with the possible upregulation of muropeptide biosynthesis upon partial inhibition of this pathway. The overexpression of cloned MurF appeared to partly alleviate the DQ1-mediated inhibition of muropeptide synthesis. The identification of MurF inhibitors such as DQ1 and DQ2 that disrupt cell wall biosynthesis suggests that MurF remains a viable target for an antibacterial agent.
TI  - A longitudinal analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility in clinical institutions  in Germany as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (2004-2007).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) global surveillance program has been designed to assess the in vitro activity of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent tigecycline plus several comparative agents. METHODS: In vitro activities of bacterial isolates obtained from 13 centers in Germany between 2004 and 2007 were evaluated longitudinally and pooled, using the interpretive criteria of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). RESULTS: Tigecycline demonstrated good activity against both Gram-positive and -negative pathogens monitored in this study [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) 0.06-2 microg/ml] with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which had elevated MICs for most antimicrobial agents. Imipenem and meropenem also showed good activity (MIC(90) <or=0.06-4 microg/ml) against most Gram-negative pathogens but were less active against Gram-positive organisms (MIC(90) <or=0.12 to >or=32 microg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline was highly active against most pathogens monitored in the T.E.S.T. study. A low tigecycline MIC(90) was reported against Acinetobacter baumannii and drug-resistant Enterococcus faecium,Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The carbapenems showed the lowest MIC(90) values against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive E. coli. E. coli susceptibility to most antimicrobial agents decreased over the course of this study.
TI  - Application of microbial source tracking methods in a Gulf of Mexico field setting.
AB  - AIMS: Microbial water quality and possible human sources of faecal pollution were assessed in a Florida estuary that serves shellfishing and recreational activities. METHODS AND RESULTS: Indicator organisms (IO), including faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci, were quantified from marine and river waters, sediments and oysters. Florida recreational water standards were infrequently exceeded (6-10% of samples); however, shellfishing standards were more frequently exceeded (28%). IO concentrations in oysters and overlaying waters were significantly correlated, but oyster and sediment IO concentrations were uncorrelated. The human-associated esp gene of Enterococcus faecium was detected in marine and fresh waters at sites with suspected human sewage contamination. Lagrangian drifters, used to determine the pathways of bacterial transport and deposition, suggested that sediment deposition from the Ochlockonee River contributes to frequent detection of esp at a Gulf of Mexico beach. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that human faecal pollution affects water quality in Wakulla County and that local topography and hydrology play a role in bacterial transport and deposition. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A combination of IO enumeration, microbial source tracking methods and regional hydrological study can reliably inform regulatory agencies of IO sources, improving risk assessment and pollution mitigation in impaired waters.
TI  - Bacteriocin production by Pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from marula (Scerocarya birrea).
AB  - Strain ST44AM, isolated from marula, was identified as Pediococcus pentosaceus based on biochemical tests, sugar fermentation reactions (API 50CHL), PCR with species-specific primers and 16S rDNA sequencing. Strain ST44AM produces a 6.5 kDa class IIa bacteriocin, active against lactic acid bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria innocua, Listeria ivanovii subsp. ivanovii and Listeria monocytogenes. The peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, Triton X-100, Triton X-114, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea, NaCl and EDTA. No change in activity was recorded after 2 h at pH values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees C for 120 min or 121 degrees C for 20 min. The mode of activity against L. ivanovii susbp. ivanovii ATCC19119 and Enterococcus faecium HKLHS is bactericidal, resulting in cell lyses and enzyme- and DNA-leakage. No significant differences in cell growth and bacteriocin production were observed when strain ST44AM was cultured in MRS broth at 26 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C for 24 h and tested against the same target strain. L. ivanovii subsp. ivanovii ATCC 19119 and E. faecium HKLHS did, however, differ in sensitivity to bacteriocin ST44AM (3.3x10(6) AU/mL and 2.6x10(4) AU/mL, respectively). Peptide ST44AM adsorbs at high levels (1600 AU/mL) to producer cells. Bacteriocin ST44AM may be a derivative of pediocin PA-1. This is the first report on the presence of P. pentosaceus in marula and a pediocin PA-1 derivative produced by this species. We are also the first to report on the synergetic effect ciprofloxacin has on a pediocin-like bacteriocin.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of tigecycline and comparators against bacterial isolates collected as part of the TEST study in Europe (2004-2007).
AB  - Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections as well as intra-abdominal infections. The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) is a global, longitudinal surveillance study established in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against key Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. This report examines data obtained for 24748 isolates collected across 24 European countries between 2004 and 2007. Tigecycline, meropenem and imipenem were the most active antimicrobial agents against most Gram-negative isolates including multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (15.7% of the A. baumannii isolates in this study), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (8.5% of E. coli) and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.6% of K. pneumoniae). Only amikacin was active against >90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (92.8% susceptible). Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin were the most active agents against Gram-positive agents across Europe between 2004 and 2007, with tigecycline displaying the lowest MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (26.5% of the collected S. aureus isolates), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (15.7% of the E. faecium strains) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.3% of the S. pneumoniae strains). Longitudinal analysis showed no increase in tigecycline MIC values over the 4-year study period, whilst increased resistance was noted for several comparator agents.
TI  - Characterization of the beneficial properties of lactobacilli isolated from bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) hatchery.
AB  - The present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a R. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. The bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis and Ent. faecium, and Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli) while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. The Lactobacillus plantarum and L. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. While L. plantarum CRL 1606 also inhibited red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. However, by using a MRS medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of H(2)O(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. The surface properties of Lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate ABO human erythrocytes, while the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. This paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of Lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.
TI  - [Removal of microorganisms by soil filters for bathing ponds].
AB  - "Bathing ponds" are artificial outdoor water pools without disinfection. Whereas  in conventional pools, chlorine promptly kills pathogens shed by bathers, such quick inactivation is missing in bathing ponds. We have explored the retention of indicator bacteria and viruses by a vertically operated, reed grown soil filter. After continuously running the filter with wastewater-spiked surface water, we found that the filter retains more than 99 % of the indicator organisms. It has been reported in the literature that the "spontaneous" inactivation of pathogens in water might be very variable depending on sunlight irradiation, water turbidity, etc. On the contrary, the performance of a filter like the one reported here allows filtering the water so as to reliably eliminate 90 % of the spiked microorganisms from the pool water within 24 hours.
TI  - Gene cloning and characterization of EfmA, a multidrug efflux pump, from Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - A DNA fragment responsible for resistance to antimicrobial agents was cloned from chromosomal DNA of Enterococcus faecium FN-1, a clinically isolated strain. Escherichia coli KAM32, a drug-hypersusceptible mutant, was used as a host for gene cloning. Cells of E. coli KAM32 harboring a recombinant plasmid (pTFM8) carrying the DNA fragment became resistant to fluoroquinolones, macrolides, ethidium bromide, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (TPPCl). Three complete open reading frames (ORFs) were found in the DNA insert of pTFM8, and the deduced amino acid sequences of one of the ORFs showed high similarity to Mdt(A) from Lactococcus lactis. Mdt(A) is a multidrug efflux pump belonging to a major facilitator superfamily. We designated the ORF efmA. E. coli KAM32 cells harboring the efmA showed energy-dependent efflux of DAPI and TPP(+). We also observed norfloxacin/H(+) antiport due to EfmA. The mRNA expression of efmA was observed in E. faecium FN-1 grown without any exogenously added antimicrobial agents. Thus, we conclude that efmA is constitutively expressed under laboratory growth conditions and would contribute to intrinsic resistance against multiple antimicrobial agents in E. faecium FN-1.
TI  - Bacterial diversity from benthic mats of Antarctic lakes as a source of new bioactive metabolites.
AB  - During the MICROMAT project, the bacterial diversity of microbial mats growing in the benthic environment of Antarctic lakes was accessed for the discovery of novel antibiotics. In all, 723 Antarctic heterotrophic bacteria belonging to novel and/or endemic taxa in the alpha-, beta- and gamma-subclasses of the Proteobacteria, the Bacteroidetes branch, and of the high and low percentage G+C Gram-positives, were isolated, cultivated in different media and at different temperatures, and then screened for the production of antimicrobial activities. A total of 6348 extracts were prepared by solid phase extraction of the culture broths or by biomass solvent extraction. 122 bacteria showed antibacterial activity against the Gram-positives Staphylococcus aureus and to a lower extent Enterococcus faecium, and versus the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Few of these strains showed also some antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus and to a lower extent Candida albicans. LC-MS fractionation of extracts from a subset of strains (hits) that exhibited relatively potent antibacterial activities evidenced a chemical novelty that was further investigated. Two strains of Arthrobacter agilis produced potent antibacterial compounds with activity against Gram-positives and possibly related to novel cyclic thiazolyl peptides. To our knowledge, this is the first report of new antibiotics produced by bacteria from benthic microbial mats from Antarctic lakes. With no doubts these microbial assemblages represent an extremely rich source for the isolation of new strains producing novel bioactive metabolites with the potential to be developed as antibiotic compounds.
TI  - Design and synthesis of new hydroxyethylamines as inhibitors of D-alanyl-D-lactate ligase (VanA) and D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase (DdlB).
AB  - The Van enzymes are ATP-dependant ligases responsible for resistance to vancomycin in Staphylococcus aureus and Enteroccoccus species. The de novo molecular design programme SPROUT was used in conjunction with the X-ray crystal structure of Enterococcus faeciumd-alanyl-d-lactate ligase (VanA) to design new putative inhibitors based on a hydroxyethylamine template. The two best ranked structures were selected and efficient syntheses developed. The inhibitory activities of these molecules were determined on E. faecium VanA, and due to structural similarity and a common reaction mechanism, also on d-Ala-d-Ala ligase (DdlB) from Escherichia coli. The phosphate group attached to the hydroxyl moiety of the hydroxyethylamine isostere within these systems is essential for their inhibitory activity against both VanA and DdlB.
TI  - Neopyrrolomycins with broad spectrum antibacterial activity.
AB  - Three new antibiotics, neopyrrolomycins B (1), C (2), and D (3), with potent activity against Gram-positive pathogens were discovered. They exhibited MIC values < 1 microg/mL versus a number of resistant strains. The compounds were obtained from the ethyl acetate extracts of a Streptomyces sp. after purification by column chromatography and RP-HPLC. Their structures were elucidated using X-ray crystallography (1) and NMR spectroscopy (2 and 3).
TI  - Failure of current antibiotic first-line regimens and mortality in hospitalized patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increases in Gram-positive infections and infections with Enterobacteriaceae with antimicrobial resistance have been reported in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). This study was performed to investigate the rate of treatment failures of recommended empirical therapies and the impact on mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospectively collected database comprising 101 patients with SBP (70 nosocomial, 31 community acquired) treated at a university hospital between 2002 and 2006 in Munich, Germany, was analyzed. RESULTS: 17 patients initially received a broader than recommended antibiotic regimen. Most of these were treated in the intensive care unit because of severe sepsis/septic shock. Hospital mortality in this group was 82%. A modification of therapy was necessary in 24 of the 84 patients receiving one of the published first-line therapies (cefotaxime, ampicillin/clavulanate, or ciprofloxacin). Mortality was significantly higher in these patients than in those with no change in treatment (66.7% vs 30%, p = 0.002). In 29 patients with positive cultures, mortality was also higher in those with an ineffective first-line treatment (90% vs 45%, p = 0.032). In the multivariable analysis, a modification of antibiotic treatment was an independent risk factor for mortality (odds ratio 5.876, 95% confidence interval 1.826-18.910, p = 0.003). In 41 culture-positive cases, the most commonly cultured pathogens were Escherichia coli (n = 17) and Enterococcus faecium (n = 10). Of the encountered bacterial microorganisms, 14 (33.3%) were resistant to cefotaxime, 17 (38.6%) were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, and 19 (45.2%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin. 29 (64.4%) of the isolates were resistant to one of the recommended firstline antibiotic regimens, and 11 (24.4%) of the isolates were resistant to all three. CONCLUSION: Recommended empirical antibiotic regimens fail to achieve the desired effect in a substantial number of hospitalized patients with SBP. This has a negative impact on mortality.
TI  - Blood stream infections in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: reemergence of Gram-negative rods and increasing antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Blood stream infections (BSI) are a well-known cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients. The aim of this study was to analyze etiology and microbial resistance of BSI in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT in a single center over a 4-year period (2004-2007). There were 168 episodes of BSI in 132 patients (median 10 days after HSCT) and 182 pathogens were isolated. Gram-positive bacteria (GPB) accounted for 57% of 182 isolates. Gram-negative rods (GNR) for 37% and fungi for 6%. All patients received routine fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. There was a significant decrease in GPB/GNR ratio over time, from 2.4 in 2004 to 1 in 2007 (P = .043). Among GPB, staphylococci decreased from 37 of 68 (64%) in 2004-2005 to 8 of 35 (23%) in 2006-2007 (P < .002). The Enterococcus faecalis/E. faecium ratio decreased from 4.5 in 2004 to 0.33 in 2007 (P = .006), whereas the total number of enterococcal strains per year did not change. The incidence of Escherichia coli among GNR increased from 3 of 15 (20%) in 2004 to 13 of 21 (62%) in 2007 (P = .003). Fluoroquinolone-resistance was common, both among GPB and GNR (81% and 74%, respectively). Mortality rate at 7 days after BSI was 11% (19 of 168), reaching 39% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa BSI (7 of 18). BSI remains a frequent and potentially life-threatening complication of allogeneic HSCT, the causative organism influencing 7- and 30-day mortality rate. BSI etiology may change rapidly, requiring implementation of new empirical-therapy schemes.
TI  - Monitoring major mastitis pathogens at the population level based on examination  of bulk tank milk samples.
AB  - The objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (BTM), as well as to clarify the relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (BTSCC). The purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for BTSCC at the population level. Samples of BTM were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). Staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. Based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. Counts of specific mammary pathogens in BTM samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. Significant differences were documented in BTSCC between BTM samples containing Str. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, and Str. dysgalactiae and BTM samples that were pathogen-free. Geometric means of BTSCC associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall BTSCC (Str. agalactiae 243 628; Staph. aureus 205 610; Str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). It follows that the somatic cell count (SCC) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall BTSCC. Environmental pathogens predominated in samples of BTM with SCC <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in BTM samples with SCC >300x103/ml. No correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and BTSCC. This study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of BTM in relation to BTSCC is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.
TI  - Probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermented dairy milks on antiproliferation of colon cancer cells.
AB  - Fifty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria obtained from fermented dairy milks were investigated for possible use as probiotics and for colon cancer biological products. Five of these strains inhibited growth of eight food-borne pathogens including Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium. Three of these strains survived at pH 2.5 and in 0.3% bile salts. Additionally they produced no haemolysis, were resistant to kanamycin and adhered to Caco-2 cells. 16S rRNA gene sequences of probiotic strains indicated that RM11 and RM28 were Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus fermentum, respectively. Both the cultured medium and live whole cells from probiotic strains were tested for antiproliferation of colon cancer cells through MTT and Trypan Blue exclusion assays. The probiotic strains of E. faecium RM11 and L. fermentum RM28 also triggered antiproliferation of colon cancer cells at the rates of 21-29%, and 22-29%, respectively. This suggested that both strains could be used as potential probiotics in functional food or for colon cancer biological products.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of fecal bacterial composition from surface water through aquifer sand material.
AB  - When bacterial pathogens from livestock contaminate drinking water supplies, they can cause different forms of gastroenteritis. The objective of this study was to enumerate the concentrations of fecal indicator (Escherichia coli and enterococci) in surface water in order to determine removal efficiency by sand filtration. The concentrations of different indicator bacterial species were determined after running tertiary treated water through two tanks containing aquifer material. Enterococcus faecalis primers targeting the ddl gene and primers for Enterococcus faecium were used to identify the two species in the samples. A PCR assay based on the partial sequence of the 13-D-glucoronidase gene (uidA) for specific detection and differentiation of E. coli populations was used to confirm the presence of E. coli after a biochemical test. The biochemical test overestimated the percentage of E. faecium in our samples, but the PCR assay with the ddl gene produced 100% specificity with Enterococcus faecalis. The biochemical test was 91.5% specific in identifying E. coli. The composition of indicator bacteria in Santa Ana River was dominated by intestinal microflora of humans and animals; filtration by aquifer sand material may reduce the transport of indicator bacteria from surface water to groundwater.
TI  - The D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase incorrectly annotated PanE is the sole reduction system for branched-chain 2-keto acids in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Hydroxyacid dehydrogenases of lactic acid bacteria, which catalyze the stereospecific reduction of branched-chain 2-keto acids to 2-hydroxyacids, are of interest in a variety of fields, including cheese flavor formation via amino acid catabolism. In this study, we used both targeted and random mutagenesis to identify the genes responsible for the reduction of 2-keto acids derived from amino acids in Lactococcus lactis. The gene panE, whose inactivation suppressed hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase activity, was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant His-tagged fusion protein was purified and characterized. The gene annotated panE was the sole gene responsible for the reduction of the 2-keto acids derived from leucine, isoleucine, and valine, while ldh, encoding L-lactate dehydrogenase, was responsible for the reduction of the 2-keto acids derived from phenylalanine and methionine. The kinetic parameters of the His-tagged PanE showed the highest catalytic efficiencies with 2-ketoisocaproate, 2-ketomethylvalerate, 2-ketoisovalerate, and benzoylformate (V(max)/K(m) ratios of 6,640, 4,180, 3,300, and 2,050 U/mg/mM, respectively), with NADH as the exclusive coenzyme. For the reverse reaction, the enzyme accepted d-2-hydroxyacids but not l-2-hydroxyacids. Although PanE showed the highest degrees of identity to putative NADP-dependent 2-ketopantoate reductases (KPRs), it did not exhibit KPR activity. Sequence homology analysis revealed that, together with the d-mandelate dehydrogenase of Enterococcus faecium and probably other putative KPRs, PanE belongs to a new family of D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases which is unrelated to the well-described D-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase family. Its probable physiological role is to regenerate the NAD(+) necessary to catabolize branched-chain amino acids, leading to the production of ATP and aroma compounds.
TI  - Environmental occurrence of the enterococcal surface protein (esp) gene is an unreliable indicator of human fecal contamination.
AB  - The enterococcal surface protein (esp) gene found in Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium has recently been explored as a marker of sewage pollution in recreational waters but its occurrence and distribution in environmental enterococci has not been well-documented. If the esp gene is found in environmental samples, there are potential implications for microbial source tracking applications. In the current study, a total of 452 samples (lake water, 100; stream water, 129; nearshore sand, 96; and backshore sand, 71; Cladophora sp. (Chlorophyta), 41; and periphyton (mostly Bacillariophyceae), 15) collected from the coastal watersheds of southern Lake Michigan were selectively cultured for enterococci and then analyzed for the esp gene by PCR, targeting E. faecalis/ E. faecium (esp(fs/fm)) and E. faecium (esp(fm)). Overall relative frequencies for esp(fs/fm) and esp(fm) were 27.4 and 5.1%. Respective percent frequency for the esp(fs/fm) and esp(fm) was 36 and 14% in lake water, 38.8 and 2.3% in stream water, 24 and 6.3% in nearshore sand; 0% in backshore sand; 24.4 and 0% in Cladophora sp.; and 33.3 and 0% in periphyton. The overall occurrence of both esp(fs/fm) and esp(fm) was significantly related (chi2 = 49, P < 0.0001). Post-rain incidence of esp(fs/fm) increased in lake and stream water and nearshore sand. Further, E. coli and enterococci cell densities were significant predictors for esp(fs/fm) occurrence in post-rain lake water, but esp(fm) was not F+ coliphage densities were not significant predictors for esp(fm) or esp(fs/fm) gene incidence. In summary, the differential occurrence of the esp gene in the environment suggests that it is not limited to human fecal sources and thus may weaken its use as a reliable tool in discriminating contaminant sources (i.e., human vs. nonhuman).
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline and other antimicrobials against Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms collected from the Asia-Pacific Rim as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST).
AB  - As part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST), Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms were collected from 31 medical centres in nine countries in the Asia-Pacific Rim between 2004 and 2007. Overall, 34.2% of Acinetobacter spp. were multidrug-resistant, and 17.0% of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 10.6% of Escherichia coli produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. A total of 39.5% of Staphylococcus aureus were meticillin-resistant and 21.7% of Enterococcus faecium were vancomycin-resistant. Tigecycline MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) were <or=2mg/L against Acinetobacter spp., K. pneumoniae, E. coli, Enterobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens and <or=0.25mg/L against S. aureus, E. faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Antimicrobial resistance is widespread in the Asia-Pacific Rim. Tigecycline has excellent in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including resistant strains.
TI  - Highly resistant microorganisms in a teaching hospital: the role of horizontal spread in a setting of endemicity.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence density of highly resistant organisms (HROs) and the relative contribution of horizontal spread in a setting of endemicity. METHODS: Prospective surveillance was performed among hospitalized patients during an 18-month period. Enterobacteriaceae, nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecium--all considered highly resistant, according to Dutch guidelines--were included. Epidemiological linkage and nosocomial transmission were determined on the basis of molecular typing and hospital admission data. RESULTS: From 119 patients, we recovered a total of 170 unique HRO isolates, as follows: Escherichia coli, 96 isolates; Klebsiella species, 11 isolates; Enterobacter species, 8 isolates; Proteus species, 9 isolates; Citrobacter species, 5 isolates; Pseudomonas species, 5 isolates; Acinetobacter species, 3 isolates; Morganella species, 2 isolates; Salmonella species, 1 isolate; Serratia species, 1 isolate; S. pneumoniae, 20 isolates; and S. aureus, 9 isolates. No vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was found. The incidence density was 4.3 HRO isolates per 10,000 patient-days. The majority of HRO isolates were unique, and nosocomial transmission was observed 4 times for highly resistant gram-negative bacilli (case reproduction rate, 0.05) and 4 times for penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae (case reproduction rate, 0.29). A stay on the intensive care unit was the main determinant for the recovery of an HRO. CONCLUSION: Nosocomial transmission of HROs was observed 8 times during the 18-month period. The intensive care unit was identified as the main reservoir of horizontal spread of HROs. This study shows that nosocomial transmission of HROs is largely preventable using transmission precautions.
TI  - NHSN annual update: antimicrobial-resistant pathogens associated with healthcare-associated infections: annual summary of data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006-2007.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency of selected antimicrobial resistance patterns among pathogens causing device-associated and procedure-associated healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) reported by hospitals in the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). METHODS: Data are included on HAIs (ie, central line-associated bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and surgical site infections) reported to the Patient Safety Component of the NHSN between January 2006 and October 2007. The results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of up to 3 pathogenic isolates per HAI by a hospital were evaluated to define antimicrobial-resistance in the pathogenic isolates. The pooled mean proportions of pathogenic isolates interpreted as resistant to selected antimicrobial agents were calculated by type of HAI and overall. The incidence rates of specific device-associated infections were calculated for selected antimicrobial-resistant pathogens according to type of patient care area; the variability in the reported rates is described. RESULTS: Overall, 463 hospitals reported 1 or more HAIs: 412 (89%) were general acute care hospitals, and 309 (67%) had 200-1,000 beds. There were 28,502 HAIs reported among 25,384 patients. The 10 most common pathogens (accounting for 84% of any HAIs) were coagulase-negative staphylococci (15%), Staphylococcus aureus (15%), Enterococcus species (12%), Candida species (11%), Escherichia coli (10%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6%), Enterobacter species (5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (3%), and Klebsiella oxytoca (2%). The pooled mean proportion of pathogenic isolates resistant to antimicrobial agents varied significantly across types of HAI for some pathogen-antimicrobial combinations. As many as 16% of all HAIs were associated with the following multidrug-resistant pathogens: methicillin-resistant S. aureus (8% of HAIs), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (4%), carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (2%), extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae (1%), extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli (0.5%), and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and E. coli (0.5%). Nationwide, the majority of units reported no HAIs due to these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Biodiversity of the microbial community in a Spanish farmhouse cheese as revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - The microbial diversity within Alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the Alpujarra mountains (Granada, south-east Spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community DNA. A collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analyses. Isolates on Man-Rogosa and Sharpe-agar (MRS), M17-glucose agar and Kenner Fecal (KF)-agar medium were identified by specific PCR or 16S rRNA gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. The predominant genus was Lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being Lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of Lb. plantarum and Lb. brevis. Other lactic-acid bacteria identified were Pediococcus urinaequi, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuc. mesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci Enterococcus faecium and E. devriesei. Cluster analyses of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. The Gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to Hafnia alvei species. The microbes occurring in Alberquilla cheese were also studied by PCR temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) of the 16S rRNA V3 region and partial 16S rRNA sequencing of the TTGE bands. The results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to Lc. lactis, Lb. paracasei, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. acidophilus and Enterococcus sp. The non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as Escherichia coli. All the Enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaAfm. On the basis of their antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of Ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin B105 and mesenterocin Y105, as revealed by PCR techniques.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the replication region of the pCIZ2 plasmid from the multiple bacteriocin producer strain Enterococcus faecium L50.
AB  - The sequence analysis of the 7383 bp plasmid pCIZ2 from Enterococcus faecium L50  enabled the identification of a DNA region involved in its replication. The structural organization of the pCIZ2 replication region is highly similar to those of well-known theta-replicating plasmids. It contains an untranslated region, the putative replication origin (ori), constituted by two sets of direct repeats of 12 and 22 bp (iterons), and followed by three open-reading frames (orf8 to orf10). orf8 encodes the replication initiation protein (RepE). The transcriptional start site of the replication locus was identified 13 nucleotides upstream of the repE start codon. A two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis analysis revealed pCIZ2 intermediates profile typical of the theta-type replication mechanism. Subcloning of different DNA fragments of the pCIZ2 replication region in Escherichia coli and, subsequently, in the plasmidless E. faecium L50/14-2 allowed the determination of the minimal replicon on a 1.2kb DNA fragment containing only the overall ori and repE which also act in trans. The involvement of orf9 in the plasmid copy number and in the plasmid stability was investigated. The pCIZ2 recombinant plasmids constitute narrow-host range shuttle cloning vectors (E. coli-E. faecium) that could be very useful for enterococcal genes studies, allowing an easy identification due to their histochemical recognition.
TI  - Effectiveness and kinetics of ferrate as a disinfectant for ballast water.
AB  - This study examined whether ferrate could meet the international standards for successful ballast water treatment, including final concentrations of less than 1 CFU/mL of Enterococci, less than 2.5 CFU/mL of Escherichia coli, and less than 1 CFU/100 mL of Vibrio cholerae. Pure cultures of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and V. cholerae, and a mixed culture of Enterococcus faecium and E. faecilis were grown in saline solution to simulate ballast water and were treated with dosages of ferrate ranging from 0.25 to 5.0 mg/L. A ferrate dose of 5 mg/L resulted in complete disinfection of all organisms tested, and smaller dosages were also very effective. Tailing was consistently observed, and the Hom's model (1972) appeared to most accurately represent the action of ferrate on these organisms. Salinity and pH did not adversely affect results, and regrowth was not a problem. Ferrate shows good potential as an effective disinfectant in the treatment of ballast water.
TI  - Differential correlation between rates of antimicrobial drug consumption and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in a tertiary care hospital in Greece.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there is a correlation between the rates of antimicrobial drug consumption in hospital departments and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among clinically important bacteria recovered in the hospital. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital in Greece. METHODS: Data on antimicrobial consumption (from January 2001 through December 2004) were expressed as defined daily doses per 100 bed-days. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterococcus faecium recovered during the same time period were calculated by the microbiology department. We then performed the following analyses: (1) a comparison of the consumption rates for different antimicrobial groups in individual hospital departments, (2) a comparison of the prevalence of resistance to different antimicrobials, and (3) a correlation analysis of antimicrobial consumption rates and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. RESULTS: The rates of antimicrobial consumption and the prevalence of resistance varied substantially among the hospital's departments. The annual rate of consumption for carbapenems correlated with the rate of consumption for glycopeptides and third-generation cephalosporins (P < .05). Among P. aeruginosa isolates, the prevalence of imipenem resistance correlated with the prevalence of resistance to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime (P < .05). The rate of carbapenem consumption correlated with the prevalence of imipenem resistance among P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates (P < .05). The rate of aminoglycoside consumption correlated with the prevalence of amikacin resistance among P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli isolates (P < .05). However, the rate of consumption for fluoroquinolones and glycopeptides had no correlation with the prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance among gram-negative bacteria or vancomycin resistance among E. faecium isolates. CONCLUSIONS: These data are suggestive of a differential relationship between antimicrobial consumption and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among various species and for various antimicrobial agents. These findings may help to optimize antimicrobial prescription policies in the hospital, especially in departments that have both high rates of antimicrobial consumption and a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - The culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  - AIM: Traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. AIM: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. METHODS: A cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. After surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. Identification of bacteria as well as computation of mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. Wilcoxon's paired and Chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. Positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (P<0.001). The microorganisms identified were Escherichia coli (14 cases) and Enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). Mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (P<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). Mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (P<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. CONCLUSION: The neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. This difference might be attributed to the presence of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the region.
TI  - [Treatment of lower limb osteomyelitis by a local bone substitute supplemented with antibiotics].
AB  - A seriously injured tsunami victim with complicated osteomyelitis is presented. The patient was treated with a new resorbable bone substitute, which can be loaded with different antibiotics. The successful treatment is illustrated by the clinical, radiological and histological features. Bilateral open fractures of the lower leg with open elbow fracture led to a bilateral amputation of the lower legs and the right arm because of a beginning sepsis. The following intramedullary osteitis with multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium was treated with the bone substitute PerOssal combined with systemic and local application of vancomycin and systemic application of ceftazidime and meropenem. This case report illustrates the concept of an additional local antibiotic treatment of osteomyelitis by a bone substitute also functioning as a drug delivery system.
TI  - Monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in healthy dogs: first report of canine ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium clonal complex 17.
AB  - National surveillance programs on antimicrobial usage and antimicrobial resistance in animals have been established in various countries but few of them include bacteria from pets. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in healthy dogs and to search for resistance phenotypes of clinical relevance. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. were isolated from faecal swabs obtained from 127 dogs. Disk diffusion was used to measure antimicrobial susceptibility in 117 Escherichia coli, 10 Enterococcus faecium and 51 Enterococcus faecalis of canine origin. Resistance was relatively low compared with food animal species in Denmark. All Escherichia coli isolates were susceptible to broad-spectrum aminopenicillins, third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Despite the low prevalence of resistance, statistical analysis of questionnaire data revealed a significant association (p=0.02) between recent antimicrobial treatment and resistance in Escherichia coli. Interestingly, two dogs were found to shed Enterococcus faecium resistant to ampicillin. Multilocus sequence typing of these isolates indicated that the two isolates belonged to sequence types associated with human nosocomial infections, and one (ST-192) was genetically related to human epidemic clonal complex 17. The detection of ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium warrants further studies on the prevalence of these bacteria in dogs and on the possible implications to both animal and human health. The results suggest that distinct methods for detection and assessment of antimicrobial resistance in animals should be considered depending on the target animal species and the purposes of the study.
TI  - Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. in raw milk produced in Brazil: occurrence and interference of indigenous microbiota in their isolation and development.
AB  - This study aimed to verify the occurrence of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. in raw milk produced in Brazil. On account of the poor microbiological quality of this product, possible interference from the indigenous microbiota in these pathogens was also evaluated. Two-hundred and ten raw milk samples were collected in four important milk-producing areas in Brazil, tested for L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. presence, and for enumeration of indicator microorganisms: mesophilic aerobes, total coliforms and Escherichia coli. The interference of the indigenous microbiota in the isolation procedures was also tested, as well the frequency of naturally occurring raw milk strains with antagonistic activity against both pathogens. The pathogens were not isolated in any raw milk sample, but poor microbiological quality was confirmed by the high levels of indicator microorganisms. When present at high levels, the indigenous microbiota generated an evident interference in the methodologies of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. isolation, mainly when the pathogens appeared at low levels. Three-hundred and sixty raw milk strains were tested for antagonistic activity against both pathogens, and 91 (25.3%) showed inhibitory activity against L. monocytogenes and 33 (9.2%) against Salmonella spp. The majority of the antagonistic strains were identified as Lactic Acid Bacteria species, mainly Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Enterococcus faecium, known by antimicrobial substance production.
TI  - Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.
AB  - According to the German definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. Numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of L. casei or the L. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, certain enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) and the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. Among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are basic mechanisms. They are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. In addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. Well-established probiotic effects are: 1. Prevention and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. Reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. Prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. Beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, Helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. Normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. Prevention or alleviation of allergies and atopic diseases in infants. 7. Prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. Insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). A prebiotic is "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. Today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for prebiotic classification. They are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. Other health effects of prebiotics (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect, i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. In the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.
TI  - Medical-grade honey kills antibiotic-resistant bacteria in vitro and eradicates skin colonization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance among microbes urgently necessitates the development of novel antimicrobial agents. Since ancient times, honey has been used successfully for treatment of infected wounds, because of its antibacterial activity. However, large variations in the in vitro antibacterial activity of various honeys have been reported and hamper its acceptance in modern medicine. METHODS: We assessed the in vitro bactericidal activity of Revamil (Bfactory), a medical-grade honey produced under controlled conditions, and assessed its efficacy for reduction of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers in a within-subject-controlled trial. RESULTS: With Bacillus subtilis as a test strain, we demonstrated that the variation in bactericidal activity of 11 batches of medical-grade honey was <2-fold. Antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella oxytoca were killed within 24 h by 10%-40% (vol/vol) honey. After 2 days of application of honey, the extent of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers was reduced 100-fold (P < .001), and the numbers of positive skin cultures were reduced by 76% (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Revamil is a promising topical antimicrobial agent for prevention or treatment of infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Chemical and microbial decontamination of pool water using activated potassium peroxymonosulfate.
AB  - Potassium peroxymonosulfate activation leads to the formation of highly reactive  species, mainly the sulfate radicals. Activated potassium peroxymonosulfate (from now on peroxymonosulfate) was tested against specific pollutants such as ammonium ion, creatinine, chlorinated creatinine products, arginine and Escherichia coli (E. coli), all constituents or derivatives of human discharges. The objective was to assess whether activated peroxymonosulfate can be a viable treatment reagent in recreational water applications. It was found that organic molecules such as creatinine, chlorinated creatinine products and arginine could be effectively treated with activated peroxymonosulfate. Ammonium ion was oxidized only by chlorine species and only in de-ionized water. Chlorine species were formed from the reaction of sulfate radicals with chloride ions. In pool water, the reaction of sulfate radicals with chloride ions and the subsequent ammonium ion oxidation were scavenged by the presence of bicarbonate ions. The Co/Peroxymonosulfate system was also shown to be an effective disinfection reagent, since 99.99% (4-log) kill of E. coli was achieved in 60 min of treatment. At the concentrations tested here, however, it is still not efficacious enough to qualify as an EPA-registered sanitizer for swimming pools (requires 6-log kill of E. coli, ATCC 11229, and Enterococcus faecium, ATCC 6569, in 30s).
TI  - Empiric antibiotic therapy for seawater injuries: a four-seasonal analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous seawater studies found Vibrio species associated with morbidity, suggesting that seawater-contaminated wounds should be treated early. The purpose of this study was to identify common seawater pathogens and antibiotic sensitivities to provide empiric antibiotic therapy until patient-specific culture results are available. METHODS: Seasonal samples were collected from 25 Galveston beach locations and cultured. Colonies were identified and sensitivities were performed using MicroScan Positive and Negative Breakpoint Combo Panels. RESULTS: In the fall (28.3 degrees C), of 15 species isolated, the three most common isolates were Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Gram-negative isolates were sensitive to levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and cefepime. Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to penicillin and ampicillin. In the winter (11.1 degrees C), of 14 species isolated, the three most common isolates were Enterobacter agglomerans, E. faecium, and E. coli. Gram-negative isolates were sensitive to levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and cefepime. Most Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to vancomycin, levofloxacin, penicillin, and ampicillin. In the spring (26.6 degrees C), of 14 species isolated, the three most common isolates were E. coli, Bacillus species, and E. faecium. Gram-negative isolates were sensitive to levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and cefepime. Most Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. In the summer (29.7 degrees C), of 17 bacterial species isolated, the three most common isolates were Bacillus species, Enterobacter cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Gram-negative isolates were sensitive to cefepime, lomefloxacin, and levofloxacin. Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and chloramphenicol. CONCLUSIONS: Cultured pathogens were sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, or levofloxacin. The authors recommend a combination of penicillin or ampicillin with levofloxacin for empiric antibiotic coverage for seawater-contaminated injuries.
TI  - Qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the role of Qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins (PRPs) from several gram-positive species with quinolone resistance in vitro. METHODS: A PCR-based strategy was used to clone and express genes coding for Qnr-like PRPs in Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis in Escherichia coli DH10B. MIC values of nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones were determined for reference strains and E. coli DH10B harbouring recombinant plasmids containing genes coding for PRPs. RESULTS: Amino acid identity of Qnr-like PRPs in gram-positive strains compared with that of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants QnrA1, QnrB1 and QnrS1 was in the range of 16% to 22%. Recombinant plasmids coding for Qnr-like PRPs conferred reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (in the range of 0.016 to 0.064 mg/L for ciprofloxacin) and nalidixic acid (from 6 to 12 mg/L), depending on the antimicrobial agent and PRP. The PRP from B. subtilis showed no protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: The PRPs analysed conferred a reduced susceptibility phenotype in E. coli; the data provide further evidence of the possible roles in quinolone resistance of PRPs from different gram-positive species. These gram-positive species may constitute a reservoir for Qnr-like quinolone resistance proteins.
TI  - Comparison of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli and enterococci isolates from the feces of livestock and livestock farmers in Japan.
AB  - Seven hundred thirty-nine animal strains and 662 livestock-farmer strains, consisting of Escherichia coli and enterococci, were examined for their pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial-resistance patterns. Two hundred fifty-eight and 203 PFGE patterns were found among 739 animal strains isolated from animals comprising broilers, pigs and cattle, and 662 human strains isolated from livestock farmers, respectively, from 27 farms in Japan. These results demonstrated that the PFGE patterns found among E. coli and enterococci strains from animals and livestock-farmers were heterogeneous and considerably diverse. The strains having both the identical PFGE pattern and the same drug-resistance pattern were defined as a single clone in this study. Seven types of E. coli and enterococci clones were shared among animals within the same farms and between the different farms housing the same animal species. The 25 strains (3.4%) of 739 E. coli and enterococci animal strains belonged to these seven types of clones. Only three types of E. coli clones were shared among animals between the different farms housing different animal species, but no identical E. faecalis or E. faecium clones were found between different animal species farms. The 15 strains (2.0%) of 739 E. coli and enterococci animal strains belonged to these three types of clones. Additionally, the 11 strains (1.5%) of 739 E. coli and enterococci strains isolated from animals were identical clones to strains isolated from livestock farmers of the same farm. These results suggest that the transmission of animal clones to livestock farmers or vice versa is less common.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of omiganan pentahydrochloride tested against contemporary bacterial pathogens commonly responsible for catheter-associated infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Omiganan pentahydrochloride is a cidal cationic peptide with a broad  antimicrobial spectrum, including yeast, currently in development as a topical agent for the prevention of catheter-associated infections. We evaluated the spectrum and potency of omiganan against pathogens commonly associated with such infections. METHODS: A recent (2005-06) collection of bacterial isolates originating from patients with bloodstream, respiratory tract, and skin and skin structure infections in US medical centres was evaluated by reference broth microdilution methods against omiganan and comparator agents. RESULTS: All tested gram-positive (390) and -negative (167) isolates were inhibited by < or = 128 and < or = 1024 mg/L, respectively, of omiganan. The agent was the most active against coagulase-negative staphylococci (range 1-8 mg/L; MIC(50/90), 4 mg/L) and inhibited all Staphylococcus aureus at < or = 32 mg/L (MIC(50/90), 16 mg/L). Omiganan was 16-fold more active against Enterococcus faecium than Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(50/90) results, 4/8 versus 64/128 mg/L, respectively). MIC ranges and MIC(50) potencies were unaffected by methicillin resistance in staphylococci, vancomycin resistance in enterococci, and penicillin resistance in streptococci. Omiganan potency was also unaffected by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production in Escherichia coli when compared with wild-type strains (MIC(50) values 32 mg/L), although a 4-fold increase was noted among ESBL-positive Klebsiella spp. (128 versus 32 mg/L, respectively). Wild-type Enterobacter spp. displayed higher omiganan MIC(50/90) results (64/512 mg/L) compared with AmpC-hyperproducing strains (32/64 mg/L). Carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant P. aeruginosa strains exhibited omiganan MIC(50/90) values of 128/256 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: At a 1% (10 000 mg/L) topical gel formulation, omiganan can be expected to inhibit all clinically relevant bacterial species producing catheter-associated infections (all MIC values, < or = 1024 mg/L), including those with antimicrobial-resistant phenotypes.
TI  - Diverse antimicrobial killing by Enterococcus faecium E 50-52 bacteriocin.
AB  - An effective bacteriocin was identified and characterized. Lactic acid bacteria were screened against Campylobacter jejuni. One bacteriocin producer, Enterococcus faecium (NRRL B-30746), was studied. The isolate was grown, and the bacteriocin was purified to single-band homogeneity. Biochemical traits indicated that the peptide was a Class IIa bacteriocin, and it was named E 50-52. The bacteriocin had a molecular weight of 3339.7 and an isoelectric point of 8.0. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of E 50-52 against C. jejuni, Yersinia spp., Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella dysenteriae, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus spp., and Listeria spp. ranged from 0.025 to 32 microg/mL. In therapeutic broiler trials, oral treatment with E 50-52 reduced both C. jejuni and Salmonella enteritidis by more than 100,000-fold in the ceca, and systemic S. enteritidis was reduced in the liver and spleen. The wide range of antibacterial activity of bacteriocin E 50-52 against pathogens provides a promising alternative to antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of DX-619, a novel Des-F (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of DX-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in China. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobials were determined by a CLSI recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were examined by the broth dilution method. Time-kill curves against representative isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. DX-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant Gram-positive cocci. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 against Enterobacteriaceae (except for Escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/L, which were comparable to other comparators. MBCs and time-kill curves showed that DX-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. There was no significant inoculum effect on MICs. But the activities of DX-619 against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic pH and human serum. DX-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including Gram-positive cocci, such as S. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.
TI  - Decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  Part II: new insights.
AB  - The second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. A simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast Candida albicans, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Neisseria sicca, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Gram-positive bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of Geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. A similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. Measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. Counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. Reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. The area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the Wartburg law depending on exposure time. Qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.
TI  - Screening of the enterocin genes and antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria in Enterococcus strains obtained from different origins.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of 139 Enterococcus isolates (48 E. faecium and 91 E. faecalis) obtained from canine feces, boiler meat samples, swine feces, wild waterfowl feces, and human feces were examined against respective bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Escherichia coli. Bacteriocin (BAC) production assay revealed that the antimicrobial activity against at least one of 6 indicator strains (BAC+ phenotype) was found in 51 (37%) isolates (29 E. faecium and 22 E. faecalis). Twenty-four of 46 isolates positive for at least one of the enterocin structural genes (entA, entB, entL50AB, and cylL) showed a BAC+ phenotype. The existence of other enterocins or nonenterocin factors was implied because the BAC+ phenotype was detected in a total of 27 Enterococcus isolates that had none of the enterocin genes tested. The antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative strains (Salmonella Enteritidis and E. coli) was detected in the 6 Enterococcus isolates that had either the entA, entB, entL50AB or cylL genes. Moreover, the proportion of the antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes among the cylL-positive E. faecalis isolates showing beta-hemolysis (10/16) was significantly (p<0.01) higher than among those lacking beta-hemolysis (2/15). The results suggested that certain characteristics are likely to be associated with the antimicrobial activity against specific organisms.
TI  - [Microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. Analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. METHODS: The species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the Severance Hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. Blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. Identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. Among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. Escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Enterococcus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The proportion of patients with Enterococcus faecium and K. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. Enterococcus, S. aureus and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. E. coli, Enterococcus spp., K. pneumoniae and S. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. Oxacillin-resistant S. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and imipenemresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii increased. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and S. aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, and K. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. The bacteremia due to Enterococcus, K. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii gradually increased during this period.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from Swiss veal calves at slaughter.
AB  - Bacteria with antimicrobial resistance can be transferred from animals to humans  and may compromise antimicrobial treatment in case of infection. To determine the antimicrobial resistance situation in bacteria from Swiss veal calves, faecal samples from 500 randomly selected calves originating from 129 farms were collected at four big slaughterhouses. Samples were cultured for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus sp. and Campylobacter sp. and isolated strains were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents by the minimal inhibitory concentration technique using the broth microdilution method. From 100 farms, data on farm management, animal husbandry and antimicrobial treatments of the calves were collected by questionnaire. Risk factors associated with antimicrobial resistance were identified by logistic regression. In total, 467 E. coli, 413 Enterococcus sp. and 202 Campylobacter sp. were isolated. Of those, 68.7%, 98.7% and 67.8%, respectively, were resistant to at least one of the tested antimicrobial agents. Resistance was mainly observed to antimicrobials frequently used in farm animals. Prevalence of resistance to antimicrobials important for human treatment was generally low. However, a rather high number of quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter sp. were detected. External calf purchase, large finishing groups, feeding of milk by-products and administration of antimicrobials through feed upon arrival of the animals on the farm significantly increased the risk of antimicrobial resistance at farm level. Participation in a quality assurance programme and injection of a macrolide upon arrival of the animals on the farm had a protective effect. The present study showed that veal calves may serve as a reservoir for resistant bacteria. To ensure food safety, veal calves should be included in the national monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance in farm animals. By improving farm management and calf husbandry the prevalence of resistance may be reduced.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - Increase of granzyme B-positive cells in ascitic fluid of patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
AB  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) occurs as a direct consequence of bacteria entering ascitic fluid (AF) from the intestinal lumen trough in several ways, including the hematogenous and mesenteric lymph nodes route. There are few studies on the cytokine profile of ascitic-derived mononuclear cells of patients with SBP, particularly on granzyme B (GZB). The aim of the present study was to verify whether patients with SBP have GZB-positive cells, whether they are increased in patients with aseptic ascites, and their trend after antibiotic treatment. We enrolled 36 consecutive patients (24 males and 12 females) with SBP on histologically-proven hepatitis C virus cirrhosis (group A) and 20 patients (11 males and nine females with ascites, but without evidences of SBP (group B). The diagnosis of SBP was made according to the following criteria: positive colture in AF or blood (at least two cultures) and neutrophils in AF (>250 mL polymorphonuclear leukocytes). For these patients we used ELISpot to assay GZB production on purified mononuclear cells in ascitesand peripheral blood, coupled with tumor necrosis factor-alpha tested using ELISA. A non-parametric statistical analysis was used to assess significant differences and correlations. We found positive culture in all of the patients with SBP (80% Escherichia coli; 20% Enterococcus faecium). Furthermore, the patients in group A had a higher number of GZB spot-forming colonies than the patients in group B (P < 0.001). GZB-positive cells were lower in the peripheral blood than those found in the AF of patients with SBP, while no differences were found between blood and AF in group B. Furthermore, after antibiotic treatment, GZB was reduced in the patients with SBP (P < 0.05). In conclusion, GZB may be an important mediator of the immune response towards bacteria in AF and could be used as a diagnostic tool.
TI  - Combining targeted sampling and fluorometry to identify human fecal contamination in a freshwater creek.
AB  - Many bacterial source tracking (BST) methods are too expensive for most communities to afford. In an effort to develop an inexpensive method of detecting human sources of fecal contamination in a freshwater creek during baseflow and stormflow conditions, we combined targeted sampling with fluorometry. Targeted sampling is a prelude to BST and finds sources of fecal contamination by continued sampling and resampling over ever-decreasing distances. Fluorometry identifies human fecal contamination in water by detecting fluorescing compounds, optical brighteners, from laundry detergents. Potato Creek, a freshwater creek in Georgia (U.S.A.), had three reaches identified as containing high numbers of fecal bacteria, and these reaches were sampled by targeted sampling and fluorometry. Targeted sampling quickly and inexpensively identified humans, cattle, and dogs as the major sources of fecal contamination in the first, second, and third reaches, respectively. Fluorometric values were consistent with these identifications, but high fluorometric values were sometimes observed in areas with no fecal contamination. One likely cause of these false-positive signals was fluorescence from organic matter. For targeted sampling, the cost of each sample was $6, with a one-time equipment cost of $3,650; for fluorometry, the cost of each sample was negligible, with a one-time equipment cost of $14,250. This was the first study of this relatively inexpensive combination in freshwater during both baseflow and stormflow conditions.
TI  - Composition of intestinal Enterobacteriaceae populations of healthy domestic pigs.
AB  - In this study, the Enterobacteriaceae microbiota, including their diversity as well as the distribution of haemolytic and virulence gene-harbouring Escherichia coli of 56-day-old healthy piglets, was characterized. Both the composition and the diversity of Enterobacteriaceae populations varied considerably between individual pigs and intestinal sections. E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae dominated the Enterobacteriaceae microbiota. However, mucosa-associated Enterobacteriaceae were scarce or in some cases undetectable. The majority of E. coli clones from the jejunum were also found in the colon, with up to 10 different E. coli clones in one intestinal section. Other Enterobacteriaceae species were represented by only one clone localized to one intestinal section. While several piglets did not harbour virulence gene-positive or haemolytic E. coli, such strains dominated intestinal sections of other animals. This study reveals that the diversity of intestinal Enterobacteriaceae is clearly individual. In general, Enterobacteriaceae do not appear to be a consistent fraction of the microbiota of the jejunum. High numbers of adherent bacteria do not appear to be essential for successful intestinal colonization, and E. coli clones do not necessarily colonize distinct intestinal sections based on the particular phylogenetic affiliation. Furthermore, dominance of haemolytic or virulence gene-positive E. coli does not correlate with disease. Finally, probiotic Enterococcus faecium feed supplementation does not affect the Enterobacteriaceae microbiota.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Consumption of Camembert cheese stimulates commensal enterococci in healthy human intestinal microbiota.
AB  - Enterococci are natural inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract and the main Gram-positive and facultative anaerobic cocci recovered in human faeces. They are also present in a variety of fermented dairy and meat products, and some rare isolates are responsible for severe infections such as endocarditis and meningitis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of Camembert cheese consumption by healthy human volunteers on the faecal enterococcal population. A highly specific real-time quantitative PCR approach was designed and used to type enterococcal species in human faeces. Two species were found, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and only the Enterococcus faecalis population was significantly enhanced after Camembert cheese consumption, whereas Escherichia coli population and the dominant microbiota remained unaffected throughout the trial.
TI  - Contamination of milk by enterococci and coliforms from bovine faeces.
AB  - AIM: To determine the contribution of enterococci and coliforms from bovine faeces and teats to contamination of raw milk. METHODS: Putative enterococci (n = 301) and coliforms (n = 365) were isolated from bovine faeces (n = 20), cows' teats (n = 20), the raw milk (n = 1) and the milking environment (n = 4) on one farm. The clonal relationships of each bacterial group were investigated using Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis of genomic macrorestriction fragments. Representatives of the different clusters of enterococci were identified by molecular techniques including rep-PCR, SDS protein profiling, Fluorescent Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (FAFLP), phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase (pheS) sequence analysis and/or 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Coliforms were identified by API 20E strips. RESULTS: The majority of the bovine faecal enterococcal isolates were identified as a potential new species of Aerococcus (100 isolates); E. faecium (28 isolates), and Aerococcus viridans (28 isolates) were also found. All coliform isolates from the bovine faeces were identified as Escherichia coli. The coliforms present in the milk were Hafnia alvei, Serratia liquefaciens, Yersinia enterocolitica and Enterobacter amnigenus. No E. coli, Enterococcus or Aerococcus from the bovine faeces were found in the milk. A single clone of H. alvei was found in the water, the milking equipment and the milk, suggesting that the water was the source of the organism in the milk. No vancomycin-resistant aerococci or enterococci were found while most of the isolates tested showed the presence of at least one virulence gene. The milk-sock retained strains that adhered to particulate faecal material. Coliforms were present at approx. 2 orders of magnitude greater than enterococci in the bovine faeces. CONCLUSIONS: The results imply that bovine faeces are not an important source of contamination of raw milk with enterococci or coliforms. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results confirm those of two previous studies (Gelsomino et al. 2001, Int J Food Microbiol71, 177-188 and Kagkli et al. 2007, Int J Food Microbiol114, 243-251) on two other farms. The three studies show that contamination of milk by enterococci, lactobacilli and coliforms of bovine faecal origin is extremely low. The results also suggest that where raw milk is implicated in food infection, other factors in addition to faecal contamination must be involved.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance patterns of isolates from urine cultures at an oncological center].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the patterns of antimicrobial resistance of organisms isolated from urine cultures at a teaching oncological hospital for adult patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All strains obtained from urine cultures from 1998 to 2005 were included. Mean susceptibilities were obtained for each antimicrobial tested; nosocomial and community-acquired isolates were analyzed separately. RESULTS: A total of 9,232 positive urine cultures were obtained (20.7%) from 44,447 samples taken. Gram negative bacteria were reported in 78.8%, Gram-positive in 13.8% and yeasts in 7.4%. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated bacterium (41.3%); antimicrobial resistance was higher in nosocomial isolates than in community strains (amikacin 92.4 vs. 97%, ceftazidime 83.1 vs. 95.1% and ciprofloxacin 46.2 vs. 58.6%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed a greater resistance to amikacin and ceftazidime in nosocomial cultures compared to community-acquired bacterial cultures (55.7 vs. 66.6% and 65.5 vs. 84.8% respectively). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in only 2.5% (3 of 119 E. faecium isolates). CONCLUSIONS: Higher bacterial resistance was observed in nosocomial cultures than in community ones. Antimicrobial resistance was found to be progressively increasing for E. coli, the most frequent pathogen isolated both in nosocomial and community infections. We consider imperative the establishment of an intense educational campaign for the use and control of antibiotics.
TI  - Preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  - The aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. One hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. On the basis of these results, 80% alcohol, Octenidine 0.1%, and Chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. The results of the questionnaire revealed that Chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and Octenidine by 7% of the dentists. Using the in vitro model, with the exception of S. aureus, Chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. In contrast, the treatment with Octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. The 80% alcohol was more efficient. No growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. On the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or Octenidine using an incubation time of 15 min with ultrasonication.

TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among organisms from the Asia/Pacific Rim, Europe and Latin and North America collected as part of TEST and the in vitro activity of tigecycline.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe antimicrobial susceptibility among bacterial isolates associated with hospital infections collected from 266 centres in Asia/Pacific Rim (n = 1,947), North America (n = 24,283), Latin America (n = 1,957) and Europe (n = 8,796). METHODS: Isolates were collected from blood, respiratory tract, urine, skin, wound, body fluids and other defined sources between January 2004 and August 2006. Only one isolate per patient was accepted. In vitro MICs for the isolates were determined according to the CLSI (formerly NCCLS) guidelines. RESULTS: Key organisms collected were Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2,902), Enterobacter spp. (n = 5,731), Escherichia coli (n = 6,504), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4,916), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5,128), Serratia marcescens (n = 2,313), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 2,701), Enterococcus faecium (n = 1,035) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5,753). Rates of methicillin resistance among S. aureus and of vancomycin resistance among enterococci were highest in North America (2,016/3,809, 52.9% and 571/2,544, 22.4%, respectively) and lowest in Europe (337/1,340, 25.1% and 36/916, 3.9%, respectively). Tigecycline was the only antimicrobial to maintain activity against all Gram-positive isolates (MIC(90) values of <or=0.25 mg/L). Overall, tigecycline and imipenem were the most active (>93% susceptibility in all regions) antimicrobials against the Gram-negative species, except for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin were the most active against P. aeruginosa. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers among K. pneumoniae occurred most frequently in Latin America (124/282, 44.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline is a novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial that is active against the common organisms associated with infections.
TI  - Effects of tetracycline on antibiotic resistance and removal of fecal indicator bacteria in aerated and unaerated leachfield mesocosms.
AB  - Antibiotics can be present in low concentrations in domestic wastewater, but little is known about their effect on bacteria in onsite wastewater treatment systems. Mesocosms, consisting of soil-filled lysimeters representing the leachfield of a septic system under aerated (AIR) and unaerated (LEACH) conditions, were used to study the effects of tetracycline addition (5 mg L(-1)) to septic tank effluent on tetracycline resistance in the fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and fecal streptococci, and on their removal. The mesocosms were dosed with antibiotic for 10 days, and effects monitored for 52 days. The fraction of resistant bacteria in mesocosm drainage water relative to that in septic tank effluent, GammaRes, for E. coli ranged from 0 to 0.66 in the AIR treatment and from 0 to 3.32 in the LEACH treatment. For fecal streptococci, GammaRes ranged from 0 to 0.41 and from 0.63 to 1.06 in the AIR and LEACH treatments, respectively. No significant differences in antibiotic resistance of fecal indicator bacteria were observed among sampling dates in soil or water from either treatment. Tetracycline had no significant effect on removal of fecal indicator bacteria, which ranged from 99.9 to 100% for E. coli and from 95.9 to 100% for fecal streptococci. Our results suggest that short-term addition of tetracycline at environmentally-relevant concentrations is likely to have minimal consequences on pathogen removal from wastewater and development of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria in leachfield soil.
TI  - A novel bacteriocin-like substance produced by Enterococcus faecium 3587.
AB  - Secretion of a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance from Enterococcus faecium 3587 is described herein for the first time. Whereas some bacteriocins receive their denomination based on the species or genus name of the producer microorganism, the newly discovered bacteriocin-like substance was named "enterocin 3587." The growth characteristics of the producer strain, as well as the type of production and the primary characteristic of the peptide, were investigated. It was found by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that the molecule possesses a molecular weight <6.5 kDa; its secretion is growth-phase dependent; and it shows activities only against other closely related enterococci but not against other Gram-positive bacteria, such as L. innocua, S. aureus 209, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii B2, nor against some Gram-negative species, such as Escherichia coli HB101.
TI  - Are probiotics detectable in human feces after oral uptake by healthy volunteers?
AB  - GOALS: Assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on the host. As a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. STUDY: The feces of seven volunteers were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: E. coli Nissle 0.5-5 x 10(9) cells (Mutaflor), Enterococcus faecium SF 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (Bioflorin), Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (Infloran), Lactobacillus gasseri and Bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (Omniflora), Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (Antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with Lactobacillus casei Immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (Actimel). Ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and DNA was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. RESULTS: Fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of Mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking Bioflorin, and from 1/6 after Infloran. Cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of Antibiophilus, Omniflora and Actimel. CONCLUSIONS: After oral consumption of probiotics, E. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). In contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.
TI  - Many fructosamine 3-kinase homologues in bacteria are ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases potentially involved in protein deglycation.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to identify the function of bacterial homologues of  fructosamine 3-kinase (FN3K), a mammalian enzyme responsible for the removal of fructosamines from proteins. FN3K homologues were identified in approximately 200 (i.e. approximately 27%) of the sequenced bacterial genomes. In 11 of these genomes, from phylogenetically distant bacteria, the FN3K homologue was immediately preceded by a low-molecular-weight protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (LMW-PTP) homologue, which is therefore probably functionally related to the FN3K homologue. Five bacterial FN3K homologues (from Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Staphylococcus aureus and Thermus thermophilus) were overexpressed in E. coli, purified and their kinetic properties investigated. Four were ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases acting best on free lysine and cadaverine derivatives, but not on ribulosamines bound to the alpha amino group of amino acids. They also phosphorylated protein-bound ribulosamines or erythrulosamines, but not protein-bound fructosamines, therefore having properties similar to those of mammalian FN3K-related protein. The E. coli FN3K homologue (YniA) was inactive on all tested substrates. The LMW-PTP of T. thermophilus, which forms an operon with an FN3K homologue, and an LMW-PTP of S. aureus (PtpA) were overexpressed in E. coli, purified and shown to dephosphorylate not only protein tyrosine phosphates, but protein ribulosamine 5-phosphates as well as free ribuloselysine 5-phosphate and erythruloselysine 4-phosphate. These LMW-PTPs were devoid of ribulosamine 3-phosphatase activity. It is concluded that most bacterial FN3K homologues are ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases. They may serve, in conjunction with a phosphatase, to deglycate products of glycation formed from ribose 5-phosphate or erythrose 4-phosphate.
TI  - Predicting microbial heat inactivation under nonisothermal treatments.
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop an equation that accurately predicts microbial heat inactivation under nonisothermal treatments at constantly rising heating rates (from 0.5 to 5 degrees C/min) in media with different pH values (4.0 or 7.4). The survival curves of all bacteria (Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Senftenberg 775W, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) tested under isothermal treatments were nearly linear. For the most heat-resistant microorganism (E. faecium), the estimated DT-values at pH 7.4 were at least 100 times those of the second most thermotolerant microorganism (Salmonella Senftenberg 775W). The heat resistance of E. faecium was up to 30 times lower at pH 4.0 than at pH 7.4. However, E. faecium was still the most heat-resistant microorganism under nonisothermal treatments at both pH values. Inactivation under nonisothermal conditions was not accurately estimated from heat resistance parameters of isothermal treatments when microbial adaptation or sensibilization occurred during the heating up lag phases. The under-prediction of the number of survivors might be greater than 15 log CFU within the nonisothermal treatment conditions investigated. Therefore, the nonisothermal survival curves of the most heat-resistant microorganisms were fitted with the following equation: log S(t) = -(t/delta)P. This equation accurately described the survival curves of all the bacteria tested. We observed a linear relationship between the log of the scale parameter (delta) and the log of the heating rate. A p value characteristic of each microorganism and pH tested was calculated. Two equations capable of predicting the inactivation rate of all bacteria tested under nonisothermal treatments at pH 7.4, 5.5, or 4.0 were developed. The model was evaluated in skim milk and apple juice. The results of this study could be used to help minimize public health risks and to extend the shelf life of those foods requiring long heating up lag phases during processing.
TI  - [PCR MP (PCR melting profile) technique--possibilities of application in epidemiological studies].
AB  - The performance and convenience of a PCR melting profile (PCR MP) technique based on using low denaturation temperatures during ligation mediated PCR (LM PCR) of bacterial DNA is shown. We found that PCR MP technique is a rapid method that offers good discriminatory power, excellent reproducibility and may be applied for epidemiological studies. Results from strain genotyping illustrate that PCR MP is useful for the study of intraspecific genetic relatedness of strains and is as effective in discriminating closely related strains as the PFGE method, which is currently considered to be the gold standard for epidemiological studies. The usefulness of the PCR MP for molecular typing was shown for clinical strains of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium VRE and Stapylococcus aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) against bacteria with defined resistance mechanisms and phenotypes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an N-phosphono prodrug. We investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. METHODS: MICs were determined by CLSI agar dilution, but with varied inocula. Mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. RESULTS: MICs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were 0.5-2 mg/L, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/L for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/L, respectively. Even with 2% NaCl added, all MRSA were susceptible at 2 mg/L. MICs for Enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/L; E. faecium was resistant. MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Morganella morganii and Proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/L versus 0.12-1 mg/L for Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter spp. and 2-8 mg/L for Acinetobacter spp. MICs rose to 1-2 mg/L for many Enterobacteriaceae with classical TEM beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), hyperproduced AmpC or K1 enzymes. MICs for strains with classical TEM/SHV beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with ESBLs. Resistance due to Class A beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. Geometric mean MICs were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/L for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised MICs for beta-lactamase-positive Moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. Ceftaroline selected AmpC-derepressed Enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected ESBL variants of blaTEM in E. coli. Resistance selection was not seen with S. aureus, H. influenzae or pneumococci. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftaroline has impressive anti-MRSA and anti-pneumococcal activity. Slight lability to classical TEM and SHV beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by ESBLs. Resistance selection occurred with Enterobacteriaceae, not MRSA.
TI  - Confirmation of putative stormwater impact on water quality at a Florida beach by microbial source tracking methods and structure of indicator organism populations.
AB  - The effect of a stormwater conveyance system on indicator bacteria levels at a Florida beach was assessed using microbial source tracking methods, and by investigating indicator bacteria population structure in water and sediments. During a rain event, regulatory standards for both fecal coliforms and Enterococcus spp. were exceeded, contrasting with significantly lower levels under dry conditions. Indicator bacteria levels were high in sediments under all conditions. The involvement of human sewage in the contamination was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the esp gene of Enterococcus faecium and for the conserved T antigen of human polyomaviruses, all of which were negative. BOX-PCR subtyping of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus showed higher population diversity during the rain event; and higher population similarity during dry conditions, suggesting that without fresh inputs, only a subset of the population survives the selective pressure of the secondary habitat. These data indicate that high indicator bacteria levels were attributable to a stormwater system that acted as a reservoir and conduit, flushing high levels of indicator bacteria to the beach during a rain event. Such environmental reservoirs of indicator bacteria further complicate the already questionable relationship between indicator organisms and human pathogens, and call for a better understanding of the ecology, fate and persistence of indicator bacteria.
TI  - Chronic endometritis: correlation among hysteroscopic, histologic, and bacteriologic findings in a prospective trial with 2190 consecutive office hysteroscopies.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the type and etiopathogenic role of infectious agents detected in endometrial cultures obtained from women with chronic endometritis (CE). DESIGN: Prospective controlled study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): 2190 women undergoing hysteroscopy for different indications. INTERVENTION(S): Vaginal and endometrial samples were collected from 438 women with a CE diagnosis at hysteroscopy and 100 women with no signs of CE (controls). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Histology and cultures for common bacteria, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma, and molecular biology testing for Chlamydia were performed. RESULT(S): We compared results of vaginal and intrauterine cultures obtained from women with and without CE. Histologic results were positive in 388 of these cases (88.6%), and at least one microorganism was found in 320 endometrial samples (73.1%). In the control group, histologic results and endometrial culture were positive in only 6% and 5% of cases, respectively. The most frequent infectious agents detected at the endometrial level were common bacteria (58% of cases). Ureaplasma urealyticum was detected in 10% and Chlamydia in only 2.7% of positive endometrial cultures. In only 143 (32.6%) cases were the same infectious agent isolated in endometrial and vaginal cultures. CONCLUSION(S): More than 70% of CE cases resulted from nongonococcal, nonchlamydial infections. Common bacteria and Mycoplasma were the most frequent etiologic agents. Vaginal cultures have low concordance with endometrial cultures.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of a small library of nojirimycin-derived bicyclic iminosugars.
AB  - Novel nojirimycin-derived bicyclic structures, containing cyclic carbamate, urea  and guanidine moieties have been synthesised starting from suitably protected alpha-C-vinylnojirimycin and alpha-C-allylnojirimycin, respectively, and their biological activity against different glycosidases and as antibacterial agents tested.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Detection of aortic graft infection by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography.
AB  - Functional in vivo molecular imaging is provided with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), which can detect cells with high glucose turnover. FDG-PET is an established imaging tool in oncology but has also been used in infectious and inflammatory diseases. PET combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) shows the metabolic activity with precise anatomic localization. More than 2000 scanners have now been installed worldwide, and with better availability, this hybrid method has the potential to become an important imaging tool in the management of suspected aortic graft infections, especially in patients with low-grade graft infection. We report a patient with a suspected aortic graft infection that was confirmed and anatomically localized by FDG-PET/CT. An extra-anatomic bypass and extirpation of the aortic graft was performed. The perioperative location of the graft infection coincided exactly with the place of FDG uptake shown on PET/CT. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and did well during 6 months of follow-up.
TI  - A new antibacterial compound produced by an indigenous marine bacteria--fermentation, isolation, and biological activity.
AB  - The use of microorganisms for biological purpose has become an effective alternative to control pathogens. A marine bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from Eal fish of Baluchistan coast of Pakistan. This strain produced a bactericidal antibiotic against environmental and clinical isolates. In this study, we purified bactericidal antibiotic from the ethyl acetate extract of the cells of P. aeruginosa and analyzed its chemical structure. Based on spectrometric analysis, this compound 1 is proposed to be 1-methyl-1,4 dihydroquinoline and is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio aliginolyticus, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter faecium but it is not active against G streptococci, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger. Minimal inhibitory concentration for Gram-positive bacteria was between 50 and 75 microg mL(-1) and for Gram-negative bacteria 75-100 microg mL(-1).
TI  - Identification of the L,D-transpeptidases responsible for attachment of the Braun lipoprotein to Escherichia coli peptidoglycan.
AB  - The L,D-transpeptidase Ldt(fm) catalyzes peptidoglycan cross-linking in beta-lactam-resistant mutant strains of Enterococcus faecium. Here, we show that in Escherichia coli Ldt(fm) homologues are responsible for the attachment of the Braun lipoprotein to murein, indicating that evolutionarily related domains have been tailored to use muropeptides or proteins as acyl acceptors in the L,D-transpeptidation reaction.
TI  - Treatment options for primary infected aorta.
AB  - A 71-year-old man, with a history of anterior-perineal bowel resection for previous malignancy, presented with a septic picture and back pain. Investigations revealed a primary infected aorta. At laparotomy an ileocolic tumor was also discovered and resected. Blood cultures prior to the operation were positive for Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium was cultured from the actual aorta.
TI  - Electrochemical detection of harmful algae and other microbial contaminants in coastal waters using hand-held biosensors.
AB  - Standard methods to identify microbial contaminants in the environment are slow,  laborious, and can require specialized expertise. This study investigated electrochemical detection of microbial contaminants using commercially available, hand-held instruments. Electrochemical assays were developed for a red tide dinoflagellate (Karenia brevis), fecal-indicating bacteria (Enterococcus spp.), markers indicative of human sources of fecal pollution (human cluster Bacteroides and the esp gene of Enterococcus faecium), bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus), and a viral pathogen (adenovirus). For K. brevis, two assay formats (Rapid PCR-Detect and Hybrid PCR-Detect) were tested and both provided detection limits of 10 genome equivalents for DNA isolated from K. brevis culture and amplified by PCR. Sensitivity with coastal water samples was sufficient to detect K. brevis that was "present" (<or=1000 cells/l) without yielding false positive results and the electrochemical signal was significantly different than for samples containing cells at "medium" concentrations (100,000 to<10(6)cells/l). Detection of K. brevis RNA was also shown. Multi-target capability was demonstrated with an 8-plex assay for bacterial and viral targets using isolated DNA, natural beach water spiked with human feces, and water and sediments collected from New Orleans, Louisiana following Hurricane Katrina. Furthermore, direct detection of dinoflagellate and bacterial DNA was achieved using lysed cells rather than extracted nucleic acids, allowing streamlining of the process. The methods presented can be used to rapidly (3-5h) screen environmental water samples for the presence of microbial contaminants and have the potential to be integrated into semi-automated detection platforms.
TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics: effects on diarrhea.
AB  - Probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. Prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). Other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, certain strains of L. casei, L. acidophilus, Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) as well as the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. However, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. Perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.
TI  - In vitro growth control of selected pathogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus- and Lactobacillus casei-fermented milk.
AB  - AIMS: Food-borne pathogen inhibition was tested in the presence of a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei during fermentation under controlled pH conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis was evaluated for 48 h at 37 degrees C. In the presence of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), an increase of the generation time was observed for all the gram-positive bacteria evaluated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain showing an increase of the generation time by 210%. However, for all the gram-negative bacteria evaluated, no inhibition occurred after 8 h of fermentation. The soluble portion of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk was recuperated and tested for its antimicrobial activity. Listeria innocua and Staph. aureus were the most sensitive to the presence of fermented milk supernatant showing an inhibition of 85.9% and 84.7%, respectively. This soluble fraction was neutralized to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of the organic acids produced; the most sensitive strains were L. innocua and E. coli O157:H7 showing an inhibition of 65.9% and 61.9%, respectively. Finally, the soluble fraction was neutralized and irradiated at 45 kGy using a (60)Co source to eliminate the possible antimicrobial effect of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances. Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus were the most affected bacteria by this fraction, showing 39.1, 32 and 31.2% inhibition, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study suggest the implication of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances in the antimicrobial activity observed in the soluble fraction of the probiotic preparation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed the antimicrobial mechanisms of action of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  - The most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 Italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. The most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). Overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. Three bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. Other prevalent bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, while Acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) isolates. 7% of S. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Although E. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among Enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. All the Gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)=4 microg/ml. Almost 10% of Escherichia coli, 14% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of Serratia marcescens and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. Amikacin was the most active antibiotic against P. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. Finally, Acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). The results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in Italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital setting in Italy.
TI  - Actinomadura rudentiformis sp. nov., isolated from soil.
AB  - As part of an antibiotic-screening programme, the actinomycete strain HMC1(T) was isolated from soil collected from the banks of the Gamka River in the Swartberg Nature Reserve, Western Cape Province, South Africa. The isolate produced branching vegetative mycelia, which entwined to form rope-like structures. It exhibited antibiosis against Enterococcus faecium VanA (a vancomycin-resistant clinical strain) and Mycobacterium aurum A+. Organic solvent extracts of the culture filtrate and mycelial mass of strain HMC1(T) exhibited moderate antibiosis against Mycobacterium aurum A+, Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Tokyo) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv(T). The chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain HMC1(T) corresponded with those of members of the genus Actinomadura. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene showed that the strain was closely related to members of the genus Actinomadura. Phenotypic and 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses indicated that strain HMC1(T) represents a novel species of the genus Actinomadura, for which the name Actinomadura rudentiformis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HMC1(T) (=DSM 44962(T)=NRRL B-24458(T)).
TI  - Fluorescent reagents for in vitro studies of lipid-linked steps of bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis: derivatives of UDPMurNAc-pentapeptide containing d-cysteine at position 4 or 5.
AB  - UDPMurNAc-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-X-D-Ala-DAla (X = L-Lys or m-DAP) is the cytoplasmic  precursor for the lipid-linked cycle of bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis, consisting of at least four enzymatic reactions, which are targets for antibacterial agents. Fluorescent derivatives of the UDPMurNAc-pentapeptide labelled at the 3rd, 4th, and 5th position of the peptide chain were prepared chemoenzymatically, in order to study the reactions catalysed by enzymes in this cycle. Derivatives labelled on the epsilon-amino group of the 3rd amino acid (N-dansyl, N-fluorescamine and N-phthalaldehyde) were prepared by chemical modification. Two methods were developed for preparation of analogues of UDPMurNAc-pentapeptide containing D-cysteine at position 4 or 5: either by MurF-catalysed ligation of the UDPMurNAc-tripeptide to synthetic D-Ala-D-Cys or D-Cys-D-Ala dipeptides; or by enzymatic synthesis of D-Ala-D-Cys by ligase VanD. D-Cys-containing UDPMurNAc-pentapeptides were labelled with pyrene maleimide, to give 4-pyrene and 5-pyrene labelled derivatives. The fluorescent UDPMurNAc-pentapeptides were processed as substrates by Escherichia coli MraY or E. coli membranes, giving 1.5-150-fold changes in fluorescence upon transformation to lipid intermediate I. Subsequent processing to lipid intermediate II gave rise only to small changes in fluorescence. Pyrene-labelled lipid intermediates I and II can be generated using Micrococcus flavus membranes, enabling the study of the later lipid-linked steps.
TI  - Interplay among folding, sequence, and lipophilicity in the antibacterial and hemolytic activities of alpha/beta-peptides.
AB  - Host-defense peptides inhibit bacterial growth but manifest relatively little toxicity toward eukaryotic cells. Many host-defense peptides adopt alpha-helical conformations in which cationic side chains and lipophilic side chains are segregated to distinct regions of the molecular surface ("globally amphiphilic helices"). Several efforts have been made to develop unnatural oligomers that mimic the selective antibacterial activity of host-defense peptides; these efforts have focused on the creation of molecules that are globally amphiphilic in the preferred conformation. One such endeavor, from our laboratories, focused on helix-forming alpha/beta-peptides, i.e., oligomers containing a 1:1 pattern of alpha- and beta-amino acid residues in the backbone [Schmitt, M. A.; Weisblum, B.; Gellman, S. H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 6848-6849]. We found, unexpectedly, that the most favorable biological activity profile was displayed by a "scrambled" sequence, which was designed not to be able to form a globally amphiphilic helix. Here we report new data, involving an expanded set of alpha/beta-peptides, from experiments designed to elucidate the origins of this surprising result. In addition, we evaluate the susceptibility of alpha/beta-peptides to proteolytic degradation. Our results support the hypothesis that the ability to adopt a globally amphiphilic helical conformation is not a prerequisite for selective antibacterial activity. This conclusion represents a significant advance in our understanding of the relationship among molecular composition, conformation, and biological activity. Our results should therefore influence the design of other unnatural oligomers intended to function as antibacterial agents.
TI  - Construction of plasmid vector for expression of bacteriocin N15-encoding gene and effect of engineered bacteria on Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - A 6.09-kb plasmids vector pOri253 was constructed from the plasmid pIL253 (5.2 kb) and a 0.89-kb fragment of oriColE1 from pBluescript II KS. The bifunctional plasmid pOri253 conferred erythromycin resistance in both Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. It has unique sites for EcoRI, BamHI, SalI, and PstI derived from pIL253 and was lost at a low rate in E. faecalis JCM8726 when cultured in Man, Rogosa, & Sharpe broth without antibiotic. The lactococcal promoter P23 was inserted at one end of the pOri253 multicloning site. Gene expression was assessed by an entAI gene, which produced bacteriocin N15. The E. faecalis harboring constructed plasmid carrying P23 (pOrient23) had more antibacterial activity than parental E. faecalis JCM8726 and its clone harboring non-P23-containing plasmid (pOrient), as determined by means of an overlay method.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance surveillance: VIRA STUDY 2006].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two VIRA studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. METHODS: In February 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (365), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and Acinetobacter baumannii (92). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Susceptibility was determined with a broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Among the non-penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). Among MRSA, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin MIC of 4 microg/mL. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli was 12.1%. Resistance of A. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: These results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.
TI  - [Synthesis and antibacterial activities of 7-{4-[2-[2-substituted-4-((5S)-5-acetylaminomethyl-2-oxo-oxazolidin-3-yl)}-phenyl ] -ethyl]-piperazin-1-yl}-fluoroquinolones].
AB  - AIM: To find out new oxazolidinone-fluoroquinolone derivatives with high antibacterial activity. METHODS: Some 7-{4-[2-[2-substituted-4-((5S)-5- acetylaminomethyl-2-oxo-oxazolidin-3-yl)-phenyl]-ethyl]-piperazin-1-yl}-fluoroqui nolones were designed and synthesized, and their antibacterial activities were tested in vitro. RESULTS: Twenty target compounds were obtained and their structures were confirmed by 1H NMR and MS. The target compounds had high antibacterial activities in vitro, especially, the activity of compound 22 against Enterococcus faecium was 16-fold and 64-fold more potent than that of linezolid and norfloxacin, respectively, and its MIC value against Staphylococcus aureus was 4-fold lower than that of linezolid. CONCLUSION: The oxazolidinone-fluoroquinolone derivatives improved the antibacterial activities.
TI  - Improvement of enterocin P purification process.
AB  - Purification and heterologous expression of enterocin P (EntP), a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium, in Escherichia coli is described. PCR-amplified product of the enterocin P structural gene entP was cloned into plasmid pET-32b under the control of the inducible T7lac promoter. The neo-synthesized EntP was genetically modified by an addition of 3 extra amino acids, leading to recombinant EntRP. Active EntRP was recovered from the cytoplasmic soluble fraction of E. coli harboring appropriate recombinant plasmid, characterized by ELISA and Western-blot analysis and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. The use of E. coli as heterologous host and pET-32b as expressing vector offers promising tools for heterologous production of class IIa bacteriocin.
TI  - Comparison of BACTEC PLUS blood culture media to BacT/Alert FA blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  - Blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. This study compared the ability of Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD) BACTEC PLUS bottles and bioMerieux (Durham, NC) BacT/Alert FA bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow. Each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. The organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 CFU/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. Two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. Bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. Overall, the BacT/Alert FA system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the BACTEC PLUS system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. Both systems performed well in the detection of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. In the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. The results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the BacT/Alert system. For the BACTEC system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. Under these simulated conditions, the BACTEC PLUS system was superior to the BacT/Alert FA system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.
TI  - Enterococcus faecium EK13--an enterocin a-producing strain with probiotic character and its effect in piglets.
AB  - The experiment was conducted to determine the effects of the inoculation of the probiotic and enterocin A-producing strain Enterococcus faecium EK13 on selected parameters of metabolic profile, gut microflora, growth, and health in newborn piglets of Slovak White Improved. Piglets for study were divided into two groups: one group (EK13 group, n=8) received strain EK13 per os once daily for 7 days (2ml per piglet, 10(9)CFU/mL of saline buffer). The control group of piglets (n=7) was given placebo-saline buffer. The experiment lasted 14 days. After 7 days, strain EK13 reached 9.8 log(10) CFU/g in faeces of E. faecium EK13 treated piglets while counts of Escherichia coli were significantly lower (P<0.01) than in piglets of the control group. The concentrations of total serum protein, calcium, haemoglobin, haematocrit, red blood cell count and index of phagocytic activity of leukocytes were significantly higher after application of strain EK13. On the other hand, cholesterol was significantly lower in the EK13 group of animals. On day 14, piglets were killed and samples of intestinal contents were taken. Total counts of bacteria in the intestinal contents (jejunum, ileum, caecum, colon) were not significantly influenced. The pH value was significantly lower (P<0.05) only in duodenum of piglets receiving E. faecium EK13. There was a significant higher concentration of lactic acid (P<0.01) and propionic acid in the colon (P<0.001) of the EK13 group. Application of E. faecium EK13 did not influence the daily body weight gain significantly.
TI  - High prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and increase of imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. in Korea: a KONSAR program in 2004.
AB  - A nationwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted since 1997  in Korea. In this study, susceptibility test data generated in 2004 by KONSAR group hospitals were analyzed and compared to those at a commercial laboratory. In hospitals, the rank orders of organisms in 2004 were identical to those in 2003. The most prevalent species was Staphylococcus aureus (20.2%) in hospitals, but Escherichia coli (29.7%) in the commercial laboratory. The proportions of Enterococcus faecium to all isolates of Enterococcus faecalis plus E. faecium were 47.2% in hospitals and 24.9% in the commercial laboratory. The mean resistance rates of significant antimicrobial-organism combinations in hospitals were: oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (68%), oxacillin-resistant (penicillin- nonsusceptible) Streptococcus pneumoniae (68%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (25%), cefotaxime-resistant E. coli (14%), ceftazidime- and cefoxitin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (34% and 32%, respectively), and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 24%, respectively). In conclusion, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa were prevalent in 2004. Increasing trends were observed for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, cefoxitin- resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Certain antimicrobial- organism combinations were also prevalent among the commercial laboratory-tested strains.
TI  - Resistance of Enterococcus strains isolated from pigs to gastrointestinal tract and antagonistic effect against Escherichia coli K88.
AB  - The intestinal flora plays an important role in health and wellbeing of different organisms. Indigenous microflora can be innocuous or pathogenic. Consumption of food supplemented with beneficial microorganisms as probiotics provides a good health state and this can be maintained and recovered. Currently, probiotic strains of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus are widely used in humans as well as animals. Swine industry would benefit with the application of probiotics, mainly to overcome diarrheal diseases produced by different causes, as a pathogenic E. coli K88. The aim of this work was to isolate strains of Enterococcus from gastrointestinal tract of pigs to use them as probiotic. Two strains of E. faecalis, 2 of E. mundii and 7 of E. faecium were isolated with characteristics of resistance to acid pH, tolerance to biliary salts and a high antagonistic activity (>80%) against E. coli K88. Based on their characteristics and species affinity, we believe that these strains could be administered to pigs as a probiotic.
TI  - Seasonal persistence and population characteristics of Escherichia coli and enterococci in deep backshore sand of two freshwater beaches.
AB  - We studied the shoreward and seasonal distribution of E. coil and enterococci in  sand (at the water table) at two southern Lake Michigan beaches-Dunbar and West Beach (in Indiana). Deep, backshore sand (approximately 20 m inland) was regularly sampled for 15 months during 2002-2003. E. coli counts were not significantly different in samples taken at 5-m intervals from 0-40 m inland (P = 0.25). Neither E. coli nor enterococci mean counts showed any correlation or differences between the two beaches studied. In laboratory experiments, E. coli readily grew in sand supplemented with lake plankton, suggesting that in situ E. coil growth may occur when temperature and natural organic sources are adequate. Of the 114 sand enterococci isolates tested, positive species identification was obtained for only 52 (46%), with E. faecium representing the most dominant species (92%). Genetic characterization by ribotyping revealed no distinct genotypic pattern (s) for E. coli, suggesting that the sand population was rather a mixture of numerous strains (genotypes). These findings indicate that E. coli and enterococci can occur and persist for extended periods in backshore sand at the groundwater table. Although this study was limited to two beaches of southern Lake Michigan, similar findings can be expected at other temperate freshwater beaches. The long-term persistence of these bacteria, perhaps independent of pollution events, complicates their use as indicator organisms. Further, backshore sand at the water table may act as a reservoir for these bacteria and potentially for human pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Detection of human-derived fecal pollution in environmental waters by use of a PCR-based human polyomavirus assay.
AB  - Regulatory agencies mandate the use of fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli or Enterococcus spp., as microbial indicators of recreational water quality. These indicators of fecal pollution do not identify the specific sources of pollution and at times underestimate health risks associated with recreational water use. This study proposes the use of human polyomaviruses (HPyVs), which are widespread among human populations, as indicators of human fecal pollution. A method was developed to concentrate and extract HPyV DNA from environmental water samples and then to amplify it by nested PCR. HPyVs were detected in as little as 1 microl of sewage and were not amplified from dairy cow or pig wastes. Environmental water samples were screened for the presence of HPyVs and two additional markers of human fecal pollution: the Enterococcus faecium esp gene and the 16S rRNA gene of human-associated Bacteroides. The presence of human-specific indicators of fecal pollution was compared to fecal coliform and Enterococcus concentrations. HPyVs were detected in 19 of 20 (95%) samples containing the E. faecium esp gene and Bacteroides human markers. Weak or no correlation was observed between the presence/absence of human-associated indicators and counts of indicator bacteria. The sensitivity, specificity, and correlation with other human-associated markers suggest that the HPyV assay could be a useful predictor of human fecal pollution in environmental waters and an important component of the microbial-source-tracking "toolbox."
TI  - Five-year surveillance of nosocomial infections in Ankara Training and Research Hospital.
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the rate of nosocomial infections (NIs), frequency of nosocomial pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility changes in a 530-bed hospital over a five-year period. Hospital-wide laboratory-based NI surveillance was performed prospectively between 1999 and 2003. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definitions were used for NIs and nosocomial surgical site infections, and NI rates were calculated by the number of NIs per number of hospitalized patients on an annual basis. NI rates ranged between 1.4% and 2.4%. Higher rates were observed in the neurology, neurosurgery, paediatric and dermatology departments; the low rate of NIs overall may be due to the surveillance method used. The most commonly observed infections were urinary tract, surgical site and primary bloodstream infections, and the most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. Carbapenems were the most effective agents against enterobacteriaceae. Meticillin resistance among S. aureus isolates was less than 50%, and all S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. isolates were susceptible to glycopeptides apart from one glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium isolate identified in 2003. Data obtained by the same method enabled comparison between years and assisted in the detection of recent changes. Antimicrobial susceptibility data on nosocomial pathogens provided valuable guidance for empirical antimicrobial therapy of NIs.
TI  - Intracellular accumulation of linezolid in Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter aerogenes: role of enhanced efflux pump activity and inactivation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The oxazolidinone class of antibiotics such as linezolid have a narrow spectrum of activity that targets Gram-positive bacteria. We hypothesized that the poor activity of linezolid in Gram-negative bacteria is in part caused by relatively low intracellular concentration due to efflux. METHODS: Using whole cell accumulation assays we estimated the intracellular concentration of linezolid in Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae. We included test strains with enhanced RND-type multidrug efflux pump activity and with genetic inactivation of the pump or functional inhibition by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone as inhibitor of the proton motive force or 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (NMP), an efflux pump inhibitor. RESULTS: Consistent with susceptibility studies, enhanced pump activity caused decreased accumulation, and pump inactivation and inhibition caused increased accumulation, of linezolid. The accumulation levels in test strains of E. coli, Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter aerogenes with functional pumps were lower than in control strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium, but were higher after pump inactivation and correlated with ethidium bromide and pyronin Y accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: The intracellular concentration of linezolid is comparatively low owing to efficient efflux of the drug and could be increased substantially by inhibition of RND-type efflux pumps.
TI  - Purification and characterization of two bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from Mongolian airag.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to isolate and identify bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) issued from Mongolian airag (traditional fermented mare's milk), and to purify and characterize bacteriocins produced by these LAB. METHODS AND RESULTS: Identification of the bacteria (Enterococcus durans) was carried out on the basis of its morphological, biochemical characteristics and carbohydrate fermentation profile and by API50CH kit and 16S rDNA analyses. The pH-neutral cell-free supernatant of this bacterium inhibited the growth of several Lactobacillus spp. and food-borne pathogens including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria innocua. The antimicrobial agent (enterocin A5-11) was heat stable and was not sensitive to acid and alkaline conditions (pH 2-10), but was sensitive to several proteolytic enzymes. Its inhibitory activity was completely eliminated after treatment with proteinase K and alpha-chymotrypsin. The activity was however not completely inactivated by other proteases including trypsin and pepsin. Three-step purification procedure with high recovery yields was developed to separate two bacteriocins. The applied procedure allowed the recovery of 16% and 64% of enterocins A5-11A and A5-11B, respectively, present in the culture supernatant with purity higher than 99%. SDS-PAGE analyses revealed that enterocin A5-11 has a molecular mass of 5000 Da and mass spectrometry analyses demonstrates molecular masses of 5206 and 5218 Da for fractions A and B, respectively. Amino acid analyses of both enterocins indicated significant quantitative difference in their contents in threonine, alanine, isoleucine and leucine. Their N-termini were blocked hampering straightforward Edman degradation. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteriocins A5-11A and B from Ent. durans belong to the class II of bacteriocins. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Judging from molecular masses, amino acid composition and spectrum of activities, bacteriocins A5-11A and B from Ent. durans show high degree of similarity with enterocins L50A and L50B isolated from Enterococcus faecium (Cintas et al. 1998, 2000) and with enterocin I produced by Ent. faecium 6T1a, a strain originally isolated from a Spanish-style green olive fermentation (Floriano et al. 1998).
TI  - FT-IR microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potentials and limitations of Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1570 FT-IR spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. A classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium at the species level. An average accuracy of about 80% was reached with Gram negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae families; Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter koseri; and Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Results were comparable with FT-IR measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with FT-IR microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. Some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Combination of FT-IR microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in the southeastern Mediterranean--preliminary results from the ARMed project.
AB  - Sporadic reports from centres in the south and east of the Mediterranean have suggested that the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in this region appears to be considerable, yet pan-regional studies using comparable methodology have been lacking in the past. Susceptibility test results from invasive isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium and faecalis routinely recovered from clinical samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid within participating laboratories situated in Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey were collected as part of the ARMed project. Preliminary data from the first two years of the project showed the prevalence of penicillin non-susceptibility in S. pneumoniae to range from 0% (Malta) to 36% (Algeria) [median: 29%] whilst methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus varied from 10% in Lebanon to 65% in Jordan [median: 43%]. Significant country specific resistance in E. coli was also seen, with 72% of isolates from Egyptian hospitals reported to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins and 40% non-susceptible to fluoroquinolones in Turkey. Vancomycin non-susceptibility was only reported in 0.9% of E. faecalis isolates from Turkey and in 3.8% of E. faecium isolates from Cyprus. The preliminary results from the ARMed project appear to support previous sporadic reports suggesting high antibiotic resistance in the Mediterranean region. They suggest that this is particularly the case in the eastern Mediterranean region where resistance in S. aureus and E. coli seems to be higher than that reported in the other countries of the Mediterranean.
TI  - Modeling the transport and inactivation of E. coli and enterococci in the near-shore region of Lake Michigan.
AB  - To investigate the transport and fate of fecal pollution at Great Lakes beaches and the health risks associated with swimming, the near-shore waters of Lake Michigan and two tributaries discharging into it were examined for bacterial indicators of human fecal pollution. The enterococcus human fecal pollution marker, which targets a putative virulence factor--the enterococcal surface protein (esp) in Enterococcus faecium, was detected in 2/28 samples (7%) in the tributaries draining into Lake Michigan and in 6/30 samples (20%) in Lake Michigan beaches. This was indicative of human fecal pollution being transported in the tributaries and occurrence at Lake Michigan beaches. To understand the relative importance of different processes influencing pollution transport and inactivation, a finite-element model of surf-zone hydrodynamics (coupled with models for temperature, E. coli and enterococci) was used. Enterococci appear to survive longer than E. coli, which was described using an overall first-order inactivation coefficient in the range 0.5-2.0 per day. Our analysis suggests that the majority of fecal indicator bacteria variation can be explained based on loadings from the tributaries. Sunlight is a major contributor to inactivation in the surf-zone and the formulation based on sunlight, temperature and sedimentation is preferred over the first-order inactivation formulation.
TI  - Antibiotic-induced enterococcal expansion in the mouse intestine occurs throughout the small bowel and correlates poorly with suppression of competing flora.
AB  - To test the hypothesis that establishing gastrointestinal colonization with multiresistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) C68 results from expansion of the enterococcal population in the upper small bowel, we compared VRE quantities recovered from the proximal, middle, and distal segments of the small bowel from mice treated with different antimicrobial agents. Antibiotics associated with high-level VRE fecal colonization (cefotetan, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) increased VRE quantities in all small-bowel segments, whereas cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam did not. Enterococcal expansion did not correlate with reductions in numbers of native gram-negative or anaerobic flora. Green fluorescence protein-expressing E. faecium bacteria were found adjacent to the small bowel epithelial lining in colonized mice. These data indicate that enterococcal bowel colonization begins within the proximal small bowel and does not correlate with inhibition of other cultivable flora. Host or enterococcal factors induced by exposures to certain antibiotics may play a role in facilitating E. faecium colonization of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Dietary probiotic supplementation and resulting effects on performance, health status, and microbial characteristics of primiparous sows.
AB  - In an experiment with 33 first-litter sows from day 90 of pregnancy to day 28 of  lactation, the influence of a probiotic supplementation on weight performance, feed intake, litter sizes, litter weights, health status and microbiological profile was tested. Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 was supplemented in a concentration of 5 x 10(8) CFU/kg feed to the gestation and lactation diets of gilts. The supplemented sows showed a significant higher improvement of feed intake (4.16 vs. 3.71 kg/day), litter size (9.2 vs. 7.7 piglets) and weight performance. The average live weight of the probiotic sows at day 28 of lactation was 11 kg higher than of the controls. The bacterial counts/g faeces (lactobacilli, Gram-positive anaerobes, Gram-negative anaerobes, Escherichia coli and enterococci) and the incidence of adhesive and haemolytic E. coli organisms revealed no significant differences between the sows of the two groups or their piglets. While the litter size cannot necessarily be assumed as a primary effect of the probiotic supplementation, the significantly better feed intake and weight performance might be partly due to the probiotic use and can prevent "starvation sterility" of young sows after their first litter caused by reduced feed intake during lactation with high mobilization of body tissue accompanied with lack of energy.
TI  - Rise in antimicrobial resistance in invasive isolates of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium in Ireland.
AB  
TI  - DNA microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  - A DNA microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. A database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available DNA sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. Probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with DNA templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. Hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected DNA templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(SA) in B. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Antibiotic-resistance in Italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project AR-ISS].
AB  - The antibiotic resistance surveillance project AR-ISS, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country. The laboratories collect and transmit data to the Istituto Superiore di Sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis/faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed Escherichia coli. They also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. Results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study EARSS-Italia and from other European countries. Oxacillin resistance in S. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in Europe (41,5%). No strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. In S. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several European countries. Unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in E. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in Europe. Presumptive ESBL production in Gram-negative organisms can be estimated at 20% in Klebsiella and 1% in E. coli. Ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in Europe. In conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. Although some activities of AR-ISS need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and representative data about antibiotic resistance in Italy that can be used for comparison at the European level.
TI  - First genetic characterization of a bacterial beta-phenylethylamine biosynthetic  enzyme in Enterococcus faecium RM58.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium RM58 produces beta-phenylethylamine and tyramine. A gene from Ent. faecium RM58 coding for a 625 amino-acid residues protein that shows 85% identity to Enterococcus faecalis tyrosine decarboxylase has been expressed in Escherichia coli, resulting in L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine decarboxylase activities. Both activities were lost when a truncated protein lacking 84 amino acids at its C-terminus was expressed in E. coli. This study constitutes the first genetic characterization of a bacterial protein having L-phenylalanine decarboxylase activity and solves a long-standing question regarding the specificity of tyrosine decarboxylases in enterococci.
TI  - Predominance of Gram-negative bacilli and increasing antimicrobial resistance in  nosocomial bloodstream infections at a university hospital in southern Taiwan, 1996-2003.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While nosocomial infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, the availability of timely and accurate epidemiological information on nosocomial pathogens is essential to the appropriate selection of empirical therapy. This study analyzed nosocomial bloodstream infections (NBSIs) surveillance data to determine trends in the distribution of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these pathogens. METHODS: During the period from 1996 to 2003 at National Cheng Kung University Hospital, patients with NBSIs were enrolled in the study, and the ranking of pathogens and status of antimicrobial resistance were determined. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2003, there were 4,038 episodes of NBSIs. The overall incidence was 1.79 episodes per 1,000 inpatient-days. Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive cocci, fungi, and anaerobes were responsible for 51%, 37%, 10%, and 1.6% of NBSIs, respectively. The 5 leading pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16% of NBSIs), Staphylococcus aureus (13%), Candida spp. (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii (8%), and Escherichia coli (8%). Oxacillin resistance was found in 90% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 75% of S. aureus isolates. In contrast to Enterococcus faecalis, in which only 1% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 78% of Enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to ampicillin. The emerging antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative pathogens included multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, cephalosporin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli. Despite the annual increase in the use of fluconazole, Candida albicans (54%) remained the most common causative pathogen of nosocomial candidemia. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, Gram-negative bacilli predominated among pathogens causing NBSIs and an upsurge in the threat of antimicrobial resistance in our hospital occurred during the 8-year period. Surveillance of the characteristics of NBSIs and antimicrobial resistance patterns, together with appropriate antibiotic and infection control measures, should be reinforced.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in Enterococcus isolates from Batzos, a raw goat milk cheese.
AB  - This study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of Batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as Enterococcus durans. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Species recognition by means of RAPD-PCR was in agreement with the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. One strain was characterized as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by RAPD-PCR and four strains were grouped with the Enterococcus faecium reference strain. All strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. All strains exhibited antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited Enterococcus faecalis. Isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. However, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.
TI  - Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of Enterococcus faecium aminoglycoside-2''-phosphotransferase-Ib [APH(2'')-Ib].
AB  - Bacterial resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotics is primarily the result of deactivation of the drugs. Three families of enzymes are responsible for this activity, with one such family being the aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (APHs). The gene encoding one of these enzymes, APH(2'')-Ib, has been cloned and the protein (comprising 299 amino-acid residues) expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized in the presence of 16%(w/v) PEG 3350 and gentamicin. The crystals belong to the monoclinic space group P2(1), with approximate unit-cell parameters a = 79.7, b = 58.8, c = 81.4 A, beta = 98.4 degrees, and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis is consistent with the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Synchrotron diffraction data to approximately 2.65 A resolution were collected from a native APH(2'')-Ib crystal at beamline BL9-2 at SSRL (Stanford, CA, USA). Selenium-substituted crystals have also been produced and structure determination is proceeding.
TI  - Further increase of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. in Korea: 2003 KONSAR surveillance.
AB  - Monitoring temporal trends of antimicrobial resistance can provide useful information for the empirical selection of antimicrobial agents to treat infected patients and for the control of nosocomial infections. In this study, we analyzed antimicrobial resistance of clinically relevant bacteria in 2003 at Korean hospitals and at a commercial laboratory. The following organism-antimicrobial agent resistance combinations were very prevalent: oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (68%), expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), and fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli (33%), Acinetobacter spp. (58%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (40%). Moreover, gradual increases in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (20%), cefoxitin-resistant E. coli (10%) and K. pneumoniae (23%), and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (20%) and Acinetobacter spp. (13%) were also observed. The resistance rates of Acinetobacter spp. to most antimicrobial agents at hospitals and at the commercial laboratory were similar. Among the Acinetobacter spp. isolated at a tertiary-care hospital, 46.2% were multidrug-resistant to 9-12 of 13 antimicrobial agents, and 18.3% were panresistant. The exclusion of duplicate isolates at a tertiary-care hospital significantly lowered the proportion of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli.
TI  - Percutaneous drainage of infected pancreatic fluid collections in critically ill  patients: correlation with C-reactive protein values.
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of percutaneous catheter drainage, of early infected pancreatic fluid collections, in critically ill patients with severe acute pancreatitis. The patients in our series had a mean Ranson's score of 5.4. Nineteen (63.3%) of the 30 patients were cured with percutaneous drainage. In this group, the mean C-reactive protein value at the beginning of treatment was 172.8 U/l and 102.5 U/l at the end (P<.001). Cultures yielded multiple organisms in 23 patients (76.7%). The most frequently seen organisms were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium.
TI  - Performance, diarrhea incidence, and occurrence of Escherichia coli virulence genes during long-term administration of a probiotic Enterococcus faecium strain to sows and piglets.
AB  - As part of an interdisciplinary research project, the performance response of sows and their litters to the probiotic strain Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415, as well as some health characteristics of the piglets, were studied. Gestating sows (n = 26) were randomly allotted into 2 groups. The probiotic was administered by dietary supplementation to 1 group of sows and their respective litters (probiotic group), whereas the second group (control group) received no probiotic supplementation. The duration of the treatment was nearly 17 wk for sows (d 90 ante partum until d 28 postpartum) and 6 wk for piglets (d 15 to 56). Body weight and feed consumption were recorded weekly. The frequency of 4 toxin and 5 adhesion genes of putative pathogenic Escherichia coli was monitored weekly (d 7 to 35) by multiplex PCR assays, and fecal consistency of weaned piglets was studied daily. Probiotic treatment of lactating sows led to an overall pre-weaning mortality of 16.2% compared with 22.3% in the control group (P = 0.44). Animal losses during the first 3 d of the suckling period were decreased in the probiotic group (P = 0.09). For piglets (n = 153), which were weaned at 28 d, there were no overall treatment differences in BW gain, feed intake, or feed efficiency. Probiotic supplementation, however, led to nearly a 40% reduction (P = 0.012). The actual percentage of piglets with postweaning diarrhea in the probiotic group was 21% compared with 38% in the control group (P = 0.05). The study on virulence factors of dominant fecal E. coli isolates revealed a high diversity with varying frequency and distribution of each single pathogenicity gene. The 440 isolates carried 29 different pathogenicity gene combinations as well as each of the 9 pathogenicity genes alone. Altogether, isolates with more than 2 pathogenicity genes were quite rare (< or = 10%), and up until d 28 isolates without any pathogenicity gene occurred most frequently. Depending on the time of sampling, one-third or more of all isolates contained est2 or est1b as single gene or in combination with other pathogenicity genes.
TI  - Susceptibility studies of piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Susceptibility testing was used to evaluate potential spectrum of action for piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and to evaluate dimers against fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci. Individual dimers displayed equivalent or lowered MIC values compared with parent fluoroquinolone monomers against test strains of S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, E. coli, and VRE. Raised MIC values were observed for all dimers in comparison to monomers against test strains of P. aeruginosa and E. coli. In comparison to parent fluoroquinolones, all dimers displayed decreased percent inhibition of growth against M. tuberculosis. Structural requirements for activity of dimers and partial dimers against all organisms, including lower MICs against certain fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci, were consistent with requirements previously observed for dimers against fluoroquinolone-susceptible and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of S. aureus. In contrast, the 10- to 100-fold lowering of MICs against wild-type and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of S. aureus previously observed for individual cross-linked dimers was not observed with test strains of the various organisms used here.
TI  - Partial characterization of enterocin MR99 from a corn silage isolate of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the inhibitory activity on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of several species of enterococci recovered from a natural corn silage. METHODS AND RESULTS: The inhibitory activity of strains of Enterococcus faecalis (58), Enterococcus faecium (35), Enterococcus gallinarum (3) and Enterococcus casseliflavus (4) were studied employing indicator strains from various sources (clinical, food and ATCC). Enterococcus faecalis MR99, the only strain with inhibitory activity, inhibited other enterococci, Listeria spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium spp., Bacillus spp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri. The bacterium contained only one conjugative pheromone-responsive plasmid. The partially chromatography-purified MR99 enterocin (PPE) had a molecular weight of approx. 5000 Da and a pI of 6.2, was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and could be extracted in benzene and butanol. It appeared stable to adjustment of pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 and was resistant to heat. Inactivation was at 15 min at 121 degrees C. Enterocin MR99 was bactericidal on strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Staph. aureus, and bovine mastitis agents, it was bacteriostatic on E. coli. Although enterocins MR99 and AS48 have inhibitory activity on Gram-negative bacilli, PCR studies demonstrated a lack of relationship between them. CONCLUSIONS: The active component had a protein nature, was resistant to heat and presented a wide inhibitory spectrum. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The biological properties of Ent. faecalis MR99 suggest that this strain merits further investigations so it can be applied in human and veterinary health programmes.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab: no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound T cell depletion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, a cell surface antigen expressed on B and T lymphocytes, monocytes and NK cells. Its use results in a profound decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. Alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. We followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. However, no patient had bacteremia with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal Salmonella or Mycobacterium avium complex. Fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. The most common organisms isolated from the blood were Staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (14 episodes), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), Enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), Enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and Escherichia coli (7 episodes). DISCUSSION: We conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound CD4 positive T lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of CD4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
TI  - Construction of improved temperature-sensitive and mobilizable vectors and their  use for constructing mutations in the adhesin-encoding acm gene of poorly transformable clinical Enterococcus faecium strains.
AB  - Inactivation by allelic exchange in clinical isolates of the emerging nosocomial  pathogen Enterococcus faecium has been hindered by lack of efficient tools, and, in this study, transformation of clinical isolates was found to be particularly problematic. For this reason, a vector for allelic replacement (pTEX5500ts) was constructed that includes (i) the pWV01-based gram-positive repAts replication region, which is known to confer a high degree of temperature intolerance, (ii) Escherichia coli oriR from pUC18, (iii) two extended multiple-cloning sites located upstream and downstream of one of the marker genes for efficient cloning of flanking regions for double-crossover mutagenesis, (iv) transcriptional terminator sites to terminate undesired readthrough, and (v) a synthetic extended promoter region containing the cat gene for allelic exchange and a high-level gentamicin resistance gene, aph(2'')-Id, to distinguish double-crossover recombination, both of which are functional in gram-positive and gram-negative backgrounds. To demonstrate the functionality of this vector, the vector was used to construct an acm (encoding an adhesin to collagen from E. faecium) deletion mutant of a poorly transformable multidrug-resistant E. faecium endocarditis isolate, TX0082. The acm-deleted strain, TX6051 (TX0082Deltaacm), was shown to lack Acm on its surface, which resulted in the abolishment of the collagen adherence phenotype observed in TX0082. A mobilizable derivative (pTEX5501ts) that contains oriT of Tn916 to facilitate conjugative transfer from the transformable E. faecalis strain JH2Sm::Tn916 to E. faecium was also constructed. Using this vector, the acm gene of a nonelectroporable E. faecium wound isolate was successfully interrupted. Thus, pTEX5500ts and its mobilizable derivative demonstrated their roles as important tools by helping to create the first reported allelic replacement in E. faecium; the constructed this acm deletion mutant will be useful for assessing the role of acm in E. faecium pathogenesis using animal models.

TI  - Acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of diverse cat populations.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the resident intestinal microbiota of cats and to identify significant differences between various cat populations. Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Streptococcus canis were isolated as faecal indicator bacteria from rectal swabs of 47 individually owned cats, 47 cattery cats and 18 hospitalised cats, and submitted through antimicrobial sensitivity tests. The results revealed that bacteria isolated from hospitalised and/or cattery cats were more frequently resistant than those from individually owned cats. E. coli isolates from hospitalised cats were particularly resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and sulfonamide. Both enterococci and streptococci showed high resistance to tetracycline and in somewhat lesser extent to erythromycin and tylosin. Most E. faecium isolates were resistant to lincomycin and penicillin. One E. faecalis as well as one E. faecium isolate from hospitalised cats showed 'high-level resistance' (MIC > 500 microg/ml) against gentamicin, a commonly used antimicrobial agent in case of human enterococcal infections. The results of this research demonstrate that the extent of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of cats depends on the social environment of the investigated population. It is obvious that the flora of healthy cats may act as a reservoir of resistance genes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of doripenem (S-4661): a global surveillance report (2003).
AB  - The spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. Using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; MIC90s 0.06 mg/L), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. Against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of Enterococcus faecium, doripenem displayed modest activity (MIC50 4). Doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; MIC(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). For Enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (MIC90s 0.03-0.5 mg/L). MIC90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155 isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/L, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. Doripenem was also active against Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. (MIC90s 0.06-0.25 mg/L), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. Doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; MIC50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/L, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against Acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; MIC50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/L, respectively). Doripenem was slightly more potent (MIC50 2 mg/L) than ertapenem and imipenem (MIC50 4 mg/L), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (MIC50 2 mg/L), against Burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). Both Haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and Moraxella catarrhalis (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (MIC90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). Doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.
TI  - Correlation between the genetic diversity of nosocomial pathogens and their survival time in intensive care units.
AB  - Bacteria differ in their ability to survive in the hospital environment outside the human host. Species remaining viable and infectious have a higher chance of being transmitted, giving them a fitness advantage in hospitals. This differential fitness could be expected to alter the genetic population structure of bacterial populations in hospitals, and should be reflected by the relative abundance of several successful clones. The objective of this study was to test for a potential correlation between tenacity, i.e. environmental survival, and clonal abundance determined by the genetic diversity in different bacterial species from prospectively collected isolates of intensive care patients. A literature review was performed to identify mean environmental survival times for the most important pathogens in intensive care units (ICUs): Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Acetinobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. To determine the genetic diversity of the natural population of these species in ICUs, a prospective 18-month study was conducted in five units with median nosocomial infection rates. All clinical isolates were collected, and highly discriminatory DNA fingerprinting techniques were used to identify specific clones. A diversity index for each species was calculated as the number of distinguishable genotypes in the population divided by size. The correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was investigated using non-parametric methods. Although 21 studies were identified in the literature, only two were relevant. They showed median survival times between 1.5 days (P. aeruginosa) and 60.0 days (Enterococcus faecium). During the prospective ICU study, 1264 pathogens were investigated and simple diversity indices between 49.1 (Enterococcus faecalis) and 89.8 (E. coli) were found. A correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was found (correlation coefficient 0.821, P=0.024). Environmental survival may be an important factor contributing to the ecological fitness of some nosocomial pathogens in ICUs. Infection control measures should consider this finding.
TI  - Bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  - Bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. Much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in Western countries. Reports indicate that appropriate administration of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio vulnificus, and Salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. The phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of Helicobacter pylori and P. aeruginosa, respectively. In addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis, and group B streptococci. All phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. Furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. Phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.
TI  - [Pathogenic characters of infected bacteria after liver transplantation].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the main pathogens of infection after the liver transplantation and their antibiotic resistant patterns. METHODS: The main pathogens of infection after the liver transplantation were retrospectively analyzed. Using 3-dimensional tests, ESBLs (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase), and AmpC were detected among the Gram negative bacilli. beta-Lactamase and Van gene in Enterococcus were determined by the standard agar dilution susceptibility tests and Nitrocefin respectively. RESULTS: The main infected strains were Enterococcus faecalis (15.0%), Enterobacter cloacae (13.9%), fungus (13.3%), and Escherichia coli (10.7%) after the liver transplantation. Among them, 32.4% of Enterobacter cloacae and 36.8% of Escherichia coli produced ESBLs; 33.8% of Enterobacter cloacae and 10.5% of Escherichia coli. produced AmpC beta-lactamases. The detectable rate of VanA gene in Enterococcusfaecalis and Enterococcus faecium was 7.5% and 11.1%; VanB was 3.8% and 7.4%; VanC was 1.3% and 0, respectively. CONCLUSION: The infection mainly occurs in the intestinal tract after the liver transplantation. The production of ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases is the main mechanism of antibiotic resistance. The increased detectable rate of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus should be paid attention to.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - Identification of glucoselysine-6-phosphate deglycase, an enzyme involved in the  metabolism of the fructation product glucoselysine.
AB  - The metabolism of the glycation product fructose-epsilon-lysine in Escherichia coli involves its ATP-dependent phosphorylation by a specific kinase (FrlD), followed by the conversion of fructoselysine 6-phosphate into glucose 6-phosphate and lysine by fructoselysine-6-phosphate deglycase (FrlB), which is distantly related to the isomerase domain of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase. As shown in the present work, several bacterial operons comprise: (1) a homologue of fructoselysine-6-phosphate deglycase; (2) a second homologue of the isomerase domain of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase, more closely related to it; and (3) components of a novel phosphotransferase system, but no FrlD homologue. The FrlB homologue (GfrF) and the closer glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase homologue (GfrE) encoded by an Enterococcus faecium operon were expressed in E. coli and purified. Similar to FrlB, GfrF catalysed the reversible conversion of fructoselysine 6-phosphate into glucose 6-phosphate and lysine. When incubated with fructose 6-phosphate and elevated concentrations of lysine, GfrE catalysed the formation of a compound identified as 2-epsilon-lysino-2-deoxy-6-phospho-glucose (glucoselysine 6-phosphate) by NMR. GfrE also catalysed the reciprocal conversion, i.e. the formation of fructose 6-phosphate (but not glucose 6-phosphate) from glucoselysine 6-phosphate. The equilibrium constant of this reaction (0.8 M) suggests that the enzyme serves to degrade glucoselysine 6-phosphate. In conclusion, GfrF and GfrE serve to metabolize glycation products formed from lysine and glucose (fructoselysine) or fructose (glucoselysine), via their 6-phospho derivatives. The latter are presumably formed by the putative phosphotransferase system encoded by gfrA-gfrD. The designation gfr (glycation and fructation product degradation) is proposed for this operon. This is the first description of an enzyme participating in the metabolism of fructation products.
TI  - A novel peptidoglycan cross-linking enzyme for a beta-lactam-resistant transpeptidation pathway.
AB  - The beta-lactam antibiotics remain the most commonly used to treat severe infections. Because of structural similarity between the beta-lactam ring and the d-alanyl(4)-d-alanine(5) extremity of bacterial cell wall precursors, the drugs act as suicide substrates of the dd-transpeptidases that catalyze the last cross-linking step of cell wall assembly. Here, we show that this mechanism of action can be defeated by a novel type of transpeptidase identified for the first time by reverse genetics in abeta-lactam-resistant mutant of Enterococcus faecium. The enzyme, Ldt(fm), catalyzes in vitro the cross-linking of peptidoglycan subunits in a beta-lactam-insensitive ld-transpeptidation reaction. The specificity of Ldt(fm) for the l-lysyl(3)-d-alanine(4) peptide bond of tetrapeptide donors accounts for resistance because the substrate does not mimic beta-lactams in contrast to d-alanyl(4)-d-alanine(5) in the pentapeptide donors required for dd-transpeptidation. Ldt(fm) homologues are encountered sporadically among taxonomically distant bacteria, indicating that ld-transpeptidase-mediated resistance may emerge in various pathogens.
TI  - Isolation, gene expression and solution structure of a novel moricin analogue, antibacterial peptide from a lepidopteran insect, Spodoptera litura.
AB  - An antibacterial peptide was isolated from a lepidopteran insect, Spodoptera litura. The molecular mass of this peptide was determined to be 4489.55 by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass (MALDI-TOF MS) spectrometry. The peptide consists of 42 amino acids and the sequence has 69-98% identity to those of moricin-related peptides, antibacterial peptides from lepidopetran insects. Thus, the peptide was designated S. litura (Sl) moricin. Sl moricin showed a broad antibacterial spectrum against Gram-positive and negative bacteria. Sl moricin gene was inducible by bacterial injection and expressed tissue-specifically in the fat body and hemocytes. Furthermore, the solution structure of Sl moricin was determined by two-dimensional (2D) 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing calculation. The tertiary structure revealed a long alpha-helix containing eight turns along nearly the full length of the peptide like that of moricin, confirming that Sl moricin is a new moricin-like antibacterial peptide. These results suggest that moricin is present not only in B. mori but also in other lepidopteran insects forming a gene family.
TI  - Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., verocytotoxic Escherichia coli, and antibiotic resistance in indicator organisms in wild cervids.
AB  - Faecal samples were collected, as part of the National Health Surveillance Program for Cervids (HOP) in Norway, from wild red deer, roe deer, moose and reindeer during ordinary hunting seasons from 2001 to 2003. Samples from a total of 618 animals were examined for verocytotoxic E. coli (VTEC); 611 animals for Salmonella and 324 animals for Campylobacter. A total of 50 samples were cultivated from each cervid species in order to isolate the indicator bacterial species E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis / E. faecium for antibiotic resistance pattern studies. Salmonella and the potentially human pathogenic verocytotoxic E. coli were not isolated, while Campylobacter jejuni jejuni was found in one roe deer sample only. Antibiotic resistance was found in 13 (7.3%) of the 179 E. coli isolates tested, eight of these being resistant against one type of antibiotic only. The proportion of resistant E. coli isolates was higher in wild reindeer (24%) than in the other cervids (2.2%). E. faecalis or E. faecium were isolated from 19 of the samples, none of these being reindeer. All the strains isolated were resistant against one (84%) or more (16%) antibiotics. A total of 14 E. faecalis-strains were resistant to virginiamycin only. The results indicate that the cervid species studied do not constitute an important infectious reservoir for either the human pathogens or the antibiotic resistant microorganisms included in the study.
TI  - Enumeration and antibiotic resistance patterns of fecal indicator organisms isolated from migratory Canada geese (Branta canadensis).
AB  - Thermotolerant fecal indicator organisms carried by migratory waterfowl may serve as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. To determine the extent to which such antibiotic resistance markers were present in migratory Canada geese (Branta canadensis) on the Maryland Eastern Shore, we isolated Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli from fresh feces and examined the antibiotic resistance profiles of these bacteria. Samples were obtained in October 2002, January 2003, and March 2003. Thermotolerant E. coli counts ranged from 0 to 1.0x10(7) colony forming units (CFU)/0.1g (g-1) wet weight of feces, whereas Enterococcus spp. counts ranged from 1.0x10(2)-1.0x10(7) CFU g-1 wet weight of feces. Primary isolates of each indicator organism were tested against a panel of 10 antibiotics. Greater than 95% of E. coli isolates were resistant to penicillin G, ampicillin, cephalothin, and sulfathiazole; no E. coli were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Enterococcal isolates showed highest resistance to cephalothin, streptomycin, and sulfathiazole; no enterococci were resistant to chloramphenicol. The tetracyclines, streptomycin, and gentamycin provided the greatest discrimination among E. coli isolates; chlortetracycline, cephalothin, and gentamycin resistance patterns provided the greatest discrimination between enterococcal strains. Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) profiles were calculated: fall (E. coli=0.499; enterococci=0.234), winter (E. coli=0.487; enterococci=0.389), and spring (E. coli=0.489; enterococci=0.348). E. faecalis and E. faecium, which are recognized human nosocomial pathogens, were cultured from winter (44 and 56%, respectively) and spring (13 and 31%, respectively) fecal samples.
TI  - Cloning, production and functional expression of enterocin P, a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium P13, in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The cloning and expression of enterocin P (EntP), a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium P13, was studied in Escherichia coli. PCR-amplified products of the preenterocin P gene (entP) or entP plus the putative EntP immunity gene (entiP), were cloned in plasmid pETBlue-1 under the control of the inducible T7lac promoter. Although target genes in derivative plasmids pJG01 (entP) and pJG02 (entP plus entiP) did not generate products with antimicrobial activity after an in vitro combined transcription/translation reaction, they were expressed as biologically active products following transformation and induction in the E. coli Tuner(DE3)pLacI host. The use of specific antibodies and an ELISA permitted the detection and quantification of EntP in the supernatant (SN), cellular soluble protein fraction (CSF), and inclusion bodies (IB) of E. coli Tuner(DE3)pLacI cells transformed with either pJG01 or pJG02. Functional EntP from the supernatants of E. coli Tuner(DE3)pLacI (pJG01) cultures grown in a complex medium was recovered, at a high efficiency, by immunoaffinity chromatography in a single step. A purification method based on hydrophobic adsorption and reverse-phase chromatographies also permitted the recovery of active EntP from the supernatants of the same cultures grown in a minimally defined medium. The E. coli Tuner(DE3)pLacI (pJG01) cells would merit consideration as an alternative experimental model for the heterologous production and functional expression of EntP, as well as for the fast and efficient recovery of this bacteriocin from the supernatant of this recombinant producer.
TI  - Human fecal water modifies adhesion of intestinal bacteria to Caco-2 cells.
AB  - The aqueous phase of feces (fecal water) has been suggested to mediate the effects of diet on colon carcinogenesis. We determined whether human fecal water samples, of varying genotoxic potential, had the capacity to alter adhesion of intestinal bacteria to intestinal (Caco-2) cells. Genotoxicity of fecal water samples was measured using the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay ("comet" assay), and bacterial adhesion was measured using a well-established model system. Fecal water genotoxicity was found to correlate positively with inhibition of adhesion of Escherichia coli strains, Salmonella species, and Enterococcus faecium to Caco-2 cells. The presence of fecal water samples did not interfere with adhesion of Bacteroides and Lactobacillus species. Inhibition of adhesion by fecal water was not due to cytotoxicity to Caco-2 cells as cytotoxicities of most fecal water samples were similar, nor was the inhibitory effect due to bacteriotoxicity as toxicity of fecal waters in the 10 strains of bacteria studied was not detected. Results indicate that components in fecal water may alter adhesion of intestinal bacteria to intestinal cell surfaces and that this effect may be correlated to the genotoxic potential of fecal water. This may have consequences for dietary effects on colon carcinogenesis.
TI  - Isolation of three new naturally occurring compounds from the culture of Micromonospora sp. P1068.
AB  - Bioassay guided isolation of an antibacterial extract prepared from the fermentation broth of a Micromonospora sp. P1068 led to the isolation of eight compounds identified as (3R) 3,4',7-trihydroxy-isoflavanone (1), 3-hydroxydehydrodaidzein, daidzein (2), 3-methyl-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid (3), 1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde (4), 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-N-methylpropionamide, N-methylphloretamide (5), phenyl acetic acid (6), 2-hydroxy phenyl acetic acid (7) and 4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-benzoic acid (8). Compounds 1 and 5 were found to be novel chemical entities while 3 was isolated from a natural source for the first time. All compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against a panel of clinically significant microorganisms. Compound 4 was active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC, 32 microg/ml), Enterococcus faecium (MIC, 32 microg/ml) and Escherichia coli (MIC, 64 microg/ml).
TI  - Acquisition of resistant bowel flora during a double-blind randomized clinical trial of ertapenem versus piperacillin-tazobactam therapy for intraabdominal infections.
AB  - Bowel colonization with resistant bacteria can develop in patients receiving broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. We compared the impact of two antimicrobial regimens often used to treat intraabdominal infections on susceptibility patterns of bowel flora at the end of therapy. In a double-blind clinical trial, adults with complicated intraabdominal infection requiring surgery were randomized to receive piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 g every 6 h) or ertapenem (1 g once a day) for 4 to 14 days. Rectal swabs were obtained at baseline and at the end of study therapy to determine the acquisition rates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to the study drug, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to imipenem or piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium. Treated patients were assessable for the acquisition of resistant bacteria if appropriate specimens were obtained at both time points. Enterobacteriaceae resistant to the treatment received were acquired during study therapy by 8/122 assessable piperacillin-tazobactam recipients (6.6%) compared to 0/122 assessable ertapenem recipients (P = 0.007). Neither ESBL-producing E. coli or Klebsiella species nor P. aeruginosa resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam was isolated from patients in either treatment group. Imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa was acquired by two of the ertapenem recipients (1.6%) versus zero of the piperacillin-tazobactam recipients (P = 0.50). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci were acquired during therapy by 8/125 assessable ertapenem recipients (6.4%) versus 2/123 assessable piperacillin-tazobactam recipients (1.6%; P = 0.10). In this study, the acquisition of resistant Enterobacteriaceae occurred significantly more often in patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam than in those treated with ertapenem.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
AB  - Bacteriocin-producing strains of Lactobacillus plantarum ST23LD and ST341LD, Enterococcus faecium ST311LD and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides ST33LD were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. The bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis, L. casei and Streptococcus pneumoniae), but also Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strain ST23LD produced two bacteriocins (ST23LDa and ST23LDb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kDa, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 AU/ml after 18 h of growth. The same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin ST341LD (approximately 3.0 kDa), but after 16 h. Bacteriocins ST311LD (ca. 2.3 kDa) and ST33LD (ca. 2.7 kDa) were produced at much lower levels (6400 AU/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. Bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and Triton X, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees C. Addition of bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST311LD to cells of Lactobacillus casei LHS in logarithmic phase resulted in growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density over the next seven hours. Bacteriocin ST33LD also inhibited the growth of strain LHS, but to a lesser extent. Bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST33LD remained at the same level of activity for 6 h at pH<4.0. However, the activity of bacteriocin ST311LD decreased by 50% within 2 h at pH 4.4. The possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.
TI  - Combined effect of high-pressure treatments and bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria on inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in raw-milk cheese.
AB  - The effect of high-pressure (HP) treatments combined with bacteriocins of lactic  acid bacteria (LAB) produced in situ on the survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in cheese was investigated. Cheeses were manufactured from raw milk inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 at approximately 10(5) CFU/ml. Seven different bacteriocin-producing LAB were added at approximately 10(6) CFU/ml as adjuncts to the starter. Cheeses were pressurized on day 2 or 50 at 300 MPa for 10 min or 500 MPa for 5 min, at 10 degrees C in both cases. After 60 days, E. coli O157:H7 counts in cheeses manufactured without bacteriocin-producing LAB and not pressurized were 5.1 log CFU/g. A higher inactivation of E. coli O157:H7 was achieved in cheeses without bacteriocin-producing LAB when 300 MPa was applied on day 50 (3.8-log-unit reduction) than if applied on day 2 (1.3-log-unit reduction). Application of 500 MPa eliminated E. coli O157:H7 in 60-day-old cheeses. Cheeses made with bacteriocin-producing LAB and not pressurized showed a slight reduction of the pathogen. Pressurization at 300 MPa on day 2 and addition of lacticin 481-, nisin A-, bacteriocin TAB 57-, or enterocin AS-48-producing LAB were synergistic and reduced E. coli O157:H7 counts to levels below 2 log units in 60-day-old cheeses. Pressurization at 300 MPa on day 50 and addition of nisin A-, bacteriocin TAB 57-, enterocin I-, or enterocin AS-48-producing LAB completely inactivated E. coli O157:H7 in 60-day-old cheeses. The application of reduced pressures combined with bacteriocin-producing LAB is a feasible procedure to improve cheese safety.
TI  - Binding sites of VanRB and sigma70 RNA polymerase in the vanB vancomycin resistance operon of Enterococcus faecium BM4524.
AB  - The vanB operon of Enterococcus faecium BM4524 which confers inducible resistance to vancomycin is composed of the vanR(B)S(B) gene encoding a two-component regulatory system and the vanY(B)WH(B)BX(B) resistance genes that are transcribed from promoters P(RB) and P(YB) respectively. In this study, primer extension revealed transcription start sites at 13 and 48 bp upstream from the start codon of vanR(B) and vanY(B), respectively, that allowed identification of -10 and -35 promoter motifs. The VanR(B) protein was overproduced in Escherichia coli, purified and phosphorylated (VanR(B)-P) non-enzymically with acetylphosphate. VanR(B)-P and VanR(B) specifically bound to P(RB) and P(YB) promoters. VanR(B) bound at a single site at position -32.5 upstream from the P(RB) transcriptional start site and at two sites at positions -33.5 and -55.5 upstream from that of P(YB). The proximal VanR(B) binding site overlapped the -35 region of both promoters. VanR(B) was converted from a monomer to a dimer upon acetylphosphate treatment. VanR(B)-P had higher affinity than VanR(B) for its targets and appeared more efficient than VanR(B) in promoting open complex formation with P(RB) and P(YB). In the absence of regulator, E. coli RNA polymerase was able to interact with P(RB) but not with P(YB). Phosphorylation of VanR(B) significantly increased promoter interaction with RNA polymerase and led to an extended and modified footprint. In vitro transcription assays showed that VanR(B)-P activates P(YB) more strongly than P(RB). Analysis of the protected regions revealed one copy of a 21 bp sequence in the P(RB) promoter and two copies in the P(YB) promoter which may serve as recognition sites for VanR(B) and VanR(B)-P binding that are required for transcriptional activation and expression of vancomycin resistance.
TI  - Phylogeny and identification of Enterococci by atpA gene sequence analysis.
AB  - The relatedness among 91 Enterococcus strains representing all validly described  species was investigated by comparing a 1,102-bp fragment of atpA, the gene encoding the alpha subunit of ATP synthase. The relationships observed were in agreement with the phylogeny inferred from 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. However, atpA gene sequences were much more discriminatory than 16S rRNA for species differentiation. All species were differentiated on the basis of atpA sequences with, at a maximum, 92% similarity. Six members of the Enterococcus faecium species group (E. faecium, E. hirae, E. durans, E. villorum, E. mundtii, and E. ratti) showed > 99% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, but the highest value of atpA gene sequence similarity was only 89.9%. The intraspecies atpA sequence similarities for all species except E. faecium strains varied from 98.6 to 100%; the E. faecium strains had a lower atpA sequence similarity of 96.3%. Our data clearly show that atpA provides an alternative tool for the phylogenetic study and identification of enterococci.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium GM-1 isolated  from an infant.
AB  - AIM: To partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the GM-1 strain of Enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. METHODS AND RESULTS: The bacteriocin produced by E. faecium GM-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio spp., Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Treatment of the GM-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. The bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees C for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral pH. The optimal production of bacteriocin from E. faecium GM-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were pH 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees C. The inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. The use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. A bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin P was identified from the total DNA of E. faecium GM-1 by PCR and direct sequencing methods. CONCLUSION: E. faecium GM-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin P-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: E. faecium GM-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin P. This bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Human defensins.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are small, cationic, amphiphilic peptides of 12-50 amino acids with microbicidal activity against both bacteria and fungi. The eukaryotic antimicrobial peptides may be divided into four distinct groups according to their structural features: cysteine-free alpha-helices, extended cysteine-free alpha-helices with a predominance of one or two amino acids, loop structures with one intramolecular disulfide bond, and beta-sheet structures which are stabilised by two or three intramolecular disulfide bonds. Mammalian defensins are part of the last-mentioned group. The mammalian defensins can be subdivided into three main classes according to their structural differences: the alpha-defensins, beta-defensins and the recently described theta-defensins. Mammalian alpha-defensins are predominantly found in neutrophils and in small intestinal Paneth cells, whereas mammalian beta-defensins have been isolated from both leukocytes and epithelial cells. Recently, two novel human beta-defensins, human beta-defensin-3 (HBD-3), and human beta-defensin-4 (HBD-4) have been discovered. Similar to HBD-1 and HBD-2, HBD-3 has microbicidal activity towards the Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) and the yeasts Candida albicans and Malassezia furfur. In addition, HBD-3 kills Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus, including multi-resistant S. aureus strains, and even vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. In contrast to HBD-1 and HBD-2, significant expression of HBD-3 has been demonstrated in non-epithelial tissues, such as leukocytes, heart and skeletal muscle. HBD-4 is expressed in certain epithelia and in neutrophils. Its bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa is stronger than that of the other known beta-defensins. Here we present an overview of human antimicrobial peptides with some emphasis on their antifungal properties.
TI  - Influence of a probiotic Enterococcus faecium strain on development of the immune system of sows and piglets.
AB  - The influence of the probiotic bacterium Enterococcus faecium SF68 on the immune  system and the intestinal colonization of pigs were determined in a feeding experiment with sows and piglets. Mucosal immunity of the developing piglets was monitored by isolation and detection of intestinal lymphocyte cell populations from the proximal jejunal epithelium and the continuous Peyers patches by the use of flow cytometry. The levels of intestinal IgA in both groups of piglets were compared, as well as total IgG in the serum of sows and piglets. Feces of the sows and intestinal contents of the piglets were taken for determination of total anaerobe and coliform bacterial counts in both probiotic and control groups. Villus length and depth of the crypts were measured in the jejunum of sacrificed piglets to monitor the development of the intestinal mucosal surface amplification. Total serum IgG of the sows appeared to be unaffected. Piglets of both groups showed similar IgG levels up to 5 weeks after birth with a slight tendency toward lower values in the probiotic group. At an age of 8 weeks the total IgG levels of the probiotic animals were significantly lower (p<0.01). No differences were observed in the populations of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the Peyers patches. However, the levels of cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) in the jejunal epithelium of piglets of the probiotic group were significantly reduced. The depth of the jejunal crypts and length of the villi were similar in both groups, suggesting the relative T-cell population differences were not due to alterations in the epithelial cell numbers. The total anaerobe and coliform bacterial populations were not significantly affected by the probiotic treatment, either in sows or in the piglets. However, a remarkable decline in the frequency of beta-haemolytic and O141 serovars of Escherichia coli was observed in the intestinal contents of probiotic piglets, suggesting an explanation for the reduction in cytotoxic T-cell populations.
TI  - Analysis of etiology and drug resistance of biliary infections.
AB  - The bile was collected from fro patients with biliary infections, with the bacterium isolated to study the sensitivity of each kind of the bacterium to several antibiotics in common use. Except G- bacterium, we also found some kinds of G+ bacterium in infection bile. G- bacterium were not sensitive to Clindamycin, G+ bacterium were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin. Escherichia coli, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to Ampicillin. G+ bacterium were not sensitive to Azactam. Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter cloacae were not sensitive to Ceftazidime. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not sensitive to Ceftriaxone Sodium. We didn't found any bacterium resistance Imipenem. The possibility of the existence of G+ bacterium as well as drug resistance should be considered n patients with biliary infections. The value of susceptibility test should be respected to avoid drug abuse of antibiotics.
TI  - Actinomadura napierensis sp. nov., isolated from soil in South Africa.
AB  - An actinomycete, strain B60(T), was isolated from a soil sample in Napier, Western Cape province of South Africa. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and chemotaxonomy, strain B60(T) was identified as a member of the genus Actinomadura. Strain B60(T) produced an antibiotic with activity against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium and Mycobacterium aurum, but not against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Significant differences in morphological and physiological characteristics indicate that strain B60(T) represents a novel species of the genus Actinomadura. The name Actinomadura napierensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is B60(T) (=DSM 44846(T)=NRRL B-24319(T)).
TI  - Survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
AB  - In 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  We assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Standards (NCCLS). Methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The most common gram-positive species was Enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). Enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (BLs), fluoroquinolones (FQs), and tetracyclines (TCs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. Escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. The proportion of FQ-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). All the ESBL-producing strains (ESBLs) possess resistance to FQs. Over 95% of Klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. The distribution of antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. Some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among Proteus species. No ESBL-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from Serratia marcescens. This survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of ESBL-producing or FQs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships of different beta-lactam antibiotics against a soluble form of Enterococcus faecium PBP5, a type II bacterial transpeptidase.
AB  - Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) catalyze the essential reactions in the biosynthesis of cell wall peptidoglycan from glycopeptide precursors. beta-Lactam antibiotics normally interfere with this process by reacting covalently with the active site serine to form a stable acyl-enzyme. The design of novel beta-lactams active against penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant organisms will require a better understanding of the molecular details of this reaction. To that end, we compared the affinities of different beta-lactam antibiotics to a modified soluble form of a resistant Enterococcus faecium PBP5 (Delta1-36 rPBP5). The soluble protein, Delta1-36 rPBP5, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified, and the NH(2)-terminal protein sequence was verified by amino acid sequencing. Using beta-lactams with different R1 side chains, we show that azlocillin has greater affinity for Delta1-36 rPBP5 than piperacillin and ampicillin (apparent K(i) = 7 +/- 0.3 microM, compared to 36 +/- 3 and 51 +/- 10 microM, respectively). Azlocillin also exhibits the most rapid acylation rate (apparent k(2) = 15 +/- 4 M(-1) s(-1)). Meropenem demonstrates an affinity for Delta1-36 rPBP5 comparable to that of ampicillin (apparent K(i) = 51 +/- 15 microM) but is slower at acylating (apparent k(2) = 0.14 +/- 0.02 M(-1) s(-1)). This characterization defines important structure-activity relationships for this clinically relevant type II transpeptidase, shows that the rate of formation of the acyl-enzyme is an essential factor determining the efficacy of a beta-lactam, and suggests that the specific side chain interactions of beta-lactams could be modified to improve inactivation of resistant PBPs.
TI  - Heterologous expression of enterocin A, a bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecium,  fused to a cellulose-binding domain in Escherichia coli results in a functional protein with inhibitory activity against Listeria.
AB  - The genes for the bacteriocins enterocin A and B were isolated from Enterococcus  faecium ATB 197a. Using the pET37b(+) vector, the enterocin genes were fused to an Escherichia coli specific export signal sequence, a cellulose-binding domain (CBD(cenA)) and a S-tag under the control of a T7lac promotor. The constructs were subsequently cloned into E. coli host cells. The expression of the recombinant enterocins had different effects on both the host cells and other Gram-positive bacteria. The expression of entA in Esc. coli led to the synthesis and secretion of functional active enterocin A fusion proteins, which were active against some Gram-positive indicator bacteria, but did not influence the viability of the host cells. In contrast, the expression of enterocin B fusion proteins led to a reduced viability of the host cells, indicating a misfolding of the protein or interference with the cellular metabolism of Esc. coli. Indicator strains of Gram-positive bacteria were not inhibited by purified enterocin B fusion proteins. However, recombinant enterocin B displayed inhibitory activity after the proteolytic cleavage of the fused peptides.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and chemical investigation of Brazilian Drosera.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of three different extracts (hexanic, ethyl acetate, methanol) obtained from Brazilian Drosera species (D. communis, D. montana var. montana, D. brevifolia, D. villosa var. graomogolensis, D. villosa var. villosa, Drosera sp. 1, and Drosera sp. 2 ) were tested against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecium (ATCC23212), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), Escherichia coli (ATCC11229), Salmonella choleraesuis (ATCC10708), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC13883), and Candida albicans (a human isolate). Better antimicrobial activity was observed with D. communis and D. montana var. montana ethyl acetate extracts. Phytochemical analyses from D. communis, D. montana var. montana and D. brevifolia yielded 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (plumbagin); long chain aliphatic hydrocarbons were isolated from D. communis and from D. villosa var. villosa, a mixture of long chain aliphatic alcohols and carboxylic acids, was isolated from D. communis and 3b-O-acetylaleuritolic acid from D. villosa var. villosa.
TI  - Overexpression and characterization of an aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyltransferase with broad specificity from an epsilon-poly-L-lysine producer, Streptomyces albulus IFO14147.
AB  - Streptomyces albulus IFO14147 produces epsilon-poly-L-lysine, which exhibits antimicrobial activity. In the MIC studies with antibiotics, S. albulus IFO14147 was shown to be resistant to kanamycin and amikacin, which are aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics. We report here the isolation of the AG-resistance gene from S. albulus IFO14147 and the substrate specificity of the gene product, AAC(6')-Isa, which catalyzes N-acetylation at the 6' position of AGs, thereby inactivating them. Kinetic studies revealed that this enzyme has remarkably wide substrate specificity. The V(max)/K(m) values determined for AGs vary by a factor of up to 6,300, a much wider range than those observed for the AAC(6')s from Enterococcus faecium [AAC(6')-Ii] and Salmonella enteritidis [AAC(6')-Iy]. In addition, AAC(6')-Isa was able to acetylate lividomycin A, which has a hydroxy group at the 6' position. Enzymatically acetylated lividomycin A was found to be highly susceptible to mild base hydrolysis, suggesting that the enzyme also catalyzes O-acetyltransfer.
TI  - Towards the establishment and standardization of a veterinary antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programme in South Africa.
AB  - The objective of this study was to establish a repeatable, standardized laboratory procedure for monitoring the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from animals and food of animal origin in South Africa, with reagents prepared in-house. The emergence of resistance and the spread of resistant bacteria can be limited by implementing a veterinary antimicrobial drug policy, in which inter alia systematic monitoring and prudent use play essential roles. The bacteria included in this study represented three different categories, namely zoonotic bacteria (Salmonella), indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) and veterinary pathogens (Mannheimia haemolytica). Thirty isolates of each species were collected with the aim of standardizing the laboratory methodology for a future national veterinary surveillance and monitoring programme. Susceptibility to ten selected antimicrobial drugs was determined by means of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) using the microdilution method. The method according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was used as the standard. Multi-well plates containing varying dilutions of antimicrobial drugs and prepared in-house for MIC determinations, yielded repeatable results. Storage of plates for 2 months at -70 degrees C did not influence results meaningfully. Within this limited sample of bacteria, MIC results did not indicate meaningful resistance against any of the ten selected antimicrobial drugs. The findings of the study will be used to establish a national veterinary antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programme in South Africa. To allow for international comparison of data, harmonisation of the surveillance and monitoring programme in accordance with global trends is encouraged. Ideally it should be combined with a programme monitoring the quantities of antimicrobial drugs used. The aim is to contribute to slowing down the emergence of resistance and the problems associated with this phenomenon by means of the rational use of antimicrobial drugs.
TI  - An alcohol hand rub containing a synergistic combination of an emollient and preservatives: prolonged activity against transient pathogens.
AB  - A new alcohol-based hand antiseptic (Octoxy hand rub) containing a synergistic combination of an emollient (Octoxyglycerine) and preservatives was developed and evaluated for immediate and prolonged activity against transient bacteria. The in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial efficacy was compared with other alcohol hand rubs containing preservative/antimicrobial (Prevacare and Avagard). In vitro evaluation was carried out using a tube-dilution method and a pig-skin model. Rapid and prolonged efficacy in vivo was evaluated against Staphylococcus epidermidis on the hands of volunteers. Octoxy hand rub was 100% effective in rapidly killing pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in vitro. In volunteers, all three hand rubs gave a significant reduction in microbial count within 15s. Octoxy hand rub showed significantly higher efficacy against S. aureus and Escherichia coli than Avagard and Prevacare 15 min after application to the pig-skin model, and against S. epidermidis in both the pig-skin model and in volunteers. Use of Octoxy hand rub with broad-spectrum immediate and prolonged antimicrobial activity may be a very effective way of improving hand hygiene without exposing the hands to higher concentrations of antimicrobials.
TI  - Spectroscopic quantification of bacteria using artificial neural networks.
AB  - Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, in conjunction with artificial neural networks, has been used for identification and classification of selected foodborne pathogens. Five bacterial species (Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella Enteritidis, Bacillus cereus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella boydii) and five Escherichia coli strains (O103, O55, O121, O30, O26) suspended in phosphate-buffered saline were enumerated to provide seven different concentrations ranging from 10(9) to 10(3) CFU/ ml. The trained artificial neural networks were then validated with an independent subset of samples and compared with the traditional plate count method. It was found that the concentration-based classification of the species was 100% correct and the strain-based classification was 90 to 100% accurate.
TI  - Cyclic dipeptides exhibit synergistic, broad spectrum antimicrobial effects and have anti-mutagenic properties.
AB  - Cyclic dipeptides are known to have antiviral, antibiotic and antitumour properties. The aim of this study was to determine the combined effects of cyclo(L-leucyl-L-prolyl) and cyclo(L-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl) on the growth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and pathogenic yeasts, as well as determining their anti-mutagenic effects. This drug combination was especially effective against five VRE strains: Enterococcus faecium (K-99-38), E. faecalis (K-99-17), E. faecalis (K-99-258), E. faecium (K-01-312) and E. faecalis (K-01-511) with MIC values of 0.25-1 mg/l. It was also effective against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans with MIC values of 0.25-0.5 mg/l. In addition, the cyclic dipeptides exerted anti-mutagenic activity against Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains in a Salmonella mutation assay. The number of mutant colonies of S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 induced by exposure to AF-2 (0.2 microg/plate) decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of the two cyclic dipeptides (correlation 0.72 and 0.78, respectively). Here, for the first time, we report synergistic effects of the cyclic dipeptides [cyclo(L-leu-L-pro) and cyclo(L-phe-L-pro)] in inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, as well as their anti-mutagenic effects in Salmonella strains.
TI  - [Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: VIRA study 2004].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the VIRA study carried out in 2001. METHODS: The 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in February 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89) and Enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (346), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and Acinetobacter baumannii (130). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). Global methicillin-resistance in S. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the E. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. One P. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the E-test MBL assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. The strains of imipenem-resistant A. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. CONCLUSION: These results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. This emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Streptomyces africanus sp. nov., a novel streptomycete with blue aerial mycelium.
AB  - An actinomycete with blue aerial mycelium and yellow substrate mycelium was isolated from a suburban soil sample collected in Cape Town, South Africa and named strain CPJVR-HT. The colour of the substrate mycelium was not sensitive to changes in pH. The organism produced spiny spores in Spirales spore chains. Chemical taxonomy indicated that it is a member of the genus Streptomyces. Strain CPJVR-HT grew at 45 degrees C and did not produce melanin or any diffusible pigments. It exhibited weak antibacterial activity against a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecium, but no antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 or Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Analysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence, DNA-DNA hybridization studies and the results of physiological tests showed that this strain represents a novel species of Streptomyces, for which the name Corynebacterium aurimucosum [corrected] nov. is proposed. The type strain is CPJVR-HT (= NRRL B-24243T [corrected] = DSM 41829T).
TI  - Bacterial resistance to antimicrobials in urinary isolates.
AB  - Escherichia coli accounted for about 80% of organisms in uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), followed by Staphylococcus spp. especially Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Proteus mirabilis. Against E. coli isolates from patients with uncomplicated UTI, faropenem was the most effective. Up to 1999, fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were not observed in patients with uncomplicated UTI, but in 2001 fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli isolates emerged and accounted for about 8%. Various types of organisms were isolated in patients with complicated UTI. Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the three most frequent organisms isolated. These three organisms accounted for 44.6%. Amongst oral agents, faropenem showed the lowest rate of resistance against E. coli followed by cephems. The rates of highly fluoroquinolone-resistant and cefpodoxime-resistant E. coli isolates increased rapidly from 1998 to 2001. Fluoroquinolone-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates accounted for about 40% in 2001. Against this species, amikacin was the most effective antimicrobials among all agents tested. About 17% of Pseudomonas were resistant to carbapenem. Eight milligram per litre of ampicillin inhibited all E. faecalis isolates; about 60% of Enterococcus faecium were resistant to ampicillin. The rates of levofloxacin-resistant isolates of E. faecalis and E. faecium were 38 and 97% respectively. UTIs caused by vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) are rare in Japan.
TI  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections in US hospitals: analysis of 24,179 cases from  a prospective nationwide surveillance study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSIs) are important causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. METHODS: Data from a nationwide, concurrent surveillance study (Surveillance and Control of Pathogens of Epidemiological Importance [SCOPE]) were used to examine the secular trends in the epidemiology and microbiology of nosocomial BSIs. RESULTS: Our study detected 24,179 cases of nosocomial BSI in 49 US hospitals over a 7-year period from March 1995 through September 2002 (60 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions). Eighty-seven percent of BSIs were monomicrobial. Gram-positive organisms caused 65% of these BSIs, gram-negative organisms caused 25%, and fungi caused 9.5%. The crude mortality rate was 27%. The most-common organisms causing BSIs were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (31% of isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (20%), enterococci (9%), and Candida species (9%). The mean interval between admission and infection was 13 days for infection with Escherichia coli, 16 days for S. aureus, 22 days for Candida species and Klebsiella species, 23 days for enterococci, and 26 days for Acinetobacter species. CoNS, Pseudomonas species, Enterobacter species, Serratia species, and Acinetobacter species were more likely to cause infections in patients in intensive care units (P<.001). In neutropenic patients, infections with Candida species, enterococci, and viridans group streptococci were significantly more common. The proportion of S. aureus isolates with methicillin resistance increased from 22% in 1995 to 57% in 2001 (P<.001, trend analysis). Vancomycin resistance was seen in 2% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates and in 60% of Enterococcus faecium isolates. CONCLUSION: In this study, one of the largest multicenter studies performed to date, we found that the proportion of nosocomial BSIs due to antibiotic-resistant organisms is increasing in US hospitals.
TI  - Determining incidence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 38 centres from 17 countries: the PEARLS study 2001-2002.
AB  - The PEARLS study prospectively monitored selected nosocomial pathogens from 38 centres in 13 European, three Middle Eastern countries and South Africa during 2001-2002. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production rates among Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter spp. were 5.4% (142/2609), 18.2% (401/2,206) and 8.8% (204/2,328), respectively, for all study sites. The overall ESBL production rate for the combined Enterobacteriaceae was 10.5% (747/7,143), highest in Egypt, 38.5%, and Greece, 27.4%, and lowest in The Netherlands, 2.0%, and Germany, 2.6%. IEF, PCR and DNA sequencing determined 10.7% false positives among Enterobacter spp. when using NCCLS guidelines to screen for ESBL production. The prevalence of nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium was 32.4% (294/908) and 8.7% (83/949), respectively. PEARLS provides baseline data against which prospective changes in resistant determinants and outcomes can be measured in this ongoing study.
TI  - Emerging resistance among bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit--a European and North American Surveillance study (2000-2002).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally ICUs are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. METHODS: Antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant ICU pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Databases in Europe (France, Germany and Italy), Canada, and the United States (US). RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance rates among Staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. Penicillin resistance rates among Streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in Germany to as high as 20.2% in the US; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in Germany to 3.4% in Italy. Vancomycin resistance rates among Enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among Enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in France to 76.3% in the United States. Putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production among Enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among Escherichia coli in the five countries studied. Ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the Enterobacteriaceae species examined. Fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for E. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), Proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and Morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other Enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). P. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. Imipenem was the most active compound tested against Acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. CONCLUSION: There was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. Compared with other countries, Italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of Enterococcus spp., which were highest in the US. This data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in Europe and North America and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of integrons in blood culture Enterobacteriaceae  and gastrointestinal Escherichia coli in Norway and reporting of a novel class 1 integron-located lincosamide resistance gene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Class 1 integrons contain genetic elements for site-specific recombination, capture and mobilization of resistance genes. Studies investigating the prevalence, distribution and types of integron located resistance genes are important for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and to understand resistance development at the molecular level. METHODS: We determined the prevalence and genetic content of class 1 integrons in Enterobacteriaceae (strain collection 1, n = 192) and E. coli (strain collection 2, n = 53) from bloodstream infections in patients from six Norwegian hospitals by molecular techniques. Class 1 integrons were also characterized in 54 randomly selected multiresistant E. coli isolates from gastrointestinal human infections (strain collection 3). RESULTS: Class 1 integrons were present in 10.9% of the Enterobacteriaceae blood culture isolates of collection 1, all but one (S. Typhi) being E. coli. Data indicated variations in class 1 integron prevalence between hospitals. Class 1 integrons were present in 37% and 34% of the resistant blood culture isolates (collection 1 and 2, respectively) and in 42% of the resistant gastrointestinal E. coli. We detected a total of 10 distinct integron cassette PCR amplicons that varied in size between 0.15 kb and 2.2 kb and contained between zero and three resistance genes. Cassettes encoding resistance to trimethoprim and aminoglycosides were most common. We identified and characterized a novel plasmid-located integron with a cassette-bound novel gene (linF) located downstream of an aadA2 gene cassette. The linF gene encoded a putative 273 aa lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase resistance protein and conferred resistance to lincomycin and clindamycin. The deduced LinF amino acid sequence displayed approximately 35% identity to the Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis nucleotidyl transferases encoded by linB and linB' CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated an overall low and stable prevalence of class 1 integron gene cassettes in clinical Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli isolates in Norway. Characterization of the novel lincosamide resistance gene extends the growing list of class 1 integron gene cassettes that confer resistance to an increasing number of antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 against selected bacteria.
AB  - Immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. This study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. L. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. The antimicrobial potential of immobilized L. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus) or Pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. Results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized L. lactis inhibited the growth of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus sakei, Kocuria varians, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees C resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. With the addition of 10 mM of a chelating agent (EDTA) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of E. coli; however, P. putida and Salmonella Typhi were unaffected by this treatment. These results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial growth in semisolid synthetic media.
TI  - Results of a multicenter, randomized, open-label efficacy and safety study of two doses of tigecycline for complicated skin and skin-structure infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic being investigated for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. Tigecycline has been shown to be efficacious against serious infections in animals, and preliminary studies in healthy adults have shown that tigecycline has an acceptable tolerability profile. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the clinical and microbiological efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, and tolerability of 2 doses of tigecycline in hospitalized patients with a complicated skin and skin-structure infection (cSSSI). METHODS: This Phase II, randomized, open-label study was conducted between September 1999 and March 2001 at 14 investigative centers across the United States. Patients were randomized to receive tigecycline 25 or 50 mg IV q12h for 7 to 14 days. The primary efficacy end point was the clinically observed cure rate among clinically evaluable (CE) patients at the test-of-cure visit. Secondary end points were the clinical cure rate at the end of treatment and bacteriologic response in microbiologically evaluable (ME) patients. Also, in vitro tests of susceptibility to tigecycline were performed for selected pathogens known to cause skin infections, including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. Tolerability assessments also were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients received > or =1 dose of tigecycline; 109 patients were CE, and 91 were ME. The majority of patients (74%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 49.0 (14.8) years. At the test-of-cure visit, the clinical cure rate in the 25-mg group was 67% (95% CI, 53.3%-79.3%) and in the 50-mg group was 74% (95% CI, 60.3%-85.0%). In the 25-mg group, 56% of the patients had eradication (95% CI, 40.0%-70.4%) of the pathogens compared with 69% (95% CI, 54.2%-82.3%) in the 50-mg group. Values for the minimum concentration of tigecycline that is inhibitory for 90% of all isolates ranged from 0.06 to 0.50 microg/mL for the selected pathogens. Both tigecycline doses were generally well tolerated. Nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, tigecycline appeared efficacious and showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of hospitalized patients with cSSSI. In patients who received 50-mg doses of tigecycline q12h, the clinical cure rates and microbial eradication rates were 74% and 70%, respectively, and were 67% and 56% in patients who received 25-mg doses.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in the United States in 2002.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns should guide the choice of empiric antimicrobial regimens for patients with bacteremia. METHODS: From January to December of 2002, 82,569 bacterial blood culture isolates were reported to The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA by 268 laboratories. Susceptibility to relevant antibiotic compounds was analyzed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (42.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.3%), Escherichia coli (7.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.6%), and Enterococcus faecium (3.5%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures, collectively accounting for >80% of isolates. In vitro susceptibility to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone were high for oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (98.7%), oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (99.8%), E. coli (97.3%), K. pneumoniae (93.3%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (97.2%). Susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones were variable for K. pneumoniae (90.3-91.4%), E. coli (86.0-86.7%), oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (84.0-89.4%), oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (72.7-82.7%), E. faecalis (52.1%), and E. faecium (11.3%). Combinations of antimicrobials are often prescribed as empiric therapy for bacteremia. Susceptibilities of all blood culture isolates to one or both agents in combinations of ceftriaxone, ceftazdime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin were consistent (range, 74.8-76.3%) but lower than similar beta-lactam or ciprofloxacin combinations with vancomycin (range, 93.5-96.6%). CONCLUSION: Ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility remains essential, and will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland 2001-2002: the BSAC Bacteraemia Resistance Surveillance Programme.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. METHODS: In 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the UK and Ireland. A single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured MICs by the BSAC agar dilution method. RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of Staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in Streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group B isolates (82% resistant). Nine percent of S. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (MICs 0.12-1 mg/L), but none required >/=2 mg/L for inhibition. High-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of Enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin MICs (>/=32 mg/L), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. Only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of Enterococcus faecium. Vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of E. faecium, 3% of E. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, MIC of 8 mg/L). Escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of E. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of Klebsiella spp. and 8% of Enterobacter spp. Resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. Among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in Gram-positive organisms. Ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. MICs of tigecycline were low for Gram-positive species and Enterobacteriaceae except Proteeae and Enterobacter spp. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. An important exception was oxacillin resistance in S. aureus.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of three new quinolones and azithromycin against  aerobic pathogens causing respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our study the in vitro susceptibility of common pathogens that cause respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections was tested against two newer fluorquinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) as well as levofloxacin and azithromycin. METHODS: 50 isolates each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae isolated from the respiratory tract and from wounds were tested for their susceptibility to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and azithromycin. RESULTS: Moxifloxacin proved to be the most active substance against the tested gram-positive pathogens. Gatifloxacin was the most active against P. aeruginosa. Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin proved to be comparably active against the clinical isolates of E. coli and H. influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin display excellent activity against respiratory pathogens as well as nosocomial pathogens causing abdominal wound infections. When treating infections caused by P. aeruginosa the earlier fluorquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are the substances of choice.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in methanolic extracts of several plant species from northern Argentina.
AB  - Thirty-nine native plant species were collected from the provinces of Chaco and Formosa, in northern Argentina, and were screened for antimicrobial activity. The plants were dried and extracted thoroughly with methanol. The dry extracts, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, were tested for inhibition of microbial growth via microplate assay with an oxidation-reduction dye. The test organisms were: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Inhibition of respiratory activities in some of these microbial species was produced by the extracts of Astronium balansae, Geoffroea decorticans, Peltophorum dubium, Geoffroea spinosa, Lantana balansae, Prosopis kuntzei, Prosopis ruscifolia and Bulnesia sarmientoi, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 0.08 to 0.5 mg dry matter/ml. Further in vitro experiments measuring the growth of S. aureus in liquid culture confirmed that all of the above extracts at 2 x MIC were able to inhibit bacterial growth effectively, and that some of them (A. balansae, G. decorticans, P. dubium, G. spinosa, P. kuntzei and B. sarmientoi) were able to reduce the initial number of viable counts by at least one order of magnitude in 10 hours, indicating that these extracts should be investigated further for the possible presence of bactericidal components.
TI  - Comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492, was determined. METHODS: MICs were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. The effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. RESULTS: MIC data indicate that ABT-492 has potent activity against Gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis but not Enterococcus faecium. ABT-492 was the most active agent tested against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible Neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. Good activity was observed for ABT-492 amongst the Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of Proteus, Morganella and Providencia, as well as for Pseudomonas spp. In common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised MIC(90)s to ABT-492. The one isolate of H. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an ABT-492 MIC close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. ABT-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against Chlamydia spp. An inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. faecium, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised MICs in the presence of 70% serum protein. The clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. CONCLUSIONS: ABT-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.
TI  - Harmonization of antimicrobial susceptibility testing among veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five Nordic countries.
AB  - A total of 100 bacterial strains (25 Escherichia coli, 25 Salmonella enterica, 25 Staphylococcus aureus, and 25 Enterococcus strains) and four reference strains were tested for susceptibility toward 8-12 antimicrobial agents in 12 veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five Nordic countries using routine methodology. In addition, the 25 Enterococcus strains were identified to species level. A total of 22,598 (97.2%) out of 23,259 test results were in accordance when the data were categorized as susceptible or resistant. When the reported results were categorized according to the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards breakpoints, the percentage of concordant results increased to 98.4% and the performance between laboratories varied between 94.2 and 99.4% concordant results. For E. coli, S. aureus, and Salmonella, all laboratories except one had more than 97% concordant results, whereas for Enterococcus spp., two laboratories had less than 90% concordant results. Susceptibility testing of Salmonella to fluoroquinolones gave rise to almost 0.5% nonconcordant results and susceptibility testing of S. aureus to vancomycin resulted in that 1.8% of the strains were incorrectly reported as vancomycin resistant. Ten laboratories identified the Enterococcus spp. to species level. All five Enterococcus faecium and 10 Enterococcus faecalis selected from the strain collection at the Danish Veterinary Institute were correctly identified by all laboratories, whereas some problems were observed identifying other enterococcal species. This study showed a good performance and agreement in antimicrobial susceptibility testing at the 12 participating laboratories and that surveillance data covering susceptibility test results of E. coli, S. aureus, and Salmonella from animals in the Nordic countries are comparable. But it also showed that some aspects can be improved. In addition, the study showed that the different laboratories are capable of identifying E. faecalis and E. faecium.
TI  - Interactions between penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and two novel classes of  PBP inhibitors, arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-ones.
AB  - Several non-beta-lactam compounds were active against various gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. The MICs of arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-ones were lower than those of ampicillin and cefotaxime for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MI339 and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium EF12. Several compounds were found to inhibit the cell wall synthesis of S. aureus and the last two steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis catalyzed by ether-treated cells of Escherichia coli or cell wall membrane preparations of Bacillus megaterium. The effects of the arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-one derivatives on E. coli PBP 3 and PBP 5, Streptococcus pneumoniae PBP 2xS (PBP 2x from a penicillin-sensitive strain) and PBP 2xR (PBP 2x from a penicillin-resistant strain), low-affinity PBP 2a of S. aureus, and the Actinomadura sp. strain R39 and Streptomyces sp. strain R61 DD-peptidases were studied. Some of the compounds exhibited inhibitory activities in the 10 to 100 microM concentration range. The inhibition of PBP 2xS by several of them appeared to be noncompetitive. The dissociation constant for the best inhibitor (Ki = 10 microM) was not influenced by the presence of the substrate.
TI  - Increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Korea: KONSAR study in 2001.
AB  - The 5th year KONSAR surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. It was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of Enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. Resistance rates of Gram-positive cocci were: 70% of Staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of Enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. Seventy-two percent of pneumococci were nonsusceptible to penicillin. The resistance rates of Enterobacteriaceae were: Escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and Enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. The resistance rates of P. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. Thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of Haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. Notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. With the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Assessment of the antibacterial activity of selected flavonoids and consideration of discrepancies between previous reports.
AB  - Activity of the flavonoids apigenin, baicalin and galangin against sensitive and  antibiotic resistant strains of Staphylococculs aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated. Using an agar dilution assay, galangin was shown to have a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 25 to 50 microg/mL against all six strains of S. aureus but negligible activity against the othe species. Apigenin displayed only marginal activity against S. aureus and no activity was detected from baicalin. In inhibition curve studies, galangin caused a 100,000-fold decrease in the viability of a growing population of S. aureus NCTC 6571 within the first two hours of treatment. Decreases in viability of S. aureus NCTC 11561 and NCIMB 9968 populations were also observed.
TI  - Characterization of a new erm-related macrolide resistance gene present in probiotic strains of Bacillus clausii.
AB  - The mechanism of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramins B was studied in four Bacillus clausii strains that are mixed in a probiotic administered to humans for prevention of gastrointestinal side effects due to oral antibiotic chemotherapy and in three reference strains of B. clausii, DSM8716, ATCC 21536, and ATCC 21537. An 846-bp gene called erm(34), which is related to the erm genes conferring resistance to these antibiotics by ribosomal methylation, was cloned from total DNA of B. clausii DSM8716 into Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence presented 61% identity with that of Erm(D) from B. licheniformis, B. halodurans, and B. anthracis. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of total DNA digested by I-CeuI, followed by hybridization with an erm(34)-specific probe, indicated a chromosomal location of the gene in all B. clausii strains. Repeated attempts to transfer resistance to macrolides by conjugation from B. clausii strains to Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2, E. faecium HM1070, and B. subtilis UCN19 were unsuccessful.
TI  - Mur-LH, the broad-spectrum endolysin of Lactobacillus helveticus temperate bacteriophage phi-0303.
AB  - phi-0303 is a temperate bacteriophage isolated from Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ 303 strain after mitomycin C induction. In this work, the gene coding for a lytic protein of this bacteriophage was cloned using a library of phi-0303 in Escherichia coli DH5alpha. The lytic activity was detected by its expression, using whole cells of the sensitive strain L. helveticus CNRZ 892 as the substrate. The lysin gene was within a 4.1-kb DNA fragment of phi-0303 containing six open reading frames (ORFs) and two truncated ORFs. No sequence homology with holin genes was found within the cloned fragment. An integrase-encoding gene was also present in the fragment, but it was transcribed in a direction opposite that of the lysin gene. The lysin-encoding lys gene was verified by PCR amplification from the total phage DNA and subcloned. The lys gene is a 1,122-bp sequence encoding a protein of 373 amino acids (Mur-LH), whose product had a deduced molecular mass of 40,207 Da. Comparisons with sequences in sequence databases showed homology with numerous endolysins of other bacteriophages. Mur-LH was expressed in E. coli BL21, and by renaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with L. helveticus CNRZ 892 as the substrate, the recombinant protein showed an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa. The N-terminal sequence of the protein confirmed the start codon. Hydrolysis of cell walls of L. helveticus CNRZ 303 by the endolysin and biochemical analysis of the residues produced demonstrated that Mur-LH has N-acetylmuramidase activity. Last, the endolysin exhibited a broad spectrum of lytic activity, as it was active on different species, mainly thermophilic lactobacilli but also lactococci, pediococci, Bacillus subtilis, Brevibacterium linens, and Enterococcus faecium.
TI  - A novel antibacterial iridoid and triterpene from Caiophora coronata.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of the antibacterial CH(2)Cl(2)-MeOH extract obtained from the aerial parts of the Argentinean plant Caiophora coronata led to the isolation of a new triterpene, 1beta,3beta-dihydroxyurs-12-en-27-oic acid, 1, and a new iridoid, 1alpha-methoxy-6alpha,10-dihydroxyisoepiiridomyrmecin (caiophoraenin), 2, along with the known iridoid isoboonein 3. Their structures were established by spectroscopic techniques (1D and 2D NMR, HRFABMS, FTIR). The MIC values of isolated compounds were determined against methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and -resistant (MRSA) strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis (BS), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), Escherichia coli (EC), E. coli imp (ECimp), and Candida albicans (CA). Compound 1 was found active against BS, MSSA, MRSA, VREF, and ECimp with MIC values of 2, 4, 4, 4, and 16 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Bacteraemia in hospitalised patients with malignant blood disorders: a retrospective study of causative agents and their resistance profiles during a 14-year period without antibacterial prophylaxis.
AB  - Bacteraemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with haematological disorders during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The generally reported trend during the last two decades has been a gradual replacement of Gram-negative bacilli by Gram-positive cocci as the major causes of bacteraemia in neutropenic hosts. However, data that are unaffected by the use of antibacterial prophylaxis are scarce. Our objective therefore was to study the incidence of bacteraemia with different microorganisms in a haematology centre where antibacterial prophylaxis has not been used during the years 1988-2001. A total of 1402 episodes of clinically significant bacteraemia in 927 patients were identified. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and had an underlying haematological disorder, with lymphoma, leukaemia, and myeloma dominating. There were 536 (58%) male, and 391 (42%) female patients, with a median age of 58 years. The dominating pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) 17%, Escherichia coli 16%, alpha-haemolytic streptococci 12%, Staphylococcus aureus 9%, Klebsiella spp 9%, Enterococcus spp 7%, and Pseudomonas spp 5%. The only significant incidence change was an increase of E. faecium bacteraemia. The balance between Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms was essentially stable over the 14-year period. The rates of antibiotic resistance were generally low and stable. Gram-negative bacteria exhibited resistance to fluoroquinolones after 1998. The 7- and 30-day mortality rates were 6.3 and 15.6%, respectively, being significantly higher in patients with bacteraemia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, or E. faecium.
TI  - A six amino acid deletion, partially overlapping the VanSB G2 ATP-binding motif,  leads to constitutive glycopeptide resistance in VanB-type Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium clinical isolate BM4524, resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin, harboured a chromosomal vanB cluster, including the vanSB/vanRB two-component system regulatory genes. Enterococcus faecium strain BM4525, isolated two weeks later from the same patient, was resistant to high levels of both glycopeptides. The ddl gene of BM4525 had a 2 bp insertion leading to an impaired d-alanine:d-alanine ligase. Sequencing of the vanB operon in BM4525 also revealed an 18 bp deletion in the vanSB gene designated vanSBDelta. The resulting six amino acid deletion partially overlapped the G2 ATP-binding domain of the VanSBDelta histidine kinase leading to constitutive expression of the resistance genes. Sequence analysis indicated that the deletion occurred between two tandemly arranged heptanucleotide direct repeats, separated by 11 base-pairs. The VanSB, VanSBDelta and VanRB proteins were overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified. In vitro autophosphorylation of the VanSB and VanSBDelta histidine kinases and phosphotransfer to the VanRB response regulator did not differ significantly. However, VanSBDelta was deficient in VanRB phosphatase activity leading to accumulation of phosphorylated VanRB. Increased glycopeptide resistance in E. faecium BM4525 was therefore a result of the lack of production of d-alanyl-d-alanine ending pentapeptide and to constitutive synthesis of d-alanyl-d-lactate terminating peptidoglycan precursors, following loss of d-alanine:d-alanine ligase and of VanSB phosphatase activity respectively. We suggest that the heptanucleotide direct repeat in vanSB may favour the appearance of high level constitutively expressed vancomycin resistance through a 'slippage' type of genetic rearrangement in VanB-type strains.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Leontopodium alpinum (Edelweiss).
AB  - Extracts and individual constituents of Leontopodium alpinum Cass. (Asteraceae) were tested for their antimicrobial activity in two different assays. Extracts were screened in agar diffusion assays, whereas the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of single compounds were determined by the microbroth dilution method according to NCCLS criteria. Significant antimicrobial activities were found against various strains of Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes strains. These results support the ethnomedicinal use of Leontopodium alpinum for the treatment of respiratory and abdominal disorders.
TI  - Sequence and genetic organization of the 19.3-kb erythromycin- and dalfopristin-resistance plasmid pLME300 from Lactobacillus fermentum ROT1.
AB  - Lactobacillus fermentum ROT1 was isolated from a raw milk dairy product. It is resistant to novobiocin, tetracycline, erythromycin and dalfopristin. A chromosomal tetracycline-resistance determinant was identified as tetM. A 19,398-bp plasmid (pLME300), present in several erythromycin-resistant strains of Lb. fermentum, was isolated from strain ROT1 and completely sequenced. Based on putative open reading frames, pLME300 contains at least four different functional regions. In region I, ORF1 shows high homologies to replication proteins of different theta-replicating plasmids. In addition, a tandem repeat of a 22-bp sequence appears 4.5 times. In region II, ORF3 may code for a methylase, and ORF4 has homologies to Mrr restriction system proteins of Deinococcus radiodurans and Escherichia coli suggesting a restriction-modification system. Region III harbours antibiotic-resistance genes, coding for a macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) methylase Erm(LF) and the streptogramin A acetyltransferase Vat(E), which is identical to Vat(E) from Enterococcus faecium. Furthermore, region III shows a 91% nucleotide sequence identity to an erm-vat linkage of E. faecium. Region IV carries ORFs that appear to be involved in plasmid mobilization as characterized by a putative origin of transfer and a mobilization protein. pLME300 is the largest completely sequenced multi-resistance plasmid isolated from any Lactobacillus strain so far.
TI  - Species distribution and antibiotic resistance patterns of enterococci isolated from food of animal origin in Germany.
AB  - Presently, enterococci take the third place of bacterial pathogens associated with nosocomial infections, after staphylococci and Escherichia coli. Especially, the resistances of enterococci to several available antibiotics are threatening. We attempted to determine which species of enterococci could be found in food of animal origin and their significance according to their antibiotic resistances for human beings. From November 2000 to May 2002 we investigated 155 samples of food of animal origin bought in retail outlets in Germany: 27 samples of sausages, 19 of ham, 83 of minced meat, 26 of cheese. From these food samples we isolated 416 enterococcal strains. The most frequent species was Enterococcus faecalis (299 strains); furthermore, we found Enterococcus faecium (54 strains), Enterococcus durans together with Enterococcus hirae (24 strains), Enterococcus casseliflavus (22 strains), Enterococcus avium (9 strains) and Enterococcus gallinarum (8 strains). We focused on the resistance patterns of 118 selected E. faecium and E. faecalis strains to 13 antimicrobial active agents (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, avilamycin, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, flavomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, tetracycline and vancomycin). From the clinical point of view, the situation of antibiotic resistance to the examined antimicrobial agents seemed to be favourable. The investigated strains were sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. These antibiotics are, in combination with an aminoglycoside, for example gentamicin, agents of choice for the treatment of enterococcal infections in human medicine. Only one E. faecium strain was resistant to penicillin, while all strains were sensitive to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin. Resistances found against the antibiotics, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin and erythromycin, are causes for concern.
TI  - Comparison of fecal flora following administration of two antibiotic protocols for suspected maternofetal infection.
AB  - Two protocols are used by French neonatologists for the treatment of suspected maternofetal infection (SMFI). Three groups of premature and term neonates were included to study the impact of antibiotics on fecal flora: 10 infants with SMFI treated with amoxicillin and netilmicin (group BI), 10 infants with SMFI treated with amoxicillin, cefotoxime and netilmicin (group TRI) and 10 infants without antibiotic therapy as controls (group C). Group BI samples were colonized with Klebsiella oxytoca and Escherichia coli resistant to amoxicillin and by Eneterococcus faecium and coagulase-negative staphylococci. In group TRI biodiversity of the intestinal flora was low, with rapid growth of staphyloccoci and occurrence of Candida spp. These modifications of the intestinal flora should encourage us to use antibiotic treatment as targeted as possible.
TI  - The screening of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactic acid bacteria and their application to inactivating psychrotrophic food-borne pathogens.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from various food samples and evaluated for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Cells suspended in 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose plus 0.5% (wt/vol) lactate (pH 7.0) were incubated for 5 h at 37 degrees C under aeration. Among 193 strains, 27 strains accumulated 201-300 ppm H2O2, and 4 strains accumulated more than 301 ppm H2O2 in the cell suspensions. Among the 9 high-level H2O2-producing strains, 8 strains were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. The cell-free filtrate from Lc. lactis subsp. lactis AI 62, which contained approximately 350 ppm H2O2, was evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Listeria ivanovii, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Aeromonas hydrophila. After 1 h incubation at 30 degrees C in the cell-free filtrate, the initial viable cell counts of the target bacteria (5.53-6.00 log cfu/mL) were reduced by 0.12-5.00 log units, except in the case of enterococci. The sensitivity varied with the bacterial species and pH. The enterococci were resistant to the treatment. Our results show that H2O2 accumulated by lactic acid bacteria in a cell suspension is very effective in reducing the viable cell count of food-borne pathogens.
TI  - The effect of cyclosporine and tacrolimus on indigenous bacterial flora in human  skin grafts.
AB  - Allogeneic skin transplants require intensive immunosuppressive therapy. Treatment protocols used for parenchymal organ grafts are not satisfactory to prevent skin graft rejection. Another factor responsible for the destruction of allogeneic skin transplants is bacterial inflammation. Temporary ischemia and the allogeneic reaction in transplanted skin cause increased permeability of the epidermis and the dermal capillaries, making skin grafts vulnerable to bacterial penetration. Moreover, immunosuppressive therapy compromises the host immune response. The present study assessed the effects of immunosuppression by cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus (Tac) on the indigenous bacterial flora of transplanted human skin. We found that a 6-day course of treatment with CsA or Tac was followed by an increased prevalence of bacterial isolates, mostly evidenced by a change in the spectrum of graft bacterial flora from Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci toward more pathogenic strains such as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, micrococcus, and pseudomonas. The mouse skin adjacent to the graft remained sterile, precluding the possibility of graft contamination with mouse flora.
TI  - Efficacy of some neutralizers in suspension tests determining the activity of disinfectants.
AB  - The ability of six mixtures to neutralize glutaraldehyde, o-phthalaldehyde and peracetic acid was tested using four reference strains: Pseudomonas aeruginosa CIP A22, Escherichia coli CIP 54127, Staphylococcus aureus CIP 53154, and Enterococcus faecium CIP 5855. Glutaraldehyde was the hardest to neutralize, and peracetic acid the easiest. The most effective mixture was Tween 80 with sodium bisulphate, sodium thioglycolate, lecithin and cysteine, and the least effective was Tween 80, lecithin and histidine. The efficacy of the neutralizers may indicate a propensity loss of activity from interfering substances when disinfectants are used in practice.
TI  - A standardized test to assess the impact of different organic challenges on the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics.
AB  - This paper presents a suggestion for determining the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics in a phase 2/step 1 assay. Emphasis is placed on specific organic challenges to evaluate the efficacy of antiseptics used to rinse the oral cavity, mucous membranes, or wounds for either prophylactic or therapeutic reasons. Basic data are given concerning ready-to-use products based on Poly(1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone-)iodine-complex (PVP-iodine), chlorhexidine, octenidine, or cetylpyridinium chloride. Hydrogen peroxide (3.0%) was included to assess a product with known limited efficacy only. Using Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, and Candida albicans, a 10(5)-fold reduction can be achieved in 10 min without interfering substances. In the presence of 10% albumin, 10% sheep blood, or 1% mucin, a 10(3)-fold reduction is yielded using products based on PVP-iodine, octenidine, or chlorhexidine. The combination of 4.5% albumin, 4.5% sheep blood, and 1% mucin was the most difficult organic challenge and only the products based on PVP-iodine, octenidine, or chlorhexidine remained active. The cetylpyridinium-based product and hydrogen peroxide were less effective. Based on these data, a proposal for a phase 2/step 1 assay for antiseptics is presented to promote the standardization efforts.
TI  - Mutations in the DNA mismatch repair proteins MutS and MutL of oxazolidinone-resistant or -susceptible Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Mutations in mutS and mutL, which encode DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, can  confer hypermutator phenotypes and may facilitate the emergence of mutational antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Linezolid-resistant enterococci (LRE) rarely emerge during therapy and contain mutations in 23S rRNA genes. As enterococci with defective MMR could be prone to the development of oxazolidinone resistance mutations, we investigated 13 clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium, including 2 LRE, for mutations in mutSL. A 4,944-bp fragment spanning mutSL was sequenced from two pairs of linezolid-resistant (MICs, 64 micro g/ml) and linezolid-susceptible (MICs, 2 micro g/ml) E. faecium isolates (one pair from Austria and one pair from the United Kingdom) identical by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The pairs represented distinct strains in which linezolid resistance had emerged during therapy. The MutSL peptides of all four isolates had amino acid substitutions compared with the sequence of E. faecium strain DO (used for genome sequencing). These were Val352Ile (one pair of isolates only) and Met628Leu in MutS and Leu387Pro, Tyr406Phe, Thr415Ser, Phe427Leu, and Phe565Ile in MutL. The significance of these changes remains unknown; these isolates did not show a demonstrable hypermutator phenotype. The same substitutions were found in two of nine geographically diverse linezolid-susceptible enterococcal isolates; the other seven isolates had MutSL sequences identical to that of strain DO. Multilocus sequence typing revealed that all isolates with alternate MutSL peptides belonged to a distinct lineage of a prevalent E. faecium clonal complex, designated CC17. Further studies are needed to investigate the prevalence of these MutSL mutations and their possible roles in the emergence of E. faecium strains resistant to oxazolidinones and other antibiotic classes.
TI  - Binding of extracellular matrix molecules by probiotic bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate extracellular matrix (ECM) and mucin binding of selected bacterial isolates with probiotic features in comparison with commercially used probiotic bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: ECM molecules were immobilized in microtitre plates (mucin and fetuin) or on the surface of latex beads. Porcine mucin was bound by all 13 probiotic strains tested with important inter-strain differences; however, fetuin binding was similar (weak) for all 14 strains tested. Strongly positive (three) binding of bovine fibrinogen was expressed by strains from fermented food (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. casei Shirota and L. johnsonii La1) as well as by L. casei L.c., Lactobacillus sp. 2I3 and by L. plantarum LP. The other strains expressed moderate (2) or weakly positive (1) binding of bovine fibrinogen. Strongly positive (3) binding of porcine fibronectin was observed only with two strains; however, all other strains also bound this molecule. Bovine lactoferrin was bound to a higher extent than transferrins. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Some animal strains (at least L. casei L.c. and Lactobacillus sp. 2I3) are comparable with the commercially used strains with respect to their ECM binding ability. As this feature is important for probiotic bacteria to be able to colonize intestine, these strains should be considered for their wider use in fermented feed (or probiotic preparations) for animals.
TI  - Angiotensin I-converting-enzyme-inhibitory and antibacterial peptides from Lactobacillus helveticus PR4 proteinase-hydrolyzed caseins of milk from six species.
AB  - Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine alpha(S1)-casein (alpha(S1)-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and beta-CN f58-76; ovine alpha(S1)-CN f1-6 and alpha(S2)-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine beta-CN f58-65 and alpha(S2)-CN f182-187; buffalo beta-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human beta-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 micro g/ml (100 micro mol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 micro g/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC(50)s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to beta-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 micro g/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.
TI  - Discovery of a small molecule that inhibits cell division by blocking FtsZ, a novel therapeutic target of antibiotics.
AB  - The emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a major health problem and, therefore, it is critical to develop new antibiotics with novel modes of action. FtsZ, a tubulin-like GTPase, plays an essential role in bacterial cell division, and its homologs are present in almost all eubacteria and archaea. During cell division, FtsZ forms polymers in the presence of GTP that recruit other division proteins to make the cell division apparatus. Therefore, inhibition of FtsZ polymerization will prevent cells from dividing, leading to cell death. Using a fluorescent FtsZ polymerization assay, the screening of >100,000 extracts of microbial fermentation broths and plants followed by fractionation led to the identification of viriditoxin, which blocked FtsZ polymerization with an IC50 of 8.2 microg/ml and concomitant GTPase inhibition with an IC50 of 7.0 microg/ml. That the mode of antibacterial action of viriditoxin is via inhibition of FtsZ was confirmed by the observation of its effects on cell morphology, macromolecular synthesis, DNA-damage response, and increased minimum inhibitory concentration as a result of an increase in the expression of the FtsZ protein. Viriditoxin exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, without affecting the viability of eukaryotic cells.
TI  - Many chemokines including CCL20/MIP-3alpha display antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that beta-defensins exhibit chemotactic activity by sharing the chemokine receptor CCR6 with the CC chemokine ligand CCL20/macrophage-inflammatory protein-3alpha (MIP-3alpha). Structural analysis of CCL20/MIP-3alpha revealed that most of the positively charged residues are concentrated at one area of its topological surface, a characteristic considered to be important for the antimicrobial activity of defensins. Here, we report that similar to defensins, CCL20/MIP-3alpha has antimicrobial effects on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. Additionally, by screening a total of 30 human chemokines, we have identified an additional 17 human chemokines, which exhibit antimicrobial activity in vitro. Collectively, about two-thirds of the chemokines investigated so far has the capacity to kill microorganisms in vitro, suggesting that antimicrobial activity may be another host-defense function for certain chemokines. Comparison of the structural characteristics between antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial chemokines suggests that topological formation of a large, positively charged electrostatic patch on the surface of the molecule is likely to be a common structural feature of antimicrobial chemokines.
TI  - Antimicrobial characterization of human beta-defensin 3 derivatives.
AB  - Human beta-defensin 3 (hBD3) is a highly basic 45-amino-acid protein that acts both as an antimicrobial agent and as a chemoattractant molecule. Although the nature of its antimicrobial activity is largely electrostatic, the importance of the molecular structure on this activity is poorly understood. Two isoforms of hBD3 were synthesized: the first with native disulfide linkages and the second with nonnative linkages. In a third synthetic peptide, all cysteine residues were replaced with alpha-aminobutyric acid, creating a completely linear peptide. A series of six small, linear peptides corresponding to regions of hBD3 with net charges ranging from +4 to +8 (at pH 7) and lengths ranging from 9 to 20 amino acids were also synthesized. The linear full-length peptide showed the highest microbicidal activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, while all three full-length forms showed equal activity against Candida albicans. The linear peptide also showed high activity against Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Peptides corresponding to the C terminus showed higher activities when tested against E. coli, with the most active peptides being the most basic. However, only the peptide corresponding to the N terminus of hBD3 showed any activity against S. aureus and C. albicans. Further, N-terminal deletion mutants of native hBD3 showed diminished activities against S. aureus. Thus, the antimicrobial properties of hBD3 derivatives are determined by both charge and structure.
TI  - An Enterococcus faecium secreted antigen, SagA, exhibits broad-spectrum binding to extracellular matrix proteins and appears essential for E. faecium growth.
AB  - A gene encoding a major secreted antigen, SagA, was identified in Enterococcus faecium by screening an E. faecium genomic expression library with sera from patients with E. faecium-associated endocarditis. Recombinant SagA protein showed broad-spectrum binding to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including fibrinogen, collagen type I, collagen type IV, fibronectin, and laminin. A fibrinogen-binding protein, purified from culture supernatants of an E. faecium clinical isolate, was found to match the N-terminal sequence of the predicted SagA protein and to react with the anti-SagA antibody, confirming that it was the SagA protein; this protein appeared as an 80- to 90-kDa smear on a Western blot that was sensitive to proteinase K and resistant to periodate treatment and glycoprotein staining. When overexpressed in E. faecium and Escherichia coli, the native and recombinant SagA proteins formed stable oligomers, apparently via their C-terminal domains. The SagA protein is composed of three domains: (i) a putative coiled-coil N-terminal domain that shows homology to the N-terminal domain of Streptococcus mutans SagA protein (42% similarity), previously shown to be involved in cell wall integrity and cell shape maintenance, and to the P45 protein of Listeria monocytogenes (41% similarity); (ii) a central domain containing direct repeats; and (iii) a C-terminal domain that is similar to that found in various proteins, including P45 (50% similarity) and P60 (52% similarity) of L. monocytogenes. The P45 and P60 proteins both have cell wall hydrolase activity, and the latter has also been shown to be involved in virulence, whereas cell wall hydrolase activity was not detected for SagA protein. The E. faecium sagA gene, like the S. mutans homologue, is located in a cluster of genes encoding proteins that appear to be involved in cell wall metabolism and could not be disrupted unless it was first transcomplemented, suggesting that the sagA gene is essential for E. faecium growth and may be involved in cell wall metabolism. In conclusion, the extracelluar E. faecium SagA protein is apparently essential for growth, shows broad-spectrum binding to ECM proteins, forms oligomers, and is antigenic during infection.
TI  - Lactobacillus ruminis is a predominant lactic acid producing bacterium in the caecum and rectum of the pig.
AB  - AIMS: To identify the predominant lactic acid producing bacteria in the small intestine, caecum and the rectum of the healthy pig. METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples obtained from the large intestine of healthy pigs post-mortem were cultured using a modified agar-MRS medium in roll tubes. Thirteen isolates were selected on the basis of their morphological characteristics and Gram stain reaction for gene sequencing. These isolates were characterized by DNA sequence analysis of 16S rDNA. Eight isolates were identified as Lactobacillus ruminis, two as Enterococcus faecium, one as Mitsuokella multiacidus and two as Escherichia coli. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of Lact. ruminis as the dominant lactic acid bacteria in the large intestine of the pig. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results suggest that Lact. ruminis is a dominant bacterium in the large intestine of the healthy pig. Future work should focus on the role of this bacterium in relation to the physiological function of the intestine and the health of the animal.
TI  - Disinfection of surfaces by photocatalytic oxidation with titanium dioxide and UVA light.
AB  - Particularly in microbiological laboratories and areas in intensive medical use,  regular and thorough disinfection of surfaces is required in order to reduce the numbers of bacteria and to prevent bacterial transmission. The conventional methods of disinfection with wiping are not effective in the longer term, cannot be standardized, are time- and staff-intensive and use aggressive chemicals. Disinfection with hard ultraviolet C (UVC) light is usually not satisfactory, as the depth of penetration is inadequate and there are occupational medicine risks. Photocatalytic oxidation on surfaces coated with titanium dioxide (TiO2) might offer a possible alternative. In the presence of water and oxygen, highly reactive OH-radicals are generated by TiO2 and mild ultraviolet A (UVA). These radicals are able to destroy bacteria, and may therefore be effective in reducing bacterial contamination. Direct irradiation with UVC however can produce areas of shadow in which bacteria are not inactivated. Using targeted light guidance and a light-guiding sheet (out of a UVA-transmittant, Plexiglas, for example), as in the method described in the present study, bacterial inactivation over the entire area is possible. The effectiveness of the method was demonstrated using bacteria relevant to hygiene such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. For these bacteria, a reduction efficiency (RE) more than 6log10 steps in 60 min was observed. Using Candida albicans, a RE of 2log10 steps in 60 min was seen. Light and scanning electron microscopic examinations suggest that the germ destruction achieved takes place through direct damage to cell walls caused by OH-radicals.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the C-2 side chain. In agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) with a MIC(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. Furthermore, SM-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against MRSA, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the MIC. SM-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of MRSA in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The MICs of SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. These drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against Enterococcus faecium, and the MIC(90) s for ampicillin-resistant E. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. However, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity of SM-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an E. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in CFU at four times the MIC after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. In addition, SM-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the E. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the MICs (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. Among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. Thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - Antiviral activity of N-benzoylphenylisoserinates of Lactarius sesquiterpenoid alcohols in vitro.
AB  - Cytotoxic, antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal properties of a new, originally synthesised group of compounds: the N-benzoylphenylisoserinates of sesquiterpenoid alcohols - derivatives of taxol and various sesquiterpenes of Lactarius origin were evaluated in vitro. Among 16 compounds tested, 6 decreased HSV-1 titres. Selectivity indices ranged from 13.9 to 31.7. No activity against RNA viruses (parainfluenza 3, Coxsackie B3, vesicular stomatitis virus, and encephalomyocarditis virus), bacteria: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis and fungal strain of Candida albicans was detected.
TI  - Susceptibility of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium isolated from pigs and broiler chickens to tetracycline degradation products and distribution of tetracycline resistance determinants in E. coli from food animals.
AB  - One hundred Escherichia coli isolates from diseased and healthy pigs, cattle and  broiler chickens were screened for the presence of tetracycline resistance genes tet(A), (B), (C), (D) or (E). The tet(A) gene was the most abundant (71% of the 100 isolates) followed by tet(B) (25%). The predominance of tet(A) and tet(B) applied to all three animal species, and there was no difference between the distribution of tet(A) and tet(B) genes among non-pathogenic and pathogenic E. coli in any of the animal species. The susceptibility of 20 of these isolates together with 10 tetracycline sensitive E. coli and 18 tetracycline resistant and 10 sensitive Enterococcus faecium to tetracyclines and tetracycline degradation products was determined. The resistant isolates showed reduced resistance to anhydrotetracycline, 4-epi-anhydrotetracycline, anhydrochlortetracycline and 4-epi-anhydrochlortetracycline. In general both the tetracycline resistant and susceptible E. faecium were more susceptible to the compounds tested than E. coli.
TI  - Potential of the enterocin regulatory system to control expression of heterologous genes in Enterococcus.
AB  - AIMS: To exploit the enterocin regulatory system for regulated expression of genes in Enterococcus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Production of some pediocin-like bacteriocins such as enterocin A in Enterococcus is regulated by a three-component system comprising a histidine kinase (entK ), a response regulator (entR) and an induction factor (entF ). Exposure to the induction factor results in the transcription of gene(s) under the control of the enterocin A promoter, including entA which encodes the bacteriocin. In an effort to exploit this system for expression of genes in Enterococcus, a number of vectors were constructed which contain the entA promoter followed by convenient cloning sites to introduce gene(s) of interest. These vectors were used in an enterococcal background which does not produce induction factor but does produce both the kinase and regulator proteins. The system was tested using the reporter genes ltnI (lacticin 3147 immunity) and gusA (beta-glucuronidase) under the control of the entA promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Upon addition of the induction factor, the beta-glucuronidase activity increased 20-fold when compared with uninduced cells. In addition, concentrations of as little as 0.2 nm synthetic EntF were sufficient to give maximal expression. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The potential benefit of having an expression system based on EntF is that gene expression can be finely controlled upon addition of low concentrations of a peptide that can easily be artificially synthesized.
TI  - In vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the British Isles.
AB  - Piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. We assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive, clinically significant isolates from in-patients in UK and Ireland. Standardised disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. For quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for MIC tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. Compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and Enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. These changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of S. aureus-reflected the massive increase of MRSA, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. Based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of P. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of Enterococcus faecalis. Resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in E. coli from 4 to 10%, Klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in AmpC-inducible Enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in P. mirabilis or P. aeruginosa. MIC tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in Enterobacter spp., but indicated susceptibility for about half of the E. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. This situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. Thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that MIC be determined with, e.g., an Etest.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in animals.
AB  - There is currently no systematic surveillance or monitoring of antibiotic resistance in Australian animals. Registration of antibiotics for use in animals is tightly controlled and has been very conservative. Fluoroquinolones have not been registered for use in food producing animals and other products have been removed from the market because of human health concerns. In the late 1970s, the Animal Health Committee coordinated a survey of resistance in Salmonella and Escherichia coli isolates from cattle, pigs and poultry and in bovine Staphylococcus aureus. Some additional information is available from published case reports. In samples collected prior to the withdrawal of avoparcin from the market, no vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium or Enterococcus faecalis were detected in samples collected from pigs, whereas some vanA enterococci, including E. faecium and E. faecalis, were found in chickens. No vanB enterococci were detected in either species. Virginiamycin resistance was common in both pig and poultry isolates. Multiple resistance was common in E. coli and salmonellae isolates. No fluoroquinolone resistance was found in salmonellae, E. coli or Campylobacter. Beta-lactamase production is common in isolates from bovine mastitis, but no methicillin resistance has been detected. However, methicillin resistance has been reported in canine isolates of Staphylococcus intermedius and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli has been found in dogs.
TI  - Streptomyces speibonae sp. nov., a novel streptomycete with blue substrate mycelium isolated from South African soil.
AB  - An actinomycete with blue substrate mycelium was isolated from a soil sample in Cape Town, South Africa, and designated strain PK-Blue(T). The colour of the substrate mycelium was not sensitive to changes in pH. The organism produced hairy spores in Spirales-type spore chains. Chemical taxonomy indicated that it belonged to the genus Streptomyces. Strain PK-Blue(T) produced no diffusible pigments other than melanin, grew at 45 degrees C, did not degrade adenine and exhibited no antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Analysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence and the results of physiological tests showed that strain PK-Blue(T) (= DSM 41797(T) = ATCC BAA-411(T)) represents the type strain of a novel species of Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces speibonae sp. nov. is proposed.
TI  - Persistent silver disinfectant for the environmental control of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contaminated surfaces can act as a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms and potentially exacerbate the risk of infection. Surface disinfection and decontamination provide temporary amelioration against bacterial colonization. Disinfected surfaces eventually become contaminated, thus, mitigating the benefit of the initial disinfection. It is hypothesized that to improve on the current state of the art, a disinfectant should not only immediately disinfect a surface but also provide persistent antimicrobial action after the product has been applied. We describe here a silver-based disinfectant technology designed to provide long-lasting sanitization and disinfection to treated surfaces as evaluated on hard surfaces after repeated environmental insults. METHODS: A comparative evaluation of 6 disinfectant formulations for residual antimicrobial activity after water rinsing was performed. Log reduction of bacterial populations on disinfectant-treated substrates were measured after 30 minutes to 8 hours of exposure and compared with an untreated control. In a similar study, the residual antimicrobial activity of a silver disinfectant was evaluated against antibiotic- and biocide-resistant bacteria also after water rinsing. Further, residual antimicrobial activity of the silver disinfectant was measured after 5 cycles of rinsing, abrasion, and contamination against representative household and nosocomial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, or Salmonella choleraesuis) after 10-minute exposure times. RESULTS: In the comparative assay, only the silver disinfectant and a persistent quaternary ammonium compound disinfectant demonstrated significant residual activity (> or =3.0 log(10) reduction to control) against S aureus whereas only the silver disinfectant demonstrated activity against Pseudomonas. No residual activity (< or = 0.5 log reduction to untreated control) was observed for the other disinfectant products. The silver-based disinfectant also showed significant and equivalent efficacy against antibiotic- and silver-resistant bacteria. In addition, the silver disinfectant was able to achieve significant residual activity in 10 minutes against all organisms tested after 1, 3, and 5 cycles of water rinse, abrasion, and microbial contamination. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show the ability of a new silver-based disinfectant to reduce bacterial populations that contact treated surfaces within minutes, highlight the potential to interrupt cross-contamination from environmental surfaces, and reduce the risk of infection within the home and health care settings.
TI  - Development of a thermally regulated broad-spectrum promoter system for use in pathogenic gram-positive species.
AB  - Selectively regulating gene expression is an essential molecular tool that is lacking for many pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. In this report, we describe the evaluation of a series of promoters regulated by the bacteriophage P1 temperature-sensitive C1 repressor in Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Using the lacZ gene to monitor gene expression, we examined the strength, basal expression, and induced expression of synthetic promoters carrying C1 operator sites. The promoters exhibited extremely low basal expression and, under inducing conditions, gave high levels of expression (100- to 1,000-fold induction). We demonstrate that the promoter system could be modulated by temperature and showed rapid induction and that the mechanism of regulation occurred at the level of transcription. Controlled expression with the same constructs was also demonstrated in the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. However, low basal expression and the ability to achieve derepression were dependent on both the number of mismatches in the C1 operator sites and the promoter driving c1 expression. Since the promoters were designed to contain conserved promoter elements from gram-positive species and were constructed in a broad-host-range plasmid, this system will provide a new opportunity for controlled gene expression in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Kinetic mechanism of the GCN5-related chromosomal aminoglycoside acetyltransferase AAC(6')-Ii from Enterococcus faecium: evidence of dimer subunit cooperativity.
AB  - The aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyltransferase AAC(6')-Ii from Enterococcus faecium is an important microbial resistance determinant and a member of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily. We report here the further characterization of this enzyme in terms of the kinetic mechanism of acetyl transfer and identification of rate-contributing step(s) in catalysis, as well as investigations into the binding of both acetyl-CoA and aminoglycoside substrates to the AAC(6')-Ii dimer. Product and dead-end inhibition studies revealed that AAC(6')-Ii follows an ordered bi-bi ternary complex mechanism with acetyl-CoA binding first followed by antibiotic. Solvent viscosity studies demonstrated that aminoglycoside binding and product release govern the rate of acetyl transfer, as evidenced by changes in both the k(cat)/K(b) for aminoglycoside and k(cat), respectively, with increasing solvent viscosity. Solvent isotope effects were consistent with our viscosity studies that diffusion-controlled processes and not the chemical step were rate-limiting in drug modification. The patterns of partial and mixed inhibition observed during our mechanistic studies were followed up by investigating the possibility of subunit cooperativity in the AAC(6')-Ii dimer. Through the use of AAC-Trp(164) --> Ala, an active mutant which exists as a monomer in solution, the partial nature of the competitive inhibition observed in wild-type dead-end inhibition studies was alleviated. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies also indicated two nonequivalent antibiotic binding sites for the AAC(6')-Ii dimer but only one binding site for the Trp(164) --> Ala mutant. Taken together, these results demonstrate subunit cooperativity in the AAC(6')-Ii dimer, with possible relevance to other oligomeric members of the GNAT superfamily.
TI  - In vitro activities of linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents against Staphylococci, Enterococci, Pneumococci, and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The activities of linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against  gram-positive organisms, alone and in combination with 35 antimicrobial agents were tested in vitro against methicillin-sensitive (n = 1 to 2 strains) and methicillin-resistant (n = 8 to 10) Staphylococcus aureus strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 6) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6 to 8) Enterococcus faecalis strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 5) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6) Enterococcus faecium strains; penicillin-sensitive (n = 2 to 5), penicillin-intermediate (n = 5 to 6), and penicillin-resistant (n = 5 to 6) Streptococcus pneumoniae strains; Escherichia coli (n = 6); and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 6). The fractional inhibitory concentration indices of linezolid in combination with other antimicrobial agents for the organisms tested were generated on checkerboard broth microdilution plates prepared by a semiautomated method. Of 1,380 organism-drug combinations, 1,369 (99.2%) combinations of linezolid with 28 antimicrobial drugs were indifferent, 9 combinations (0.65%) of linezolid with 6 drugs (amoxicillin, erythromycin, imipenem, sparfloxacin, teicoplanin, and tetracycline) were synergistic, and 2 combinations (0.15%) of linezolid with 2 drugs (ofloxacin and sparfloxacin) were antagonistic. Overall, the in vitro data demonstrated that linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents primarily produces an indifferent response, with infrequent occurrences of synergism and antagonism.
TI  - Heat-resistance and heat-shock response in the nosocomial pathogen Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - We have characterized the heat-shock response of the nosocomial pathogen Enterococcus faecium. The growth of E. faecium cells was analyzed at different temperatures; little growth was observed at 50 degrees C, and no growth at 52 degrees C or 55 degrees C. In agreement, a marked decrease of general protein synthesis was observed at 52 degrees C, and very light synthesis was detected at 55 degrees C. The heat resistance of E. faecium cells was analyzed by measuring the survival at temperatures higher than 52 degrees C and, after 2 h of incubation, viable cells were still observed at 70 degrees C. By Western blot analysis, two heat-induced proteins were identified as GroEL (65 kDa) and DnaK (75 kDa). Only one isoform for either GroEL or DnaK was found. The gene expression of these heat-shock proteins was also analyzed by pulsed-labeled experiments. The heat-induced proteins showed an increased rate of synthesis during the first 5 min, reaching the highest level of induction after 10 min and returning to the steady-state level after 20 min of heat treatment.
TI  - Growth inhibition of intestinal bacteria and mutagenicity of 2-, 3-, 4-aminobiphenyls, benzidine, and biphenyl.
AB  - 2-Aminobiphenyl (2-ABP), 3-aminobiphenyl (3-ABP) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), but not benzidine (Bz) and biphenyl (Bp), were found to be inhibitory to the growth of human intestinal bacteria Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, B. bifidium ATCC 11863, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047 and Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, YG1041 at 10-200 microg/ml in culture broth. Bacteroides distasonis ATCC 8503, B. fragilis ATCC 25285, B. theataiotaomicron ATCC 29741, C. paraputrificum ATCC 26780, C. clostridiiforme ATCC 25537, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 and Enterococcus faecium ATCC 19434 were not inhibited by the above mentioned compounds in concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. The Ames Salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat S9 mix. It was found that 4-ABP was mutagenic to both TA98 and TA100, and Bz was mutagenic to TA98 in the presence of rat S9 mix. 2-Aminobiphenyl, 3-ABP, and Bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-Aminobiphenyl and 3-ABP are chemical isomers of 4-ABP and are as strong as 4-ABP in inhibiting the growth of intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-ABP. Evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of DNA that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.
TI  - Effects of nitrogen sources on bacteriocin production by Enterococcus faecium A 2000.
AB  - The production of a novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide enterococcin A 2000, active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms including Listeria subsp. and Escherichia coli, by Enterococcus faecium strain A 2000 isolated from the surface of traditional Bulgarian yellow cheese "kash-kaval" is considerably influenced by complex nitrogen sources in the production medium. Medium components, especially peptone and yeast extract, and their concentration contributed to the increase in bacteriocin production during the stationary phase (16-46 h) of cultivation even in the absence of one of the components present in the basal cultivation MRS medium.
TI  - Axe-Txe, a broad-spectrum proteic toxin-antitoxin system specified by a multidrug-resistant, clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Enterococcal species of bacteria are now acknowledged as leading causes of bacteraemia and other serious nosocomial infections. However, surprisingly little is known about the molecular mechanisms that promote the segregational stability of antibiotic resistance and other plasmids in these bacteria. Plasmid pRUM (24 873 bp) is a multidrug resistance plasmid identified in a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecium. A novel proteic-based toxin-antitoxin cassette identified on pRUM was demonstrated to be a functional segregational stability module in both its native host and evolutionarily diverse bacterial species. Induced expression of the toxin protein (Txe) of this system resulted in growth inhibition in Escherichia coli. The toxic effect of Txe was alleviated by co-expression of the antitoxin protein, Axe. Homologues of the axe and txe genes are present in the genomes of a diversity of Eubacteria. These homologues (yefM-yoeB) present in the E. coli chromosome function as a toxin-antitoxin mechanism, although the Axe and YefM antitoxin components demonstrate specificity for their cognate toxin proteins in vivo. Axe-Txe is one of the first functional proteic toxin-antitoxin systems to be accurately described for Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase productivity of recent clinical  isolates during the period between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testings of 24 antimicrobial agents against 605 clinical strains belonging to 10 species were carried out according to the micro-broth dilution method of NCCLS M7-A4. The productivity of beta-lactamase was also determined against them isolated at 8 medical facilities in Nagano prefecture, Japan during the period between December 1999 and February 2000. When applied the nitrocefin method, beta-lactamase productivity was demonstrated to be positive for 89.2% of 74 S. aureus, 4.3% of 94 H. influenzae, and 100% of 69 M. (B.) catarrhalis isolates. On the other hand, when used the acidometry method, penicillinase/cephalosporinase were found to be positive for 21.2%/9.6% of 52 E. coli, 29.0%/3.2% of 31 K. pneumoniae, 53.2%/100% of 47 E. cloacae, 0%/11.1% of 99 S. marcescens, and 25.9%/55.6% of 54 P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. Among the beta-lactamase-producers including P. aeruginosa isolates, only 2 E. coli isolates were found to be ESBL-producers. Besides, 9.6% (9/94) of H. influenzae isolates were proved to be BLNAR strains.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and prevalence of beta-lactamase producing clinical isolates in southern Kyushu. The results of collaborative study from 1999 to 2000].
AB  - The positivity of beta-lactamase and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined in a total of 1,358 clinical isolates at 15 hospitals and clinics in four prefectures in southern Kyushu (Okinawa, Miyazaki, Kagoshima and Kumamoto) during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. The isolates collected comprised of 176 strains of S. aureus, 203 of H. influenzae, 102 of M. catarrhalis, 206 of E. coli, 153 of K. pneumoniae, 99 of E. cloacae, 95 of S. marcescens, 201 of P. aeruginosa, 79 of E. faecalis, and 44 of E. faecium. The frequency of CPDX resistance among E. coli in particular varied geographically, and was found to be higher in Kumamoto and Kagoshima. The strains of K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae resistant to common antimicrobial agents were particularly found in Kagoshima, and one strain of IPM-resistant E. cloacae was isolated in Miyazaki. Also, the geographical difference in the frequency of LVFX resistance among the isolates of E. cloacae was noted, the results indicating the higher prevalence in Okinawa and Kagoshima. Resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa were less common in Kagoshima, and four isolates of P. aeruginosa from Miyazaki were found to be resistant to CAZ and IPM. None of the isolates of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. was resistant to VCM or TEIC at all. The isolates of E. faecalis resistant at high-level GM (500 micrograms/ml) and SM (1,000 micrograms/ml) were found in 27.8% and 22.8%, and those of E. faecium were 6.8% and 38.6%, respectively. Overall, the ratio of MRSA among S. aureus was 67.6%, and three isolates were resistant to ABK with no less than 8 micrograms/ml of MIC. The frequency of BLNAR (beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin resistant) among H. influenzae isolated in Okinawa was markedly higher (isolation ratio, 37.9%) when compared with other prefectures, and the isolates of BLPACR (beta-lactamase-positive, AMPC/CVA resistant) were found only in Okinawa with a ratio of 41.6%. A total of 18 strains of ESBL defined by the NCCLS criteria (M100-S11) were isolated, eight strains of K. pneumoniae and 10 strains of E. coli. Of 18 isolates of ESBL, 13 were from Kagoshima and the remaining five were from Kumamoto.
TI  - [Beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics among some species of bacteria isolated from medical institution between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - We studied the beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics in 604 strains among 10 species of bacteria isolated from 10 medical institutions in Tottori and Shimane Prefectures between December 1999 and February 2000. beta-Lactamase activity was measured by the nitrocefin test and penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were measured by acidometry. beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 72.1% of S. aureus, 18.8% of H. influenzae, and 96.3% of M. catarrhalis. Penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were detected in 17.8%/22.2% of E. coli, 9.7%/0.0% of K. pneumoniae, 18.6%/95.3% of E. cloacae, 12.7%/79.4% of S. marcescens, and 7.1%/31.8% of P. aeruginosa. Three of 72 strains (4.2%) of K. pneumoniae and 5 of 90 strains (5.6%) of E. coli were assessed as ESBL-producing bacteria using the NCCLS proposed screening method based on routine susceptibility testing results. BLNAR were detected in 13 of 69 strains (18.8%) of H. influenzae.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase producibility of bacteria clinically isolated during the period from December 1999 to February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase producibility were tested in 848  clinical strains collected at 8 hospitals in Kanagawa prefecture during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. Positive rates of beta-lactamase used the nitrocefin method (Cefinase) were 21.9% of Staphylococcus aureus, 10.0% of Haemophilus influenzae, and 99.0% of Moraxella catarrhalis. Furthermore, on the acidometric method (P/Case test) penicillinase (PCase), cephalosporinase (CEPase), and both of PCase and CEPase were found to be positive in 19.0%, 16.0%, and 16.0% for Escherichia coli, 6.2/0/3.1% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/66.3/26.5% for Enterobacter cloacae, 2.8/57.7/15.5% for Serratia marcescens, and 4.0/15.0/22.0% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. Based on the assessment of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibacterial agents among beta-lactamase producing strains, there were 5 strains (4 strains of K. pneumoniae and 1 strain of E. coli) that may be ESBLs producing bacteria out of a total of 466 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. During this process, 1 strain of class-B beta-lactamase-producing E. cloacae was isolated. MRSA were found in 79.2% of S. aureus, and BLNAR were found in 8.9% of H. influenzae.
TI  - [beta-lactamase-producing activity and antimicrobial susceptibility of major pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples. Japan beta-lactamase Research Group].
AB  - beta-Lactamase production and susceptibility to an assortment of antimicrobial agents were examined in 9,483 strains of organisms isolated from clinical materials obtained from inpatients and outpatients at 104 institutions throughout Japan from December 1999 to February 2000. The organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, 1,369 strains, including 847 methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains; Enterococcus faecalis, 735 strains; Enterococcus faecium, 302 strains; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, 730 strains; Haemophilus influenzae, 1,142 strains; Escherichia coli, 1,276 strains; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1,058 strains; Enterobacter cloacae, 772 strains; Serratia marcescens, 847 strains; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1,252 strains. The 23 antimicrobial agents used were ampicillin, sulbactam/ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefoperazone, sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpodoxime, imipenem, gentamicin, arbekacin, clarithromycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and levofloxacin. Antimicrobial agents appropriate for each organism were used. Among S. aureus strains, 61.9% were MRSA, and 62.3% were positive for beta-lactamase. Among the MRSA strains, none was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin, and only 3% were resistant to arbekacin. There was no vancomycin resistance in the Enterococcus strains. Only 0.1% of E. faecalis strains were ampicillin-resistant. Among the M. catarrhalis strains, 97.5% produced beta-lactamase, while among the H. influenzae strains, 8.5% produced beta-lactamase and 14.5% were beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR). Among the Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa strains, there were 20 (E. coli; 7/1,276, K. pneumoniae; 13/1,058) that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and 11 that produced class B beta-lactamases. Multiple drug resistance was advanced in every species, and organisms resistant to 7 or more common antimicrobial agents were isolated. The best combination of antimicrobial agent and beta-lactamase inhibitor was sulbactam/cefoperazone. Sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefepime, and imipenem still have excellent antimicrobial activity. Rates of resistance to each antimicrobial agent differed more among institutions than among geographical regions.
TI  - Evolution of microbial populations during traditional Feta cheese manufacture and ripening.
AB  - In three different dairies (A, B and C) located in Peloponess region (Southern Greece), traditional Feta cheese trials took place February to March using mixtures of sheep's and goat's milk. Only small variations in the evolution of microbial groups were observed during the whole ripening period. The main groups, such as thermophilic cocci, mesophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactobacilli, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB), presumptive Leuconostoc, enterococci and micrococci, reached their highest levels during the first 16 days, and then declined approximately 1-2 log units until the end of ripening. The remaining groups investigated, comprising yeasts, coliforms and Escherichia coli, were highest at day 4. The yeasts remained constant, while coliforms and E. coli decreased sharply and were not detectable after 120 days of ripening. A number of 146 isolates (dairy A) taken from all stages of the manufacturing and ripening process were purified and studied. Lactobacillus plantarum (58/146) and isolates of related species Lactobacillus pentosus and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (16/146) were the most common microorganisms found during cheese ripening. Streptococcus thermophilus (23/146) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (20/146) were detected in high levels up to 20 days, and then gradually reduced. Enterococcus faecium (29/146) was found in all manufacturing and ripening stages.
TI  - Intestinal mucosal oxidative damage and bacterial translocation in cirrhotic rats.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial translocation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis mainly due to intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Alterations in the functional integrity of the intestinal barrier caused by an increased production of free radical metabolites as a consequence of portal hypertension could also facilitate bacterial translocation in cirrhotic rats. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine intestinal mucosal lipid peroxidation and neutrophil infiltration and their relationship with portal hypertension and bacterial translocation in cirrhotic rats. DESIGN: Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats with cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride, administered by gavage, and eight control rats were included in the study. METHODS: Samples of jejunum, ileum and caecum were obtained by laparotomy for the determination of malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase as indexes of lipid peroxidation and neutrophil infiltration, respectively. Samples of ascitic and pleural fluids, mesenteric lymph nodes and ileal stools were obtained for the culture of microoganisms. RESULTS: The concentration of malondialdehyde was significantly higher in ileal and caecal, but not in jejunal mucosa, in cirrhotic rats, mainly in those with ascites (P< 0.01), as compared to control rats (P< 0.01), and in cirrhotic rats with bacterial translocation compared to those without bacterial translocation (P< 0.01). No differences between groups were observed in the concentrations of myeloperoxidase in jejunum, ileum or caecum. A direct correlation between ileal malondialdehyde and portal pressure was observed (P< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Cirrhotic rats, particularly those with ascites and bacterial translocation, show increased malondialdehyde levels in ileal and caecal mucosa. These results suggest that mucosal oxidative damage in ileum and caecum could favour bacterial translocation in cirrhotic rats.
TI  - MC21-A, a bactericidal antibiotic produced by a new marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. O-BC30(T), against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We previously reported a new marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. O-BC30(T), which produced a bactericidal antibiotic against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In the present study, we purified an anti-MRSA substance (MC21-A) from the methanol extract of the cells of P. phenolica O-BC30(T) and analyzed its chemical structure. MC21-A was determined to be 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-2,2'-biphenyldiol by spectrometric analyses. Its anti-MRSA activity against 10 clinical isolates of MRSA was comparable to that of vancomycin (MC21-A MICs, 1 to 2 micro g/ml; vancomycin MICs, <0.25 to 2 micro g/ml). This substance was also high active against Enterococcus serolicida, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis but was less active against Streptococcus spp. A time-kill study also demonstrated that MC21-A was bactericidal and that its killing rate was much higher than that of vancomycin. The postantibiotic effect (PAE) of MC21-A against a clinical MRSA isolate, strain E 31243, was also comparable to that of vancomycin (MC21-A PAEs, 1.46 to 1.65 h; vancomycin PAEs, 0.84 to 1.43 h). However, a lysis experiment demonstrated that this substance failed to lyse MRSA cells. This substance also did not lyse human erythrocytes. A SYTOX Green staining experiment implied that this substance permeabilized the cell membrane of MRSA as its mode of action. When its activities against a hypersensitive Escherichia coli mutant (KO 1489) and wild-type strains were tested, MC21-A exhibited higher levels of activity against the former. Furthermore, MC21-A was not cytotoxic to human normal fibroblast, rat pheochromocytoma, and Vero cells at concentrations up to 50 micro g/ml. These results suggest that MC21-A might be useful as a lead compound in the development of new types of anti-MRSA substances with modes of action different from those of vancomycin and teicoplanin.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - Development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - A membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. The 16S rDNA sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. Three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled 16S rDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. Hybridization signals were read by NBT/BCIP color development. The 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. fragilis, B. distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, C. leptum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, Ruminococcus obeum, R. bromii, R. callidus, R. albus, Bifidobacterium longum, B. adolescentis, B. infantis, Eubacterium biforme, E. aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus,Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. The two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16S rDNA from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. The hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. The result was also confirmed by using specific PCR methods for these bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of dedicated stethoscopes as a potential source of nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the ear tips of dedicated stethoscopes (DS) that  are used on patients prescribed contact precautions for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, or multiple antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii become contaminated with these micro-organisms. DESIGN: Culture of DS ear tips. SETTING: A 524-bed tertiary care university hospital. METHODS: DS ear tips were inoculated directly onto bacteriologic media and incubated for 48 to 72 hours. Growth of more than 10 colonies from the 2 ear tips collectively was indicative of contamination. RESULTS: Ear tips of 78 DS from 69 patients were cultured. Ear tips from 17% (13/78) of the DS were contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria: 2 with S aureus (1 MRSA), 1 with E faecalis, 7 with Acinetobacter species, 2 with Pseudomonas species, 1 with Escherichia coli, and 1 with Moraxella. None of the stethoscope ear tips was contaminated with the same pathogen for which the patient was prescribed contact precautions (95% CI, 0-3.8%). CONCLUSION: Although the ear tips of DS from patients who were prescribed contact precautions for MRSA, vancomycin-resistant E faecium, or multiple antibiotic-resistant A baumannii were not contaminated with the indicated nosocomial pathogen, 94% of the evaluable ear tips were contaminated, including with MRSA (1.3%) and Acinetobacter (11%). Regular disinfection of ear tips of DS between users should be considered.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAL9141, a novel parenteral cephalosporin active against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - Community-acquired and nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens continue to increase in prevalence and have become a serious problem in many parts of the world. BAL9141 is a member of the class of parenteral pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephalosporins, and has a broad spectrum of activity. In the current study, BAL9141 was tested against a large number (n = 2263) of recent isolates from various international surveillance programmes including 1097 Gram-positive strains. Susceptibility to (S) and activity of (mg/L) to BAL9141, based on proposed breakpoints (MIC50/MIC90/% S) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.5/0.5/100%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (1/2/100%), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (0.12/0.25/100%), methicillin-resistant CoNS (MR-CoNS) (1/2/100%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (< or = 0.015/0.25/100%), viridans group streptococci (0.03/0.5/99%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (< or = 0.015/< or = 0.015/100%), Enterococcus faecalis (0.5/16/90%), Enterococcus faecium (>32/>32/22%), Haemophilus influenzae (0.06/0.06/100%), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.06/0.5/100%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (0.03/0.06/100%) and Neisseria meningitidis (< or = 0.002/0.004/100%). BAL9141 susceptibility at < pr = 4 mg/L (100% S) surpassed that of ceftriaxone (CRO; 1% S) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q-D; 92% S) against MRSA and MR-CoNS (CRO 0.9% S; Q-D 94% S). All S. pneumoniae were inhibited by BAL9141 at < or = 1 mg/L compared with CRO (90% S) and levofloxacin (LVX; 98% S). Susceptibility rates for viridans group streptococci to BAL9141 (>98%) were also higher than to CRO (86%) and LVX (96%). BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against most species of wild-type enteric bacilli, with > or = 95% of isolates being susceptible; however, only modest activity was observed for BAL9141 against non-fermentative Gram-negative species and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against many tested pathogens displaying various resistance phenotypes, and should be particularly valuable in the treatment of MRSA as well as for drug-resistant streptococci, while maintaining a spectrum resembling a 'third-generation' cephalosporin against other clinically important species.
TI  - [Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: VIRA Study].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. The aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in Spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in October 2001 were studied. These included 294 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 96 Enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli, 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 Acinetobacter baumannii. Sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. Additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. RESULTS: Overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and MRSA strains was 24% in both cases. The pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. Telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. Most MRSA isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. All the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only 50% of A. baumannii strains were susceptible to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as MRSA, CNS, ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.
TI  - Isolation and partial characterization of an antibacterial substance produced by  Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - A strain of Enterococcus faecium isolated from Bulgarian yellow cheese "kashkaval" produced a bacteriocin-like substance named enterococcin A 2000. The antibacterial substance had a low molar mass (< 2 kDa), was relatively stable toward heat but was sensitive to selected proteolytic enzymes. It was active against Gram-positive bacteria including enterococci, such as Listeria, Bacillus and Streptococcus, and also against Gram-negative E. coli. Production of enterococcin A 2000 has a maximum near the end of the exponential phase of producer growth. The peptide was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, butanol extraction, followed by cation-exchange chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography. A partial sequence of purified enterococcin A 2000 indicated that this substance does not belong to the class IIa of bacteriocins presenting the consensus anti-Listeria motif YGNGV.
TI  - Design of non-cysteine-containing antimicrobial beta-hairpins: structure-activity relationship studies with linear protegrin-1 analogues.
AB  - Protegrins are short, cationic peptides that display potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. PG-1, the first of the five natural analogues discovered, forms a rigid antiparallel two-stranded beta-sheet that is stabilized by two disulfide bonds. The two strands of the sheet are linked by a short two-residue loop segment. Removal of the disulfide bridges (e.g., in Cys --> Ala analogues) is known to cause marked loss of antimicrobial activity. We have used basic principles of beta-hairpin design to develop linear analogues of PG-1 that lack cysteine but nevertheless display PG-1-like activity. Our most potent reengineered molecules contain three essential design features: (i) the four cysteine residues of PG-1 are replaced by residues that have high propensity for beta-strand conformation, (ii) D-proline is placed at the i + 1 position of the reverse turn to promote a type II' beta-turn, and (iii) amino functionality is incorporated at the gamma-carbon of the D-proline residue to mimic the charge distribution of the natural beta-hairpin. Structural studies revealed that the antimicrobial potency of the non-disulfide-bonded peptides can be correlated to the stability of the beta-hairpin conformations they adopt in aqueous solution. The presence of 150 mM NaCl was found to have little effect on the antimicrobial activity of PG-1, but one of our linear analogues loses some potency under these high salt conditions. Despite this discrepancy in salt sensitivity, NMR and CD data indicate that neither PG-1 nor our linear analogue experiences a significant decrease in beta-hairpin conformational stability in the presence of 150 mM NaCl. Thus, salt inactivation is not due to destabilization of the beta-hairpin conformation. Furthermore, our results show that beta-sheet design principles can be used to replace conformation-stabilizing disulfide bridges with noncovalent conformation-stabilizing features.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA), retinol (ROL) and retinaldehyde (RAL) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. Most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. Little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. AIM: To analyse the potential anti-infective activities of topical ROL, RAL and RA. METHODS: Microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ROL, RAL and RA were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus flavus, Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus group B, Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas/Klebsiella. In two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% RAL or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% RAL or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. Paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. RESULTS: Of the three retinoids tested, only RAL showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like S. aeureus, Micrococcus spp. or P. acnes. No activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. These results on reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for RAL were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with RAL had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. In the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2) for P. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. No resistant bacteria were found after 2 weeks of topical use. Preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of RAL is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: We have shown that RAL differs from parent natural retinoids such as ROL and RA in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. This activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.
TI  - Design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - An oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. The 16S rDNA sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. Three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. Cyanine5 (CY5)-labeled 16S rDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human fecal samples or bacterial DNA using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. The 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, Clostridium leptum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, Ruminococcus obeum, Ruminococcus bromii, Ruminococcus callidus, Ruminococcus albus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Eubacterium biforme, Eubacterium aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. The two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16S rDNA from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. The hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.
TI  - Characterization of a cryptic plasmid from Lactobacillus fermentum KC5b and its use for constructing a stable Lactobacillus cloning vector.
AB  - Lactobacillus fermentum KC5b, a strain originally isolated from the human vagina, contains a cryptic plasmid pKC5b. The sequence and genetic organization of the 4392-bp plasmid were determined. It contains two convergently oriented replicons, which are homologous to each other and to the stable replicon of the Enterococcus faecium plasmid pMBB1. The two replicons of pKC5b were used either individually or together to construct Lactobacillus-Escherichia coli shuttle plasmids. Only the plasmid pSP1 that carried both replicons transformed lactobacilli, suggesting a complementary function between the two replicons. Since the replicons had a high homology to those of other plasmids that replicate via a theta-like mechanism and no detectable single-stranded intermediates were found for the plasmid, it is possible that pKC5b may replicate via a theta-like mechanism. The new shuttle plasmid pSP1 has been transformed and stably maintained in several Lactobacillus strains. As an initial application, pSP1 was used to clone the S-layer protein gene (slpA) of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 into a heterologous vaginal Lactobacillus strain and achieved surface-bound expression of the protein.
TI  - Biochemical and genetic characterization of mundticin KS, an antilisterial peptide produced by Enterococcus mundtii NFRI 7393.
AB  - Mundticin KS, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus mundtii NFRI 7393 isolated from grass silage in Thailand, is active against closely related lactic acid bacteria and the food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. In this study, biochemical and genetic characterization of mundticin KS was done. Mundticin KS was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, sequential ion-exchange chromatography, and solid-phase extraction. The gene cluster (mun locus) for mundticin KS production was cloned, and DNA sequencing revealed that the mun locus consists of three genes, designated munA, munB, and munC. The munA gene encodes a 58-amino-acid mundticin KS precursor, munB encodes a protein of 674 amino acids involved in translocation and processing of the bacteriocin, and munC encodes a mundticin KS immunity protein of 98 amino acids. Amino acid and nucleotide sequencing revealed the complete, unambiguous primary structure of mundticin KS; mundticin KS comprises a 43-amino-acid peptide with an amino acid sequence similar to that of mundticin ATO6 produced by E. mundtii ATO6. Mundticin KS and mundticin ATO6 are distinguished by the inversion of the last two amino acids at their respective C termini. These two mundticins were expressed in Escherichia coli as recombinant peptides and found to be different in activity against certain Lactobacillus strains, such as Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus curvatus. Mundticin KS was successfully expressed by transformation with the recombinant plasmid containing the mun locus in heterogeneous hosts such as E. faecium, L. curvatus, and Lactococcus lactis. Based on our results, the mun locus is located on a 50-kb plasmid, pML1, of E. mundtii NFRI 7393.
TI  - Prevalence of and resistance to anti-microbial drugs in selected microbial species isolated from bulk milk samples.
AB  - The prevalence of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative (CN) staphylococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Bacillus cereus, was investigated in 111 bulk milk samples. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 38 samples, CN staphylococci from 63 samples, E. coli from 49 samples, E. faecalis or E. faecium from 107 samples, and L. monocytogenes from two samples. Bacillus cereus was not found in any of the samples and three samples were free of any of the selected species. Sensitivity to the anti-microbial drugs amikacin, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cephalothin (CLT), cephotaxime, clindamycin, chloramphenicol (CMP), co-trimoxazole, erythromycin (ERY), gentamicin, neomycin, norfloxacin, oxacillin, penicillin, streptomycin (STR), tetracycline (TTC) and vancomycin was tested using the standard dilution technique. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) characteristics (MIC50, MIC90, MIC range) were determined for each microbial species. Resistance against one or more anti-microbial drugs was found in 93% of S. aureus, 40% of CN staphylococci, 73% of E. coli, 88% of E.faecalis, 55% of E.faecium, and one L. monocytogenes strain. Most of the strains, particularly enterococci, were resistant to STR, TTC, and ERY (MIC50 4 microg/ml). A high percentage of staphylococci were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. High resistance to CLT was found in 11 strains of E. coli (MIC 256 microg/ml) and strains resistant to CMP (MIC90 16 microg/ml) were detected. The highest numbers of resistance phenotypes were found in E. coil (16) and CN staphylococci (12). Eighteen identical resistance phenotypes were demonstrated in indicator bacteria (E. coli, E. faecalis, E. faecium) and pathogens (S. aureus, CN staphylococci) isolated from the same bulk milk sample. The obtained resistance data were matched against the herd owners' information on therapeutic use of the drugs. This confrontation could not explain the findings of strains resistant to ERY or CMP. Our findings are evidence of selection of resistant strains among not only pathogenic agents, but also among indicator bacteria which can become significant carriers of transmissible resistance genes.
TI  - Identification of ABC transporters in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium as potential targets for antibody therapy.
AB  - The occurrence of an outbreak of septicaemias due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), in Manchester, UK, provided an opportunity to examine the antibody responses in patients infected by the same strain. Immunoblotting sera from 24 cases, six of whom died, showed an immunodominant cluster of antigens at 34, 54 and 97 kDa, with a statistically significant correlate between survival and immunoglobulin G to the 34 and 97 kDa bands (P<0.05). Screening a genomic expression library of VRE with seropositive serum and peritoneal dialysate from a survivor gave a recombinant clone with two contiguous open reading frames, the derived amino acid sequences of which both showed sequence homologue with ABC transporters, with a Walker A and Walker B motif and the signature sequence LSGGQ. The first open reading frame (putative VRE ABC1) showed 57% homologue with YbxA from Bacillus subtilis. A partial sequence (putative VRE ABC2) was also obtained, in the same recombinant clone, of a second ABC transporter with 72% homologue with ybaE from B. subtilis. Affinity selection with the seropositive serum and peritoneal dialysate used to screen the library showed that the eluted antibody bound to the 97, 54, 34 and 30 kDa bands. Direct amino acid sequencing identified this as a possible ABC transporter. Rabbit antiserum against peptides representing Walker A and an area adjacent to the Walker B site cross-reacted with bands at 34, 54, 97, 110 kDa and at 30, 34 and 54 kDa respectively. This therefore appeared to be an immunodominant complex of ABC transporters of which the smallest was the 30 kDa antigen. Epitope mapping of this antigen with seropositive patients' sera delineated three linear epitopes (KVGIV, FGPKNF and RVAI). The Walker A site represented by peptide 1 (GHNGSGKSTLAKTIN), epitope RVAI represented by peptides 2 (MRRVAIAGVLAMPRE) and 3 (ELSGGQMRRVAIAGV), epitope KVGIV represented by peptide 4 (LKPIRKKVGIVFQFP), and recombinant VRE ABC1 and VRE ABC2 expressed in Escherichia coli pBAD were then used to isolate human genetically recombinant antibodies from a phage antibody display library. An assessment of the protective potential of these antibodies was carried out in a mouse model of the infection. This study suggests that an ABC transporter homologue could be a target for antibody therapy against VRE infections.
TI  - Balance between two transpeptidation mechanisms determines the expression of beta-lactam resistance in Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - The d,d-transpeptidase activity of high molecular weight penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) is essential to maintain cell wall integrity as it catalyzes the final cross-linking step of bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis. We investigated a novel beta-lactam resistance mechanism involving by-pass of the essential PBPs by l,d-transpeptidation in Enterococcus faecium. Determination of the peptidoglycan structure by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry revealed that stepwise selection for ampicillin resistance led to the gradual replacement of the usual cross-links generated by the PBPs (d-Ala(4) --> d-Asx-Lys(3)) by cross-links resulting from l,d-transpeptidation (l-Lys(3) --> d-Asx-Lys(3)). This was associated with no modification of the level of production of the PBPs or of their affinity for beta-lactams, indicating that altered PBP activity was not required for ampicillin resistance. A beta-lactam-insensitive l,d-transpeptidase was detected in membrane preparations of the parental susceptible strain. Acquisition of resistance was not because of variation of this activity. Instead, selection led to production of a beta-lactam-insensitive d,d-carboxypeptidase that cleaved the C-terminal d-Ala residue of pentapeptide stems in vitro and caused massive accumulation of cytoplasmic precursors containing a tetrapeptide stem in vivo. The parallel dramatic increase in the proportion of l-Lys(3) --> d-Asx-Lys(3) cross-links showed that the enzyme was activating the resistance pathway by generating the substrate for the l,d-transpeptidase.
TI  - Mimicry of host-defense peptides by unnatural oligomers: antimicrobial beta-peptides.
AB  - We have designed beta-amino acid oligomers that are helical, cationic, and amphiphilic with the intention of mimicking the biological activity of amphiphilic, cationic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides found in nature (e.g., magainins). We have previously identified a 17-residue beta-peptide (called beta-17) with antibiotic activity similar to that of a magainin derivative against four bacterial species, including two clinical isolates that are resistant to common antibiotics. This beta-peptide displays very low hemolytic activity against human red blood cells, which indicates selectivity for bacterial cells over mammalian cells. Here we examine some of the factors important for activity in this class of beta-peptides. An amphiphilic helix is necessary, because a nonamphiphilic isomer proved to be inactive. The ratio of cationic to hydrophobic residues is also important. Active beta-peptides induce the leakage of beta-galactosidase from treated Bacillus subtilis cells, as do alpha-helical antibiotic peptides, and this similarity suggests that the beta-peptide mode of action involves disruption of microbial membranes. This class of beta-peptides is not degraded by proteases, which bodes well for biological applications.
TI  - [Evaluation of microecology of colonic contents in patients with chronic pancreatitis].
AB  - The paper deals with microbiocenosis in the colonic content in 60 patients with chronic pancreatitis during its exacerbation. An analysis has indicated that in the colonic content there are the following microorganisms: Bifidobacterium sp., 10(8)-10(10) CFU/g; Lactobacillus sp., 10(1)-10(5) CFU/g; Escherichia coli, 10(8)-10(10) CFU/g; Enterococcus faecalis, 10(6)-10(10) CFU/g; Enterococcus faecium, 10(6)-10(10) CFU/g; the family Enterobacteriaceae (mainly Klebsiella-Enterobacter sp.), 10(1)-10(6) CFU/g; yeasty (including the Candida genus) and mold fungi, 10(1)-10(5)/g; Staphylococci, 10(1)-10(3) CFU/g. Comparing the findings with those of normal cenosis according to different authors' data suggests that there are no apparently impairments in the levels of some microoranisms, the representives of microbiocenosis in the colonic content in the examinees.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis acetoacetyl-coenzyme A thiolase/3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, a dual-function protein of isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthesis.
AB  - Many bacteria employ the nonmevalonate pathway for synthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate, the monomer unit for isoprenoid biosynthesis. However, gram-positive cocci exclusively use the mevalonate pathway, which is essential for their growth (E. I. Wilding et al., J. Bacteriol. 182:4319-4327, 2000). Enzymes of the mevalonate pathway are thus potential targets for drug intervention. Uniquely, the enterococci possess a single open reading frame, mvaE, that appears to encode two enzymes of the mevalonate pathway, acetoacetyl-coenzyme A thiolase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Western blotting revealed that the mvaE gene product is a single polypeptide in Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus hirae. The mvaE gene was cloned from E. faecalis and was expressed with an N-terminal His tag in Escherichia coli. The gene product was then purified by nickel affinity chromatography. As predicted, the 86.5-kDa mvaE gene product catalyzed both the acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and HMG-CoA reductase reactions. Temperature optima, DeltaH(a) and K(m) values, and pH optima were determined for both activities. Kinetic studies of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase implicated a ping-pong mechanism. CoA acted as an inhibitor competitive with acetyl-CoA. A millimolar K(i) for a statin drug confirmed that E. faecalis HMG-CoA reductase is a class II enzyme. The oxidoreductant was NADP(H). A role for an active-site histidine during the first redox step of the HMG-CoA, reductase reaction was suggested by the ability of diethylpyrocarbonate to block formation of mevalonate from HMG-CoA, but not from mevaldehyde. Sequence comparisons with other HMG-CoA reductases suggest that the essential active-site histidine is His756. The mvaE gene product represents the first example of an HMG-CoA reductase fused to another enzyme.
TI  - [Alive microorganism in the workplace ambient air in plants disposing communal waste].
AB  - This paper presents the results of the identification and determination of alive  microorganisms in the air samples collected from the breath zone of workers employed in the waste collection and disposal. Samples were taken during waste collection and in the waste reloading, sorting and composting plants. In addition, samples were taken at stationary sites: in the city and inside flats. Different kinds of species of Gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Bacillus, Listeria, Corynebacterium, Rhodococcus) and Gram-negative rods (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas and other aerobic bacteria) were found. On every work site, there were fecal bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium). The city areas and flats were free from this kind of bacteria. The number of mesophilic bacteria and thread-like fungi exceeding 10(4) cfu/m3 of air was counted on every work site. The largest number of mesophilic bacteria and Actinomycetes were found in the waste composting plant (10(4)-10(6) and 10(3)-10(5) cfu/m3, respectively), whereas the majority of fungal spores were counted during waste collection and sorting. (10(4)-10(5) cfu/m3). On the city streets there were no Actinomycetes and the number of fungal spores (10(4)/m3 of air) was similar to that observed in the waste reloading and composting plants. The amount of mesophilic bacteria in the city and flat samples was below 10(2)-10(3) cfu/m3. As to the number of fungal spores and Actinomycetes there was a limit of determination (10(1)-10(2) cfu/m3). The majority of mesopholic bacteria identified in the air were classified as the second group of occupational risk in the Council Directive 54/2000/EU. Bearing in mind that Gram-negative rods (especially intestinal) were identified in all samples, it is suggested to use endotoxin concentration as one of possible criteria for assessing the hygiene conditions at workplaces.
TI  - Typing and subtyping of 83 clinical isolates purified from surgically implanted silicone feeding tubes by random amplified polymorphic DNA amplification.
AB  - In this study, 83 clinical isolates purified from biofilms colonizing 18 silicone gastrostomy devices (12 "buttons" and six tubes converted to skin level devices) were selected for subtype characterization utilizing genetic analysis. The tubes, previously used for feeding, remained in place for 3 to 47 months (mean, 20.0 months) in children ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years. Classification of specific microbes using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis revealed genetic similarities and differences among isolates belonging to the same genus. Both gram-positive and -negative bacteria were investigated, including 2 isolates of Bacillus brevis, 4 isolates of Bacillus licheniformis, 2 isolates of Bacillus pumilus, 3 isolates of Enterococcus durans, 19 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 isolates of Enterococcus faecium, 2 isolates of Enterococcus hirae, 7 isolates of Escherichia coli, 8 isolates of Lactobacillus plantarum, 19 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 7 isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Amplified DNA fragments (amplicons) provided species-specific fingerprints for comparison by agarose gel electrophoresis. A total of 62 distinct RAPD types were categorized from the five genera studied. Typing analysis suggested cross acquisition of E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus in three patient pairs. Genomic polymorphism detection proved efficient and reliable for classifying bacterial subtypes isolated from biofilms adhering to various portions of commonly employed enteral access tubes.
TI  - Multicenter surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens in intensive care units in 2000 in Taiwan.
AB  - A susceptibility surveillance study of 1,274 bacterial isolates recovered from various clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) of five major teaching hospitals was carried out from March, 2000, to June, 2000, in Taiwan. This study demonstrated a high rate (66%) of oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA), a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (intermediate, 50% and highly resistant, 8%), and high rates of cefotaxime nonsusceptibility for S. pneumoniae (intermediate, 29% and resistant, 4%), Enterobacter cloacae (57%), Serratia marcescens (34%), and Citrobacter freundii (60%). High rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%), and high rates of imipenem nonsusceptibility for P. aeruginosa (15%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (22%) were also found. The percentage (11.9%) of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli was greater than that (11.3%) for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin nonsusceptibility for S. pneumoniae (42%), Enterococcus faecium (71%), and ORSA (39%) were high, but no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in this study. The resistance rates of some pathogen varied by institution or type of ICUs. Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens in hospitals, particularly in ICU settings with a preexisting higher resistance burden, is mandatory in establishing and/or modifying guidelines for empirical treatment of severe infections in ICU patients caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Present situation of antimicrobial resistance in Korea.
AB  - Resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. In Korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, class C beta-lactamase-producing E. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in Korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. Recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa present new threats in Korea.
TI  - Microbial killing activity of peracetic acid.
AB  - In vitro killing activity of peracetic acid (Perasafe) at a concentration of 0.26 per cent w/v was tested against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Acinetobacter baumannii, Sternotrophomonas maltophilia, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Bacillus subtilis spore, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immuno-deficiency virus type I. Exposure to Peracetic acid (0.26% w/v) for 10 minutes resulted in massive killing of all the aforementioned organisms and spore.
TI  - The in vitro activity of BMS-284756, a new des-fluorinated quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BMS-284756 (previously T-3811ME), a des-fluoro(6) quinolone, was investigated and compared with those of six other antimicrobial agents. Susceptibility tests were performed on 919 Gram-positive, Gram-negative (including nine quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli) and anaerobic bacteria, three Chlamydia isolates and four Mycobacteria spp. BMS-284756 was marginally less active against the Enterobacteriaceae, but was the most active quinolone against staphylococci, enterococci and peptostreptococci. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae, BMS-284756 and gemifloxacin were more active than other quinolones. The MIC(90) of BMS-284756 was > or = 2 mg/L for the following bacteria: E. coli (MIC(90) 16 mg/L), Acinetobacter spp. (8 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (64 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecium (4 mg/L). The MIC of BMS-284756 for Mycobacterium spp. was within one dilution of the MIC of ciprofloxacin. BMS-284756 was markedly more active than ciprofloxacin against the Chlamydia isolates tested.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of chloroxylenol and chlorhexidine in the treatment of infected root canals.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of a chlorhexidine gluconate (2.0%) and of an ethanolic chloroxylenol solution (10%) as a temporary root canal dressing against selected test microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracted single-rooted human teeth were instrumented up to size 40. After removal of the smear layer suspensions of the test microorganisms were inserted into the root canals. After incubation for 48 hrs each suspension of the test organisms was removed and the root canals were filled with one of the two different disinfectants. The teeth were then incubated for 48 hrs. Twelve teeth and three controls were used for each of the four test organisms and each of the two regimens. After incubation, each root canal was instrumented and the removed canal wall dentin was examined microbiologically. RESULTS: With a contact time of 48 hrs between the two disinfectants and the four bacterial suspensions the medications led to a total killing of microorganisms in 82% of a total of 96 contaminated teeth. In the dentin layer situated 50 microm from the root canal, both medications achieved bacterial killing in a range from 99.9% to 99.99%, depending on the test organism. There were no significant differences (P> 0.1) between the relative antimicrobial activity of the two root canal dressings.
TI  - Aminoglycoside-streptothricin resistance gene cluster aadE-sat4-aphA-3 disseminated among multiresistant isolates of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Seventy-two Enterococcus faecium isolates of different origins highly resistant to nourseothricin and streptomycin were studied. Sequencing of a genomic fragment from two isolates identified a gene cluster, aadE-sat4-aphA-3, which has been isolated recently in staphylococci and Campylobacter coli. Patterns of digested PCR products of aadE-sat4-aphA-3 were identical for all isolates.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - EmtA, a rRNA methyltransferase conferring high-level evernimicin resistance.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium strain 9631355 was isolated from animal sources on the basis of its resistance to the growth promotant avilamycin. The strain also exhibited high-level resistance to evernimicin, a drug undergoing evaluation as a therapeutic agent in humans. Ribosomes from strain 9631355 exhibited a dramatic reduction in evernimicin binding, shown by both cell-free translation assays and direct-binding assays. The resistance determinant was cloned from strain 9631355; sequence alignments suggested it was a methyltransferase and therefore it was designated emtA for evernimicin methyltransferase. Evernimicin resistance was transmissible and emtA was localized to a plasmid-borne insertion element. Purified EmtA methylated 50S subunits from an evernimicin-sensitive strain 30-fold more efficiently than those from a resistant strain. Reverse transcription identified a pause site that was unique to the 23S rRNA extracted from resistant ribosomes. The pause corresponded to methylation of residue G2470 (Escherichia coli numbering). RNA footprinting revealed that G2470 is located within the evernimicin-binding site on the ribosome, thus providing an explanation for the reduced binding of the drug to methylated ribosomes.
TI  - An in vitro study of antibacterial properties of the cervical mucus plug in pregnancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether cervical mucus plugs are antibacterial in vitro. STUDY DESIGN: Cervical mucus plugs from 56 healthy women in labor were studied by 2 different antimicrobial assays: (1) analysis of the inhibition by the cervical mucus plug of several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by overlaying the cervical mucus plug onto an agar plate with imbedded bacteria, and (2) determination of the antibacterial property of the cervical mucus plug material by radial diffusion assay with group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli. RESULTS: In the agar overlay assay, there was complete inhibition of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus, E coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and patient-variable partial-to-complete inhibition of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. In the radial diffusion assay, cervical mucus plugs had activity toward group B Streptococcus equivalent to 0.075 microg/mL of gentamicin and toward E coli equivalent to 0.5 microg/mL of gentamicin. CONCLUSION: A low-molecular substance with antibacterial activity in the cervical mucus plug may protect the fetus against ascending infections.
TI  - Aminoglycoside resistance genes aph(2")-Ib and aac(6')-Im detected together in strains of both Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Escherichia coli SCH92111602 expresses an aminoglycoside resistance profile similar to that conferred by the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2")-Ia gene found in gram-positive cocci and was found to contain the aminoglycoside resistance genes aph(2")-Ib and aac(6')-Im (only 44 nucleotides apart). aph(2")-Ib had been reported previously in Enterococcus faecium SF11770. aac(6')-Im had not been detected previously in enterococci and was found to be present also 44 nucleotides downstream from aph(2")-Ib in E. faecium SF11770. aph(2")-Ib and aac(6')-Im are separate open reading frames, each with its own putative ribosome binding site, whereas aac(6')-Ie-aph(2")-Ia appears to be a fusion of two genes with just one start and one stop codon. The deduced AAC(6')-Im protein exhibits 56% identity and 80% similarity to the AAC(6')-Ie domain of the bifunctional enzyme AAC(6')-APH(2"). Our results document the existence of a member of the aph(2") family of genes in gram-negative bacteria and provide evidence suggesting the horizontal transfer of aph(2")-Ib and aac(6')-Im as a unit between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - The penicillin resistance of Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2r results from an overproduction of the low-affinity penicillin-binding protein PBP4 and does not involve a psr-like gene.
AB  - A penicillin-resistant mutant, JH2-2r (MIC 75 microg ml(-1)), was isolated from Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 (MIC 5 microg ml(-1)) by successive passages on plates containing increasing concentrations of benzylpenicillin. A comparison of the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) profiles in the two strains revealed a more intensely labelled PBP4 in JH2-2r. Because the sequences of the JH2-2 and JH2-2r pbp4 genes were strictly identical, even in their promoter regions, this intensive labelling could only be associated with an overproduction of the low-affinity PBP4. No psr gene analogous to that proposed to act as a regulator of PBP5 synthesis in Enterococcus hirae and Enterococcus faecium could be identified in the vicinity of pbp4 in E. faecalis JH2-2 and JH2-2r. However, a psr-like gene distant from pbp4 was identified. The cloning and sequencing of that psr-like gene from both E. faecalis strains indicated that they were identical. It is therefore postulated that the PBP4 overproduction in E. faecalis JH2-2r results from the modification of an as yet unidentified factor.
TI  - Development of systemic bacteraemia after oral inoculation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in mice.
AB  - Bacteraemia caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is an important clinical problem because there are only a few potent antimicrobial agents against such bacteria. Therefore, understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of VRE bacteraemia is important for prophylaxis. This study shows that treatment of mice with cyclophosphamide and a combination of metronidazole, kanamycin and vancomycin reduced normal intestinal flora and induced systemic VRE bacteraemia. Translocation of VRE and the normal intestinal flora to the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen and blood, and mortality rate were dependent on treatment with cyclophosphamide and each of the three antimicrobial drugs. Among the different strains studied, C57BL/6 mice were the most susceptible to VRE. The virulence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis was greater than that of vancomycin-resistant Ent. faecium. On the day after inoculation of VRE, Escherichia coli was also detected in many VRE-positive specimens including blood, liver and the mesenteric lymph nodes. Moreover, both VRE and E. coli were detected simultaneously in almost all blood samples obtained from dead and dying mice, and VRE organisms outnumbered E. coli in those samples by 100:1 or more. These results indicate that changes in normal intestinal flora by administration of antimicrobial drugs and severity of neutropenia induced by cyclophosphamide are important factors that contribute to the development of systemic VRE bacteraemia. E. coli may be intimately associated with the establishment of VRE translocation.
TI  - Biological and mechanistic activities of xanthorrizol and 4-(1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2-methylphenol isolated from Iostephane heterophylla.
AB  - Xanthorrizol (1) and 4-(1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2-methylphenol (2) were identified as the principal antimicrobial components of a CH(2)Cl(2)-MeOH (1:1) extract derived from Iostephane heterophylla. Compound 2 is a new natural product, but has been synthesized. Both compounds exhibited low level activity (MICs of 16-32 microg/mL) against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. They were either inactive or poorly active against Gram-negative bacteria and yeast. Mechanistic studies performed in Escherichia coli imp suggested nonspecific inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis by both of these compounds. Compound 1 was tested in an in vivo model; it did not provide protection to mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of intestinal bacteria from Swiss poultry flocks before the ban of antimicrobial growth promoters.
AB  - From the crop and the caecum of Swiss broilers slaughtered between November 1997  and January 1998, Escherichia coli, enterococci, staphylococci, lactobacilli and Campylobacter species were isolated. After identification to the genus or species level, their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) for several clinically used antimicrobial agents were determined with the E-Test stripes and compared to those from studies in other European countries. All strains of Enterococcus faecalis (n = 38), E. faecium (27), staphylococci (n = 39) and lactobacilli (n = 14) showed a hundred percent resistance against bacitracin which was included in the feed of the mother animals, but not in the feed of the investigated animals. E.coli strains (n = 60) showed higher resistance incidences than in comparable studies from Finland and Denmark, but lower than those in studies from Italy and Germany. In staphylococci, low resistance rates were observed. A high susceptibility of the 13 Campylobacter jejuni strains was found against therapeutically used antimicrobials. These data can be used as a baseline to determine antibiotic resistance rates after implementation of the growth promotor ban in 1999 in Switzerland.
TI  - Antagonistic effect of enterocin CCM 4231 from Enterococcus faecium on "bryndza", a traditional Slovak dairy product from sheep milk.
AB  - "Bryndza" is a traditional Slovak dairy product (type of soft cheese) made from sheep cheese which was ripened for 14 days. Because its manufacture, transporting and/or storing represent conditions which facilitate contamination, the effect of enterocin CCM4231 in "bryndza" was investigated with the aim to reduce the contaminant agents. "Bryndza" was divided into equal portions (50 g). The experimental sample (ES) as well as the control sample one (C1) were inoculated with Listeria innocua Li1 strain. The other control samples C2 and C3 were without Li1 strain. C3 control was selected as a reference control. ES and C2 portions were treated with purified enterocin CCM4231 in a concentration of 6400 AU/ml. Before the experimental inoculation, "bryndza" was checked for the presence of contaminant agents. The experiment lasted 1 week and the samples were stored in the refrigerator at 4 degrees C. Sampling was performed on day 1, on day 4 and on day 7. The control samples C2 and C3 were checked only on day 1 and then after 1 week. The following contaminant agents were detected in "bryndza" before its experimental inoculation with L. innocua Li1 strain: Escherichia coli in the amount 10(3) cfu/ml/g, Staphylococcus aureus (10(2) cfu/ml/g) and enterococci (10(4) cfu/ml/g). In the control sample C2, the number of E. coli was reduced to 10(2) cfu/ml/g. Enterococci and staphylococci were totally eliminated there. Concerning C3 control, natural decrease of bacteria was found and/or their unchanged counts. The value of pH (5) was stable during the whole experiment. In the experimental sample inoculated with Li1 strain, its counts were decreased immediately after enterocin CCM4231 addition approximately by one order of magnitude. This inhibitory effect was also detectable on day 4 by the difference of one order of magnitude between ES and C1. On day 7, 10(3) cfu/ml/g of Li1 strain were detected in both samples (ES, C1). The difference by one order of magnitude indicated, an inhibitory effect of enterocin CCM4231 in "bryndza". However, bacteriocin activity was not determined by laboratory analyses.
TI  - Regulation of expression of the vanD glycopeptide resistance gene cluster from Enterococcus faecium BM4339.
AB  - A new open reading frame, encoding a putative integrase-like protein, was detected downstream from the six genes of the vanD glycopeptide resistance cluster in Enterococcus faecium BM4339 (B. Casadewall and P. Courvalin, J. Bacteriol. 181:3644-3648, 1999). In this cluster, genes coding for the VanR(D)-VanS(D) two-component regulatory system were cotranscribed from the P(R(D)) promoter, whereas transcription of the vanY(D), vanH(D), vanD, vanX(D), and intD genes was initiated from the P(Y(D)) promoter located between vanS(D) and vanY(D) (the D subscript indicates that the gene is part of the vanD operon). The VanR(D)-VanS(D) regulatory system is likely to activate transcription of the resistance genes from the promoter P(Y(D)). Glycopeptide-susceptible derivatives of BM4339 were obtained by trans complementation of the frameshift mutation in the ddl gene, restoring functional D-alanine:D-alanine ligase activity in this strain. The glycopeptide-susceptible transformant BM4409, producing only D-alanyl-D-alanine-terminating peptidoglycan precursors, did not express the resistance genes encoding the VanY(D) D,D-carboxypeptidase, the VanH(D) dehydrogenase, the VanD ligase, the VanX(D) D,D-dipeptidase, and also the IntD integrase, although the regulatory region of the vanD cluster was still transcribed. In BM4409, the absence of VanR(D)-VanS(D), apparently dependent, transcription from promoter P(Y(D)) correlated with the lack of D-alanyl-D-lactate-terminating precursors. The vanX(D) gene was transcribed in BM4339, but detectable amounts of VanX(D) D,D-dipeptidase were not synthesized. However, the gene directed synthesis of an active enzyme when cloned on a multicopy plasmid in Escherichia coli, suggesting that the enzyme was unstable in BM4339 or that it had very low activity that was detectable only under conditions of high gene dosage. This activity is not required for glycopeptide resistance in BM4339, since this strain cannot synthesize D-alanyl-D-alanine.
TI  - Screening of some plants from Northern Argentina for their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - AIMS: Screening of antimicrobial activity in 25 plant species from Northern Argentina. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inhibition of microbial growth was measured by a microplate assay with an oxidation-reduction indicator (Alamar Blue). Test organisms were: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Weak inhibitory activities (MIC=0.5 mg dry matter ml(-1)) were found in methanolic extracts of Rivina humilis, Crateva tapia, Funastrum claucum and Schinopsis balansae. Stronger bacteriostatic power was detected in Vassobia breviflora (MIC=0.25 mg ml(-1) against Staphylococcus aureus, and 0.5 mg ml(-1) against Enterococcus faecium). This activity was purified five-fold by extraction with dichloromethane, and it was found equally effective against susceptible or antibiotic-resistant strains of Staph. aureus. In addition, the purified extract was synergistic with gentamicin, and it was bactericidal at 24 h, with a concentration of 0.25 mg ml(-1). CONCLUSION: There is a significant antimicrobial activity in Vassobia breviflora. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Further studies will be required to disclose the potential importance of these findings.
TI  - Adsorption effect of activated charcoal on enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli.
AB  - The adsorption property of activated charcoal on verotoxin (VT)-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) was examined using E. coli O157:H7. In the present study, E. coli O157:H7 strains were effectively adsorbed by activated charcoal. Adsorption was dose-dependent, and the maximum adsorption occurred within 5 min. At 10 mg of activated charcoal, bacteria tested were completely adsorbed. Activated charcoal also had the capacity to adsorb toxin (verotoxin 2) activity from the bacterial extract. Furthermore, the adsorption efficiency of activated charcoal for the normal bacterial flora in the intestine was assessed using Enterococcus faecium, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Activated charcoal showed lower binding capacity to the normal bacterial flora tested than that to E. coli O157:H7 strains. These results suggest that activated charcoal could be a good adsorbent system for the removal of VTEC and verotoxin.
TI  - Penicillin-binding protein 5 and expression of ampicillin resistance in Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - We report a structural and transcriptional analysis of the pbp5 region of Enterococcus faecium C68. pbp5 exists within a larger operon that includes upstream open reading frames (ORFs) corresponding to previously reported psr (penicillin-binding protein synthesis repressor) and ftsW (whose product is a transmembrane protein that interacts with PBP3 in Escherichia coli septum formation) genes. Hybridization of mRNA from C68, CV133, and four ampicillin-resistant CV133 mutants revealed four distinct transcripts from this region, consisting of (i) E. faecium ftsW (ftsW(Efm)) alone; (ii) psr and pbp5; (iii) pbp5 alone; and (iv) ftsW(Efm), psr, and pbp5. Quantities of the different transcripts varied between strains and did not always correlate with quantities of PBP5 or levels of ampicillin resistance. Since the psr of C68 is presumably nonfunctional due to an insertion of an extra nucleotide in the codon for the 44th amino acid, the region extending from the ftsW(Efm) promoter through the pbp5 gene of C68 was cloned in E. coli to facilitate mutagenesis. The psr ORF was regenerated using site-directed mutagenesis and introduced into E. faecium D344-SRF on conjugative shuttle vector pTCV-lac (pCWR558 [psr ORF interrupted]; pCWR583 [psr ORF intact]). Ampicillin MICs for both D344-SRF(pCWR558) and D344-SRF(pCWR583) were 64 microg/ml. Quantities of pbp5 transcript and protein were similar in strains containing either construct regardless of whether they were grown in the presence or absence of ampicillin, arguing against a role for PSR as a repressor of pbp5 transcription. However, quantities of psr transcript were increased in D344-SRF(pCWR583) compared to D344-SRF(pCWR558), especially after growth in ampicillin; suggesting that PSR acts in some manner to activate its own transcription.
TI  - In vivo efficacy of trovafloxacin against Bacteroides fragilis in mixed infection with either Escherichia coli or a vancomycin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecium in an established-abscess murine model.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of trovafloxacin were studied  in a standardized murine model of established subcutaneous abscesses. Daily dosing regimens of 37.5 to 300 mg/kg every 8 h (q8h) or every 24 h (q24h) were started 3 days after inoculation with mixtures containing either Bacteroides fragilis-Escherichia coli-autoclaved cecal contents (ACC) or B. fragilis-vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF)-ACC. Treatment was continued for 3 or 5 days. The efficacy of treatment was determined by the decrease in abscess bacterial counts and abscess weights, as well as by the reduction in inflammation (biodistribution of (99m)Tc-HYNIC immunoglobulin G) compared to saline-treated controls. Trovafloxacin showed a significant dose-response effect on the bacterial counts, weight, and inflammation of B. fragilis-E. coli abscesses after 3 and/or 5 days of treatment. A maximum 3.4 and 3.1 log(10) reduction in CFU/abscess in the respective B. fragilis and E. coli bacterial counts was attained after 5 days of treatment with daily doses of 300 mg/kg. The peak serum concentration was more predictive for effect than the area under the concentration-time curve. The C(max) was the pharmacodynamic index most predictive for success, and the efficacy of the q24h regimens was significantly better than the q8h regimens. The antibiotic was ineffective against the VREF in mixed infection with B. fragilis, while the killing of the anaerobe in the same combination was significantly less than in the E. coli combination (P < 0.05). We conclude that this is a useful model for studying the activity of antimicrobials for the treatment of small (<1-cm), undrainable, mixed-infection abscesses. In addition, we have shown for the first time that a decrease in bacterial numbers also leads to a reduction in both abscess weight and inflammation.
TI  - Sequencing of the ddl gene and modeling of the mutated D-alanine:D-alanine ligase in glycopeptide-dependent strains of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Glycopeptide dependence for growth in enterococci results from mutations in the ddl gene that inactivate the host D-Ala:D-Ala ligase. The strains require glycopeptides as inducers for synthesis of resistance proteins, which allows for the production of peptidoglycan precursors ending in D-Ala-D-Lac instead of D-Ala-D-Ala. The sequences of the ddl gene from nine glycopeptide-dependent Enterococcus faecium clinical isolates were determined. Each one had a mutation consisting either in a 5-bp insertion at position 41 leading to an early stop codon, an in-frame 6-bp deletion causing the loss of two residues (KDVA243-246 to KA), or single base-pair changes resulting in an amino acid substitution (E13 --> G, G99 --> R, V241 --> D, D295 --> G, P313 --> L). The potential consequences of the deletion and point mutations on the 3-D structure of the enzyme were evaluated by comparative molecular modeling of the E. faecium enzyme, using the X-ray structure of the homologous Escherichia coli D-Ala:D-Ala ligase DdlB as a template. All mutated residues were found either to interact directly with one of the substrates of the enzymatic reaction (E13 and D295) or to stabilize the position of critical residues in the active site. Maintenance of the 3-D structure in the vicinity of these mutations in the active site appears critical for D-Ala:D-Ala ligase activity.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of group IIA and group V phospholipases A2.
AB  - Group V phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) is a recently characterized 14-kDa secretory  PLA(2) of mammalian heart and macrophage-derived cells. Group IIA PLA(2), which is structurally close to group V PLA(2), has been shown to kill Gram-positive bacteria in vitro and to prevent symptoms of Gram-positive infection in vivo. We studied the antibacterial properties of fully active recombinant rat group IIA and V PLA(2)s. Both group IIA and V PLA(2)s were highly bactericidal against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Only high concentrations of group IIA PLA(2) showed some bactericidal effect against the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. Our results confirm that group IIA PLA(2) is a potent antibacterial enzyme against Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, we show here that group V PLA(2) is a novel antibacterial mammalian protein, but is less potent than group IIA PLA(2). Both enzymes may be considered as future therapeutic agents against bacterial infections.
TI  - Determination of the antibacterial efficacy of several antiseptics tested on skin by an 'ex-vivo' test.
AB  - There are many skin antiseptics commercially available. Although their antibacterial activity has often been well studied, their potential effectiveness on skin remains poorly documented. To date, in-vivo protocols designed for the testing of the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics cannot use, for ethical reasons, pathogenic bacteria or new formulations whose toxicity in human subjects is unknown. An 'ex-vivo' test was recently developed to overcome these problems. Freshly excised human skin from abdominal or breast reduction was placed in a diffusion cell containing a maintenance medium in the recipient compartment. A bacterial inoculum was then applied to the stratum corneum and, after a drying step, antiseptic formulations were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. Several micro-organisms were investigated: - Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant Ent. faecium (VRE), S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli--with several biocides--para-chloro-meta-xylenol (PCMX, active compound of Dettol), povidone iodine, triclosan (in isopropanol) and chlorhexidine. Results from the ex-vivo test were compared with results obtained in suspension and glass-carrier tests. The bactericidal activity of the biocides depended upon the test performed and results were generally significantly different from one method to the other. All biocides tested in the suspension test achieved >4 log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentrations, apart from povidone iodine tested against Ent. faecalis and VRE. The antibacterial activity of biocides tested in the glass-carrier test was significantly lower than in the suspension test, with the exception of triclosan in isopropanol, which was as effective in both suspension and glass-carrier test. In the ex-vivo test, triclosan in isopropanol achieved a log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentration of 1.105-1.771 (with the exception of P. aeruginosa with 0.758 log10 reduction). PCMX, povidone iodine and chlorhexidine achieved log10 reductions in viable bacterial concentration of 0.303-0.901. Chlorhexidine tested against P. aeruginosa produced a 1.94 log10 reduction in concentration. These results confirm previous observations about the need for testing the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics on skin surface to determine their in-situ efficacy and encourage further the use of the ex-vivo protocol.
TI  - Analysis of the bacterial strains isolated from urine samples of hospitalized and ambulatory patients.
AB  - Bacteria of Enterococcus spp. are now much more often isolated from various diagnostic materials in systemic infection, both in hospitalized and in ambulatory patients. The study included 571 enterococci strains isolated from urine in 1997. Species identification was performed by rapid ID32 STREP test (bioMerieux) for 327 analyzed strains. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium dominated (46.1% and 11.2%, respectively). Over 42% of strains were isolated from urine of patients with non-significant bacteriuria or as concomitant flora. In such cases, simplified identification was performed and the strains were determined as Enterococcus spp. The microorganisms analyzed originated primarily from the urine samples of patients hospitalized at the Department of Urology (41.8%), the Department of Neurology (11.9%) and the Department of Internal Medicine and Nephrology (9.9%). Enterococcus faecalis strains were second with respect to population count (263--10.6%), after Escherichia coli strains (464--18.8%), while Enterococcus faecium strains were the sixth (64--2.5%). Enterococcus genus took the first place among all microorganisms isolated from the urine samples. Antibiotic-sensitivity was determined for 323 enterococci strains originating from hospitalized and ambulatory patients. Enterococcus faecium strains, naturally resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, were sensitive to nitrofuranoin in more than 50% and to norfloxacin in about 20%. Among 254 analyzed Enterococcus faecalis strains, 80.0% were sensitive to ampicillin, nitrofurantoin and high concentrations of gentamicin as well as streptomycin. Enterococci strains isolated from hospitalized patients proved sensitive to ampicillin and carbapenems in 76.8%, while strains isolated from ambulatory patients were 100% sensitive to these drugs. Examination of enterococci isolated from urine of patients hospitalized showed 33.8% sensitive to norfloxacin and 84.6% sensitive to nitrofurantoin. All the enterococci strains were sensitive to glycopeptide antibiotics: vancomycin, teicoplanin.
TI  - Selective pressure by antibiotic use in livestock.
AB  - Selective pressure exerted by the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in food  animals appears to have created large reservoirs of transferable antibiotic resistance in these ecosystems. This first became evident for oxytetracycline and later for the streptothricin antibiotic nurseothricin, for which a transfer of relevant resistance determinants (sat genes) to bacterial pathogens of humans was demonstrated. With the emergence of glycopeptide resistance in Enterococcus faecium outside hospitals, a large reservoir of transferable resistance (vanA gene cluster) was identified in animal husbandry due to the use of avoparcin as feed additive. The spread of resistance, which reaches the human enterococcal flora via meat products, is probably due to the dissemination of the vanA gene cluster integrated into different conjugative plasmids among a variety of different strains. Streptogramin resistance associated with the resistance genes vatA and vatG has been found in E. faecium of animal and of clinical origin. Because virginiamycin has been used as growth promoter in animals but streptogramins have been used infrequently in human medicine, this again suggests an animal origin of resistance. Since the use of avoparcin ended, a decline in the rates of glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium (GREF) from animals and humans in the community has been recorded. This supports the ban of antibacterial growth promoters that might interfere with human chemotherapy that has been introduced in European Union countries.
TI  - In vitro activity of trovafloxacin against Bacteroides fragilis in mixed culture  with either Escherichia coli or a vancomycin- resistant strain of Enterococcus faecium determined by an anaerobic time-kill technique.
AB  - To determine the efficacy of trovafloxacin as a possible treatment for intra-abdominal abscesses, we have developed an anaerobic time-kill technique using different inocula to study the in vitro killing of Bacteroides fragilis in pure culture or in mixed culture with either Escherichia coli or a vancomycin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecium (VREF). With inocula of 5 x 10(5) CFU/ml and trovafloxacin concentrations of </=2 microg/ml, a maximum observed effect (E(max)) of >/=6.1 (log(10) CFU/ml) was attained with all pure and mixed cultures within 24 h. With inocula of 10(8) CFU/ml, a similar E(max) and a similar concentration to produce 50% of E(max) (EC(50)) for B. fragilis were found in both pure cultures and mixed cultures with E. coli. However, to produce a similar killing of B. fragilis in the mixed cultures with VREF, a 14-fold increase in the concentration of trovafloxacin was required. A vancomycin-susceptible strain of E. faecium and a trovafloxacin-resistant strain of E. coli were also found to confer a similar "protective" effect on B. fragilis against the activity of trovafloxacin. Using inocula of 10(9) CFU/ml, the activity of trovafloxacin was retained for E. coli and B. fragilis and was negligible against VREF. We conclude that this is a useful technique to study the anaerobic killing of mixed cultures in vitro and may be of value in predicting the killing of mixed infections in vivo. The importance of using mixed cultures and not pure cultures is clearly shown by the difference in the killing of B. fragilis in the mixed cultures tested. Trovafloxacin will probably be ineffective in the treatment of infections involving large numbers of enterococci. However, due to its ability to retain activity against large cultures of B. fragilis and E. coli, trovafloxacin could be beneficial in the treatment of intra-abdominal abscesses.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of human beta -defensin-3, a novel human inducible peptide antibiotic.
AB  - The growing public health problem of infections caused by multiresistant Gram-positive bacteria, in particular Staphylococcus aureus, prompted us to screen human epithelia for endogenous S. aureus-killing factors. A novel 5-kDa, nonhemolytic antimicrobial peptide (human beta-defensin-3, hBD-3) was isolated from human lesional psoriatic scales and cloned from keratinocytes. hBD-3 demonstrated a salt-insensitive broad spectrum of potent antimicrobial activity against many potentially pathogenic microbes including multiresistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Ultrastructural analyses of hBD-3-treated S. aureus revealed signs of cell wall perforation. Recombinant hBD-3 (expressed as a His-Tag-fusion protein in Escherichia coli) and chemically synthesized hBD-3 were indistinguishable from naturally occurring peptide with respect to their antimicrobial activity and biochemical properties. Investigation of different tissues revealed skin and tonsils to be major hBD-3 mRNA-expressing tissues. Molecular cloning and biochemical analyses of antimicrobial peptides in cell culture supernatants revealed keratinocytes and airway epithelial cells as cellular sources of hBD-3. Tumor necrosis factor alpha and contact with bacteria were found to induce hBD-3 mRNA expression. hBD-3 therefore might be important in the innate epithelial defense of infections by various microorganisms seen in skin and lung, such as cystic fibrosis.
TI  - A novel IS-like element frequently inserted in a putative virulence regulator in  bovine mastitis isolates of Streptococcus dysgalactiae.
AB  - Streptococcus dysgalactiae, a Lancefield group C streptococcus, is commonly isolated from bovine mastitis. We recently identified a putative regulon in two S. dysgalactiae strains, 8215 and Epi9, consisting of two consecutive genes, dmg and dem, coding for a possible regulatory protein and an M-like protein with fibrinogen- and IgG-binding-properties, respectively. During these studies a short sequence homologous to an IS element was found to be inserted in the dmg gene of strain 8215. The present investigation describes the complete sequence of this IS-like element, named ISSdy1, which consists of 1218 bp and contains two ORFs, flanked by imperfect repeats. The nucleotide sequence of the IS-like element shows 82% identity to the previously reported sequence of IS199 from Streptococcus mutans V403. The deduced amino acid sequences of the ORFs also revealed high homology to transposases from IS elements in Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Shigella dysenteriae, all belonging to the IS3 family. We studied the distribution of ISSdy1 in 57 S. dysgalactiae isolates using PCR analysis with specific primers derived from the IS element. Ninety-eight percent of the isolates contained the ISSdy1 element. Surprisingly, in the majority of studied strains a copy of the IS-like element was found to be inserted in the dmg gene, a putative virulence regulator.
TI  - Diversity of domain V of 23S rRNA gene sequence in different Enterococcus species.
AB  - The highly conserved central loop of domain V of 23S RNA (nucleotides 2042 to 2628; Escherichia coli numbering) is implicated in peptidyltransferase activity and represents one of the target sites for macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B antibiotics. DNA encoding domain V (590 bp) of several species of Enterococcus was amplified by PCR. Twenty enterococcal isolates were tested, including Enterococcus faecium (six isolates), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus casseliflavus (two isolates of each), and Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus malodoratus, and Enterococcus hirae (one isolate of each). For all isolates, species identification by biochemical testing was corroborated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The sequence of domain V of the 23S rRNA gene from E. faecium and E. faecalis differed from those of all other enterococci. The domain V sequences of E. durans and E. hirae were identical. This was also true for E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus. E. avium differed from E. casseliflavus by 23 bases, from E. durans by 16 bases, and from E. malodoratus by 2 bases. E. avium differed from E. raffinosus by one base. Despite the fact that domain V is considered to be highly conserved, substantial differences were identified between several enterococcal species.
TI  - [Sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria from nosocomial infections. Evolution in  resuscitation services of military hospitals].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study, conducted in the French Military hospitals, was to monitor the course of the antimicrobial sensibility of bacteria isolated from nosocomial infection in intensive care units. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study has been conducted from January to December 1998 in all the intensive care units of the French Army. All the non-repetitive strains isolated from nosocomial infection were collected and sent to a reference centre. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method. Beta-lactamase were identified by iso-electro-focalisation. Antibiotics choice and interpretative criteria were those of the "Comite Francais de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie". RESULTS: A total of 849 strains are included in this study. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (20%) followed by Escherichia coli (19%) Staphylococcus aureus (15%), coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) (11%) and Enterococci (7%). Imipenem was the most effective antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae (336 isolates; 100% susceptibility). Gentamicin (92%), amikacin (92%) third generation cephalosporins (83%), aztreonam (83%) and ciprofloxacin (78%) were also very effective. Resistance to III generation cephalosporins was correlated with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (BLSE) in 36% of cases. This BLSE could be associated with an over production of the constitutive cephalosporinase. The most frequent species producing BLSE were Enterobacter aerogenes (75% of BLSE) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). Among the 172 P. aeruginosa isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility were respectively: 71% for imipenem, 62%: tobramycin, 60%: amikacin 59%: ciprofloxacin 59% piperacillin + tazobactam, 55% piperacillin, 53%: ceftazidime and 44% for ticarcillin. Seventy per cent of the 96 CoNS and 50.2% of the 126 S. aureus isolated were resistant to methicillin. A strain of S. aureus and 2 CoNS strains had intermediate resistance to teicoplanin. Twenty per cent of the 59 Enterococci strains isolated were resistant to aminopenicillins (10/11 strains of E. faecium), and 9% presented a high level of resistance to gentamicine. One strain of E. faecium was resistant to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: The evolution of the susceptibility to antibiotics in intensive care units reflects the antibiotic pressure and level of cross-transmission. High rates of meticillin-resistance among staphylococci, of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics among P. aeruginosa and of ciprofloxacin among Enterobacteriaceae are shown in this study. The implementation of appropriate strategies for surveillance and prevention is necessary.
TI  - A strain of Enterococcus faecium (18C23) inhibits adhesion of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88 to porcine small intestine mucus.
AB  - Few studies, if any, have addressed the adhesion of enterococci to the intestinal mucosa and their interference with the adhesion of pathogens, although more than 60% of probiotic preparations in the market contain strains of enterococci. The objective of this study was to investigate if Enterococcus faecium 18C23 has the ability to inhibit the adhesion of Escherichia coli K88ac and K88MB to the small intestine mucus of piglets. Approximately 9% of E. faecium 18C23 organisms adhered to the small intestine mucus, and the adhesion was found to be specific. Living E. faecium 18C23 culture efficiently inhibited the adhesion of E. coli K88ac and K88MB to the piglet intestine mucus. Inhibition of the adhesion of E. coli K88ac to the small intestine mucus was found to be dose dependent. Inhibition of >90% was observed when 10(9) CFU or more of living E. faecium 18C23 culture per ml was added simultaneously with E. coli to immobilized mucus. The substances from both the 18C23 cells and the spent culture supernatant contributed to the inhibition of adhesion of E. coli K88 to the small intestine mucus receptors. The inhibiting effect was not solely a pH effect since considerable inhibitory action was demonstrated after neutralizing the mixture or spent culture supernatant to pH 7.0. Part of the inhibition of adhesion of E. coli K88ac by E. faecium 18C23 or its supernatant might occur through steric hindrance.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of chaff vinegar and its practical application.
AB  - Since enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella, etc., sometimes contaminate animal feces and may cause infectious diseases to humans, it is important to remove pathogenic bacteria from domestic animal waste. For the purpose, we examined the antibacterial activity of chaff vinegar. We found that the chaff vinegar inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria immediately in vitro but not efficiently spores and lactic acid bacteria. Further, it removes bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae, from animal feces and the surface of the concrete-floor in the cattle barn. Chaff vinegar is advertised as a natural chemical substance for a soil conditioner, to promote the composting and to deodorize their smell. Chaff vinegar may be useful for organic agriculture without enteric pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Detection of the high-level aminoglycoside resistance gene aph(2")-Ib in Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - A new high-level gentamicin resistance gene, designated aph(2")-Ib, was cloned from Enterococcus faecium SF11770. The deduced amino acid sequence of the 897-bp open reading frame of aph(2")-Ib shares homology with the aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes AAC(6')-APH(2"), APH(2")-Ic, and APH(2")-Id. The observed phosphotransferase activity is designated APH(2")-Ib.
TI  - A new rapid automated method for the detection of Listeria from environmental swabs and sponges.
AB  - Many food and meat processors test environmental swabs and sponges to confirm the absence of Listeria spp. Spectral pattern changes in a liquid growth medium, resulting from esculin hydrolysis by Listeria in contaminated swabs and sponges, were automatically monitored by the BioSys instrument in a semifluid layer (SFL). The blackening of SFL in modified MOX broth resulted in sharply declining curves, which were easily detected by the instrument. The instrument detected all nine strains of Listeria monocytogenes tested. None of the gram negative organisms (Proteus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, Citrobacter and Yersinia) were detected by the system, nor were most gram positive organisms, including Bacillus, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus strains, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis, which hydrolyze esculin, produced black colonies on PALCAM and Oxford media and were also detected in the system. A total of 122 sponges and swabs collected at food processing plants were evaluated by this method. Of these, 99 were negative, and 11 were positive. L. innocua was the dominant Listeria species in these environmental samples. Good correlation was obtained between numbers of Listeria and detection times of esculin hydrolysis: 1000 CFU/swab were detected in 10-13 h, whereas 1-10 CFU/swab were detected in less than 22 h. The total assay time was 26 h.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - Ecological impact of antibiotic use in animals on different complex microflora: environment.
AB  - Different means of interaction between microecological systems in different animal hosts (including humans) and the environment may occur during the transfer of resistant bacteria and their resistance genes. Spread of resistance takes place in different ways with respect to clonal spread of resistance strains by the spread of wide host range plasmids and translocatable elements. Commensals in ecosystems have a special significance and a pronounced capacity for acquisition and transfer of resistance genes as with Enterococcus faecium and Escherichia coli in the gut flora or Pseudomonas spp. in aquatic environments. The route of transmission from animals to humans by meat products is well established. Other routes via water and food plants (vegetables) have been investigated less, although resistance genes transfer in aquatic environments as evidenced from sequence comparison of such genes (e.g. tetR, floR in Salmonella typhimurium DT104). Whether this is due to rare but important transfer events or whether there is a more frequent exchange in aquatic or terrestrial environments needs further elucidation.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance monitoring: the Spanish programme. The VAV Network. Red de  Vigilancia de Resistencias Antibioticas en Bacterias de Origen Veterinario.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a problem in modern public health and antimicrobial use and especially misuse, the most important selecting force for bacterial antibiotic resistance. As this resistance must be monitored we have designed the Spanish network 'Red de Vigilancia de Resistencias Antibioticas en Bacterias de Origen Veterinario'. This network covers the three critical points of veterinary responsibility, bacteria from sick animals, bacteria from healthy animals and bacteria from food animals. Key bacteria, antimicrobials and animal species have been defined for each of these groups along with laboratory methods for testing antimicrobial susceptibility and for data analysis and reporting. Surveillance of sick animals was first implemented using Escherichia coli as the sentinel bacterium. Surveillance of E. coli and Enterococcus faecium from healthy pigs was implemented in 1998. In July 1999, data collection on Salmonella spp. was initiated in poultry slaughterhouses. Additionally, the prevalence of vancomycin resistant E. faecium was also monitored. This network has specific topics of interest related to methods of determining resistance, analysis and reporting of data, methods of use for veterinary practitioners and collaboration with public health authorities.
TI  - Expression, purification and crystallization of enterococcus faecium streptogramin A acetyltransferase.
AB  - The streptogramin A acetyltransferase from Enterococcus faecium (SWISS-PROT P50870) has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized. Crystallization conditions were screened using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method and resulted in two distinct crystal forms. Form I crystals diffract to 2.5 A and belong to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 68.6, b = 102.6, c = 107.5 A. Form II crystals diffract to 2.7 A and belong to space group F222, with unit-cell parameters a = 185.8, b = 185.8, c = 186.5 A. Rotation-function and packing analyses for both crystal forms indicate that the asymmetric unit may contain one and two copies of the trimeric enzyme for crystal forms I and II, respectively.
TI  - Paradoxical effect of inserting, in Enterococcus faecalis penicillin-binding protein 5, an amino acid box responsible for low affinity for penicillin in Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Penicillin-binding proteins 5 (PBP5s) of enterococci are structurally and immunologically related proteins that are characterized by their low affinity for penicillin. For this reason, they are mainly involved in penicillin resistance, due essentially to their ability to take over the function of all other PBPs already bound and inhibited by the beta-lactam. It has been demonstrated that penicillin resistance in enterococci is acquired either by overproduction of PBP5 or by the presence of specific amino acid sequences in the protein that further decrease the affinity for penicillin. In particular, a specific amino acid box (ANNGA) previously identified in Enterococcus faecium is responsible for the high penicillin resistance displayed by this species. Here, we describe the insertion of the PBP5 amino acid box ANNGA in Enterococcus faecalis, an enterococcal species usually more sensitive to penicillin, by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenized PBP5 was re-introduced into a pbp5 mutant of E. faecalis obtained by insertion of transposon Tn916. Data indicate that this amino acid box brings about no reduction in penicillin sensitivity in the recipient E. faecalis strain, but, paradoxically, dramatically lowers the penicillin minimal inhibitory concentration caused by the native PBP5. We deduce that, although enterococcal PBP5s are a family of closely related proteins as far as biological function is concerned, differences exist in their three-dimensional structure that affect penicillin affinity.
TI  - [Preliminary results of antibiotic resistance monitoring in the Netherlands].
AB  - Qualitative tests are used to monitor antimicrobial resistance in bacteria of animal origin in the Netherlands. Quantitative information on trends in resistance is thus not obtained. Moreover, in general a limited panel of antibiotics is tested. The present study describes resistance in zoonotic food-borne pathogens Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli O157 isolated from human clinical cases and from faeces of healthy food animals in 1998 and 1999, as determined with quantitative susceptibility tests. The resistance of the indicator organisms E. coli and Enterococcus faecium isolated from faecal samples of broilers and pigs randomly sampled at slaughterhouses was also determined. For this end, faecal samples from veal calves were sampled in 1996 and 1997 at the three main Dutch veal calf slaughterhouses. In 1998 only a limited number of faecal samples of veal calves were taken at farms. For E. coli and Salmonella the following antibiotics were tested: amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, imipenem, gentamicin, doxycycline, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, carbadox, and flumequine. For E. faecium the following antibiotics were tested: amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, erythromycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, streptomycin ('high level' > 2000 mg/ml), gentamicin ('high level' > 500 mg/ml), ciprofloxacin, bacitracin, flavofosfolipol, salinomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, virginiamycin, tilmicosin, avilamycin, and everninomycin. For Campylobacter the following antibiotics were tested: erythromycin, doxycycline, gentamicin, carbadox, flavofosfolipol, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, amoxicillin, and metronidazole.
TI  - Identification of a streptogramin A acetyltransferase gene in the chromosome of Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - Streptogramins are polypeptide antibiotics inhibiting protein synthesis by the prokaryotic ribosome. Gram-positive organisms are susceptible to streptogramins, while most gram-negative bacteria are intrinsically resistant. We have found a genomic fragment from a Yersinia enterocolitica isolate with an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide similar to the virginiamycin acetyltransferases found in various plasmids from gram-positive bacteria. The susceptible Escherichia coli strain DB10 was transformed to resistance to the type A streptogramins and to mixed (A + B) streptogramins upon introduction of a plasmid containing that gene. In addition, we showed streptogramin acetylating activity in vitro dependent on the presence of the Y. enterocolitica sat gene. Southern blot hybridization experiments showed that the sat gene was present in all the Y. enterocolitica isolates examined. These data together show that the gene in the Y. enterocolitica chromosome encoded an active streptogramin acetyltransferase. The deduced sequence of the Y. enterocolitica Sat protein was close to those of sat gene products found in gram-positive bacteria and cyanobacteria, suggesting a common evolutionary origin.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and frequency of occurrence of clinical blood isolates in Europe from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997 and 1998.
AB  - As part of the European arm of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 25  European university hospitals referred 9613 blood isolates for in vitro testing against >20 antimicrobial agents. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the 5 most frequent isolates and accounted for two-thirds of all referrals, with minor regional variation. Of these, approximately 0.36% of E. coli and 16.7% of K. pneumoniae isolates proved to be potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and their incidence clearly varied regionally. Quinolone resistance was detected among gram-negative species; in particular, P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. Considerable regional variation was observed in the incidences of methicillin resistance in S. aureus and penicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The incidence of vancomycin resistance in enterococci was relatively low overall and primarily associated with Enterococcus faecium. However, extrapolation of these data to smaller and nonteaching hospitals should be undertaken with caution, since resistance rates may be lower in these facilities.
TI  - In vitro action of a combination of selected antimicrobial agents and chondroitin sulfate.
AB  - Chondroitin sulfate (CS), a highly anionic polymer and the most predominant sulfated glycosaminoglycan in connective tissues, was investigated regarding to its interaction with cationic disinfectants, which are used as antiinfectives in humans. Combinations of cetylpyridiniumchloride (CPC), chlorhexidine (CHex), and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) with CS, respectively, were prepared and the resulting microbicidal activity of the mixtures was tested in the quantitative suspension test without organic matter. Polyvidone-iodine and Ringer's solution were used as controls. Even precipitated, the resulting test combinations behave differently against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. CPC/CS demonstrated only microbicidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and CHex/CS was more active against Gram-negative bacteria and C. albicans. PHMB/CS, especially in combination with CS-A, only revealed an antimicrobial effect against P. aeruginosa after 60 min action. The interaction of cationic disinfectants with CS showed depending on the investigated microorganism a more or less controlled sustained release manner of the microbicidal agent from the precipitated complex, with the only exception of PHMB in combination with CS-C, which is completely neutralized. Polyvidone-iodine and Ringer's solution were not affected by CS.
TI  - Surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Taiwan, 1998.
AB  - For the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. Besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. We re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. The most common isolates were Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among hospital-acquired infections, Acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. The oxacillin resistance of S. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. Among Enterococcus spp., 85% were either E. faecalis or E. faecium. They were 14% resistant to vancomycin. Among gram-negative bacteria, K. pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. This difference was less apparent in the case of Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa. These bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. Fifty-one percent of Salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Isolates from the East were least resistant. Plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against S. aureus, ciprofloxacin against E. coli, and ciprofloxacin against Salmonella spp. These findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.
TI  - P45, an extracellular 45 kDa protein of Listeria monocytogenes with similarity to protein p60 and exhibiting peptidoglycan lytic activity.
AB  - A monoclonal antibody obtained by immunization of mice with heat-killed cells of  Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4d showed reactivity towards a protein (P45) from L. monocytogenes with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa. This protein was detected in the culture supernatant and at the cell surface of L. monocytogenes. Proteins cross-reacting with the monoclonal antibody were present in all Listeria strains investigated, except L. grayi. The structural gene was cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. Translation of the gene starts at a TTG initiation codon. The gene was found to code for a protein of 402 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 42.7 kDa. It has a signal peptide of 27 amino acid residues, resulting in a molecular mass for the mature polypeptide of 39.9 kDa. Protein database searches showed that this protein has 55% similarity and 38% identity to protein p60 of L. monocytogenes and exhibits significant sequence similarities to p54 from Enterococcus faecium and Usp45 from Lactococcus lactis. P45 was shown to have peptidoglycan lytic activity and the encoding gene was named spl (secreted protein with lytic property).
TI  - Bacteraemia and antibiotic resistance of its pathogens reported in England and Wales between 1990 and 1998: trend analysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Determination of causes, trends, and antibiotic resistance in reports of bacterial pathogens isolated from blood in England and Wales from 1990 to 1998. DESIGN: Description of bacterial isolates from blood, judged to be clinically significant by microbiology staff, reported to the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre. SETTING: Microbiology laboratories in England and Wales. SUBJECTS: Patients yielding clinically significant isolates from blood. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency and Poisson regression analyses for trend of reported causes of bacteraemia and proportions of antibiotic resistant isolates. RESULTS: There was an upward trend in total numbers of reports of bacteraemia. The five most cited organisms accounted for over 60% of reports each year. There was a substantial increase in the proportion of reports of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance to penicillin and erythromycin, and Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium resistance to vancomycin. No increase was seen in resistance of Escherichia coli to gentamicin. CONCLUSIONS: Reports from laboratories provide valuable information on trends and antibiotic resistance in bacteraemia and show a worrying increase in resistance to important antibiotics.
TI  - Activities of a nitrofurazone-containing urinary catheter and a silver hydrogel catheter against multidrug-resistant bacteria characteristic of catheter-associated urinary tract infection.
AB  - The in vitro inhibitory activity of a nitrofurazone-coated urinary catheter (NFC) against 86 recently obtained susceptible and multidrug-resistant (MDR) clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Enterococcus faecium, which are species implicated in catheter-associated urinary tract infection and which traditionally have been susceptible to nitrofuran derivatives, was determined using an agar diffusion assay. In a subset of these strains, the activity of the NFC was compared with that of a silver hydrogel urinary catheter (SHC), and the durability of each catheter's inhibitory activity was assessed during serial daily transfers of catheter segments to fresh culture plates. Except for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, the NFC was active against all isolates tested and showed comparable inhibition zones with susceptible and MDR strains of each species. In contrast, the SHC inhibited only certain staphylococci (P < 0.01 versus the NFC), and among these strains, the SHC produced smaller inhibition zones than did the NFC (P < 0.01). Inhibition was evident for up to 5 days with the NFC, but for only 1 day (if at all) with the SHC (P < 0.01). These data document that, for most genera which traditionally have been susceptible to nitrofuran derivatives, the NFC remains active against contemporary MDR isolates. They also demonstrate that the in vitro antibacterial activity of the NFC is markedly superior to that of the SHC in several respects. Thus, the NFC shows promise for clinical use in the current era of MDR bacteria.
TI  - The role of recombination and mutation in 16S-23S rDNA spacer rearrangements.
AB  - The intragenomic heterogeneity of the bacterial intergenic (16S-23S rDNA) spacer  region (ISR) was analysed from the following species in which sequences for the complete rRNA operon (rrn) set have been determined (rrn number): Enterococcus faecalis (6) and E. faecium (6), Bacillus subtilis (10), Staphylococcus aureus (9), Vibrio cholerae (4), Haemophilus influenzae (6) and Escherichia coli (7). It was found that some spacer sequence blocks were highly conserved between operons of a genome, whereas the presence of others was variable. When these variations were analysed using the program PLATO and partial likelihood phylogenies determined by DNAml for each operon set, three regions showed significant (Z>3.3) spatial variation [Region I was 78-184 nt long (2.1<Z<49.4), Region II was 10-60 nt long (3.7<Z<23)] and Region III was 6 nt long (3.4<Z>4.4) possibly due to recombination or selection. Within Region I, there was sequence block variation in all operon sets [some operons contained tRNA genes (tRNAala, tRNAile or tRNAglu), whereas others had sequence blocks such as VS2 (S. aureus) or rsl (E. coli)]. Q Analysis of the ISR sequence from E. faecalis and E. faecium showed that there was more interspecies than intraspecies variation (both in DNA sequence and in the presence or absence of blocks). Dot matrix analysis of the sequence blocks in the nine rrn ISRs from S. aureus showed that there was significant homology between VS2 and VS5/VS6. Furthermore, repeat motifs with only A or T were present in higher copy numbers in VS5/VS6 than in VS2. Since these sequence blocks (VS2 and VS5-VS6) are related, intragenic evolution resulting in AT expansion may have occurred between these two regions. A model is proposed that postulates a role for recombination and AT-expansion in intra-genomic ISR variations. This process may represent a general mechanism of concerted evolution for bacterial ISR rearrangements.
TI  - Antibacterial diterpenoid acids from Azorella compacta.
AB  - The two novel diterpenoid acids mulin-12,14-dien-11-on-20-oic acid (1) and mulin-12-ene-11,14-dion-20-oic acid (2) have been isolated from Azorella compacta. Their structures have been elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR methods. In contrast to the closely related known mulinolic acid (3) and its dehydration product (4) these new natural products have been shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Septic shock after liver transplantation for Caroli's disease: clinical improvement after treatment with C1-esterase inhibitor.
AB  - The extent of complement and contact activation is related to outcome in sepsis.  A low functional index of their main blocker C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) is considered as a relative deficiency of C1-INH and might contribute to the development of fatal complications in the intensive care unit. The first results of therapeutic intervention with C1-INH concentrate in septic shock are promising. We report on our experience of C1-INH concentrate administration in a young woman with Caroli's disease as ultimate rescue therapy for septic shock with capillary leakage syndrome after combined liver and kidney transplantation. No focus of infection was detectable and thus surgical intervention was not indicated. Antibiotic therapy at that time included vancomycin, tobramycin, meropenem and fluconazol. Hemodynamic stabilization occurred within hours after administration of C1-INH concentrate. Simultaneously a reduction in vasopressor medication was possible and negative fluid balance was achieved.
TI  - Surveillance of antibiotic resistance in ICUs in southeastern Sweden. ICU Study Group of the South East of Sweden.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A study was designed to assess a computer-based program for continuous registration of antibiotic resistance, statistics concerning severity of illness, and consumption of antibacterial drugs. METHODS: The frequency of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in eight ICUs in southeastern Sweden was investigated yearly from 1995 through 1997. The antibiotic consumption in the ICUs was registered as defined daily doses (DDD) and compared to severity of illness (APACHE-II scores). RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increase in ampicillin resistance among Enterococcus spp. between 1996 and 1997, which was due to a shift from Enterococcus faecalis to Enterococcus faecium. A high prevalence of resistance among coagulase-negative staphylococci to oxacillin (approximately 70%), ciprofloxacin (approximately 50%), fucidic acid (approximately 50%) and netilmicin (approximately 30%) was seen in all ICUs during the whole study period. There was a statistically significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance among Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. The resistance among Enterobacter spp. to cefotaxime decreased but this change was not statistically significant. Efforts were made to avoid betalactam antibiotics, except carbapenems, for treatment of infections caused by Enterobacter spp. and the consumption of cephalosporins decreased whereas the consumption of carbapenems increased. The total antibiotic consumption decreased by 2.5% during the study period. There was no correlation between APACHE II scores and antibiotic consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Each ICU within a hospital ought to have a program for "on-line" antibiotic resistance surveillance of drugs used in that unit so that changes in empirical treatment can be made when there is an increase in antibiotic-resistant isolates within that unit.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in key bloodstream bacterial isolates: electronic surveillance with the Surveillance Network Database--USA.
AB  - To assess the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens among the most common bloodstream isolates, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility data from The Surveillance Network Database-USA, an electronic surveillance system that collects data from 118 clinical microbiology laboratories across the United States. Between 1995 and 1997, resistance to both vancomycin and ampicillin was much more prevalent among Enterococcus faecium than Enterococcus faecalis, suggesting the need for laboratories to identify to species. When staphylococcal isolates were examined for reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration = 4 microg/mL), the frequency was highest in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. We also learned that nonsusceptibility to ceftazidime in Klebsiella pneumoniae was more prevalent among isolates from blood (12.7%) than among isolates from urine (7.1%) or respiratory sources (9.3%). Although antimicrobial resistance is low overall for isolates of Escherichia coli from blood, the prevalence of cefoxitin resistance among ceftazidime-resistant strains (61.9%) suggests the action of mechanisms other than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.
TI  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections in United States hospitals: a three-year analysis.
AB  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality. In this study, concurrent surveillance for nosocomial bloodstream infections at 49 hospitals over a 3-year period detected >10,000 infections. Gram-positive organisms accounted for 64% of cases, gram-negative organisms accounted for 27%, and 8% were caused by fungi. The most common organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (32%), Staphylococcus aureus (16%), and enterococci (11%). Enterobacter, Serratia, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Candida were more likely to cause infections in patients in critical care units. In patients with neutropenia, viridans streptococci were significantly more common. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common pathogens on all clinical services except obstetrics, where Escherichia coli was most common. Methicillin resistance was detected in 29% of S. aureus isolates and 80% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Vancomycin resistance in enterococci was species-dependent--3% of Enterococcus faecalis strains and 50% of Enterococcus faecium isolates displayed resistance. These data may allow clinicians to better target empirical therapy for hospital-acquired cases of bacteremia.
TI  - Verifying apple cider plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point programs: choice of indicator bacteria and testing methods.
AB  - The objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the survival of coliforms, Escherichia coli, and enterococci in refrigerated apple cider; (ii) to develop simple and inexpensive presumptive methods for detection of these bacteria; (iii) to perform a field survey to determine the prevalence of these bacteria on apples and in apple cider; and (iv) based on our results, to recommend the most useful of these three indicator groups for use in verifying apple cider processing plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) programs. Eight of 10 coliform strains (5 E. coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, and 2 Klebsiella spp.) inoculated into preservative-free apple cider (pH 3.4, 13.3(o) Brix) survived well at 4 degrees C for 6 days (< or = 3.0 log10 CFU/ml decrease). Of 21 enterococci strains (Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and E. durans), only 2 E. durans and 3 E. faecium strains survived well. Simple broth-based colorimetric methods were developed that detected the presence of approximately 10 cells of coliforms or enterococci. In three field studies, samples of unwashed apples (drops and picked), washed apples, and freshly pressed cider were presumptively analyzed for total coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci using qualitative and/or quantitative methods. Drop apples were more likely than picked apples to be contaminated with E. coli (26.7% vs. 0%) and enterococci (20% vs. 0%). Washing had little effect on coliform populations and in one field study was associated with increased numbers. Total coliform populations in cider ranged from < 1 CFU/ml to > 738 most probable number/ml, depending on the enumeration method used and the sample origin. E. coli was not recovered from washed apples or cider, but enterococci were present on 13% of washed apple samples. The qualitative coliform method successfully detected these bacteria on apples and in cider. Based on its exclusively fecal origin, good survival in apple cider, and association with drop apples, we conclude that E. coli is the most useful organism for verifying apple cider sanitation and HACCP programs.
TI  - Prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance in 20 European university hospitals participating in the European SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the current prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance in Europe and compare the in vitro activity of amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin against 7057 bacterial isolates from 20 university hospitals participating in the European SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme. Amikacin exhibited better in vitro activity than tobramycin and gentamicin against most gram-negative bacilli in Europe. The resistance levels were 0.4-3% for amikacin, 2-13.1% for gentamicin, and 2.5-15.3% for tobramycin among different members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, 75% were susceptible to gentamicin. Only 21% of all enterococcal strains tested were fully susceptible to gentamicin. Although intra-country variations in the prevalence of resistance phenotypes in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as in staphylococci and enterococci did occur, aminoglycoside resistance rates were generally higher in Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece, France, the UK, and Poland than in Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Compared with the 1987-88 data of the European Study Group on Antibiotic Resistance, gentamicin resistance has increased up to 5% in some gram-negative bacterial species. Furthermore, a greater than 10% increase in resistance to gentamicin has been seen in Staphylococcus aureus during the last decade. The reason for this observation is unclear, although changes in antibiotic prescribing patterns that result in increased selective pressure from gentamicin may have contributed to these increased rates of aminoglycoside resistance.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray characterization of VanA from Enterococcus  faecium BM4147: towards the molecular basis of bacterial resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin.
AB  - A recombinant form of Enterococcus facieum BM4147 D-alanine-D-lactate ligase (VanA) has been prepared and crystallized. VanA was found to crystallize only in the presence of a phosphinate inhibitor analogue of D-alanine-D-alanine. The crystals grow in 40-45% ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M 3-(N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acid pH 6.0 and reach dimensions of 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.1 mm. The crystals diffract to at least 2.5 A and are in the centred orthorhombic space group C222(1), with unit-cell dimensions a = 123.2, b = 225.4, c = 72.4 A.
TI  - Microbial antagonism: a neglected avenue of natural products research.
AB  - Competition amongst microbes for space and nutrients in the marine environment is a powerful selective force which has led to the evolution of a variety of effective strategies for colonising and growing on surfaces. We are particularly interested in the chemical ecology of marine epibiotic bacteria which live on the surfaces of marine algae or invertebrates. Over 400 strains of surface-associated bacteria from various species of seaweed and invertebrate from Scottish coastal waters were isolated and 35% of them shown to produce antimicrobial compounds. This is a much higher proportion than free living marine isolates or soil bacteria. In addition, many strains which did not normally produce antibiotics could be induced to do so by exposing them to small amounts of live cells, supernatants from other bacterial cultures or other chemicals. Thus the number of strains able to produce antibiotics appears to be much higher than previously thought. Induction of antibiotic production was elicited by other marine epibionts and also by terrestrial human pathogens such as Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An understanding of this type of chemical induction and the factors regulating non-constitutive secretion of antimicrobial compounds will allow more effective strategies for searching for new chemotherapeutic antibiotics to be designed.
TI  - Continuous assay for VanX, the D-alanyl-D-alanine dipeptidase required for high-level vancomycin resistance.
AB  - The reaction of L-alanine-p-nitroanilide with VanX was studied in an effort to develop a continuous assay for VanX activity for future kinetic and inhibition studies. VanX, containing Zn(II), Co(II), Fe(II), or Ni(II), catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-alanine-p-nitroanilide producing L-alanine and p-nitroaniline as products; the formation of the latter product (epsilon(404nm) = 10, 700 M(-1) cm(-1)) can be continuously monitored using UV-VIS spectrophotometry. Zn(II)-, Co(II)-, Fe(II)-, and Ni(II)-containing VanX exhibit saturation kinetics when L-alanine-p-nitroanilide is used as the substrate with K(m) and k(cat) values ranging from 300 to 700 microM and 0.028 to 0.080 s(-1), respectively. Inhibition studies using O-[(1S)-aminoethylhydroxyphosphinyl]-D-lactic acid as the inhibitor and L-alanine-p-nitroanilide as the substrate yielded a K(i) of 400 +/- 8 microM at pH 7.0. These studies reveal a continuous assay of VanX activity which could be used to further study the kinetic mechanism of VanX and to allow for the development of high-throughput screening for inhibitors of VanX.
TI  - Molecular mechanism of VanHst, an alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase required for glycopeptide antibiotic resistance from a glycopeptide producing organism.
AB  - The vancomycin resistance enzyme VanH is an alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase that stereospecifically reduces pyruvate to D-lactate, which is required for the synthesis of the depsipeptide D-alanine-D-lactate. This compound then forms an integral part of the bacterial cell wall replacing the vancomycin target dipeptide D-alanine-D-alanine, thus the presence of VanH is essential for glycopeptide resistance. In this work, the VanH homologue from the glycopeptide antibiotic producing organism Streptomyces toyocaensis NRRL 15009, VanHst, has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified, and its substrate specificity and mechanism were probed by steady-state kinetic methods and site-directed mutagenesis. The enzyme is highly efficient at pyruvate reduction with kcat/Km = 1.3 x 10(5) M-1 s-1 and has a more restricted alpha-ketoacid substrate specificity than VanH from vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE). Conversely, VanHst shows no preference between NADH and NADPH while VanH from VRE prefers NADPH. The kinetic mechanism for VanHst was determined using product and dead-end inhibitors to be ordered BiBi with NADH binding first followed by pyruvate and products leaving in the order D-lactate, NAD+. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that Arg237 plays a role in pyruvate binding and catalysis and that His298 is a candidate for an active-site proton donor. Glu266, which has been suggested to modulate the pKa of the catalytic His in other D-lactate dehydrogenases, was found to fulfill a similar role in VanHst, lowering a pKa value of kcat/Km nearly 2 units. These results now provide the framework for additional structure and inhibitor design work on the VanH family of antibiotic resistance enzymes.
TI  - Characterization of the vanD glycopeptide resistance gene cluster from Enterococcus faecium BM4339.
AB  - VanD-type resistance to glycopeptides in Enterococcus faecium BM4339 is due to constitutive synthesis of D-alanyl-D-lactate-terminating peptidoglycan precursors (B. Perichon, P. Reynolds, and P. Courvalin, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 41:2016-2018, 1997). The sequence of a 5,780-bp fragment was determined and revealed six open reading frames. The 3' distal part encoded the VanHD dehydrogenase, the VanD ligase, and the VanXD DD-dipeptidase, which were highly similar to the corresponding proteins in VanA and VanB types of resistance. The deduced VanYD protein was homologous to penicillin-binding proteins that display DD-carboxypeptidase activity. The 5' end coded for the putative VanRD-VanSD two-component regulatory system. Due to a frameshift mutation in the chromosomal ddl gene, BM4339 produced an impaired D-alanine:D-alanine ligase. However, since expression of the resistance genes is constitutive, growth of E. faecium BM4339 was not dependent on the presence of glycopeptides in the culture medium.
TI  - The carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase of Pyrococcus furiosus is enzymologically and  structurally a carbamate kinase.
AB  - The hyperthermophiles Pyrococcus furiosus and Pyrococcus abyssi make pyrimidines  and arginine from carbamoyl phosphate (CP) synthesized by an enzyme that differs from other carbamoyl-phosphate synthetases and that resembles carbamate kinase (CK) in polypeptide mass, amino acid sequence, and oligomeric organization. This enzyme was reported to use ammonia, bicarbonate, and two ATP molecules as carbamoyl-phosphate synthetases to make CP and to exhibit bicarbonatedependent ATPase activity. We have reexamined these findings using the enzyme of P. furiosus expressed in Escherichia coli from the corresponding gene cloned in a plasmid. We show that the enzyme uses chemically made carbamate rather than ammonia and bicarbonate and catalyzes a reaction with the stoichiometry and equilibrium that are typical for CK. Furthermore, the enzyme catalyzes actively full reversion of the CK reaction and exhibits little bicarbonate-dependent ATPase. In addition, it cross-reacts with antibodies raised against CK from Enterococcus faecium, and its three-dimensional structure, judged by x-ray crystallography of enzyme crystals, is very similar to that of CK. Thus, the enzyme is, in all respects other than its function in vivo, a CK. Because in other organisms the function of CK is to make ATP from ADP and CP derived from arginine catabolism, this is the first example of using CK for making rather than using CP. The reasons for this use and the adaptation of the enzyme to this new function are discussed.
TI  - Characterization and heterologous expression of the genes encoding enterocin a production, immunity, and regulation in Enterococcus faecium DPC1146.
AB  - Enterocin A is a small, heat-stable, antilisterial bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium DPC1146. The sequence of a 10, 879-bp chromosomal region containing at least 12 open reading frames (ORFs), 7 of which are predicted to play a role in enterocin biosynthesis, is presented. The genes entA, entI, and entF encode the enterocin A prepeptide, the putative immunity protein, and the induction factor prepeptide, respectively. The deduced proteins EntK and EntR resemble the histidine kinase and response regulator proteins of two-component signal transducing systems of the AgrC-AgrA type. The predicted proteins EntT and EntD are homologous to ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters and accessory factors, respectively, of several other bacteriocin systems and to proteins implicated in the signal-sequence-independent export of Escherichia coli hemolysin A. Immediately downstream of the entT and entD genes are two ORFs, the product of one of which, ORF4, is very similar to the product of the yteI gene of Bacillus subtilis and to E. coli protease IV, a signal peptide peptidase known to be involved in outer membrane lipoprotein export. Another potential bacteriocin is encoded in the opposite direction to the other genes in the enterocin cluster. This putative bacteriocin-like peptide is similar to LafX, one of the components of the lactacin F complex. A deletion which included one of two direct repeats upstream of the entA gene abolished enterocin A activity, immunity, and ability to induce bacteriocin production. Transposon insertion upstream of the entF gene also had the same effect, but this mutant could be complemented by exogenously supplied induction factor. The putative EntI peptide was shown to be involved in the immunity to enterocin A. Cloning of a 10.5-kb amplicon comprising all predicted ORFs and regulatory regions resulted in heterologous production of enterocin A and induction factor in Enterococcus faecalis, while a four-gene construct (entAITD) under the control of a constitutive promoter resulted in heterologous enterocin A production in both E. faecalis and Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - A new resistance gene, linB, conferring resistance to lincosamides by nucleotidylation in Enterococcus faecium HM1025.
AB  - Resistance to lincomycin and clindamycin in the clinical isolate Enterococcus faecium HM1025 is due to a ribosomal methylase encoded by an ermAM-like gene and the plasmid-mediated inactivation of these antibiotics. We have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of the gene responsible for the inactivation of lincosamides, linB. This gene encodes a 267-amino-acid lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase. The enzyme catalyzes 3(5'-adenylation) (the adenylation of the hydroxyl group in position 3 of the molecules) of lincomycin and clindamycin. Expression of linB was observed in both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme did not display any significant homology with staphylococcal nucleotidyltransferases encoded by linA and linA' genes. Sequences homologous to linB were found in 14 other clinical isolates of E. faecium, indicating the spread of the resistance trait in this species.
TI  - An in-vitro evaluation of the activity of chlorine against environmental and nosocomial isolates of Aeromonas hydrophila.
AB  - A chlorine preparation was tested against 34 strains of Aeromonas hydrophila isolated from a hospital water facility and patients with nosocomial infections in a French medical school hospital. In-vitro bactericidal activity was determined by a macro- and micromethod, using specific interfering substances over a range of dilutions and temperatures, after 1 and 5 minute exposure times. A 10(5)-fold reduction in the challenge inoculum was taken as the criterion of efficacy. Results obtained by both methods agreed and indicated a median minimal bacterial concentration of chlorine of from 0.95 ppm without interfering substances to 297 ppm in the presence of interfering substances. These data indicate that Aeromonas hydrophila isolates are relatively resistant to chlorine, thus precluding the use of chlorine alone as a disinfectant for water supplies contaminated with Aeromonas spp.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the semisynthetic compound, hexahydrocolupulone.
AB  - In this study we demonstrate that hexahydrocolupulone (HHC) more effectively inhibits the growth in vitro of Gram-positive organisms than Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Escherichia coli. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were inhibited by HHC at concentrations < or = 4.06 mg/L. Growth inhibition profiles varied according to the microorganism evaluated (static for S. aureus and bactericidal for Bacillus subtilis).
TI  - In vivo characterization of the type A and B vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) VanRS two-component systems in Escherichia coli: a nonpathogenic model for studying the VRE signal transduction pathways.
AB  - Escherichia coli reporter strains modeling the high-level type A and B vancomycin resistances of Enterococcus faecium BM4147 and Ent. faecalis have been developed to study the respective VanR-VanS two-component regulatory systems. PvanH-, PvanRa-, PvanY-, and PvanRb-lacZ fusions report on expression from the vancomycin-resistant enterococci promoters of the type A vanRSHAXYZ and type B vanRSYWHBX gene clusters. These strains also express from single-copy chromosomal genes vanRa, vanRb, or vanRSb behind their respective promoter (PvanRa or PvanRb) or vanSa or vanSb behind the rhamnose-inducible PrhaB. Results show that activation (phosphorylation) of the response regulator VanRa by its sensor kinase VanSa leads to transcriptional activation of both PvanH and PvanRa. Additionally, VanRb activates its cognate promoters PvanY and PvanRb, although this occurs only in the absence of VanSb and presumably is caused by VanRb phosphorylation by an unidentified endogenous E. coli kinase. Thus, VanSb interferes with activation of VanRb, probably by acting as a phospho-VanRb phosphatase. Although both VanRa and VanRb activate their cognate promoters, neither activates the heterologous PvanR, PvanH, or PvanY, arguing against the interchangeability of type A and B two-component regulatory switches in vancomycin-resistant enterococci. VanRa also is activated by the nonpartner kinase PhoR. Because this occurs in the absence of its inducing signal (Pi limitation), PhoR autophosphorylation apparently is regulated in vivo. Furthermore, the activation of VanRa caused by cross talk from PhoR in the absence of a signal allows distinction of cross talk from crossregulation as the latter, but not the former, responds to environmental cues.
TI  - Growth of a human intestinal Desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  - Ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (SRB) Desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). Reproducible defined bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis, Bif. pseudolongum, Bif. infantis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bact. vulgatus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. butyricum, Cl. innocuum, Cl. bifermentans. Lactobacillus and Cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. Inclusion of Des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly Bif. longum, Cl. perfringens and Bif. pseudolongum. The two bacteroides species were unaffected by Des. desulfuricans, while numbers of Cl. butyricum increased. Extensive wall growth developed in the SRB culture, consisting mainly of Des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), Bact. thetaiotaomicron and Bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, Cl. perfringens and Bif. longum. Wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures. Chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (C15) and bifidobacterial (C18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-C15:0, C16:0, i-C17:1) could be identified. The metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the SRB chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. High concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were detected in the SRB chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. Saccharolytic organisms growing in the SRB fermenter utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. Profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the SRB culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.
TI  - Resistance to antimicrobial agents used for animal therapy in pathogenic-, zoonotic- and indicator bacteria isolated from different food animals in Denmark: a baseline study for the Danish Integrated Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring Programme (DANMAP).
AB  - This study describes the establishment and first results of a continuous surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria isolated from pigs, cattle and broilers in Denmark. The three categories of bacteria tested were: 1) indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (Campylobacter coli/jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus hyicus, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). A total of 3304 bacterial isolates collected from October 1995 through December 1996 were tested for susceptibility to all major classes of antimicrobial agents used for therapy in Denmark. Bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. Acquired resistance to all antimicrobials was found. The occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. In general, resistance was observed more frequently among isolates from pigs than from cattle and broilers. The association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed, as is the occurrence of resistance in other countries. The results of this study show the present level of resistance to antimicrobial agents among a number of bacterial species isolated from food animals in Denmark. Thus, the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies has been established, enabling the determination of trends over time.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from food animals to antimicrobial growth promoters and related therapeutic agents in Denmark.
AB  - This study was conducted to describe the occurrence of acquired resistance to antimicrobials used for growth promotion among bacteria isolated from swine, cattle and poultry in Denmark. Resistance to structurally related therapeutic agents was also examined. Three categories of bacteria were tested: 1) indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus hyicus, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). All antimicrobials used as growth promoters in Denmark and some structurally related therapeutic agents (in brackets) were included: Avilamycin, avoparcin (vancomycin), bacitracin, carbadox, flavomycin, monensin, olaquindox, salinomycin, spiramycin (erythromycin, lincomycin), tylosin (erythromycin, lincomycin), and virginiamycin (pristinamycin). Bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. Breakpoints for growth promoters were established by population distribution of the bacteria tested. A total of 2,372 bacterial isolates collected during October 1995 to September 1996 were included in the study. Acquired resistance to all currently used growth promoting antimicrobials was found. A frequent occurrence of resistance were observed to avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavomycin, spiramycin, tylosin and virginiamycin, whereas resistance to carbadox, monensin, olaquindox and salinomycin was less frequent. The occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. The highest levels of resistance was observed among enterococci, whereas less resistance was observed among zoonotic bacteria and bacteria pathogenic to animals. The association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed. The results show the present level of resistance to growth promoters in bacteria from food animals in Denmark. They will form the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies, thereby enabling the determination of trends over time.
TI  - The effect of pH on the inhibition of bacterial growth by physiological concentrations of butyric acid: implications for neonates fed on suckled milk.
AB  - Butyric acid is released from milk by pre-intestinal lipases during suckling. It  is also known to inhibit bacterial growth. To investigate whether butyric acid may be a significant factor in controlling bacterial growth in the stomach of pre-weaned animals, the ability of butyric acid to inhibit growth of selected bacteria was tested over physiological ranges of pH and butyric acid concentrations. Six enteric and environmental strains of bacteria were used: two strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus casseliflavus. At pH 4.5 and 5.0, the growth of all organisms was significantly inhibited in the presence of butyrate, and in some cases growth was completely arrested. At pH 6.0, butyric acid did not affect bacterial growth until the concentration reached 40 mM. The maximum concentration of butyric acid available in cow's milk after incubation with pre-gastric lipase is approximately 16 mM, which would be sufficient to prevent growth of the organisms tested at pH values occurring in the stomach. Therefore, butyric acid inhibition of bacterial growth may explain in part, the role of pre-intestinal lipases in young animals' natural defenses against bacteria in ingested food prior to weaning.
TI  - Favorable prognosis of purulent meningitis in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - We prospectively reviewed all cases of purulent meningitis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected patients > 14 years old that occurred at the Hospital General Vall d'Hebron (Barcelona) during the period 1 January 1985 through 31 March 1997. There were 12 episodes of purulent meningitis in nine of 2,150 HIV-1-infected patients. The annual rate of purulent meningitis was 0.465 cases per 1,000 patients, a rate that is 150 times higher than that for the general population. During 10 episodes, CD4+ lymphocyte counts were < 200/mm3. The etiologic organism was Streptococcus pneumoniae in nine episodes (seven episodes occurred in four splenectomized patients), and Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Enterococcus faecium each caused one episode. Clinical features and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities were similar to those observed among patients without HIV-1 infection. All patients had bacteremia. The overall mortality was 8.3%. We conclude that purulent meningitis, particularly pneumococcal meningitis, is more frequent among HIV-1-infected patients than in the general population. The prognosis for HIV-1-infected patients is better than for HIV-1-negative patients.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with quinolones and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 Gram-negative and 498 Gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. The activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. Trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, group G streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. The reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. The commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. There was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing Enterobacter agglomerans and E. cloacae, where the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher MIC90 value.
TI  - A new high-level gentamicin resistance gene, aph(2'')-Id, in Enterococcus spp.
AB  - Enterococcus casseliflavus UC73 is a clinical blood isolate with high-level resistance to gentamicin. DNA preparations from UC73 failed to hybridize with intragenic probes for aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia and aph(2'')-Ic. A 4-kb fragment from UC73 was cloned and found to confer resistance to gentamicin in Escherichia coli DH5alpha transformants. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of a 906-bp open reading frame whose deduced amino acid sequence had a region with homology to the aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme APH(2'')-Ic and to the C-terminal domain of the bifunctional enzyme AAC(6')-APH(2''). The gene is designated aph(2'')-Id, and its observed phosphotransferase activity is designated APH(2'')-Id. A PCR-generated intragenic probe hybridized to the genomic DNA from 17 of 118 enterococcal clinical isolates (108 with high-level gentamicin resistance) from five hospitals. All 17 were vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates, and pulsed-field typing revealed three distinct clones. The combination of ampicillin plus either amikacin or neomycin exhibited synergistic killing against E. casseliflavus UC73. Screening and interpretation of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci may need to be modified to include detection of APH(2'')-Id.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid DNA from Escherichia coli to enterococci: a method to make insertion mutations.
AB  - Shuttle vector pAT18 was transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli S17-1 to Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF and Enterococcus faecium SE34. Transfer was mediated by the transfer functions of plasmid RK2 in E. coli S17-1 and the origin of conjugal transfer (oriT) located on pAT18. The oriT sequence was then inserted into two plasmids to generate vectors pTEX5235 and pTEX5236. These two vectors cannot replicate in gram-positive bacteria and can be used to make insertion mutants in gram-positive bacteria. An internal sequence from an autolysin gene of E. faecalis OG1RF was cloned into pTEX5235 and transferred by conjugation from E. coli S17-1 to E. faecalis OG1RF. The plasmid was found to integrate into the chromosome of OG1RF by a single crossover event, resulting in a disrupted autolysin gene. A cosmid carrying the pyrimidine gene cluster from E. faecalis, with a transposon insertion in pyrC, was also transferred from E. coli S17-1 to E. faecalis OG1RF. After selection for the transposon, it was found to have recombined into the recipient chromosome by a double crossover between the cosmid and the chromosome of OG1RF. This resulted in a pyrC knockout mutant showing an auxotrophic phenotype.
TI  - Carbamate kinase from Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium--cloning of  the genes, studies on the enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli, and sequence similarity with N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase.
AB  - Carbamate kinase (CK) catalyzes the reversible reaction NH2COO- + ATP <--> NHCOOPO3(2-) + ADP, serving to synthesize ATP from carbamoyl phosphate in those microorganisms that derive energy from anaerobic arginine degradation via the arginine dihydrolase pathway. We report here the cloning and sequencing of the CK gene from Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium and we demonstrate that the amino acid sequence of CK is identical in the two species. The enzyme, expressed and isolated from Escherichia coli using simple purification procedures, was used to generate crystals suitable for X-ray studies and to investigate the utilization by CK of bicarbonate and other carbamate analogs. CK had a bicarbonate-dependent ATPase activity and, therefore, is able to synthesize carboxyphosphate, an unstable compound that is an intermediate in the reactions catalyzed by carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CPS) and by biotin carboxylase. Other functional similarities with CPS include the utilization of acetate by CK with a similarly high Km and the similar Km values of CK for carbamate and of CPS for bicarbonate. Enterococcal CK was inhibited by adenosine(5')pentaphospho(5')adenosine (Ap5A) and Ap6A and, less powerfully, by Ap4A, whereas Ap3A is essentially non-inhibitory. Thus, inhibition by Ap5A seems not to be a valid criterion to differentiate between CK and CPS, for the two enzymes can be inhibited by Ap5A. All these results support the relatedness of CK and CPS. Finally, we used limited proteolysis: (a) to localize the epitopes for monoclonal antibodies obtained against CK; (b) to demonstrate the importance of the C-terminus for enzyme activity; and (c) to show that Arg158 is highly exposed and may be essential for activity. Comparison of the sequence of CK with known protein sequences demonstrates considerable similarity of CK with bacterial N-acetylglutamate kinases, strongly suggesting that these two enzymes may share a similar structure and the same catalytic mechanism.
TI  - Inhibition effect of enterocin CCM 4231 in the rumen fluid environment.
AB  - Enterocin CCM 4231 is a bacteriocin with a broad antimicrobial spectrum produced  by the ruminal strain Enterococcus faecium CCM 4231. Its inhibitory effect towards enterococci, Ent. faecium EF 26/42, staphylococci, Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85 and Escherichia coli, as well as towards Listeria monocytogenes OHIO strain, in the rumen fluid environment was studied during culture at 37 and 30 degrees C for 24 h and 20 days. Enterocin CCM 4231 was added to the samples at a concentration of 3200 AU ml-1. The best inhibitory effect was noted against enterococci at both cultivation temperatures. A decrease in total cell count from 10(8) cfu ml-1/or 10(4) cfu ml-1 and from 10(5) cfu ml-1 to 10(1) cfu ml-1 was detected. Addition of enterocin to the rumen fluid also inhibited staphylococci (from 10(5) cfu ml-1 to 10(4) cfu ml-1 and/or 10(3) cfu ml-1). Gram-negative E. coli cells were inhibited at both cultivation temperatures (decrease from 10(6) cfu ml-1 to 10(1) cfu ml-1 at 37 degrees C, and from 10(7) cfu ml-1 to 10(5) cfu ml-1 at 30 degrees C). Enterococcus faecium EF 26/42 and Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85, the strains growing in the rumen fluid, were the most sensitive to the addition of enterocin during the first 24 h of fermentation (decrease from 10(10) cfu ml-1 and 10(8) cfu ml-1 to 10(6) cfu ml-1 and 10(4) cfu ml-1). An antilisterial effect of the bacteriocin was also confirmed. Further application of bacteriocin in ruminal ecology was indicated.
TI  - Transcriptional regulation of the Enterococcus faecium BM4147 vancomycin resistance gene cluster by the VanS-VanR two-component regulatory system in Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - An Escherichia coli K-12 model system was developed for studying the VanS-VanR two-component regulatory system required for high-level inducible vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium BM4147. Our model system is based on the use of reporter strains with lacZ transcriptional and translational fusions to the PvanR or PvanH promoter of the vanRSHAX gene cluster. These strains also express vanR and vanS behind the native PvanR promoter, the arabinose-inducible ParaB promoter, or the rhamnose-inducible PrhaB promoter. Our reporter strains have the respective fusions stably recombined onto the chromosome in single copy, thereby avoiding aberrant regulatory effects that may occur with plasmid-bearing strains. They were constructed by using allele replacement methods or a conditionally replicative attP plasmid. Using these reporter strains, we demonstrated that (i) the response regulator VanR activates PvanH, but not PvanR, expression upon activation (phosphorylation) by the partner kinase VanS, the noncognate kinase PhoR, or acetyl phosphate, indicating that phospho-VanR (P-VanR) is a transcriptional activator; (ii) VanS interferes with activation of VanR by PhoR or acetyl phosphate, indicating that VanS also acts as a P-VanR phosphatase; and (iii) the conserved, phosphate-accepting histidine (H164) of VanS is required for activation (phosphorylation) of VanR but not for deactivation (dephosphorylation) of P-VanR. Similar reporter strains may be useful in new studies on these and other interactions of the VanS-VanR system (and other systems), screening for inhibitors of these interactions, and deciphering the molecular logic of the signal(s) responsible for activation of the VanS-VanR system in vivo. Advantages of using an E. coli model system for in vivo studies on VanS and VanR are also discussed.
TI  - Protegrin-1: a broad-spectrum, rapidly microbicidal peptide with in vivo activity.
AB  - Protegrin-1 (PG-1) is a cysteine-rich, 18-residue beta-sheet peptide isolated from porcine leukocytes with antimicrobial activity against a broad range of microorganisms. The MICs of PG-1 against representative gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria ranged from 0.12 to 2 microg/ml. At these levels, PG-1 was rapidly bactericidal in vitro, reducing the number of viable CFU of either methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa by more than three log units in less than 15 min. Resistance to PG-1 did not develop after 11 subculturings of P. aeruginosa or 18 subcultures of MRSA in Mueller-Hinton broth containing PG-1 at one-half the MIC. Under similar conditions of serial passage, the MICs of norfloxacin and gentamicin against P. aeruginosa increased 10 and 190 times, respectively. Similarly, the MIC of norfloxacin against MRSA increased 85 times. Immunocompetent mice inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with P. aeruginosa or S. aureus exhibited 93 to 100% mortality in the vehicle control group compared with 0 to 27% mortality in animals that received a single i.p. injection of PG-1 (0.5 mg/kg of body weight). Mice inoculated with S. aureus by intravenous (i.v.) injection and dosed 0 to 60 min later with a single i.v. injection of PG-1 (5 mg/kg) had a mortality of 7 to 33%, compared to a mortality of 73 to 93% in the vehicle controls. In leukopenic mice inoculated i.v. with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, mortality was 87% in the vehicle control group and 33% in animals that received a single i.v. injection of PG-1 (2.5 mg/kg). Taken together, these data indicate that PG-1 has potential for use as an antimicrobial agent in the treatment of local or systemic infections caused by clinically relevant pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of squalamine mimics.
AB  - We investigated the antimicrobial properties of compounds with structural features that were designed to mimic those of squalamine, an antibiotic isolated from the stomach of the dogfish shark. The mimics, like squalamine, are sterol-polyamine conjugates. Unlike squalamine, the mimics were simple to prepare, at high yield, from readily available starting materials. Several squalamine mimics showed activity against gram-negative rods, gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and fungi. Some had little or no hemolytic activity. The hydrophobicity of the sterol backbone and the length and the cationic charge of the side chains appeared to be critical determinants of activity. One of the squalamine mimics, SM-7, was bactericidal against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and S. aureus; its activity was decreased by divalent or monovalent cations and by bovine serum albumin. Subinhibitory concentrations of SM-7 markedly enhanced the antimicrobial activity of rifampin against gram-negative rods. These results suggest that the compounds may disrupt an outer membrane of gram-negative rods. Squalamine mimics are a new class of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. The antagonism of their activity by serum and albumin and their hemolytic properties may limit their use as systemic agents. The squalamine mimics, because of their potencies, broad spectra of antimicrobial activity, and potential for systemic toxicity, appear to be good candidates for development as topical antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - Survival of Acinetobacter baumannii on dry surfaces.
AB  - Acinetobacter spp. have frequently been reported to be the causative agents of hospital outbreaks. The circumstances of some outbreaks demonstrated the long survival of Acinetobacter in a dry, inanimate environment. In laboratory experiments, we compared the abilities of five Acinetobacter baumannii strains, three Acinetobacter sp. strains from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), one Escherichia coli ATCC strain, and one Enterococcus faecium ATCC strain to survive under dry conditions. Bacterial solutions of the 10 strains were inoculated onto four different material samples (ceramic, polyvinyl chloride, rubber, and stainless steel) and stored under defined conditions. We investigated the bacterial counts of the material samples immediately after inoculation, after drying, and after 4 h, 1 day, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of storage. A statistical model was used to distribute the 40 resulting curves among four types of survival curves. The type of survival curve was significantly associated with the bacterial strain but not with the material. The ability of the A. baumannii strains to survive under dry conditions varied greatly and correlated well with the source of the strain. Strains isolated from dry sources survived better than those isolated from wet sources. An outbreak strain that had caused hospital-acquired respiratory tract infections survived better than the strains from wet sources, but not as well as strains from dry sources. Resistance to dry conditions may promote the transmissibility of a strain, but it is not sufficient to make a strain an epidemic one. However, in the case of an outbreak, sources of Acinetobacter must be expected in the dry environment.
TI  - Study of the comparative activity of piperacillin/tazobactam with currently available antibiotics against 8206 aerobic isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the activity of piperacillin-tazobactam with piperacillin  and other parenterally administered antibiotics against aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci isolated from across Canada, and to determine the prevalence of resistance mediated by extended-spectrum cephalosporinases. METHODS: Sixty-one laboratories participated. Disk diffusion testing was performed in accordance with methods outlined by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Susceptibilities were performed on 8206 strains. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae with reduced susceptibilities to third-generation cephalosporins were screened for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). RESULTS: Piperacillin-tazobactam was active against 92% of the strains, piperacillin against 81% and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid against 88%. Few differences were observed in the relative susceptibility of strains from teaching or community hospitals, from different anatomic sites or from different regions of the country. Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli tested tended to be more susceptible to all the agents than was recently reported in a similar American study. Only 43% of Enterococcus faecium were susceptible to ampicillin and 42% to piperacillin piperacillin with and without tazobactam. Only two enterococcal strains were resistant to vancomycin, and 19 had intermediate zone sizes. Of the 10 strains of E coli and eight strains of K pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to extended spectrum cephalosporins, only one demonstrated typical ESBL activity. CONCLUSIONS: Canadian aerobic Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli remain highly susceptible to many currently available antibiotics. The findings confirm a broad spectrum of activity of piperacillin-tazobactam and indicate that the pattern of susceptibility is quite uniform from different body sites, in both teaching and community hospitals, and across the country.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheter.
AB  - The main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. Thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. Removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. The residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. Minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. These results support the ongoing efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.
TI  - In-vitro microbiological assessment of a new penem, Men 10700.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of Men 10700, a novel penem, has been compared with that of ritipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, cefotaxime and co-amoxiclav against 539 strains taken from 17 genera. Men 10700 was most active against staphylococci and streptococci (MIC90 < 0.5 mg/L), slightly less active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Moraxella catarrhalis and peptostreptococci (MIC90 0.5-2 mg/L), moderately active against Enterococcus faecalis, members of the tribe Proteae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter spp., clostridia and Bacteroides spp. (MIC90 4-16 mg/L), and inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Enterococcus faecium. Its antibacterial spectrum is thus slightly less broad than that of imipenem, but it compares favourably with an oral third-generation cephalosporin. Men 10700 was more active than ritipenem against many species, especially Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp.
TI  - Overexpression and characterization of the chromosomal aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyltransferase from Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - The chromosomal gene aac(6')-Ii, encoding an aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyltransferase in Enterococcus faecium, renders this organism resistant to moderate levels of many aminoglycoside antibiotics. The ubiquitous presence of aac(6')-Ii in E. faecium complicates the selection of antibiotics for treatment of infections caused by this organism. In view of the importance of this enzyme, we have initiated studies to gain an understanding of its molecular mechanism of acetyl transfer. The AAC(6')-Ii enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified in a simple three-step procedure which yields 55 mg of pure dimeric protein per liter of cell culture. Steady-state kinetic analyses revealed a broad substrate specificity and demonstrated that acetylation occurs exclusively at position N-6'. k(cat)/Km values were on the order of 10(4) M(-1) s(-1), which is relatively low compared to other aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. In addition, MIC values were positively correlated with k(cat), the rate when the enzyme is saturated with the aminoglycoside substrate, and not with k(cat)/Km, the rate at low aminoglycoside (sub-Km) concentrations. These results describe an enzyme which is not optimally evolved for aminoglycoside inactivation and suggest that this chromosomally encoded enzyme may have an alternate physiological function.
TI  - A novel gentamicin resistance gene in Enterococcus.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum SF9117 is a veterinary isolate for which the MIC of gentamicin is 256 micrograms/ml. Time-kill studies with a combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin failed to show synergism against SF9117. A probe representing aac(6')-aph(2") did not hybridize to DNA from SF9117. A 3.2-kb fragment from plasmid pYN134 of SF9117 was cloned and conferred resistance to gentamicin in Escherichia coli DH5 alpha. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of a 918-bp open reading frame whose deduced amino acid sequence had a region with homology to the C-terminal domain of the bifunctional enzyme AAC(6')-APH(2"). The gene is designated aph(2")-Ic, and its observed phosphotransferase activity is provisionally designated APH(2")-Ic. An intragenic probe hybridized to the genomic DNA from an Enterococcus faecium isolate from the peritoneal fluid of one patient and to the plasmid DNA of an Enterococcus faecalis isolate from the blood of another patient. An enterococcal isolate containing this novel resistance gene might not be readily detected in clinical laboratories that use gentamicin at 500 or 2,000 micrograms/ml for screening for high-level resistance.
TI  - Specific species of intestinal bacteria influence the induction of aberrant crypt foci by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in rats.
AB  - To shed light on the association of intestinal microflora with the development of colon cancer, we studied the modifying effects of intestinal microflora on the occurrence of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in germfree (GF), gnotobiotic (GB) and conventionalized (Cvd) rats. In the first part of this study, 10 week old germfree Fischer-344 rats were randomly assigned to three groups and two groups of rats were orally inoculated with mixtures of pure culture of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, and several strains of Bacteroides and Clostridium species (GB), or feces from conventional rats (Cvd). Inoculated rats were given two weekly i.p. injections of DMH (20 mg/kg body wt) at 13 and 14 weeks of age. Rats were sacrificed 11 or 34 weeks after the last DMH injection for ACF scoring. The total number of ACF, ACF with four or more crypts/focus, and mean number of aberrant crypts per focus (crypt multiplicity) in GB rats sacrificed at week 34 were 168% (P < 0.001), 442% (P < 0.001) and 138% (P < 0.001) of those in GF rats, respectively. On the other hand, the same values in Cvd rats were 42% (P < 0.001), 147% (P = 0.246) and 159% (P < 0.001) of those in GF rats, respectively. Similar results were observed in rats that were sacrificed at week 11. In the second part of this study, the effect of colonization of Bifidobacterium breve on the ACF profiles was examined in GB rats. The number of ACF with four or more crypts/focus and crypt multiplicity in GB plus B. breve rats at week 11 were significantly lower than those of GB rats (P < 0.01, and P < 0.05, respectively), although the former was not statistically significant at week 34. These findings suggest that some intestinal bacteria might behave as promoters and some as anti-promoters in colon carcinogenesis.
TI  - Glucose starvation response in Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2: survival and protein  analysis.
AB  - We investigated the survival of Enterococcus faecalis following starvation provoked by energy source glucose exhaustion. Inhibition of protein synthesis by chloramphenicol before 3 h of starvation resulted in a dramatic decrease in viable bacteria. Antibiotic treatment of cells after 3 or 6 h of starvation had a progressively lesser influence on bacterial survival. During the first 24 h of deprivation, a total of 42 proteins were identified as glucose-starvation-inducible; 4 temporal classes of proteins (A, B, C and D) were defined in relation to their enhanced synthesis after glucose exhaustion. Our results show that proteins from the two early classes (A and B) seem to be the most important for long-term survival in E. faecalis. One protein of each of these classes was analysed at the molecular level. The N-terminal sequence of one of them, belonging to class A, showed strong homology with the N-terminal sequence of carbamate kinase from Streptococcus faecium. This enzyme could be implicated in the development of alternative metabolic pathways of energy production and could be compared to the Cst proteins of Escherichia coli.
TI  - Resistance to lincosamides by nucleotidylation associated with conjugative transfer of a large chromosomal element in Enterococcus faecium.
AB  
TI  - 2-amino-4-oxo-5-substituted-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines as nonclassical antifolate  inhibitors of thymidylate synthase.
AB  - Six novel 2-amino-4-oxo-5-[(substituted phenyl)sulfanyl]pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines 7-12 were synthesized as potential inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (TS) and as antitumor and/or antibacterial agents. The analogues contain a 5-thio substituent with a phenyl, 4'-chlorophenyl, 3',4'-dichlorophenyl, 4'-nitrophenyl, 3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl, and 2'-naphthyl on the sulfur, and were synthesized from the key intermediate 2-(pivaloylamino)-4-oxo-6-methylpyrrolo[2,3-d]-pyrimidine, 17. Appropriately substituted aryl thiols were appended to the 5-position of 17 via an oxidative addition reaction using iodine, ethanol, and water under conditions which also resulted in the deprotection of the 2-amino group. The compounds were evaluated against human, Lactobacillus casei, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecium, and Pneumocystis carinii (pc) TSs and against human, rat liver (rl), pc, and Toxoplasma gondii (tg) DHFRs. The nonclassical analogues with the 3',4'-dichloro and the 4'-nitro substituents in the side chain (9 and 10) were more potent than N-[4-[N-[(2-amino-3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-6-quinazolinyl)methyl]-N-prop- 2-ynylamino]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid (PDDF, 1) and N-[5-[N-[(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxo-6-quinazolinyl)methyl]-N- methylamino]-2-thenoyl]-L-glutamic acid (ZD1694,2) against human TS. Analogues with the 4'-chloro, 3',4'-dimethoxy, and naphthyl side chains (8, 11 and 12) were more potent than the unsubstituted phenyl analogue (7) but less than 2, 9, and 10 by 1 order of magnitude. They were all poor inhibitors of human, rl, and pc DHFRs (IC50 = 10(-5) M) but moderate inhibitors (IC50 = 10(-6) M) of tg DHFR. The 4-nitro analogue, 10 (EC50 1.5 microM), was comparable to PDDF in its potency as an inhibitor of the growth of the FaDu human squamous cell carcinoma cell line.
TI  - Efficacy of ABT-719, a 2-pyridone antimicrobial, against enterococci, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental murine pyelonephritis.
AB  - ABT-719 is a 2-pyridone antimicrobial which inhibits DNA gyrase activity. It has  considerable subcutaneous (sc) and oral efficacy in the treatment of experimental pyelonephritis induced in carrageenan-treated mice by clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therapeutic ED50s, defined here as producing a 2 log10 reduction in kidney bacterial burden, provide a reliable end point for comparison of drug efficacy in this experimental infection. Therapeutic ED50s for ABT-719 against these infections were equal to or up to ten-fold lower than those for ciprofloxacin, used as a reference because of similarity in mode of action. Against E. faecalis, the therapeutic ED50s for ABT-719 were 4.5-13.6 mg/kg.day for sc administration and 6.8-8.9 mg/kg.day for oral administration. ABT-719 was more potent than ciprofloxacin and vancomycin against the E. faecalis strains, which showed ciprofloxacin and vancomycin resistance covering a range of MICs. Against E. faecium, the therapeutic ED50s for ABT-719 were 8.8 mg/kg.day (sc) and 9.4 mg/kg.day (oral). Against an isolate of E. faecium showing ciprofloxacin and vancomycin resistance the ED50 for ABT-719 to achieve a 1 log10 reduction in kidney bacterial burden was 17.9 mg/kg.day by sc administration. While ABT-719 had lower efficacy against this isolate than against others, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin failed to show efficacy. Against E. coli, the therapeutic ED50 for ABT-719 was 1.1 mg/kg.day (oral), and against P. aeruginosa, this value was 2.7 mg/kg.day (oral) with values against both of these pathogens similar to those for ciprofloxacin. ABT-719, which represents the new 2-pyridone compound class, has promise for the treatment of urinary tract infections, as suggested by the significant efficacy seen against experimental pyelonephritis caused by E. coli, P. aeruginosa and susceptible and resistant enterococci.
TI  - Escherichia coli transcytosis in a Caco-2 cell model: implications in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.
AB  - Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious gastrointestinal disorder of preterm infants. Other than an association with prematurity and gastrointestinal feeding, no single factor or mechanism has been consistently linked to this disease. We have previously demonstrated that Escherichia coli isolates obtained from the stool of infants with NEC caused NEC-like injury in a weanling rabbit ileal loop model; this injury, in turn, could be blocked by coinfection with selected Gram(+) bacteria (Enterococcus faecium) isolated from asymptomatic controls. Using Caco-2 cells in a trans-well system, we now demonstrate that the same E. coli isolates can cross epithelial cell monolayers in the absence of ultrastructural change or damage. These results with E. coli contrast with those seen with Salmonella typhimurium, which passed through the monolayer at a higher rate and were associated with striking ultrastructural damage. Transcytosis of E. coli was reduced 3-5-fold in the presence of E. faecium previously shown to block NEC-like injury in the loop model. There was a mild increase in the rate of E. coli transcytosis when studies were conducted with younger, undifferentiated cells; these immature cells had no brush border, had decreased production of brush border-specific enzymes, but retained well defined tight junctions, as demonstrated by transepithelial electrical resistance and electron microscopy. A further reduction/ complete blockage of E. coli transcytosis was observed when E. faecium was used as the coinfectant in studies with these undifferentiated cells. We hypothesize that the ability of E. coli to cross epithelial cell layer is a critical initial step in the cascade of events which lead ultimately to NEC; blockage or reduction in E. coli transcytosis in the presence of certain Gram(+) organisms may play a significant role in prevention of NEC.
TI  - Structure of the low-affinity penicillin-binding protein 5 PBP5fm in wild-type and highly penicillin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Among its penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), Enterococcus faecium possesses a low-affinity PBP5, PBP5fm, which is the main target involved in beta-lactam resistance. A 7.7-kb EcoRI chromosomal fragment of E. faecium D63r containing the pbp5fm gene was cloned and sequenced. Two open reading frames (ORFs) were found. A 2,037-bp ORF encoded the deduced 73.8-kDa PBP5fm, the amino acid sequences of which were, respectively, 99.8, 78.5, and 62% homologous to those of the low-affinity plasmid-encoded PBP3r of Enterococcus hirae S185r and the chromosome-encoded PBP5 of E. hirae R40 and Enterococcus faecalis 56R. A second 597-bp ORF, designated psrfm, was found 2.3 kb upstream of pbp5fm. It appeared to be 285 bp shorter than and 74% homologous with the regulatory gene psr of E. hirae ATCC 9790. Different clinical isolates of E. faecium, for which a wide range of benzylpenicillin MICs were observed, showed that the increases in MICs were related to two mechanisms. For some strains of intermediate resistance (MICs of 16 to 64 micrograms/ml), the increased level of resistance could be explained by the presence of larger quantities of PBP5fm which had an affinity for benzylpenicillin (second-order rate constant of protein acylation [k+2/K] values of 17 to 25 M(-1) s(-1)) that remained unchanged. For the two most highly resistant strains, EFM-1 (MIC, 90 micrograms/ml) and H80721 (MIC, 512 micrograms/ml), the resistance was related to different amino acid substitutions yielding very-low-affinity PBP5fm variants (k+2/K < or = 1.5 M(-1) s(-1)) which were synthesized in small quantities. More specifically, it appeared, with a three-dimensional model of the C-terminal domain of PBP5fm, that the substitutions of Met-485, located in the third position after the conserved SDN triad, by Thr in EFM-1 and by Ala in H80721 were the most likely cause of the decreasing affinity of PBP5fm observed in these strains.
TI  - The gene encoding for penicillin-binding protein 5 of Enterococcus faecalis is useful for development of a species-specific DNA probe.
AB  - Recently, in Escherichia coli was cloned a Sau3AI 3.4-kb fragment containing the  gene encoding for penicillin-binding protein 5 (PBP5) of Enterococcus faecalis. The structural gene for the PBP of E. faecalis and the flanking regions were entirely sequenced (C. Signoretto, M. Boaretti, and P. Canepari, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 123:99-106, 1994). When the entire cloned E. faecalis DNA insert, labeled with digoxigenin, was used as a probe to detect a homology gene in enterococci, it was observed that only DNAs of all the E. faecalis strains reacted to the probe. The same results were obtained when a HindIII fragment of 0.35 kb from the entire insert of 3.4 kb was used. In this study we tested a total of 62 clinically isolated enterococcal strains, belonging to the species E. faecalis (36 strains), E. faecium (13), E. gallinarum (6), E. bovis (2) E. avium (3), E. hirae (1), and E. casseliflavus (1). The results indicate that both the entire segment and the HindIII fragment may be useful for preparing a species-specific probe for rapid identification of E. faecalis species.
TI  - In vivo activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The Upjohn oxazolidinones, U-100592 and U-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. In several mouse models of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, U-100592 and U-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ED50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ED50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. Similarly, both compounds were active versus a Staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. U-100592 and U-100766 effectively cured an Enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ED50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. Both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with ED50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. In soft tissue infection models with S. aureus and E. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. U-100766 was also very active versus the Bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ED50 = 46.3 mg/kg). In combination-therapy studies, both U-100592 and U-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic S. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic S. aureus-Escherichia coli infection. U-100592 and U-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.
TI  - Comparison of antimicrobial properties of monoterpenes and their carbonylated products.
AB  - Some monoterpenes and their carbonylated products were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal properties. The carbonylation of tested monoterpenes was shown to increase the bacteriostatic and fungistatic activities specifically by the contact method. Concerning the killing effects, only (1R,2S,5R)-isopulegol, its carbonylated products, and (R)-carvone showed significant bactericidal activities, particularly against Enterococcus faecium and Escherichia coli above a concentration of 10 microliters/ml. A fungicidal efficiency of (1R,2S,5R)-isopulegol and (R)-carvone against Aspergillus niger was also noted. It seems that the presence of an oxygenated function in the framework increases the antimicrobial properties. However, monoterpenes were more active using a micro-atmosphere method.
TI  - Survival of model bacterial strains and helminth eggs in the course of mesophilic anaerobic digestion of pig slurry.
AB  - The effect of methanogenesis on the survival of model bacterial strains (Escherichia coli EC 5, Staphylococcus aureus SA 11, Enterococcus faecium CCM 4231) and non-embryonated helminth eggs (Ascaris suum) was investigated in pig slurry. Two pilot-plant experiments were carried out in two anaerobic digesters (800 and 1,000 litre) in a mesophilic thermal range (35-37 degrees C). The mean hydraulic retention time of the digesters was 20 days. The methanogenesis process was monitored by determining the following chemical parameters: pH, N-NH3, total dry matter (kg/day), organic matter (kg/day) production of methane by supplied and degraded organic matter (m3/kg). The results obtained allow us to state that the anaerobic stabilization of pig slurry in the mesophilic temperature range resulted in total devitalization of model bacterial strains E. coli EC 5 and Ent. faecium CCM 4231. St. aureus SA 11 cells, exposed to the above mentioned conditions, were also reduced in their number from 10.04 to 3.27 and from 8.69 to 2.77 log cfu/ml. It is assumed that the longer retention time of excrements in the digester could also result in total devitalization of St. aureus SA 11 cells. From the microbiological point of view, the above mentioned facts indicate a sufficient hygienization effect of the anaerobic fermentation on the contaminated pig excrements. The survival of A. suum eggs was little affected by the 20-day anaerobic mesophilic digestion of pig slurry. Only 17 or 18% (F1, F2) of the non-embryonated A. suum eggs were damaged after the 20-day exposure.
TI  - [Multicenter study of isolated micro-organisms resistant to antimicrobials in 10  Portuguese hospitals in 1994].
AB  - In 1994, Microbiology Laboratories of ten Portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. From 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were Staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples significant numbers of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida spp. were isolated. Escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A great variation in resistance values of P. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. Resistance to methicillin in S. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an average of 47%, and it was even higher with S. epidermidis (c.3000) and S. haemolyticus (c.650). Only vancomycin was always active against these strains. In E. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. E. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. Vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.
TI  - Selective isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Broth formulations of two media selective for enterococci, Enterococcel, M-Enterococcosel broths were supplemented with 6 micrograms of vancomycin per ml and evaluated for isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Each broth was challenged with various concentrations of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant enterococci and with 193 perianal specimens obtained from patients at risk in our institution for VRE colonization. Both the Enterococcosel and M-Enterococcus broths with vancomycin detected as few as 1 to 9 CFU of VRE while inhibiting growth of the other organisms tested. Enterococcus faecium organisms (MIC, > 256 micrograms/ml) were recovered from 66 perianal swab cultures in the enterococcosel-vancomycin broth, and VRE were recovered from 62 perianal swab cultures in the M-Enterococcus-vancomycin broth. Enterococcosel-vancomycin broth detected VRE in perianal specimens 48 h earlier than did M-Enterococcus-vancomycin broth. Enterococcosel broth with 6 micrograms of vancomycin per ml can be used for the rapid and selective isolation of VRE from surveillance specimens.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - Observations on the control of Campylobacter jejuni infection of poultry by 'competitive exclusion'.
AB  - Various bacteria were isolated aerobically from caecal mucus of campylobacter-free broilers sampled at slaughter. The organisms were mainly presumptive coliform bacteria, enterococci and Micrococcus/Staphylococcus spp. None showed any inhibitory activity against Campylobacter jejuni in a plate assay. On the other hand, adult hens yielded nine strains of Escherichia coli and one strain of Enterococcus faecium that were positive in the plate assay and most of which utilized mucin as an energy source. Coliform bacteria with these properties were also isolated from samples of pig colon and faeces and associated environmental samples. All of the strains from chickens or pigs failed as separate mixtures to protect chicks against a challenge dose of 10(4)-10(5) cfu/bird of C. jejuni. By contrast, chicks dosed with anaerobic preparations of caecal mucus from campylobacter-free adult hens were partly protected against C. jejuni, as shown by values for Protection Factor (mean log(10) of camplylobacters/g in caecal content of control chicks divided by corresponding mean for treated group). Materials from three hens gave values of 7.3, 1.4 and 3.6, respectively.
TI  - [Increased antibiotic resistance of intestinal bacteria].
AB  - A survey of bacterial resistance rates in four intensive care units (ICU) at a Swedish university hospital showed an increase of ampicillin resistant enterococci from 3.2 percent 1993 to 17.7 percent 1994. This increase of ampicillin-resistant enterococci was due to an increase of Enterococcus faecium with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. The survey also showed a relative high level of cefalosporine resistance, at the ICUs, among Enterobacter spp and to some extent among Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. A simultaneously performed survey of all blood isolates from the four hospitals in the county revealed the same development of resistance but the resistance rates were lower compared with the ICUs. To reduce the spread of resistant bacterial isolates there is a need for decreased and optimized antibiotic consumption as well as isolation of patients infected with resistant isolates.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of inhibitors of bacterial D-alanine:D-alanine ligases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: D-Alanine:D-alanine ligase is essential for bacterial cell wall synthesis, assembling one of the subunits used for peptidoglycan crosslinking. The resulting aminoacyl-D-Ala-D-Ala strand is the Achilles' heel of vancomycin-susceptible bacteria; binding of vancomycin to this sequence interferes with crosslinking and blocks cell-wall synthesis. A mutant enzyme (VanA) from vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium has been found to incorporate alpha-hydroxy acids at the terminal site instead of D-Ala; the resulting depsipeptides do not bind vancomycin, yet function in the crosslinking reaction. To investigate the binding specificity of these ligases, we examined their inhibition by a series of substrate analogs. RESULTS: Phosphinate and phosphonate dipeptide analogs (which, after phosphorylation by the enzyme, mimic intermediates in the ligation reaction) were prepared and evaluated as reversible inhibitors of the wild-type ligases DdlA and DdlB from Escherichia coli and of the mutant enzyme VanA. Ki values were calculated for the first stage of inhibitor binding according to a mechanism in which inhibitor competes with D-Ala for both substrate binding sites. DdlA is potently inhibited by phosphinates but not by phosphonates, while DdlB and VanA show little discrimination; both series of compounds inhibit DdlB strongly and VanA weakly. CONCLUSIONS: VanA has greatly reduced affinity for all the ligands studied. The relative affinities of the inhibitors in the reversible binding step are not, however, consistent with the substrate specificities of the enzymes. We propose a mechanism in which proton transfer from the attacking nucleophile to the departing phosphate occurs directly, without intervention of the enzyme.
TI  - Structure-activity relationship of new 2-substituted penem antibiotics.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of three new penems with 4-hydroxyprolinamide, 1-prolinamide and N-methyl-N-2-propionamide substituents, respectively, in position 2 and of their stereoisomers were examined against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All substitutes conferred a broad antibacterial spectrum on the penem moiety. Changes in stereoisomerism selectively improved the activity against E. coli, S. aureus or enterococci. The structure-activity relationships of each compound were discussed in relation to minimum inhibitory concentrations, penicillin-binding protein (PBP) affinity and outer membrane permeability coefficient in E. coli. In this microorganism, PBP 2 was the target for all compounds. Changes in stereoisomerism influenced the affinity for PBPs 1A/B and 2. All antibiotics easily permeated the outer membrane of E. coli and, within each group of compounds, the penetration rate correlated with the antibacterial activity.
TI  - Cross-talk between the histidine protein kinase VanS and the response regulator PhoB. Characterization and identification of a VanS domain that inhibits activation of PhoB.
AB  - VanS is a two-component transmembrane sensory kinase that, together with its response regulator VanR, activates the expression of genes responsible for vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium BM4147. In this report, we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of VanS (including residues Met95 to Ser384) is capable of high level activation (> 500 fold) of the Escherichia coli response regulator PhoB in vivo in the absence of its signaling kinases PhoR, CreC (PhoM), or acetyl phosphate synthesis. In vitro experiments carried out on the purified proteins confirmed that the activation is due to efficient cross-talk between VanS and PhoB, since phospho-VanS catalyzed transfer of its phosphoryl group to PhoB with approximately 90% transfer in 5 min at a 1:4 VanS/PhoB stoichiometry. However, the rate of transfer was at least 100-fold slower than that observed between phospho-VanS and VanR. The in vivo activation of PhoB was used as a reporter system to identify peptide fragments of VanS capable of interfering with activation by VanS(Met95-Ser384), in order to identify an interaction domain. A library of plasmids encoding fragments of VanS(Met95-Ser384) was constructed using transposon mutagenesis, and a subpopulation of these plasmids encoded peptides that interfered with activation of PhoB by VanS(Met95-Ser384). A minimal size fragment (Met95-Ile174) was shown to be both necessary and sufficient for potent inhibition (85%) of this activation.
TI  - Devitalization of bacterial and parasitic germs in sewage sludge during aerobic digestion under laboratory conditions.
AB  - The survival of 8 bacterial species (Pseudomonas sp., Salmonella sp., Enterobacteriae, Streptococcus sp., Escherichia coli) was detected in municipal sewage sludge up to 37 hours of mesophilic aerobic digestion under laboratory conditions. The model strain Enterococcus faecium CCM 4231 survived almost twice as long as the above-mentioned isolates. Similar findings, regarding the viability of the microorganisms studied, were also determined during thermophilic aerobic digestion of municipal sewage sludges. The final reduction in the total count of bacteria was not directly dependent on the temperature during aerobic digestion. It may be supposed that E. faecium CCM 4231 strain as a bacteriocin-producing strain with a broad antimicrobial spectrum, inoculated into the sludges, could inhibit the growth of microorganisms in the sludges by the way of its bacteriocin activity. Studying the effect of aerobic digestion on the viability of helminth eggs, the observed negative effect of higher temperatures was more expressive in comparison with bacterial strains. During thermophilic digestion process all helminth eggs (Ascaris suum, Toxocara canis) were devitalized. All eggs of T. canis were killed in experiments under mesophilic temperature. However, 32% of nonembryonated A. suum eggs remained viable.
TI  - Efficacies of ABT-719 and related 2-pyridones, members of a new class of antibacterial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The 2-pyridones are a new class of broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antibacterial agents. These compounds are potent bacterial DNA gyrase inhibitors which differ from fluoroquinolones by placement of the nitrogen atom in the ring juncture. ABT-719 is an S isomer and a representative 2-pyridone. ABT-719 administered orally or subcutaneously was 4- to 10-fold more effective than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes infections in normal mice. ABT-719 was equivalent in efficacy to ciprofloxacin for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The racemate and R forms of ABT-719 produced similar results against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. The 50% effective doses of ABT-719 were at least threefold lower than those of ciprofloxacin for therapy of intracellular infections caused by Salmonella typhimurium or Listeria monocytogenes. In immunosuppressed mice, ABT-719 was more effective than ciprofloxacin against quinolone-sensitive S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. The pharmacokinetic properties of ABT-719 were consistent with its relative efficacy. The 2-pyridones are potent, orally available antibacterial agents with efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections in mice.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - Overexpression, purification, and characterization of VanX, a D-, D-dipeptidase which is essential for vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium BM4147.
AB  - Vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium requires five genes: vanR, vanS, vanH, vanA, and vanX. The functions and mechanism of four gene products have been known, with VanR/S for signal transduction and transcriptional regulation and VanH/A to synthesize D-Ala-D-lactate. But the function of the fifth gene product, VanX, has been unknown until very recently, when Reynolds and colleagues discovered D-, D-dipeptidase activity in crude extracts of a VanX overproducer [Reynolds, P. E., et al. (1994) Mol. Microbiol. 13, 1065-1070]. We report here the expression of VanX in Escherichia coli and its purification to homogeneity. VanX has been characterized as a metal-activated D-, D-dipeptidase with an optimal pH range of 7-9. The kcat and Km of D-Ala-D-Ala in the absence of divalent metal are determined to be 4.7 s-1 and 1 mM, respectively. However, in the presence of metal cations, kcat can be as high as 788 s-1. VanX is unable to hydrolyze D-Ala-D-lactate, the substituted moiety in the peptidoglycan that leads to vancomycin resistance, not only because of low binding affinity (Ki estimated at 242 mM) but also due to a kcat less than 0.005 s-1. The more than 10(5)-fold differential in catalytic efficiency of VanX for hydrolysis of D-Ala-D-Ala vs D-Ala-D-lactate leaves D-Ala-D-lactate intact for subsequent incorporation into peptidoglycan.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A universal approach to bacterial molecular epidemiology by polymerase chain reaction ribotyping.
AB  - Oligonucleotide primers complementary to conserved regions of the 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA genes were used to amplify the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region of bacterial pathogens. The amplification patterns produced were compared for their potential use in molecular epidemiologic analysis. This method, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotyping, was applied to isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter species. Length polymorphisms in the amplified DNA distinguished unrelated strains of all bacteria. The banding patterns of 3 S. aureus isolates from the blood of 1 patient on 3 consecutive days were identical. Plasmid analysis, biotyping, and antibiograms were also obtained on the Enterobacter isolates. All three of these methods showed considerable variability after in vitro passage of bacteria, but PCR ribotypes remained stable. Results demonstrate the utility of the conserved primers for PCR ribotyping, a widely applicable method for the molecular epidemiology of genetically diverse bacteria.
TI  - Glycopeptide resistance mediated by enterococcal transposon Tn1546 requires production of VanX for hydrolysis of D-alanyl-D-alanine.
AB  - Cloning and nucleotide sequencing indicated that transposon Tn1546 from Enterococcus faecium BM4147 encodes a 23,365 Da protein, VanX, required for glycopeptide resistance. The vanX gene was located downstream from genes encoding the VanA ligase and the VanH dehydrogenase which synthesize the depsipeptide D-alanyl-D-lactate (D-Ala-D-Lac). In the presence of ramoplanin, an Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 derivative producing VanH, VanA and VanX accumulated mainly UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Lac (pentadepsipeptide) and small amounts of UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala (pentapeptide) in the ratio 49:1. Insertional inactivation of vanX led to increased synthesis of pentapeptide with a resulting change in the ratio of pentadepsipeptide: pentapeptide to less than 1:1. Expression of vanX in E. faecalis and Escherichia coli resulted in production of a D,D-dipeptidase that hydrolysed D-Ala-D-Ala. Pentadepsipeptide, pentapeptide and D-Ala-D-Lac were not substrates for the enzyme. These results establish that VanX is required for production of a D,D-dipeptidase that hydrolyses D-Ala-D-Ala, thereby preventing pentapeptide synthesis and subsequent binding of glycopeptides to D-Ala-D-Ala-containing peptidoglycan precursors at the cell surface.
TI  - Analysis by PCR and direct DNA sequencing of gyrA mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - A region of gyrA, the gene encoding subunit A of DNA gyrase, that is known to be  associated with resistance was amplified and sequenced from 16 Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolates. Six ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates (MICs of ciprofloxacin, 32 to 64 micrograms/ml) and one multistep resistant laboratory mutant of E. faecalis (MIC of ciprofloxacin, 128 micrograms/ml) contained a change from serine to arginine or to isoleucine at codon 83 or a change from glutamic acid to lysine or to glycine at codon 87 (Escherichia coli GyrA coordinates); these changes have been associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in other species. No difference in the region studied was found in two ciprofloxacin-resistant E. faecium isolates (MICs, 32 micrograms/ml) or in four laboratory derived, spontaneous ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants of E. faecalis (MICs, 8 to 16 micrograms/ml), suggesting that other mechanisms may be responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance in some enterococci.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Prevalence of important pathogens and antimicrobial activity of parenteral drugs  at numerous medical centers in the United States, I. Study on the threat of emerging resistances: real or perceived? Fluoroquinolone Resistance Surveillance Group.
AB  - Forty-three medical centers participated in a national (United States) surveillance study of parenteral antimicrobial agents as empiric therapy of pathogens isolated from blood, skin wounds, respiratory tract, and urine (> 8500 strains, 200 per laboratory). All laboratories tested each organism by the same reagent disks and/or Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) strips. Quality control results validated all laboratories for analyses. The most common isolates were Escherichia coli (1648), Staphylococcus aureus (1408), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1003), Klebsiella species (792), and the enterococci (684). Among the tested drugs the percent susceptible rates observed were ofloxacin (83.4%), ciprofloxacin (82.0%), and cefuroxime (62.9%) tested against all organisms; cefazolin (54.7%) and ceftazidime (76.7%) tested against all nonfastidious aerobes; gentamicin (91.2%), imipenem (95.3%), ticarcillin-clavulanate (78.2%), and ceftriaxone (66.2%) tested against Gram-negative organisms only; and vancomycin (97.9%) and erythromycin (49.2%) tested against Gram-positive aerobes. Several drug-resistant species appear to be emerging or increasing in the United States: (a) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (7.9%, mostly Enterococcus faecium); (b) oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (21.0%); (c) third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli and Klebsiella species with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (approximately 1.3%-8.6%); (d) penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.8%); and (e) ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (14.9%). Fluoroquinolone resistance among the enteric bacilli was confirmed in 60 of 66 referred strains (0.8% of total strains), and cross-resistance was high among ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, and norfloxacin (98.3%-100%). Seventeen strains of fluoroquinolone-resistant enteric bacilli (0.2% of total) also harbored an ESBL and resistance to aminoglycosides. Clonal spread within medical centers was observed with the ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. This national clinical isolate data base continues to demonstrate broad fluoroquinolone efficacy (ofloxacin > ciprofloxacin) against hospital-based pathogens and many strains of emerging resistant bacteria. Continued US surveillance studies are urged to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance and to guide interventions to minimize its occurrence.
TI  - [Bacteria-reducing properties of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. II. Relationship between microbiocide effect of copper-containing materials and copper ion concentration after contamination with moist and dry hands].
AB  - The bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. In first examinations (I. communication) (19) the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). The following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. In this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. Materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. The bactericide effect on Micrococcus luteus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. This results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effect of FK-037 and biapenem tested against five bacterial species.
AB  - The in-vitro post-antibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for two newer beta-lactams, FK-037 (a cephalosporin) and biapenem (a carbapenem). Our PAE results for these drugs were consistent with what has been reported previously for similar beta-lactams, e.g. Gram-positive organisms had measurable effects (0.4-2.2 hours), while Gram-negatives had variable results (0.0 to 1.4 hours). Even though the PAE test conditions generally coincided with achievable clinical levels for most organisms tested (< or = 4 mg/L for biapenem and < or = 8 mg/L for FK-037), the marginal or species dependent, short PAE values support the selection of multiple daily doses (two-to-four) based on conventional pharmacokinetic parameters such as the Cmax, AUC, and serum elimination half-life.
TI  - Epithelial cells secrete the chemokine interleukin-8 in response to bacterial entry.
AB  - Bacterial invasion of mucosal surfaces results in a rapid influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The chemotactic stimulus responsible for this response is not known. Since epithelial cells are among the first cells entered by many enteric pathogens, we investigated the ability of epithelial cells to provide an early signal for the mucosal inflammatory response through the release of chemotactic cytokines. As shown herein, the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8), a potent chemoattractant and activator of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, was secreted by intestinal and cervical epithelial cells in response to bacterial entry. Moreover, a variety of different bacteria, including those that remain inside phagosomal vacuoles, e.g., Salmonella spp., and those that enter the cytoplasm, e.g., Listeria monocytogenes, stimulated this response. Increased IL-8 mRNA levels could be detected within 90 min after infection. Neither bacterial lipopolysaccharide nor noninvasive bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium, induced an IL-8 response. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor alpha, which is known to be expressed by some epithelial cells, was not detected in the culture supernatants after bacterial entry, and addition of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha antibodies had no effect on the IL-8 response following bacterial entry. These data suggest the novel concept that epithelial cells serve as an early signaling system to host immune and inflammatory cells in the underlying mucosa following bacterial entry.
TI  - Effect of extracellularly generated singlet oxygen on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - In the separated surface-sensitizer system, a photosensitizer is physically separated from the substrate by a thin air layer under such conditions that only singlet oxygen can reach and oxidize the substrate, preventing the competition by type I photosensitized processes. This method has been used to study the reaction of singlet oxygen with Gram-positive (Streptococcus faecium) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacterial strains. Studies on cell samples exposed to singlet oxygen for different periods of time show a drastic decrease in survival for S. faecium, while E. coli becomes sensitive only when the integrity of the outer membrane is altered by treatment with CaCl2 or tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Tris-EDTA). Biochemical and ultrastructural analyses suggest that the cytoplasmic membrane and the genetic material are the main sites damaged by singlet oxygen.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of the glycylcyclines, a new class  of semisynthetic tetracyclines.
AB  - N,N-Dimethylglycylamido (DMG) derivatives of minocycline and 6-demethyl-6-deoxytetracycline are new semisynthetic tetracyclines referred to as the glycylcyclines. The in vitro activities of the glycylcyclines were evaluated in comparison with those of minocycline and tetracycline against strains carrying characterized tetracycline resistance determinants and against 995 recent clinical isolates obtained from geographically distinct medical centers in North America. The glycylcyclines were active against tetracycline-resistant strains carrying efflux [tet(A), tet(B), tet(C), and tet(D) in Escherichia coli and tet(K) in Staphylococcus aureus] and ribosomal protection [tet(M) in S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. coli)] resistance determinants. Potent activity (MIC for 90% of strains, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) was obtained with the glycylcyclines against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, E. faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and various streptococcal species. The glycylcyclines exhibited good activity against a wide diversity of gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, most of which were less susceptible to minocycline and tetracycline. The activities of the glycylcyclines against most organisms tested were comparable to each other. The in vivo efficacies of the glycylcyclines against acute lethal infections in mice when dosed intravenously were reflective of their in vitro activities. The glycylcyclines had efficacies comparable to that of minocycline against infections with methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, a strain carrying tet(K), and a tetracycline-susceptible E. coli strain but exceeded the effectiveness of minocycline against infections with resistant isolates, including strains harboring tet(M) or tet(B). Levels of DMG-6-deoxytetracycline in serum were higher and more sustained than those of DMG-minocycline or minocycline. Our results show that the glycylcyclines have potent in vitro activities against a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including many resistant strains. On the basis of their in vitro and in vivo activities, the glycylcyclines represent a significant advance to the tetracycline class of antibiotics and have good potential value for clinical efficacy.
TI  - [Bacterial reducing qualities of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. I. Contamination and sedimentation in humid and dry conditions].
AB  - In this examination the bactericide qualities of different materials were tested. Particularly the effect of humidity was examined. 3 materials containing copper ("copper", "brass" and "brass sheet") and 2 materials not containing copper ("polyamide B" and "high-grade steel") were tested. The surfaces of the 5 types of material were contaminated with a suspension of 2 different bacteria species (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus). After defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined by the standardized method of the "Guidelines of the German Society of Hygiene and Microbiology". Additionally the sedimentation of airborne microorganisms on the materials was tested by determining the number of colony-forming-units after defined exposure times. In further examinations the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. After defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined. The results show, a bactericide quality of copper depends on the percent of copper-content of the tested materials, exposure time, humidity, frequency of contamination and bacteria species. Humidity and only single contamination cause a reduction of bacteria. Reduction of gram-negative bacteria is more easily than reduction of gram-positive bacteria. Enterococcus faecium shows the highest, Pseudomonas aeruginosa the lowest reduction rate of bacteria in the following sequence: Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Identification of the satA gene encoding a streptogramin A acetyltransferase in Enterococcus faecium BM4145.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium BM4145, a clinical isolate from urine, was resistant to streptogramin group A antibiotics by inactivation. The strain harbored a plasmid containing a gene, satA, responsible for this resistance; this gene was cloned and sequenced. It encoded SatA, a protein deduced to be 23,634 Da in mass and homologous with a new family of chloramphenicol acetyltransferases described in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The similarity of SatA to other acetyltransferases, LacA (thiogalactoside acetyltransferase) and CysE (serine acetyltransferase) from E. coli, and to two putative acetyltransferases, NodL from Rhizobium leguminosarum and Urf1 from E. coli, was also observed in a region considered to be the enzyme's active site. Acetylation experiments indicated that acetyl coenzyme A was necessary for SatA activity and that a single acetylated derivative of pristinamycin IIA was produced. Other members of the streptogramin A group such as virginiamycin M and RP54476 were also substrates for the enzyme. We conclude that resistance to the streptogramin A group of antibiotics in E. faecium BM4145 is due to acetylation by an enzyme related to the novel chloramphenicol acetyltransferase family.
TI  - Taurolidine: in vitro activity against multiple-antibiotic-resistant, nosocomially significant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, and diverse Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Taurolidine at < or = 1,250 micrograms/ml killed all 37 isolates of multiple-antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Enterococcus faecium (n = 17), and Enterobacteriaceae (n = 11). Time-kill experiments disclosed that bovine serum (65% v/v) only marginally retarded the bactericidal activity of 2,000 and 1,000 micrograms/ml of taurolidine against the various strains. Taurolidine at 2,000 micrograms/ml did not antagonize the bactericidal activity of 50% (v/v) fresh human serum against promptly and delayed serum-sensitive test strains of Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens. In the presence of 65% (v/v) of fresh defibrinated human blood from two donors, however, the bactericidal activity of this antimicrobial compound was delayed, i.e., manifested only following extended (overnight) incubation, against staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates, though less so in the case of Enterobacteriaceae. Taurolidine at 2,000 micrograms/ml killed ingested, i.e., intraphagocytic bacteria of human-serum-resistant S. marcescens strains CDC 06:H3 and P016:H-.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterococci: results of a survey conducted by the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme for Microbiology.
AB  - Six strains of enterococci were distributed to participants in the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme for Microbiology with a request that they be tested for susceptibility to ampicillin/penicillin and vancomycin and for high-level resistance to gentamicin. More than 98% of laboratories correctly reported the resistant strains as resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. However, there was a poorer correlation for the susceptible strains, with only 1-6% and 69-83% of laboratories reporting the strains as susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin respectively. Those laboratories which used 5-25 micrograms ampicillin discs or breakpoint methods reported proportionally more results correctly for the susceptible strains than those using 2 micrograms discs. Participants using Escherichia coli or an enterococcus as a control and those not using a control at all were more likely to report ampicillin-susceptible strains correctly than those using Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 6571 (Oxford strain). For vancomycin-susceptible and high-level vancomycin-resistant strains, 93-96% and 96-99% of reports respectively were correct. For the low-level vancomycin-resistant strains, only 50-54% of reports were correct. Participants using a 5 micrograms vancomycin disc reported proportionally more of the low-level resistant strains correctly than those using 10, 20, 25, 30 or 100 micrograms discs. Participants not using controls were proportionally more likely to report the low-level resistant strains as susceptible than those using an enterococcus or S. aureus NCTC 6571 as a control. For the high-level gentamicin-resistant (HLGR) strains, 96-98% of reports were correct. Depending on the strain, between 12% and 41% of participants also reported high-level resistance for the strains which were not HLGR. Those using low-content discs (< or = 30 micrograms) and breakpoint or MIC methods were more likely to report strains which were not HLGR as HLGR than those using high-content discs. Those using an enterococcus as a control were less likely to report strains which were not HLGR as HLGR than those using either S. aureus NCTC 6571 or E. coli as a control and those not using a control.
TI  - Characterization of the chromosomal aac(6')-Ii gene specific for Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Chromosomal gene aac(6')-Ii of Enterococcus faecium CIP 54-32, encoding a 6'-N-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase was characterized. The gene was identified as a coding sequence of 549 bp corresponding to a protein with a calculated mass of 20,666 Da. Analysis of the sequence of the deduced protein suggested that it was the second member of a subfamily of AAC(6')-I enzymes. Insertional inactivation of aac(6')-Ii led to aminoglycoside susceptibility of CIP 54-32, suggesting that this gene plays a role in resistance to AAC(6')-I substrates. The gene was detected by DNA hybridization in all 26 strains of E. faecium tested but not in 44 other enterococci of 13 species. These data suggest that the aac(6')-Ii gene is species specific and may be used to identify E. faecium.
TI  - Multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the British Isles.
AB  - Twenty-nine British and Irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. The organisms were identified by an appropriate API system or, for staphylococci, by their Gram and coagulase reactions. Disc susceptibility tests were performed. Isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of MIC, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. Results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. Over 95% of the isolates of Escherichia coli, klebsiellae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus, Moraxella and Bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and Enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of Acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella and Serratia group. Tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against E. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), P. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and Acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). Occasional (18%) resistance in Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of Class I beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam. High resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for Enterococcus faecium and Xanthomonas maltophilia. Tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. Nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/L piperacillin/tazobactam in MIC tests. Similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. Amongst the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. However, Acinetobacter and Bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and Bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. Cefuroxime, ampicillin and co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. Only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.
TI  - Purification and characterization of VanR and the cytosolic domain of VanS: a two-component regulatory system required for vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium BM4147.
AB  - Resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin requires five genes. Two of  these, vanR and vanS, have sequence homology to cytoplasmic response regulatory (VanR) and transmembrane sensory (VanS) proteins of two-component regulatory systems used to sense and transduce environmental signals. We report the overproduction and purification to homogeneity of VanR (27 kDa) and of a fusion protein of VanS (residues 95-374, the cytosolic domain) to the maltose binding protein (MBP), yielding a MBP-VanS protein of 76 kDa. The MBP-VanS fusion protein displayed an ATP-dependent autophosphorylation on a histidine residue with a rate of 0.17 min-1 and a phosphorylation stoichiometry of 10-15%. 32P-PhosphoMBP-VanS transferred the phosphoryl group to VanR. 32P-Phospho VanR showed chemical stability anticipated for an aspartyl phosphate and was relatively stable to hydrolysis (t1/2 = 10-12 h). Thus, the vancomycin resistance operon appears to have collected and specifically tailored the His kinase and Asp phosphoryl receptor of two-component signal transduction logic for sensing extracellular vancomycin and turning on structural genes, vanA and vanH, to make altered peptidoglycan structures such that vancomycin does not bind.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of aspoxicillin of fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - The Antimicrobial activity of aspoxicillin (ASPC) in terms of minimum inhibitory  concentration (MICs) was compared with those of other penicillin antibiotics (PCs) against clinical isolates sent to us from medical institutions throughout Japan in 1988, 1990 and 1992 and strains isolated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections. 1. The MIC80's of ASPC against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis group were almost the same as those against these isolates in 1985 to 1986. 2. A trend for increasing susceptibility to PCs including ASPC was observed in the isolates of S. aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. This trend in S. aureus was attributed to the appearance of non beta-lactamase producing strains associated with the development of highly resistant strains among the methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) as well as to a tendency toward yearly decreasing frequency of MRSA. The trend for the increased susceptibility in H. influenzae was related to the decrease in the number of beta-lactamase production strains. 3. The frequency of the strains highly resistant to PCs including ASPC increased. 4. No PCs-resistant strains were observed among the so-called beta-streptococci, while among alpha-streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae there was a trend for decreasing frequency of strains with lower susceptibility to PCs or those with resistant to PCs. These strains may be variants which were also resistant to cephems and had penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Meanwhile, a high frequency of highly PCs-resistant strains were noted among Enterococcus faecium. In view of the fact that the PCs-resistance of E. faecium is known to be related to PBPs, the pattern of the susceptibility of the recent clinical isolates to beta-lactams is considered to be multimodal.
TI  - Characterization of Tn1546, a Tn3-related transposon conferring glycopeptide resistance by synthesis of depsipeptide peptidoglycan precursors in Enterococcus faecium BM4147.
AB  - Sequence determination of the flanking regions of the vancomycin resistance van gene cluster carried by pIP816 in Enterococcus faecium BM4147 revealed similarity to transposons of the Tn3 family. Imperfect inverted repeats (36 of 38 bp) delineated a 10,851-bp element designated Tn1546. The 4-kb region located upstream from the vanR gene contained two open reading frames (ORF) transcribed in opposite directions. The deduced amino acid sequence of ORF1 (988 residues) displayed, respectively, 56 and 42% identity to those of the transposases of Tn4430 from Bacillus thuringiensis and of Tn917 from Enterococcus faecalis. The product of ORF2 (191 residues) was related to the resolvase of Tn917 (33% amino acid identity) and to the Res protein (48%) of plasmid pIP404 from Clostridium perfringens. Tn1546 transposed consecutively in Escherichia coli from plasmid pUC18 into pOX38 and from pOX38 into various sites of pBR329. Transposition was replicative, led to the formation of cointegrates, and produced a 5-bp duplication at the target site. Southern hybridization and DNA amplification revealed the presence of Tn1546-related elements in enterococci highly resistant to glycopeptides. Analysis of sequences surrounding these elements indicated that transposition plays a role in dissemination of the van gene cluster among replicons of human clinical isolates of E. faecium.
TI  - Production of short chain fatty acids by the intestinal microflora during the first 2 years of human life.
AB  - We have followed the establishment of one group of intestinal microflora-associated characteristics, namely, the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in 30 healthy children, by gas chromatography analysis of fecal samples taken at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months of age. Acetic and propionic acids were the principal SCFAs at 1 and 3 months. Successively, the production of iso- and n-butyric, valeric, and caproic acids was established. At 2 years, the absolute amounts of all SCFAs with the exception of n-valeric acid had reached adult values. However, not all children had achieved a typically adult range of stool SCFAs by the end of the study. Both absolute and relative amounts of SCFAs were influenced by exposure to foods other than breast milk and exposure to antibiotic therapy. After standardization for exposure to foods other than breast milk, a positive age factor could be seen between 0 and 1 month of age for total amounts produced of SCFAs, acetic, propionic, and n-butyric acids. After this time, however, no clear age factor could be distinguished.
TI  - Characterization of enterococcal isolates by restriction enzyme analysis of genomic DNA.
AB  - A restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of chromosomal DNA for the intra-species characterization of enterococci is reported. The DNA was extracted by a rapid method and digested with the restriction enzyme Sal I to provide a characteristic 'fingerprint' consisting of 10-20 bands in the 1.6-5.0 kb range. One hundred and eighty enterococcal isolates were examined; 5 were type strains, 15 from an out-patient clinic and 160 from a geographically isolated British Antarctic Survey Base. The epidemiologically unrelated out-patient clinic isolates gave readily distinguishable patterns, whereas isolates from the geographically isolated community showed evidence of colonization. This technique provided a highly discriminatory method of isolate characterization for Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and E. durans suitable for epidemiological studies. A sample of isolates were probed with 16 + 23 S ribosomal RNA from Escherichia coli. Discrimination between isolates was poorer than with REA, although good correlation was observed between the results of the two techniques.
TI  - Characterization of vanY, a DD-carboxypeptidase from vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium BM4147.
AB  - VanY is a protein with a molecular mass of 34.8 kDa encoded by vanY, a member of  the high-level vancomycin resistance gene cluster found on plasmid pIP816 in Enterococcus faecium BM4147. Extracts from Escherichia coli JM83 bearing plasmid pAT383, which contains the vanY gene, were examined for enzymatic hydrolysis of peptidoglycan precursors. VanY was associated with the cell membranes and cleaved the C-terminal D-alanine residue of UDP-muramyl-pentapeptide but did not display transpeptidase or beta-lactamase activities. The DD-carboxypeptidase activity was not inhibited by beta-lactam antibiotics. VanY released the C-terminal D-hydroxy acid from depsipeptides produced by the vancomycin resistance protein VanA. These results demonstrate that VanY should contribute in vivo to the hydrolysis of both the D-alanyl-D-alanine- and the depsipeptide-containing peptidoglycan precursors.
TI  - Evaluation of the effect of 3 probiotics on experimental Escherichia coli enterotoxaemia in weaned piglets.
AB  - In this report the efficacy of 3 different probiotics (Bacillus cereus "toyoi", Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus faecium) was investigated. They were supplemented in the food of recently weaned piglets that were orally infected with E. coli O141 K85ab. Supplementation could not prevent mortality and clinical symptoms nor reduce the faecal excretion of hemolytic E. coli. The possible explanations for the unsatisfying results are various.
TI  - [Studies of bacterial indicators for water pollution--growth of Escherichia coli  and enterococci in limited nutrient conditions].
AB  - Bacteria, that would be an ideal indicator for fecal contamination in environmental water, should not proliferate but at the same time should survive a little longer than enteropathogenic bacteria in the environmental water. While conventional methods have recommended Escherichia coli as an indicator, enterococci is recommended as a preferable indicator for the estimation of fecal contamination based on the following observation. The relationship between the specific growth rate of organism and the concentration of peptone was determined and the value of Ks, a parameter analogous to Michaelis-Menten constant, was estimated. Ks of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were 3.8, 11.1 and 12.5 mg/ml respectively, indicating that Escherichia coli will grow at lower concentration of peptone than enterococci. Escherichia coli also grew in human fecal suspension and in filtrated (0.22 microns) river water, and while in those conditions enterococci did not grow or survive longer than Escherichia coli, survival time was longer than for Salmonella typhi and Shigella sonnei. It appears that enterococci reflect more accurately actual fecal contamination.
TI  - Determination of the chromosomal size of three different strains of Enterococcus  faecalis and one strain of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the chromosomal size of three different strains of Enterococcus faecalis and one strain of Enterococcus faecium. The size determinations of OG1X, a strain of E. faecalis widely used in many laboratories for genetic studies, using Sma I, Not I, and Sfi I alone or in combination, ranged from 2,750 to 2,761 kb. Using the same enzymes as with OG1X, the size of HH-67, a plasmid-free clinical isolate of E. faecalis, was determined to be 2,170-2,288 kb and the size of JH2-2, an E. faecalis recipient strain, ranged from 2,008 to 2,135 kb. The size range generated for GE-1, a plasmid-free E. faecium strain, with the use of Sma I, Not I, and Apa I was 2,045-2,155 kb. Although OG1X differed in size from the other three enterococci, each individual enterococcal strain generated reproducible results in different experiments. However, for both E. faecalis OG1X and E. faecium GE-1, one of the enzymes used generated a considerably smaller molecular size than that generated by the other two enzymes. The discrepancy was due to visually undiscernible comigrating fragments, and serves to point out a potential source of error if fewer than two enzymes are used to size a genome. The size discrepancies were resolved by digesting individual fragments with a second enzyme. The molecular sizes of these enterococcal strains are larger than that recently reported for Campylobacter, smaller than that of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and similar (OG1X) or smaller (JH2-2, HH67, and GE-1) than the 2,819-kb reported for Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the gamma-D-glutamyl-L-diamino acid endopeptidase II of Bacillus sphaericus.
AB  - The gene encoding the Bacillus sphaericus gamma-D-glutamyl-L-diamino acid endopeptidase II, a cytoplasmic enzyme involved in cell sporulation [1], contains the information for a 271-amino acid protein devoid of a signal peptide. The endopeptidase lacks sequence relatedness with other proteins of known primary structure except that its C-terminal region has significant similarity with the C-terminal region of the 54-kDa P54 protein of Enterococcus faecium, of unknown function [2].
TI  - Sequence of the vanC gene of Enterococcus gallinarum BM4174 encoding a D-alanine:D-alanine ligase-related protein necessary for vancomycin resistance.
AB  - The amplification product obtained with DNA from vancomycin-resistant (VmR) Enterococcus gallinarum BM4174 and a pair of degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotides that correspond to conserved amino acid (aa) motifs in Escherichia coli D-alanine (D-Ala):D-Ala ligases and in En. faecium VmR protein (VanA) was used as a probe to clone the vanC gene of that strain. The vanC product, with a calculated Mr of 37,504, exhibits 29 to 38% aa identity with VanA and E. coli ligases. Insertional inactivation of vanC led to Vm sensitivity of BM4174 suggesting that the gene may encode a D-Ala:D-Ala ligase of altered specificity.
TI  - A truncated Tn916-like element in a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - A 58.7-kb nonconjugative plasmid (pKQ1) previously reported in a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecium was found to contain both a tetM and an erythromycin resistance (erm) determinant. The plasmid contained a region homologous to the A, F, H, and G HincII fragments of Tn916. However, the 4.8-kb B fragment of Tn916 which contained the tetM determinant was replaced by a 7.3-kb fragment, and the 3.6-kb HincII C fragment of Tn916 was missing. An element homologous to Tn917 was juxtaposed to the truncated Tn916-like element. The Tn917-like element was similar in size to the erm transposon Tn917 as determined by a ClaI restriction digest which spanned approximately 99% of the transposon. When Bacillus subtilis or Streptococcus sanguis were transformed with pKQ1, no zygotically induced transposition of the tetM element was detected. Similarly no transposition of the Tn917-like element was detected.
TI  - Molecular basis for vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium BM4147: biosynthesis of a depsipeptide peptidoglycan precursor by vancomycin resistance proteins VanH and VanA.
AB  - Vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium BM4147 is mediated by vancomycin resistance proteins VanA and VanH. VanA is a D-alanine:D-alanine ligase of altered substrate specificity [Bugg, T. D. H., Dutka-Malen, S., Arthur, M., Courvalin, P., & Walsh, C. T. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 2017-2021], while the sequence of VanH is related to those of alpha-keto acid dehydrogenases [Arthur, M., Molinas, C., Dutka-Malen, S., & Courvalin, P. (1991) Gene (submitted)]. We report purification of VanH to homogeneity, characterization as a D-specific alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase, and comparison with D-lactate dehydrogenases from Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Lactobacillus leichmanii. VanA was found to catalyze ester bond formation between D-alanine and the D-hydroxy acid products of VanH, the best substrate being D-2-hydroxybutyrate (Km = 0.60 mM). The VanA product D-alanyl-D-2-hydroxybutyrate could then be incorporated into the UDPMurNAc-pentapeptide peptidoglycan precursor by D-Ala-D-Ala adding enzyme from Escherichia coli or by crude extract from E. faecium BM4147. The vancomycin binding constant of a synthetic modified peptidoglycan analogue N-acetyl-D-alanyl-D-2-hydroxybutyrate (Kd greater than 73 mM) was greater than 1000-fold higher than the binding constant for N-acetyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine (Kd = 54 microM), partly due to the disruption of a hydrogen bond in the vancomycin-target complex, thus providing a molecular rationale for high-level vancomycin resistance.
TI  - Enumeration by a miniaturized method of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus bovis and enterococci as indicators of the origin of faecal pollution of waters.
AB  - Counts of Escherichia coli, faecal streptococci and enterococci were made on faecal specimens from human and animal origin and urban raw sewage waters, with microtiter plates containing selective substances. Escherichia coli was more numerous than faecal streptococci and enterococci in 80% of the samples regardless of the origin. Consequently the use of the ratio E. coli/faecal streptococci to distinguish human from animal origin of faecal pollution is questionable. Enterococcus faecalis was predominant in human and poultry faeces, Streptococcus bovis was typical of the bovine faeces and to a lesser extent also of pig faeces whereas Enterococcus durans, Ent. hirae and Ent. faecium did not characterize any faecal source. Streptococcus bovis could be distinguished in the microtiter plate by its inability to reduce triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) in the medium.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of CPFX against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. The clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. Interpreting MIC level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. When activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, CPFX expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (OFLX) and norfloxacin (NFLX) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of CPFX against Bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of OFLX, and CPFX had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus to OFLX. 2. In comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, CPFX was inferior to amoxicillin (AMPC) against E. faecalis and inferior to AMPC and cefaclor (CCL) against Peptostreptococcus spp. Against all other bacterial species, however, CPFX expressed superior antibacterial potency to AMPC and CCL. 3. Scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to CPFX were observed among the S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of E. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
TI  - The VANA glycopeptide resistance protein is related to D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase  cell wall biosynthesis enzymes.
AB  - Inducible resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin is mediated by plasmid pIP816 in Enterococcus faecium strain BM4147. Vancomycin induced the synthesis of a ca. 40 kDa membrane-associated protein designated VANA. The resistance protein was partially purified and its N-terminal sequence was determined. A 1761 bp DNA restriction fragment of pIP816 was cloned into Escherichia coli and sequenced. When expressed in E. coli, this fragment encoded a ca. 40 kDa protein that comigrated with VANA from enterococcal membrane fractions. The ATG translation initiation codon for VANA specified the methionine present at the N-terminus of the protein indicating the absence of signal peptide processing. The amino acid sequence deduced from the sequence of the vanA gene consisted of 343 amino acids giving a protein with a calculated Mr of 37,400. VANA was structurally related to the D-alanyl-D-alanine (D-ala-D-ala) ligases of Salmonella typhimurium (36% amino acid identity) and of E. coli (28%). The vanA gene was able to transcomplement an E. coli mutant with thermosensitive D-ala-D-ala ligase activity. Thus, the inducible resistance protein VANA was structurally and functionally related to cytoplasmic enzymes that synthesize the target of glycopeptide antibiotics. Based on these observations we discuss the possibility that resistance is due to modification of the glycopeptide target.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - Cloning of usp45, a gene encoding a secreted protein from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MG1363.
AB  - We have cloned usp45, a gene encoding an extracellular secretory protein of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strain MG1363. Unidentified secreted 45-kDa protein (Usp45) is secreted by every mesophilic L. lactis strain we tested so far and it is chromosomally encoded. The nucleotide sequence of the usp45 gene revealed an open reading frame of 1383 bp encoding a protein of 461 amino acids (aa), composed of a 27-aa signal peptide and a mature protein initiated at Asp28. The gene contains a consensus promoter sequence and a weak ribosome-binding site; the latter is rather uncommon for Gram-positive bacteria. Expression studies in Escherichia coli showed efficient synthesis and secretion of the protein. Usp45 has an unusual aa composition and distribution, and it is predicted to be structurally homologous with P54 of Enterococcus faecium. Up to now, no biological activity could be postulated for this secreted protein.
TI  - Cloning and heterospecific expression of the resistance determinant vanA encoding high-level resistance to glycopeptides in Enterococcus faecium BM4147.
AB  - Fragments of plasmid pIP816, which confers high-level glycopeptide resistance in  Enterococcus faecium BM4147, were cloned into a conjugative gram-negative-gram-positive shuttle vector. The resulting hybrids were transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli to Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus thuringiensis. A 4-kilobase EcoRI fragment from pIP816 was found to confer vancomycin resistance in these hosts but not in E. coli or Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Radiolabeled penicillin G is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (PBP) assays. The disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin G are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. We investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin V as an alternative reagent. Radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin V with [125I]Na, using a modification of the chloramine-T method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. We demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3H]penicillin G and locally synthesized [125I]penicillin V (IPV) in their recognition of bacterial PBPs. Profiles of PBPs in membranes from Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Providencia rettgeri, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium labeled with IPV or [3H]penicillin G were virtually identical. Use of IPV as the imaging agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the PBPs of E. coli yielded results similar to those obtained in experiments with [3H]penicillin G. Dried electrophoretic gels from typical PBP experiments, using IPV at 37.3 Ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed X-ray film in 8 to 24 h. The stability of IPV on storage at 4 degrees C was inversely proportional to specific activity. At 37.3 Ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, IPV retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees C. IPV represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid PBP assays.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of phenethyl alcohol and resulting membrane alterations.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of phenethyl alcohol (PEA) towards Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium) was investigated. This activity was expressed as IC (inhibitory concentration) and BC (bactericidal concentration). PEA was bactericidal in the concentration range of 90 to 180 mM, these concentrations being 4- to 5-fold higher than the corresponding IC. The mechanism of action of PEA upon the cell membrane of bacteria was also studied. Morphological examination with a transmission electron microscope showed that Gram-negative cell envelopes were permeabilized; for Gram-positive bacteria, the plasmic membrane in S. aureus was solubilized, whereas lesser changes were observed in E. faecium. At lethal concentrations, PEA also induced a rapid and total leakage of K+ ions from the four strains studied. Despite the correlation between alterations in the structural integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane in Gram-negative cells and the loss of cell viability, it cannot be inferred that membrane damage is the only cause of the lethal effect.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the leaves of Phyllanthus discoideus.
AB  - The lyophilized aqueous extract (LWE) from the leaves of Phyllanthus discoideus was found to show an antibacterial activity. The alkaloid fraction obtained from LWE inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium (MIC = 1.6 mg/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC = 0.78 mg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium smegmatis (MIC = 0.2 mg/ml). Among the alkaloids identified, viroallosecurinine and securinine showed a high activity. Viroallosecurinine exhibited a MIC of 0.48 micrograms/ml for Ps. aeruginosa and Staph. aureus. This alkaloid is bactericidal since the yields of MIC/MBC were less than 1. The MIC of securinine was 0.500 mg/ml for E. coli, Staph. aureus and Myc. smegmatis. These effects of Phyllanthus discoideus leaf extracts support some of the local uses of the plant in traditional therapy.
TI  - [Mixed culture of Enterococcus faecium SF 68 with pathogenic intestinal bacterial strains].
AB  - An antagonistic activity of Enterococcus faecium SF 68 towards Plesiomonas shigelloides, Aeromonas sp., enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica has been studied and demonstrated.
TI  - The bactericidal effect of isoascorbic acid combined with mild heat.
AB  - The thermal inactivation of Salmonella thompson, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Candida zeylanoides, Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis was accelerated by the addition of sodium isoascorbate (1 mmol/l) to phosphate-buffer heating medium but not to complex food mixtures. The lethal effect of isoascorbate was nullified by heating under anaerobic conditions or by the addition of catalase. The scavengers of hydroxyl radicals, mannitol and formate were not protective whereas histidine was. Histidine may have protected by slowing the rate of isoascorbate autoxidation, a property common to other amino acids tested. Superoxide dismutase was not protective. Dehydroascorbic acid also enhanced heat killing and its action was also reversed by catalase. The bactericidal effects of mild heat plus isoascorbate or dehydroascorbic acid both apparently depend on oxidative processes but their relative effectiveness was not related to their respective rates of oxygen consumption or peroxide production. We speculate that site-specific redox reactions, involving amino-carbonyl intermediates are involved in the inactivation mechanism.
TI  - Active-site and membrane topology of the DD-peptidase/penicillin-binding protein  no. 6 of Enterococcus hirae (Streptococcus faecium) A.T.C.C. 9790.
AB  - The membrane-bound 43,000-Mr penicillin-binding protein no. 6 (PBP6) of Enterococcus hirae consists of a 30,000-Mr DD-peptidase/penicillin-binding domain and a approximately 130-residue C-terminal appendage. Removal of this appendage by trypsin proteolysis has no marked effect on the catalytic activity and penicillin-binding capacity of the PBP. Anchorage of the PBP in the membrane appears to be mediated by a short 15-20-residue stretch at the C-terminal end of the appendage. The sequence of the 50-residue N-terminal region of the PBP shows high degree of homology with the sequences of the corresponding regions of the PBPs5 of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. On this basis the active-site serine residue occurs at position 35 in the enterococcal PBP.
TI  - Resistance studies with ofloxacin.
AB  
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [The effect of roxithromycin on the aerobic fecal flora in children].
AB  - To evaluate the effect of roxithromycin on aerobic flora in 14 children treated orally (5 mg/kg/day during 5 to 7 days) quantitative stool cultures were performed using selective media. Enterobacteriaceae (EB), streptococci D (STR D), Staphylococcus aureus, Candida were counted at days 0, 2 and 5 days, and 2 days after treatment. The MIC of each strain was determined for roxithromycin, erythromycin and spiramycin. Ten infants in a nursery had already received antibiotics. A moderate albeit significant (p less than 0.01) decrease was observed for EB, falling from 7.2 log 10 (range 5-9) to 4.9 (range 2-8) per gram of stools, rising to 5.8 after treatment. There was no significant effect for STR D. The MIC of roxithromycin for EB increased from 244 mg/l (range 0.03-512) to 340 (range 0.03-512). For STR. D, it increased from 138 (range 1-1024) to 427 (range 1-1024). The bacteria with low MIC (less than or equal to 64 mg/l for EB and less than or equal to 4 mg/l for STR. D) are Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecium. The MIC increased for the three macrolides tested.
TI  - Impact of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone on the bowel and vaginal flora after single-dose prophylaxis in vaginal hysterectomy.
AB  - The aim of this randomised controlled study was to investigate the effect of a preoperative, single dose, intravenous injection of ceftriaxone 2g and cefotaxime 2g in 2 groups of 30 patients who underwent vaginal hysterectomy. The parameters were: efficacy and tolerance; impact on the aerobic bowel and vaginal flora; and serum concentrations. There were no significant differences in efficacy, haematology or clinical chemistry parameters. In the ceftriaxone group 2 patients had exanthemas, 2 had diarrhoea. In the cefotaxime group no such side effects occurred. Serum concentrations were 9.75 and 0.07 mg/L for ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, respectively, after 24 and 12 hours, respectively. Ceftriaxone had a pronounced and continuous effect on the bowel flora: Streptococcus faecium and Candida spp. increased, reaching counts of 10(8) and 10(7) organisms/g faeces, respectively, at day 10. Under cefotaxime no dramatic alteration was determined and growth of Candida spp. was not influenced. Growth of Escherichia coli and other bacteria of the vaginal flora was not influenced by either drug. Overgrowth of Candida spp. under ceftriaxone was significant (p less than 0.05) compared with that under cefotaxime. The results of this study indicate that the high biliary excretion of ceftriaxone (45%) and its long acting properties are responsible for the high selection pressure and overgrowth of Candida. Cefotaxime, a drug with low biliary excretion (5%) and shorter action, had only a negligible effect on the microflora with quick normalisation. The observed overgrowth of Candida spp., even after a single injection of ceftriaxone, could cause problems when this drug is being used for surgical prophylaxis or treatment. This applies especially to immunocompromised patients.
TI  - Comparative survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive fecal indicator bacteria in estuarine water.
AB  - The survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive strains of Escherichia coli,  Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus equinus, and two environmental isolates, AP17 and AQ62, was examined in estuarine water. Each strain was rendered resistant to a combination of two antibiotics by serial passage in increasing concentrations of antibiotics. Cultures were incubated in filter-sterilized estuarine water for up to 7 days. Recovery was assessed by examining colony-forming ability on media with and without antibiotics. None of the antibiotic-resistant forms survived longer than its antibiotic-sensitive counterpart in estuarine water. Three of the resistant strains died off more rapidly than the antibiotic-sensitive wild type. Survival of the test bacteria in estuarine water was as follows: sensitive and resistant AQ62, resistant Escherichia coli less than sensitive Escherichia coli less than resistant AP17 less than resistant Enterococcus faecium less than sensitive AP17, sensitive and resistant S. equinus less than sensitive and resistant Enterococcus faecalis, sensitive Enterococcus faecium. The results supported the suggestion that fecal entercocci may serve as better indicators of fecal pollution than Escherichia coli in marine ecosystems. Moreover, the results indicated that the use of antibiotic-resistant mutants to follow the fate of bacteria in the environment is inappropriate without adequate studies to ensure that resistant and wild-type strains react similarly to environmental stressors.
TI  - Dispersal of a plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance gene in streptococcal and enterococcal plasmids.
AB  - Plasmids coding for chloramphenicol resistance, five isolated from streptococci of groups A, B, and G, ten from enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), and two from staphylococci, were tested for sequence homology with the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pIP501, a 30-kb plasmid originally isolated from a group B Streptococcus. The 6.3-kb HindIII fragment of pIP501, known to carry the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was cloned into pBR322. A 1.6-kb portion of the cloned fragment, which included most of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was used as probe in DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. Sequence homology was detected between the probe and four of the streptococcal, seven of the enterococcal, and one of the staphylococcal plasmids. The absence of hybridization between this probe and one plasmid isolated from a group B Streptococcus, as well as three isolated from E. faecalis, indicated that there are at least two different plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance determinants in the streptococci and in the enterococci.
TI  - Gram-positive superinfections following beta-lactam chemotherapy: the significance of the enterococcus.
AB  - The recent literature was reviewed with regard to the risks of superinfection following beta-lactam chemotherapy. The summary publications for the pseudomonas-active penicillins (azlocillin, carbenicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin and ticarcillin), cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, imipenem and moxalactam show marked variations. Moxalactam was most likely to produce both gram-negative (5-38%) and enterococcal (2.2-12%) superinfections. Ceftazidime or moxalactam therapy was more often associated with anaerobic superinfections, usually by Clostridium spp., than the other beta-lactams. Comparable and lower incidences of superinfections were cited for cefoperazone, ceftazidime, mezlocillin and imipenem. The most common pathogens for the above drugs were the fungi (Candida spp.), Pseudomonas spp. and some beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Staphylococcal, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. secondary infections were more common in patients receiving the newer penicillins. Cefotaxime had a very low incidence of superinfections (1.1%), especially caused by gram-positive organisms such as enterococci. The reasons for this favorable feature seem to be: excellent inhibitory activity and beta-lactamase stability against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens, synergistic interactions of cefotaxime and its desacetyl metabolite, enhanced anti-enterococcal activity of cefotaxime in the presence of a human serum factor and interactions of cefotaxime and desacetyl cefotaxime to suppress the development of antimicrobial resistance. The most common superinfections following cefotaxime treatment were with Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp. and fungi. Cefotaxime appears to possess physical-chemical characteristics that react favorably with bacteria and the host to minimize gram-positive superinfections, especially with most enteric Streptococcus spp. (Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium).
TI  - Drug resistance of organisms isolated from feces of laboratory mice and rats.
AB  - A total of 248 strains of EScherichia coli, 132 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 137 of Streptococcus faecalis and 89 of STr. faecium were collected from feces of 40 mice and 36 rats of 8 colonies in 1978, and drug resistance were examined by an agar dieution method using 23 antibiotics. The results indicated a positive relation between use of antibiotics and appearance of multiple drug resistant organisms.
TI  - [Development of enterococci and coli bacteria in Bulgarian yogurt].
AB  - The effect of lactic acid fermentation in Bulgarian yoghourt was studied by the development and decline of hygiene level indicating microorganisms--enterococci and coli-bacteriae. It was established that for the first 6 h after production of Bulgarian yoghourt, the quantity of enterococci (Str. faecalis, resp. Str. faecium) increases 5--6 times on the average, after the 12th hour it begins slowly to decrease and the number is reduced two times during storage for 7 days at 7--10 degrees C temperature of 6 days at 18--22 degrees C. The reduction in enterococci number is not fully correlated with the stage of lactic acid fermentation. Coli-bacteriae (E. coli) do not grow in number at the time the milk is turned into yoghourt. Their initial quantity diminishes along with the advance of the lactic acid process and after 24 h of milk storage at 18--22 degrees C or after 48 h at 7--10 degrees C they cannot be detected at all. The conclusion is drawn that enterococci are more suitable as hygiene level indicating microorganisms for hygienic evaluation of Bulgarian yoghourt, as compared to coli-bacteriae, due to their greater viability and longer survival in the product at the time of its production and during storage. It is recommended to perform the investigations on coli-forms not later than the 24th hour after yoghourt productions begins.
TI  - Incidence and relationship of group D streptococci with other indicator organisms in meats.
AB  - Raw and processed meats were analyzed for presumptive group D streptococci using  KF streptococcus agar. Counts were compared with coliform, presumptive Escherichia coli, and Enterobacteriaceae counts but no meaningful relationships were observed. Results indicated that group D streptococci and E. coli type I were principally contaminants from the packing plant, rather than at retail level. The predominating group D streptococcus in both beef and pork cuts was Streptococcus faecalis, while in processed meat (bologna), the predominating group D streptococci were Streptococcus faecium var. durans and Streptococcus faecium. Streptococcus bovis was not detected among the isolates from any meat samples. Marked differences were noted in numbers of group D streptococci in processed meat from different manufacturers. The results did not support the use of group D streptococci as alternative indicator organisms for meats. However, the association of group D streptococci with packing plant contamination may prove to be of value.

TI  - Distribution of group D streptococci in rivers and streams.
AB  - A study was undertaken to determine sources of bacteriological contamination of rivers as well as the ecology of faecal streptococci in natural and contaminated waters. Media used to characterize and speciate group D streptococci were also evaluated using isolates from the water and sediment. Due to the low concentrations of faecal coliforms (FC) and faecal streptococci (FS) in river water samples, the FC/FS ratio was shown to be of little value in determining sources of contamination. High concentrations of FC and FS from sediment samples gave more credible FC/FS ratios. The actual distribution of group D streptococcal species in rivers and streams was also shown. High concentrations of all division II species (S. faecium, S. faecium var. casseliflavus, and S. faecium var. durans) were found in the water and sediment samples, with S. faecium var. durans comprising 50% of the total number of isolates. Low concentrations of division I group D streptococci (S. faecalis and varieties) were found, while only one isolation of division III group D streptococci (S. bovis and S. equinus) was made.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of 5-fluoro-4'-thiouridine and some related nucleosides.
AB  - The synthesis of a series of 4'-thio-5-halogenopyrimidine nucleosides, including  the 5-fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo derivatives, has been carried out by condensation of the 2,4-bis-O-trimethylsilyl derivatives of the corresponding pyrimidine bases with the protected 4-thio-D-ribofuranosyl chloride. Among these, the alpha and beta anomers of 4'-thio-5-fluorouridine inhibited the growth of leukemia L1210 cells at concentrations of 4 x 10(-7) and 2 x 10(-7) M, respectively, and that of S. faecium at 4 x 10(-9) and 6 x 10(-10) M, respectively. These compounds retained marked activity against strains of S. faecium resistant to 10(-3) M 5-fluorouracil or 5-fluorouridine. As determined in S. faecium cultures, 4'-thio-5-fluorouridine decreased the total protein content of the cells more markedly than it did their RNA or DNA content. X-Ray crystallography showed that substitution of sulfur for the oxygen in the carbohydrate ring markedly changes the conformation of that moiety.
TI  - [Study of enterococci in milk].
AB  - Studied were a total of 270 samples of raw and pasteurized milk taken during the  various technologic states of pasteurized mild produced for consumption at the State Economic Enterprise "Serdica", establishing the enterococcus and coli titers. It was found that the enterococcus titer of the raw milk varies from 10(-3) up to 10(-6), and the titer of the pasteurized milk at the enterprise and upon delivery through its commercial channels is from 1 up to 10(-3). The enterococcus titer of milk that was pasteurized and was kept for 24 hours at 4-5 degrees C was found to range from 1 to 10(-3), and of milk kept at 18-22 degrees C --from (0(-1) to 10(-6). Full coincidence of the enterococcus titer with the values of the coli titer was found only for pasteurized milk kept under refrigerator conditions. Along with the coli titer the enterococcus one may be used as a subsidiary means in a more strict bacteriologic control, however, it may not be referred to as the only criterion replacing the coli values in the hygiene evaluation of milk. All species of enterococci in varying counts are established in both raw and pasteurized milk. Prevailing are the strains of the Str. faecium group -- 43.2 per cent, and those of the Str. faecalis group -- 24.6 per cent.
TI  - SURVEY OF THE BACTERIOCINES OF ENTEROCOCCI.
AB  - Brock, Thomas D. (Indiana University, Bloomington), Barbara Peacher, and Deborah  Pierson. A survey of the bacteriocines of enterococci. J. Bacteriol. 86:702-707. 1963.-A survey has been made of bacteriocine production by a wide variety of well-characterized strains of group D streptococci. On the basis of spectrums and sensitivity to chloroform, heat, and proteolytic enzymes, five distinct bacteriocines can be defined. Type 1 is produced by all Streptococcus zymogenes (S. faecalis var. zymogenes) strains, is active against a wide variety of gram-positive bacteria, and is also a hemolysin. Type 2 is produced by some S. liquefaciens (S. faecalis var. liquefaciens) strains, and acts on many enterococci as well as on certain other lactic acid bacteria. Type 3 is produced by certain strains of both S. faecalis and S. faecium, and inhibits a wide variety of group D streptococci, but is inactive against all other lactic acid bacteria tested except Leuconostoc citrovorum. Type 4 is produced by certain S. faecium strains and resembles in certain ways the type 3 activity, but differs from it in other ways. Type 5 has been found to be produced by only one proteolytic strain of S. zymogenes, and this bacteriocine has a very narrow spectrum. The strain that produces this bacteriocine also produces type 1 activity. No strain is sensitive to a bacteriocine of the type it produces.
