TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == diversity of bacterial populations on the tongue dorsa of patients with halitosis and healthy patients.
AB  == the primary purpose of the present study was to compare the microbial profiles of the tongue dorsa of healthy subjects and subjects with halitosis by using culture-independent molecular methods. our overall goal was to determine the bacterial diversity on the surface of the tongue dorsum as part of our ongoing efforts to identify all cultivable and not-yet-cultivated species of the oral cavity. tongue dorsum scrapings were analyzed from healthy subjects with no complaints of halitosis and subjects with halitosis, defined as an organoleptic score of 2 or more and volatile sulfur compound levels greater than 200 ppb. 16s  rrna genes from dna isolated from tongue dorsum scrapings were amplified by pcr with universally conserved bacterial primers and cloned into escherichia coli. typically, 50 to 100 clones were analyzed from each subject. fifty-one strains isolated from the tongue dorsa of healthy subjects were also analyzed. partial sequences of approximately 500 bases of cloned inserts from the 16s rrna genes of isolates were compared with sequences of known species or phylotypes to determine species identity or closest relatives. nearly complete sequences of about 1,500 bases were obtained for potentially novel species or phylotypes. in an analysis of approximately 750 clones, 92 different bacterial species were identified. about half of the clones were identified as phylotypes, of which 29 were novel to the tongue microbiota. fifty-one of the 92 species or phylotypes were detected in more than one subject. those species most associated with healthy subjects were streptococcus salivarius, rothia mucilaginosa, and an uncharacterized species of  eubacterium (strain ftb41). streptococcus salivarius was the predominant species  in healthy subjects, as it represented 12 to 40% of the total clones analyzed from each healthy subject. overall, the predominant microbiota on the tongue dorsa of healthy subjects was different from that on the tongue dorsa of subjects with halitosis. those species most associated with halitosis were atopobium parvulum, a phylotype (clone bs095) of dialister, eubacterium sulci, a phylotype  (clone dr034) of the uncultivated phylum tm7, solobacterium moorei, and a phylotype (clone bw009) of streptococcus: on the basis of our ongoing efforts to  obtain full 16s rrna sequences for all cultivable and not-yet-cultivated species  that colonize the oral cavity, there are now over 600 species.
