TI  == transformation of mercuric chloride and methylmercury by the rumen microflora.
AB  == the microflora in strained rumen fluid did not methylate or volatilize 203hg2+ at detectable rates. however, there was an exponential decay in the concentration of added ch3hg+, which was attributed to demethylation. the major product of demethylation was metallic mercury (hg0), and it was released as a volatile product from the reaction mixture. demethylation occurred under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. the rate of demethylation was proportional to the concentration of added ch3hg+-hg from 0.02 to 100 microgram of hg per ml. the presence of hgcl2 had almost no inhibitory effect on the rate of cleavage of the  carbon-mercury bond of ch2hgcl, but it completely inhibited volatilization of the hg formed, when the concentration of hgcl2-hg reached 100 micrograms/ml. three of 11 species of anaerobic rumen bacteria catalyzed demethylation. these were desulfovibrio desulfuricans, selenomonas ruminantium, and megasphaera elsdenii. none of the 11 species caused detectable methylation, and only two caused limited volatilization of hg2+. three species of bacteria out of 90 fresh aerobic isolates from rumen contents were demethylators: two were identified as pseudomonas sp., and the third was a micrococcus sp. demethylation by the rumen microflora appeared to be carried out by both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and, on the basis of hg2+ sensitivity, probably resulted from the activity of two enzymes, a ch3-hg+ hydrolase and a hg2+ reductase.
