TI  == repurposing salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs to combat drug resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the us. repurposing food and drug administration (fda) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. the fda approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic):  0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). the two drugs were also effective against another gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecium (mic 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant s. aureus clinical isolates, with mics at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. a time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. oxyclozanide was non-toxic to hepg2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro mics but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. these data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.

TI  == 2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3h)-thiones, 2-r-(quinazolin-4(3h)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides: synthesis, molecular docking, antimicrobial and anticancer properties.
AB  == in this study, a series of novel 2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3h)-thiones, 2-r-(quinazolin-4(3h)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides were synthesized and evaluated for antimicrobial and anticancer activities. their structure was confirmed by elemental analysis and spectral data (ft-ir, lc-ms, 1h-nmr). antimicrobial activity was tested in vitro against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, candida albicans and nci in vitro preliminary anticancer activity against nine different cancer types. the most active antibacterial and antifungal compounds were: 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4. the introduction of the carboxylic acid or amide residue into the fourth position of  quinazolin-4(3h)-thione resulted in the absence of antimicrobial activity. substance 3.8 inhibited renal cancer uo-31 line and 2.18 - leukemia ccrf-cem. the results of in silico molecular docking for dhfr and ck2 kinase had no correlation with in vitro properties, proposing the presence of other biological activity pathways.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  == ac-gf(a6c)g(a6c)k(a6c)g(a6c)f(a6c)g(a6c)gk(a6c)kkkk-amide (a6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (amp) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43mum. spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this  amp interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. cd and 2d-(1)h nmr experiments indicated this amp  on binding to sds and dpc micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages  of helical and random coil conformers. cd investigations in the presence of three phospholipid suvs consisting of popc, 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc revealed: (1) the interactions occurring with popc suvs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the amp yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) the interactions with 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc suvs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the cd spectra. (3) the presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of suvs as was the case with micelles. this data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this amp are very different from the diversity of  conformations adopted by this amp on insertion into the lipid bilayer. cd spectra of this amp in the presence of suvs consisting of lps isolated from p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.

TI  == decoction, infusion and hydroalcoholic extract of cultivated thyme: antioxidant and antibacterial activities, and phenolic characterisation.
AB  == bioactivity of thyme has been described, but mostly related to its essential oils, while studies with aqueous extracts are scarce. herein, the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of decoction, infusion and hydroalcoholic extract, as also their phenolic compounds, were evaluated and compared. decoction showed the  highest concentration of phenolic compounds (either phenolic acids or flavonoids), followed by infusion and hydroalcoholic extract. in general, the samples were effective against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus aerogenes, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter sakazakii) bacteria, with decoction presenting the most pronounced effect. this sample also displayed the highest radical scavenging activity and reducing power. data obtained support the idea that compounds with strong antioxidant and antibacterial activities are also water-soluble. furthermore, the use of thyme infusion and decoction, by both internal and external use, at recommended doses,  is safe and no adverse reactions have been described.

TI  == screening and characterisation of antimicrobial properties of semisynthetic betulin derivatives.
AB  == betulin (lup-20(29)-ene-3beta, 28-diol) is a naturally occurring triterpene, which is found in substantial amounts from the outer bark of birch trees. a library of 51 structurally diverse semisynthetic betulin derivatives was screened against five bacterial strains, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and a fungal strain candida albicans, using broth microdilution assays. primary antimicrobial  screening at 50 microm concentration led to the identification of five compounds  showing antimicrobial properties (inhibition of growth by >70% against one or more microbial strains). according to the dose-response results, 28-o-(n-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (compound 5) was the most active, showing mic90 of 6.25 microm against two gram-positive bacteria, e. faecalis and s. aureus. however, the activity of this compound was affected by albumin binding, which was demonstrated by the loss of activity in a host-pathogen co-culture assay as well as in the antibacterial assay in the presence of increased concentration of albumin. furthermore, the effects on mammalian cells were evaluated by cytotoxicity assessment on hepatocyte cell culture after 24 h exposure to the compounds. betulinic aldehyde (18), betulin-28-oxime (31) and hetero cycloadduct with acetoxy groups at carbon atoms 3 and 28 and ethyl substituent at the triazolo ring (43) displayed cytotoxicity towards hepatocytes, with ic50 values of 47, 25 and 16 microm, respectively. the ic50 value for 28-o-(n-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (5) was 56 microm. the current study presents  an insight into using betulin scaffold for developing derivatives with antibacterial potential, and furthermore the necessity of in-depth analysis of found actives through selectivity profiling and follow-up studies including in silico admet predictions.

TI  == effect of vitreoscilla hemoglobin and culture conditions on production of bacterial l-asparaginase, an oncolytic enzyme.
AB  == l-asparaginase is a widely used cancer chemotherapy enzyme. the source for the enzyme with this property is mainly bacterial and its synthesis is strongly regulated by oxygen. in this study, we utilized two recombinant systems: one carried the gene (vgb) for the vitreoscilla hemoglobin (vhb), a protein of prokaryotic origin which confers a highly efficient oxygen uptake to its host and the other carried the l-asparaginase gene (ansb). the host bacteria were escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. of these three bacteria, all gram-negative, e. coli and its recombinant strain showed up to sevenfold higher l-asparaginase activity in lactose than in other carbon sources. although, in this bacterium glycerol was the poorest source for l-asparaginase synthesis, it supported the highest biomass production. in glucose medium, l-asparaginase activity of e. aerogenes was about threefold higher than its vgb and ansb recombinants. ansb recombinant showed significantly higher enzyme levels than both host and vgb recombinants in glycerol and lactose media.  in this bacterium, vhb/vgb clearly caused a decrease in the enzyme synthesis under all conditions. as seen for e. aerogens, glycerol was the most favorable carbon source for p. aeruginosa and its vgb strain in terms of both l-asparaginase synthesis and biomass production. the cultures grown in glycerol had more than two- and threefold biomass than in glucose and lactose, respectively, and up to elevenfold than in mannitol. indeed, the highest biomass  production for all bacteria and their recombinants was in glycerol. the vhb/vgb system is clearly advantageous for production of l-asparaginase in p. aeruginosa. the same, however, does not hold true for e. aerogenes.

TI  == persistence of nosocomial bacteria on 2 biocidal fabrics based on silver under conditions of high relative humidity.
AB  == background: the survival of pathogenic microorganism on fabrics in the health care environment has a important role in nosocomial infections. the use of biocidal fabrics and surfaces could reduce the prevalence of the microorganisms in the hospital environment. methods: in this study, the persistence of nosocomial bacteria on 2 fabrics containing biocidal fibers (bf) in the long term following desiccation and subsequent storage was examined at 40% and 90% relative humidity (rh). results: very few strains survived more than 7 days at 40% rh on fabrics containing 67% bf, and only strains of acinetobacter baumanii and pseudomonas aeruginosa survived on fabric containing 100% bf. none of the strains tested survived 14 days on the 2 fabrics, 67% or 100% bf, under these environmental conditions. in contrast, at higher rh ( approximately 90%), most of the strains tested showed prolonged survival on both fabrics, and all strains of  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and a baumannii survived for more  than 14 days; however, in a petri dish, most of the microorganisms tested showed  a higher survival even at 28 days. the gram-positive cocci and a baumannii were the most persistent bacteria on the petri dish. conclusions: this study emphasizes the effect of rh on the survival of nosocomial bacteria on 2 commercially available fabrics containing biocide. evidence of the clinical efficacy of these bf-containing fabrics is lacking.

TI  == the presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  == mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (et). it is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of vap. unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time vap is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (sc). it is thus important to know whether these sc can predict the microbial flora in et biofilms. in this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and of candida albicans in cultures from et biofilms and sc (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. our data indicate that  there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in et biofilms and sc.

TI  == acanthamoeba castellanii of the t4 genotype is a potential environmental host for enterobacter aerogenes and aeromonas hydrophila.
AB  == background: acanthamoeba can interact with a wide range of microorganisms such as viruses, algae, yeasts, protists and bacteria including legionella pneumophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, helicobacter pylori, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium spp., and escherichia coli. in this capacity, acanthamoeba has been suggested as a vector in the transmission of bacterial pathogens to the susceptible hosts. methods: here, we used a keratitis isolate of a. castellanii of the t4 genotype and studied its interactions with two bacterial genera which have not been tested before, enterobacter aerogenes, and aeromonas hydrophila, as well as e. coli. assays were performed to determine bacterial association with and invasion of a. castellanii. additionally, bacterial survival intracellular of a. castellanii trophozoites as well as cysts was determined. results: all three bacterial isolates tested, associated, invaded, and survived inside a. castellanii trophozoites as well as a. castellanii cysts. however, e. aerogenes and e. coli exhibited significantly reduced association with and invasion of a. castellanii as compared with a. hydrophila (p < 0.01 using paired  t-test, one tail distribution). in the long term survival assays, all three bacterial isolates tested remained viable inside a. castellanii trophozoites, while amoeba remained intact; however a. hydrophila exhibited higher survival inside amoebae (14.54 +/- 3.3 bacteria:amoeba ratio) compared with e. aerogenes (3.96 +/- 0.7 bacteria:amoeba ratio) and e. coli (5.85 +/- 1.1 bacteria:amoeba ratio). a. hydrophila, e. coli, and e. aerogenes remained viable during the encystment process and exhibited higher levels of recovery from mature cysts (14.13 +/- 0.89 a. hydrophila:amoeba ratio, 10.13 +/- 1.17 e. aerogenes:amoeba ratio, and 11.95 +/- 0.7 e. coli:amoeba ratio). conclusions: a. hydrophila and e. aerogenes also joined the ranks of other bacteria that could benefit from a. castellanii. because cysts can be airborne, these findings suggest that acanthamoeba is a potential vector in the transmission of a. hydrophila and e. aerogenes to susceptible hosts.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. in majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. this study was designed to find out the etiological agents of uti and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. this study was conducted in  kathmandu model hospital, kathmandu, nepal from april to october, 2009. midstream urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of uti were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth.  antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by modified kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. data were analyzed using spss software window  version 16. the overall prevalence of uti was found to be 18.89%. the most frequent causative organisms isolated were escherichia coli (82.30%), enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), citrobacter freundii (3.60%), enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), coagulase negative staphylococci (2.40%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), proteus mirabilis (0.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). nitrofurantoin and amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. e. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of uti and nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.

AB  == bacteria producing new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. this broad-spectrum resistance  limits treatment options for infections caused by ndm-1 producers. ndm-1 was first isolated from an indian patient in sweden; since then, ndm-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including turkey. in this study,  we investigated the presence of ndm-1 by pcr method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in samsun,  turkey. a total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 acinetobacter baumannii, 54 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 pseudomonas putida, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 3 enterobacter aerogenes, 3 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia rettgeri, 2 escherichia coli and 1 citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using vitek-2 compact (biomerieux, france) and bd  phoenix (bd diagnostic systems, md) automated systems. the results of antibiotic  susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the clsi recommendations. in our study, ndm-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by pcr. there was only one case study that reported the presence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates from turkey [poirel l et al. antimicrob agents chemother 2012;56:2784].  our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates is not common in turkey. however, since ndm-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. therefore, continuous surveillance  and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of ndm-1 may enable to identify ndm-1 producing isolates. meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of ndm-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.

TI  == discovery and biological characterization of geranylated rna in bacteria.
AB  == a general ms-based screen for unusually hydrophobic cellular small molecule-rna conjugates revealed geranylated rna in escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes,  pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica var. typhimurium. the geranyl group is conjugated to the sulfur atom in two 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine nucleotides. these geranylated nucleotides occur in the first anticodon position  of trna(glu)(uuc), trna(lys)(uuu) and trna(gln)(uug) at a frequency of up to 6.7% (~400 geranylated nucleotides per cell). rna geranylation can be increased or abolished by mutation or deletion of the selu (ybbb) gene in e. coli, and purified selu protein in the presence of geranyl pyrophosphate and trna can produce geranylated trna. the presence or absence of the geranyl group in trna(glu)(uuc), trna(lys)(uuu) and trna(gln)(uug) affects codon bias and frameshifting during translation. these rnas represent the first reported examples of oligoisoprenylated cellular nucleic acids.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == in vivo antioxidative property, antimicrobial and wound healing activity of flower extracts of pyrostegia venusta (ker gawl) miers.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: pyrostegia venusta (ker gawl) miers. (bignoniaceae), has been traditionally used as a remedy for treating white patches and infections on the skin (leukoderma, vitiligo). aim of the study: to investigate wound healing and antimicrobial activity of flower extract of pyrostegia venusta, including in vivo antioxidant activity. materials and methods: methanolic extracts of pyrostegia venusta flowers were studied for wound healing efficiency along with its effect on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was assessed using excision and incision model of wound repair in wistar rats. healing was assessed by the rate of wound contraction, tensile strength, breaking strength, hydroxyproline and hexosamine content. antimicrobial activity of the flower extract against twelve microorganisms was also assessed. in vivo antioxidant activity was performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. results: the results indicated that pyrostegia venusta extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. hydroxyproline and hexosamine expression were also correlative with the healing pattern observed. pyrostegia venusta extract exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against the  organisms: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and candida tropicana. during early wound healing phase tnf-alpha and il-6 level were found to be up regulated by pyrostegia venusta treatment. conclusion: increased wound contraction and tensile strength,  augmented hydroxyproline and hexosamine content along with antioxidative activity and moderate antimicrobial activity support the early wound healing exhibited by  pyrostegia venusta flower extract. induction in cytokine production may be one of the mechanisms involved in accelerating the wound healing by pyrostegia venusta extract. results suggest that pyrostegia venusta may be useful in the tropical management of wound healing.

TI  == genetic characterization of an extended-spectrum ampc cephalosporinase with hydrolysing activity against fourth-generation cephalosporins in a clinical isolate of enterobacter aerogenes selected in vivo.
AB  == background: extended-spectrum ampc cephalosporinases (esacs) have been reported in enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. here,  we characterize a new ampc variant presenting a broadened substrate activity towards fourth-generation cephalosporins, selected in vivo following cefepime treatment for enterobacter aerogenes. methods: two consecutive clonally related isolates of e. aerogenes were evaluated. screening for esac production was performed using plates containing 200 mg/l cloxacillin. mics were determined by microdilution (clsi guidelines). bla(ampc) genes were cloned into a pcr-blunt ii-topo vector and expressed in escherichia coli. the ampc genes were cloned into vector pgex-6p-1 for protein purification. results: isolate ea595 was resistant to two fourth-generation cephalosporins, cefepime and cefpirome; using plates containing cloxacillin, susceptibility to ceftazidime and cefepime was restored,  suggesting overproduction of the esac beta-lactamase. sequencing identified a new ampc beta-lactamase variant presenting one amino acid substitution, val291gly, inside the h-10 helix. recombinant plasmids harbouring this esac beta-lactamase conferred a broadened resistance profile to cefepime and cefpirome, with resistance levels increasing from 16- to 32-fold in e. coli. ampc-ea595 hydrolysed ceftazidime, cefepime and cefpirome at high levels, presenting a lower k(m) and enabling us to classify the enzyme as an esac. homology modelling suggested that the size of the active site could have increased. conclusions: we  characterized an esac beta-lactamase selected in vivo and conferring a high level of resistance to fourth-generation cephalosporins in e. aerogenes. the broadened  spectrum was caused by a new modification to the h-10 helix, which modified the active site.

TI  == essential oils from moroccan plants as potential chemosensitisers restoring antibiotic activity in resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == bacterial drug resistance is a worrying public health problem. antibiotic efflux  is a major non-specific resistance mechanism used by bacteria, and efflux pumps are involved in the low-level susceptibility of various important gram-negative pathogens. use of molecules that can block bacterial pumps is an attractive strategy, but several studies report only partial efficacy owing to limits of these molecules (stability, selectivity, bioavailability, toxicity, etc.). the objective of this study was to search for natural sources of molecules able to inhibit efflux pump systems of resistant gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the results indicate that the studied essential oils exhibit interesting activity against the tested bacteria. this activity was significantly enhanced in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor such as phenylalanine arginyl beta-naphthylamide (pabetan). the role of lipopolysaccharide (lps) structure in the effect of essential oils was also reported in salmonella lps deep-rough mutants. in addition, essential oils of thymus maroccanus and thymus broussonetii, used at a low concentration (a fraction of the minimum inhibitory concentration), are able to significantly increase chloramphenicol susceptibility of several resistant isolates. these results demonstrate that these essential oils can alter efflux pump activity and  may be attractive candidates to develop new drugs for chemosensitising multidrug-resistant strains to clinically used antibiotics.

TI  == bacteriologic and plasmid analysis of etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in lagos, nigeria.
AB  == background: conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the conjunctiva, is one of the most common eye problems affecting all age groups in nigeria. a better understanding of its epidemiology and the antibiotic susceptibility of etiologic  bacterial agents is crucial for the initiation of preventive and therapeutic measures. this study determined the distribution and patterns of bacterial infections in nigerian patients with conjunctivitis. antibiotic resistance patterns and the plasmid profiles of these pathogens were also investigated. methodology: a total of 83 consecutive and non-duplicate conjunctival specimens were collected from patients attending eye clinics at three different hospitals in lagos, nigeria, between february and september 2010. specimens were cultured on standard bacteriologic media and the recovered isolates speciated using standard techniques. susceptibility of pathogens to antibiotics and plasmid dna extraction were carried out by disk diffusion and alkaline lysis methods. conjugation experiment was done with rifampicin-resistant escherichia coli dh5alpha as the recipient cell. data were analyzed using the chi-square test. results: all the specimens were culture-positive, yielding a total of 155 bacterial isolates. gram-positive cocci comprising staphylococcus aureus (27.7%)  and coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. (22.6%) accounted for 50.3% (78 of 155) of conjunctivitis cases, followed by gram-positive bacilli (22.6%), gram-negative bacilli (21.3%), and gram-negative cocci (4.5%). corynebacterium spp. were the most commonly isolated gram-positive bacilli accounting for 16.1% of conjunctivitis cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa topped with 9.7% as the most commonly isolated gram-negative bacilli. other gram-negative bacilli in order of  their isolations were e. coli (6.5%), proteus sp. (3.2%), klebsiella sp. (1.9%),  and enterobacter aerogenes (1.9%). moraxella spp. were the only gram-negative cocci isolated, and they accounted for 4.5% of the total conjunctival infections. further analysis of the complexity of infections showed that 25 specimens elicited mono-infections, while cases of polymicrobial infections caused by two pathogens and three or more pathogens constituted 51.8% and 18.1% of conjunctivitis specimens screened, respectively. the disparity in the percentage  contribution of three infection patterns was significant (p < 0.05). antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed chloramphenicol and ofloxacin as the least and most active antibiotics tested as 99 (63.9%) and 149 (96.1%) of the 155 recovered isolates were sensitive to them. on the whole, the least susceptible pathogen was p. aeruginosa with sensitivities ranging from 20% to 80%, while moraxella sp. represented the most sensitive pathogen with sensitivities ranging from 71.4% to  100%. other bacterial isolates also elicited antibiotic sensitivities in the range of 33.3-100%. a total of 101 isolates were screened for plasmids, of which  45 harbored plasmids, yielding a plasmid frequency of 44.6%. conjugal transfer of resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin was detected in the transconjugants after the mating experiment. the antibiotic resistances were transferred either singly or in combination from six of the seven selected donor  strains. the antibiotic resistance pattern transferred by these donor strains was partial and was associated with the transfer of r plasmids of sizes 21.3, 15.2, and 5.0 kb from three of the six transferable strains. the frequencies of transfer of antibiotype or r plasmids to the transconjugants ranged from 1.8 x 10(-7) to 1.4 x 10(-5) transconjugants per donor strain. conclusion: conjunctivitis as an eye problem in lagos is polymicrobial with infections associated with transferable r plasmids for chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin. continuous surveillance of conjunctivitis in relation to etiology,  drug susceptibility, and plasmid transferability in the study area is therefore recommended.

TI  == novel chalcones and 1,3,5-triphenyl-2-pyrazoline derivatives as antibacterial agents.
AB  == novel sixteen chalcones and thirteen 1,3,5-triphenyl-2-pyrazolines were synthesized and characterized using ft-ir, hr-mass, nmr ((1)h-nmr, (1)(3)c-nmr, 135 dept, (1)h-(1)h cosy and (1)h and (1)(3)c cosy) and xrd. these compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against six micro-organisms, namely bacillus subtilis ncim 2718, staphylococcus aureus ncim 5021, salmonella typhi ncim 2501, enterobacter aerogenes ncim 5139, pseudomonas aeruginosa ncim 5029, and proteus vulgaris ncim 2813 by twofold dilution method using resazurin as the  indicator dye. in the case of chalcones, compounds with hydroxyl and bromo substitutions in the b-ring favor activity and benzyloxy substitution irrespective of its position in the a-ring. in the case of 1,3,5-triphenyl-2-pyrazolines, chloro substitution in the a-ring favors activity. hydrophilic/lipophilic balance of the compounds plays a major role in their antibacterial activity.

TI  == microbial transformation of albendazole.
AB  == screening scale studies were performed to biotransform anthelmintic drug albendazole by using twelve bacterial strains representing six genera and five actinomycetes cultures. among the cultures studied, bacillus subtilis mtcc 619, escherichia coli mtcc 118 and klebsiella pneumoniae mtcc 109 could transform albendazole to one metabolite whereas, enterobacter aerogenes ncim 2695, klebsiella aerogenes ncim 2258, pseudomonas aeruginosa ncim 2074 and streptomyces griseus ncim 2622 could transform albendazole into two metabolites in significant quantities. the transformation of albendazole was identified by hplc. based on lc-ms-ms data, the two metabolites were predicted to be albendazole sulfoxide (m1) and albendazole sulfone (m2), the major mammalian metabolites reported previously. since m1 is active metabolite, the results prove the versatility of microorganisms to perform industrially attractive chemical reactions.

TI  == synergistic interaction of phenylpropanoids with antibiotics against bacteria.
AB  == phenylpropanoids constitute a large part of our daily diet and there is a possibility that they might interact with synthetic drugs. the present work was aimed at studying the interaction of seven phenylpropanoids (cinnamic, p-coumaric, caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic, 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic and 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid) with five antibiotics (amikacin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and vancomycin) against gram-negative (escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. the interaction studies were performed by chequerboard and time-kill curve assays. both assays revealed that cinnamic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids were the most active. they combined synergistically  with the majority of the antibiotics and exhibited enhanced activity against all  the micro-organisms. the time-kill curve parameters were better (p<0.05) for the  combinations of amikacin with ferulic, cinnamic or p-coumaric acid than for the individual treatments. amikacin was the most favourable antibiotic and s. aureus  was the most sensitive microbe to most of the combinations. these phenylpropanoids damaged the bacterial membrane as assessed by the live/dead baclight kit, and structure-activity relationship studies indicated that hydrophilic groups enhanced this activity.

TI  == identification and characterization of a phospholipase a2 from the venom of the saw-scaled viper: novel bactericidal and membrane damaging activities.
AB  == phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)), a common toxic component of snake venom, has been implicated in various pharmacological effects. in this study, a basic myotoxic pla(2), named ectx-i was isolated from echis carinatus snake venom by using gel filtration on superdex g-75, and reverse phase hplc on c18 and c8 sepharose columns. pla(2), ectx-i was 13,861.72 molecular weight as estimated by maldi-tof  (15 kd by sds-page), and consisted of 121 amino acid residues cross-linked by seven disulfide bonds. the n-terminal sequences revealed significant homology with basic myotoxic pla(2)s from other snake venoms. the purified pla(2) ectx-i was evaluated (250 mug/ml) for bactericidal activity of a wide variety of human pathogens against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw&tes), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. ectx-i showed strong antibacterial activity against b. pseudomallei (khw) and e. aerogenes among the tested bacteria. other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria showed only a moderate effect. however,  the gram-positive bacterium e. aerogenes failed to show any effect on ectx-i protein at tested doses. the most significant bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of ectx-i was observed at mics of >15 mug/ml against (b. pseudomallei, khw) and mics >30 mug/ml against e. aerogenes. mechanisms of bactericidal and membrane damaging effects were proved by ultra-structural analysis. ectx-i was able to induce cytotoxicity on thp-1 cells in vitro as well as lethality in balb/c mice. ectx-i also induced mild myotoxic effects on mouse skin, but was devoid of hemolytic effects on human erythrocytes up to 500 mug/ml. it is shown that the toxic effect induced by e. carinatus venom is due to the presence of myotoxic pla(2) (ectx-i). the result also corroborates the hypothesis of an association between toxic and enzymatic domains. in conclusion, ectx-i displays a heparin binding c-terminal region, which is probably responsible for the cytotoxic and bactericidal effects.

TI  == bacterial coinfection and antimicrobial resistance in patients with paranasal sinus fungus balls.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of bacterial coinfection and antimicrobial resistance in cases of fungus balls of the paranasal sinuses. methods: between december 1991 and august 2008, 229 patients underwent endoscopic sinus surgery or the caldwell-luc procedure for paranasal sinus fungus ball treatment. from 123 of these patients, a total of 124 specimens were obtained for aerobic and anaerobic culture. antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed. results: ninety-one cultures (73.4%) were positive for bacteria, and 33 showed no bacterial growth. a total of 134 bacterial organisms were isolated: 65 gram-positive, 55 gram-negative, and 14 anaerobic. the most frequently isolated organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (14.9%), staphylococcus aureus (12.7%), enterobacter aerogenes (12.7%), viridans-group streptococci (8.9%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.2%). among the gram-positive cocci, 12.2% were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 27.6% to clindamycin, 30% to oxacillin, 35.8% to erythromycin, 35.9% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 56.5% to penicillin, 56.8% to gentamicin, and 0% to teicoplanin and vancomycin. among the gram-negative rods, fewer than 10% were resistant to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, gentamicin, ceftazidime, cefepime, and tobramycin, whereas more than 80% showed resistance to ampicillin and cefazolin.  when we compared the data from the periods 1991 to 2000 and 2001 to 2008, there were no significant differences in the isolation rates of particular bacterial species and no significant differences in resistance rates except for clindamycin-resistant gram-positive cocci and cefazolin-resistant gram-negative rods. conclusions: bacterial coinfections were identified in more than two thirds of patients with fungus balls and purulent secretions. this finding suggests that bacterial infection may influence the development and persistence of clinical symptoms in a substantial portion of fungus ball cases.

TI  == quinazoline derivatives are efficient chemosensitizers of antibiotic activity in  enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant strains.
AB  == amongst the three series of quinazoline derivatives synthesised and studied in this work, some molecules increase the antibiotic susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria presenting multidrug-resistant phenotypes. n-alkyl compounds induced an  increase in the activity of chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid and sparfloxacin, which are substrates of the acrab-tolc and mexab-oprm efflux pumps in clinical isolates. these molecules are able to increase the intracellular concentration of chloramphenicol in efflux pump-overproducing strains. their activity depends on the antibiotic structure, suggesting that different sites may be involved for the recognition of substrates by a given efflux pump. quinazoline molecules exhibiting a nitro functional group are more active, and structure-activity relationship studies may be undertaken to identify the pharmacophoric group involved in the acrb and mexb affinity sites.

TI  == efflux pumps are involved in the defense of gram-negative bacteria against the natural products isobavachalcone and diospyrone.
AB  == the activities of two naturally occurring compounds, isobavachalcone and diospyrone, against documented strains and multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacterial isolates were evaluated. the results indicated that the two compounds exhibited intrinsic antibacterial activity against several gram-negative bacteria, and their activities were significantly improved in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor (mic values decreased to below 10 microg/ml). in addition, the activities of isobavachalcone and diospyrone against various strains exhibiting deletions of the major efflux pump components (acrab,  tolc) were significantly increased. the overall results indicate that isobavachalcone and diospyrone could be candidates for the development of new drugs against mdr strains and that their use in combination with efflux pump inhibitors reinforces their activity.

TI  == patterns of antimicrobial therapy in severe nosocomial infections: empiric choices, proportion of appropriate therapy, and adaptation rates--a multicentre,  observational survey in critically ill patients.
AB  == this prospective, observational multicentre (n=24) study investigated relationships between antimicrobial choices and rates of empiric appropriate or adequate therapy, and subsequent adaptation of therapy in 171 icu patients with severe nosocomial infections. appropriate antibiotic therapy was defined as in vitro susceptibility of the causative pathogen and clinical response to the agent administered. in non-microbiologically documented infections, therapy was considered adequate in the case of favourable clinical response <5 days. patients had pneumonia (n=127; 66 ventilator-associated), intra-abdominal infection (n=23), and bloodstream infection (n=21). predominant pathogens were pseudomonas  aeruginosa (n=29) escherichia coli (n=26), staphylococcus aureus (n=22), and enterobacter aerogenes (n=21). in 49.6% of infections multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria were involved, mostly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ebsl)-producing  enterobacteriaceae and mdr non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria. prior antibiotic exposure and hospitalisation in a general ward prior to icu admission  were risk factors for mdr. empiric therapy was appropriate/adequate in 63.7% of cases. empiric schemes were classified according to coverage of (i) esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria ("meropenem-based"), (ii) non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria (schemes with an  antipseudomonal agent), and (iii) first-line agents not covering esbl-enterobacteriaceae nor non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria. meropenem-based schemes allowed for significantly higher rates of appropriate/adequate therapy (p<0.001). this benefit remained when only patients  without risk factors for mdr were considered (p=0.021). in 106 patients (61%) empiric therapy was modified: in 60 cases following initial inappropriate/inadequate therapy, in 46 patients in order to refine empiric therapy. in this study reflecting real-life practice, first-line use of meropenem provided significantly higher rates of the appropriate/adequate therapy, irrespective of presence of risk factors for mdr.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial activity in vitro of thymus capitatus from jordan.
AB  == this study was carried out to evaluate the antibacterial activity of aqueous and  organic extracts of thymus capitatus l. (lamiaceae) leaves and stems. dried ground powder leaves and stems were extracted with water (aqueous extracts), ethanol, dichloromethane and hexane (soxhlet extracts). the antibacterial activity of these extracts was evaluated against bacteria using disc diffusion method. the result obtained showed that the leaves had stronger antibacterial activity than the stems extracts. the ethanolic extract had the highest yield products and the high antibacterial activity than all other solvents. the results suggest that essential oil as non-polar organic compounds could be the main active compounds in this plant. therefore the antibacterial activity of leaves ethanol extracts (lee) was compared with essential oils leaves extracts (leo) of  t. capitatus. the leo showed greater antibacterial activity than lee. the leo showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and the pseudomonas aeruginosa  was the most sensitive bacteria.

TI  == copper uptake by pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from infected burn patients.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from infected burn patients and characterized by standard biochemical tests. the in vitro copper uptake was compared between this isolated pathogenic strain and two non-pathogenic control strains of gram positive bacteria bacillus thuringiensis strain israelis as well as gram negative bacteria enterobacter aerogenes. maximum copper uptake of 470 ppm/g biomass was obtained by p. aeruginosa strain, while the control strains b. thuringiensis and  enterobacter aerogenes had copper uptake of 350 and 383 ppm/g biomass, respectively. however, the lowest copper uptake (60 ppm/g biomass) was observed with another control the saprophytic strain pseudomonas (shewanella) putrefaciens. a further investigation regarding the effect of copper toxicity on  bacterial growth, gave an mic score of 600 ppm for p. aeruginosa strain compared  to 460 and 300 ppm for the two gram positive and gram negative control strains, respectively. in tandem with these in vitro findings, blood analysis on burn patients infected with p. aeruginosa has indicated a selective decrease of copper (hypocupremia) and ceruloplasmin plasma levels. the iron metabolism was also affected by this copper deprivation leading to a similar decrease in plasma levels of pcv, iron, total iron binding capacity, and transferrin. all these hematological changes were significantly different (p < 0.05) from the matched group of non-infected burn patients. the observed hypocupremia in infected burn patients was attributed to demanding scavenger ability by p. aeruginosa strain for the copper of plasma.

TI  == incidence of multiple antibiotic resistant gram-negative bacteria isolated from surface and underground water sources in south western region of nigeria.
AB  == in most rural and urban settlements, particularly in nigeria, wells, spring, streams or rivers and lakes serves as major sources of water supply for drinking  and other domestic purposes. unfortunately, many of the available water sources are not potable without some form of treatment which is seldom available in most  settings. the use of untreated surface water sources for drinking and for domestic purposes remains a major threat to public health as these could serve as reservoirs the for transfer of antibiotic resistant pathogens. the incidence of resistant bacteria isolated from surface and underground water in six rural settlements in ekiti state nigeria was thus investigated. gram-negative bacteria  were isolated from wells, streams and boreholes in six rural settlements in ekiti state nigeria between january and april, 2006 and the prevalence of organisms exhibiting multiple antibiotic resistance to tetracycline, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, nitofurantoin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid and ofloxacin was observed. gram-negative bacterial isolates comprised escherichia coli (22.7%), enterobacter aerogenes (2.5%), salmonella spp. (13.3%), shigella spp. (19.3%), proteus spp. (18.5%), klebsiella spp. (19.3%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.2%).  over 10% of the bacteria were resistant to four or more antibiotic. antibiotic resistance was highest in members of the genera enterobacter, pseudomonas, and proteus. given the prevalence of appalling sanitary facilities and inappropriate  public antibiotic use, the possibility of antibiotic resistance selection, faecal dissemination and subsequent contamination of local water sources available for rural residents of the developing world is highlighted. the implication for clinical practice of infections caused by antibiotic resistant strains especially among immunodeficient individuals is also discussed.

TI  == effects of an alternative cefepime dosing strategy in pulmonary and bloodstream infections caused by enterobacter spp, citrobacter freundii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa: a single-center, open-label, prospective, observational study.
AB  == background: various dosing strategies for cefepime have been developed in an effort to maximize pharmacodynamic exposure of this agent against gram-negative infections. an assessment of cefepime dosing strategies is warranted given recent reports of poorer treatment outcomes associated with cefepime compared with other antibiotics, particularly in patients infected with gram-negative organisms with  elevated mics. objectives: the aims of this study were to compare the efficacy of cefepime iv at a dose of 1 g q8h (adjusted based on renal function) with those of other appropriate antimicrobials in the treatment of gramnegative pulmonary and bloodstream infections and to identify risk factors for treatment failure. methods: this single-center, open-label, prospective, observational study was conducted at a tertiary care center (barnes-jewish hospital, st. louis, missouri). isolates from infections in adult patients with bacteremia or pulmonary infection caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, or citrobacter freundii were assessed in a noninterventional manner. infections were identified using an electronic notification system. patients receiving appropriate monotherapy against the studied isolate within 24 hours of culture attainment were stratified into 1 of 3 cohorts according to treatment outcome, as follows: treatment success (resolution of initial fever or elevated white blood cell count to normal values plus the presence of repeat negative cultures from the initial site or below the quantitative definition for infection), improvement (treatment success without repeat negative cultures), or treatment failure (persistent or repeat positive cultures for the original organism at the infected site despite appropriate and adequate antimicrobial therapy, lack of resolution in fever or leukocytosis, switch to an alternative antibiotic, or the addition of another antibiotic with gram-negative coverage after > or =3 days of the initial regimen, relapse of infection within 14 days, or mortality attributable to the index infection). multivariate regression analysis was used to examine risk factors associated with treatment failure. results: data from 120 patients (56.7% male; mean age, 62.2 years) were analyzed. treatment failure occurred in 48.6% (36/74) of patients who received cefepime versus 32.6% (15/46) of those who received other antibiotics; this difference was not statistically significant. the proportion of patients with markers of increased severity of illness (intensive care unit [p = 0.005] and mechanical ventilation [p = 0.002]) was significantly greater in the cefepime group compared with the group that received other antibiotics. multivariate logistic regression identified infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa (adjusted odds ratio [aor], 1.40 [95% ci, 1.01-2.00]) and mechanical ventilation (aor, 7.08 [95% ci, 1.80-31.3]) as being associated with treatment failure in patients who received cefepime. mechanical ventilation (aor, 3.97 [95% ci, 1.47-11.1]) and neutropenia (aor, 5.26 [95% ci, 1.28-20.0]) were independent predictors of treatment failure among all patients studied. conclusions: based on these results in this small cohort, the efficacy of this cefepime dosing strategy (1 g q8h) appeared to be similar to that of other antimicrobials.

TI  == the culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  == aim: traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. aim: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus  to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. methods: a cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. after surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. identification of bacteria as well as computation of  mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. wilcoxon's paired and chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. results: thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (p<0.001). the microorganisms identified were escherichia coli (14 cases) and enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and  enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (p<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (p<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. conclusion: the neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. this difference might be attributed to the presence of rokitansky-aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the  region.

TI  == influence of extended-spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance.
AB  == purpose: the influence of extended- spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance was studied. methods: hospital pharmacists were asked to provide data on antimicrobial use and bacterial susceptibilities. defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam were assessed for significant associations with gram-negative susceptibility. to account for midyear changes in usage patterns and the lag between changes in usage and resistance, susceptibility over two-year periods was evaluated. results: susceptibility data of more than 300,000 gram-negative isolates, representing 10 species of interest, were provided by 82  u.s. hospitals. two-year periods (n = 45) were evaluable for 25 hospitals, containing 159 hospital-years of data and 204,513 clinical isolates. use of cefepime increased, while use of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam decreased. excluding pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteria were most susceptible to cefepime, followed by piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime. significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to the antibiotics themselves were observed with ceftazidime (enterobacter aerogenes) and ceftriaxone (escherichia coli). extended-spectrum beta-lactams associated with significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to other beta-lactams included cefepime (e. aerogenes and e. coli susceptibility to ceftazidime), ceftazidime (enterobacter cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), ceftriaxone (e. cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), piperacillin-tazobactam (e. cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa susceptibility to cefepime). there were insufficient susceptibility data to allow for impact analysis for piperacillin-tazobactam. conclusion: use of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with variably changing susceptibilities of several key gram-negative bacteria, either to themselves or to each other. despite the increased use of cefepime, gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cefepime remained high.

TI  == occurrence of esbl & amp-c beta-lactamases & susceptibility to newer antimicrobial agents in complicated uti.
AB  == background & objective: production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and ampc beta-lactamases are the most common mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance in gram negative bacilli. a prospective study was undertaken to know the occurrence of esbl and ampc producing strains and their antibiotic susceptibilities to newer agents to guide empirical therapy for complicated urinary tract infections. methods: over a period of five months (january to may 2003), organisms grown in pure culture and in significant numbers from urine sample were identified by standard biochemical tests and antibiotic susceptibility determined by disc diffusion method. gram-negative bacilli that were resistant to third generation cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin/amikacin were defined as highly drug resistant uropathogens (hdru). hdru were further tested for esbl and ampc phenotypes. results: uropathogens were isolated in significant numbers in 1979 (21.8%) of the total 9,072 samples, of which 438(22.1%) were hdru. two hundred and five consecutive hdru isolates were tested for esbl production and 36.5 per cent were found to be esbl producers. the highest positivity was found to be in klebsiella spp. (51.2%), followed by escherichia coli (40.2%), enterobacter aerogenes (33.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (27.9%). both esbl producers and non producers showed a high degree resistance to piperacillin (93.1 and 90.9%), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (93.4 and 90.9%), aztreonam (79.4 and 78%), cefepime (76.7 and 78%), and ampicillin-sulbactam (76.7 and 70.4%). the most effective antibiotics for esbl producers were imipenem (8.2% resistance), piperacillin-tazobactam (9.5%) and ceftazidime-clavulanic acid (23.2%). among esbl non-producers, piperacillin-tazobactam (31.06%), ceftazidime-clavulanic acid (49.2%) and imipenem (11%) were less effective when compared to esbl producers. fifty three piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam positive and 20 negative isolates were further tested for ampc production and found that all 53 positive isolates were also positive by for ampc beta-lactamase. interpretation & conclusion: overall, 22.1 per cent of our isolates were highly drug resistant, and esbl producers could explain only 36.5 per cent of hdru in our study. therefore, we assume that  ampc beta-lactamases are more important in our setting. based on our finding a test using discs containing piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam ( ptpc) disc at a distance of 20 mm would act as a useful screening procedure for ampc production as ampc beta-lactamase producers are more susceptible to tazobactam as compared to clavulanic acid.

AB  == metalloproteinases are abundant enzymes in crotalidae and viperidae snake venoms. snake venom metalloproteinases (svmps) comprise a family of zinc-dependent enzymes, which display many different biological activities. a 23.1 kda protein was isolated from agkistrodon halys (pallas, chinese viper) snake venom. the toxin is a single chain polypeptide with a molecular weight of 23146.61 and an n-terminal sequence (miqvllvticlavfpyqgssiiles) relatively similar to that of other metalloprotein-like proteases isolated from the snake venoms of the viperidae family. the antibacterial effect of agkistrodon halys metalloproteinase (ahm) on burkholderia pseudomallei (strains tes and khw), escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram-negative bacteria) and staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive bacterium) was studied at a concentration 120 microm. interestingly, we found that the metalloproteinase exhibited antibacterial properties and was more active against s. aureus, p. vulgaris, p. mirabilis and multi-drug resistant b. pseudomallei (strain khw) bacteria. ahm variants with high bacteriostatic activity (mic 1.875-60 microm) also tended to be less cytotoxic against u-937 human monocytic cells up to 1 mm concentrations. these results suggest that this  metalloprotein exerts its antimicrobial effect by altering membrane packing and inhibiting mechanosensitive targets.

TI  == evaluation of phytochemical and antibacterial potential of helicteres isora l. fruits against enteric bacterial pathogens.
AB  == antibacterial activities of aqueous, acetone, ethanol and methanol extracts of fruits of helicteres isora (mororphali) were studied. the fruit aqueous extracts  of h. isora showed prominent antibacterial activities against e. coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, salmonella typhimurium and proteus vulgaris; moderate activity against enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi  and least activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the aqueous extract showed maximal, the ethanol and methanol extract moderate and acetone extracts least antibacterial activities. phytochemical screening revealed the presence of carbohydrates, anthraquinon glycosides, proteins, tannin and phenolic compounds and steroids these antibacterial properties supports its traditional use of fruits of h. isora in the treatment of enteric or diarrhoeal infections.

AB  == a series of guanylsulfonamides, 2-amino-9-[2-substituted-4-(4-substituted piperidin-1-sulfonyl)phenyl]-1,9-dihydropurin-6-ones, was synthesized by adopting reductive aminoformylation of 2-amino-5-nitro-6-[4-(piperidin-1-sulfonyl)phenylamino]-3h-pyrimidin- 4-one and subsequent intramolecular ring condensation as key steps. all the guanylsulfonamides were assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activities against klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus faecalis, and their antifungal activities against aspergillus flavus, aspergillus niger, and candida albicans. of the guanylsulfonamides, 13e and 13f displayed better antibacterial activities  than that of norfloxacin against the bacterial strains s. aureus and s. faecalis  except 13f against s. faecalis, which exhibited the activity similar to that of norfloxacin. against the fungal strains a. flavus and a. niger, 13g and 13h showed similar activities to that of griseoflavin-16 except 13h against a. niger, which displayed a profound drop in the activity compared to that of griseoflavin-16. the remarkable inhibition of the growth of the bacterial and fungal strains makes these substances promising microbial agents.

TI  == sperm motility changes after coincubation with various uropathogenic microorganisms: an in vitro experimental study.
AB  == objective: we investigated the relationship between semen motility and various uropathogenic microorganisms. materials and methods: semen specimens from healthy donors were divided into portions and incubated with uropathogenic microorganisms in concentrations varying from 2 x 10 to 2 x 10(7) microorganisms/ml(-1). uninfected suspensions of spermatozoa served as controls. in all samples, sperm motility was examined at the second, fourth, and sixth hours after incubation in  order to assess motility as a function of time. enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli were used as bacterial agents. besides these bacterial strains, candida albicans was also used. results and conclusions: observed negative impact on sperm motility was not correlated with microorganism  concentration. however, until a certain concentration threshold, this impact was  prominent. regardless of the microorganism, this deleterious effect could not be  confirmed in specimens coincubated with lower microorganism concentration. no or  poor correlation was found between motility and bacteria concentration except with e. aerogenes at the second hour. the data indicates that sperm function impairment is not related to direct sperm and bacteria interaction. instead, bacterial concentration enough to change the environment or to consume high energy might result in motility loss.

TI  == carbapenemases: molecular diversity and clinical consequences.
AB  == carbapenemases are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze most beta-lactams including carbapenems. carbapenemases are classified in four molecular classes; those belonging to class a are the chromosomally-encoded and clavulanic acid-inhibited  imi, nmc-a and sme, identified in enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens; the plasmid-encoded kpc enzymes identified in enterobacteriaceae (and rarely in pseudomonas aeruginosa); and the ges-type enzymes identified in enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa. the class b enzymes are the most clinically-significant carbapenemases; they are metallo-beta-lactamases, mostly of the imp and the vim series. they have been reported worldwide and their genes  are plasmid- and integron-located, hydrolyzing all beta-lactams with the exception of aztreonam. one single plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase, cmy-10,  identified in an enterobacter aerogenes isolate, has been shown to be a cephaslosporinase with some carbapenemase properties. finally, the class d carbapenemases are being increasingly reported, mostly in acinetobacter baumannii, and they compromise the efficacy of imipenem and meropenem significantly.

TI  == incidence of class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in champagne-ardenne (france): a 1 year prospective study.
AB  == objectives: to assess the frequency and diversity of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in the champagne-ardenne region france, and to identify genetic elements associated with the bla(ctx-m) genes. methods: during 2004, all  the non-duplicate isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii  resistant to ceftazidime and of enterobacteriaceae intermediate or resistant to ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime, screening samples excluded, were collected in 10 public hospitals and 3 private clinics. bla genes were sequenced and bla(ctx-m) environment characterized by pcr mapping. results: in enterobacteriaceae (138/21  861; 0.6%), esbls were predominantly tem-24 (n = 52; 37.7%) and ctx-m-15 (n = 37; 26.8%). three new enzymes were identified, ctx-m-61 (ctx-m-1 group), tem- and shv-type. a. baumannii (n = 5) produced veb-1 and p. aeruginosa (n = 2) shv-2a. isecp1 was detected in 22/27 strains, disrupted in 7 of them. the is903-like element was downstream of bla(ctx-m-14) and bla(ctx-m-16). iscr1 was found upstream of bla(ctx-m-2) and bla(ctx-m-9), and iscr1 and bla(ctx-m-2) were located on a sul1-type class 1 integron. in comparison with 2001-02, esbl distribution among enterobacteriaceae showed an increase in ctx-m-type (44.9% vs  3.7% p < 10(-7)) due to escherichia coli ctx-m-15 and to the almost total disappearance of tem-3 (0.9% vs 51.2%). e. coli was the most frequent species (50.0% vs 5.1% in 1998) despite a similar prevalence to that in 1998 (0.5% vs 0.2%). conclusions: a careful detection of bla(ctx-m)-type spread to other species would help to anticipate clonal endemics such as those observed in enterobacter aerogenes tem-24.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the united states between 1993 and 2004.
AB  == during the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care  unit (icu) patients in united states hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. mics for 12 different agents were  determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. the 11 organisms most frequently isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), escherichia coli (18.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), serratia marcescens (5.5%), enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), proteus mirabilis (4.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and citrobacter freundii (2.0%). specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. e. coli and p. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with acinetobacter spp. rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study  period for most species. ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (acinetobacter spp., c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens) became more susceptible. the prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among icu isolates of acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae.

TI  == antibacterial activity of snake, scorpion and bee venoms: a comparison with purified venom phospholipase a2 enzymes.
AB  == aims: venoms of snakes, scorpions, bees and purified venom phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)) enzymes were examined to evaluate the antibacterial activity of purified venom enzymes as compared with that of the crude venoms. methods and results: thirty-four crude venoms, nine purified pla(2)s and two l-amino acid oxidases (laao) were studied for antibacterial activity by disc-diffusion assay (100 microg ml(-1)). several snake venoms (daboia russelli russelli, crotalus adamanteus, naja sumatrana, pseudechis guttata, agkistrodon halys, acanthophis praelongus and daboia russelli siamensis) showed activity against two to four different pathogenic bacteria. daboia russelli russelli and pseudechis australis  venoms exhibited the most potent activity against staphylococcus aureus, while the rest showed only a moderate activity against one or more bacteria. the order  of susceptibility of the bacteria against viperidae venoms was -s. aureus > proteus mirabilis > proteus vulgaris > enterobacter aerogenes > pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) against s. aureus was studied by dilution method (160-1.25 microg ml(-1)). a stronger effect was noted with the viperidae venoms (20 microg ml(-11)) as compared with elapidae venoms (40 microg ml(-1)). the mic were comparable with those of the standard drugs (chloramphenicol, streptomycin and penicillin). conclusion: the present findings indicate that viperidae (d. russelli russelli) and elapidae (p. australis) venoms have significant antibacterial effects against gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria, which may be the result of the primary antibacterial components of laao, and in particular, the pla(2) enzymes. the results would be useful for further purification and characterization of antibacterial agents from snake venoms. significance and impact of the study: the activity of laao and pla(2) enzymes may be associated with the antibacterial activity of snake venoms.

TI  == antimicrobial disinfection effect of a laundering procedure for hospital textiles against various indicator bacteria and fungi using different substrates for simulating human excrements.
AB  == recent studies confirm the increase of nosocomial infections and microbial resistance. one of the possible causes is infected textiles due to inappropriate  laundering procedures. most slovenian laundries use thermal laundering procedures with high energy and water consumption to disinfect hospital textiles. in addition to this fact, there is an increasing number of hospital textiles composed of cotton/polyester blends that cannot endure high temperatures of thermal disinfection. on the other hand, decreasing the temperature of laundering procedures enhances the possibility of pathogenic microorganisms to survive the laundering procedure. in our research, we determined the antimicrobic laundering  effect by simulating a common laundering procedure for hospital textiles in the laboratory washing machine at different temperatures by the use of bioindicators. enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium terrae, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were used for determining the antibacterial laundering effect. candida albicans was used for determining the antifungal laundering effect. swine blood, artificial sweat, and swine fat were used as substrates for simulating human excrements and were inoculated together with the  chosen microorganisms onto cotton pieces to simulate real laundering conditions.  it was found that e. faecium, s. aureus, e. aerogenes, and p. aeruginosa survived at 60 degrees c, but no microorganisms were found at 75 degrees c.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

TI  == metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-af), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ab), and benzidine (bz). the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, klebsiella pneumoniae,  and intestinal anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta98 in the ames salmonella mutagenicity assay. in addition, the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome p450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (co) difference spectrum. this was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-af, 4-ab, and bz into mutagens. the metabolic activation by pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome p450 enzyme. for those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a p450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.

TI  == gram-negative bacilli associated with catheter-associated and non-catheter-associated bloodstream infections and hand carriage by healthcare workers in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  == objective: bloodstream infections caused by gram-negative bacilli are a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in infants in neonatal intensive care units. this study describes the species of gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections in two neonatal intensive care units, compares characteristics of catheter-related and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections, and compares species and antibiotic resistance patterns of these organisms with those isolated from the hands of nurses working in the same neonatal intensive care units. design: interventional study. setting: two high-risk neonatal intensive care units. patients: neonates hospitalized for >or  =24 hrs. interventions: prospective surveillance for bloodstream infections was performed in two neonatal intensive care units from march 2001 to january 2003. hand cultures were obtained quarterly from participating nurses immediately after they performed hand hygiene. measurements and main results: there were 298 episodes of bloodstream infections among 2,935 admissions (5.75 episodes per 1,000 patient-days); 77 of 298 (26%) episodes were caused by gram-negative bacilli. among these, 47 (61.0%) were catheter-related bloodstream infections (2.61 episodes per 1,000 catheter-days). eleven and 24 gram-negative bacilli species were isolated from neonates and nurses, respectively. the most common gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections were klebsiella pneumoniae (38.7%), escherichia coli (21.2%), enterobacter cloacae (11.2%), and serratia marcescens (11.2%). in contrast, acinetobacter lwoffi (18.1%), k. pneumoniae (11.7%), e. cloacae (10.6%), k. oxytoca (10.6%), and pseudomonas spp. (7.4%) were most commonly isolated from hands of nurses. e. coli, p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae,  and e. aerogenes were significantly more likely to cause bloodstream infections than to be isolated from nurses' hands (all p < .001). although 39% of bloodstream infections were non-catheter-related, there were no significant differences in types of organisms or antimicrobial resistance patterns between catheter-related bloodstream infections and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections (all p > or = .35). resistance patterns were similar between gram-negative bacilli isolates from neonates and nurses' hands except for a significantly higher proportion of resistance to cefotaxime and gentamicin among  neonatal isolates of k. pneumoniae (p < .05). conclusions: gram-negative bacilli  species isolated from neonatal bloodstream infections and nurses' hands varied significantly. clean hands of providers are an unlikely source of endemic gram-negative bacilli, suggesting that prevention strategies should focus more on control of endogenous neonatal flora or environmental sources.

TI  == antidiarrhoeal activity of the methanol extract of the barks of xylocarpus moluccensis in castor oil- and magnesium sulphate-induced diarrhoea models in mice.
AB  == the methanol (meoh) extract of the barks of xylocarpus moluccensis, and different fractions of this extract were studied for antidiarrhoeal activity using castor oil- and magnesium sulphate-induced diarrhoea models in mice. at the doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg, the meoh extract showed significant antidiarrhoeal activity in both models. the etoac fraction (eaf) and the residual meoh fraction (rmf) exhibited similar activity using a dose of 250 mg/kg in both models. no antidiarrhoeal activity was observed with the chloroform fraction (chf) at the test doses. when tested for antibacterial effect, the meoh extract displayed moderate inhibitory activity against escherichia coli, vibrio cholera, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermis, shigella dysentery, staphylococcus pyogenes, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. while the chf inhibited the growth of escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae, shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus epidermis, staphylococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the eaf was active against all test organisms except vibrio cholera and staphylococcus epidermis. the rmf inhibited the growth of all the test organisms with moderate zone of inhibition.  on the basis of these findings, it can be assumed that xylocarpus moluccensis could be a potential source for novel 'lead' discovery for antidiarrhoeal drug development.

TI  == chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different anatolian propolis samples.
AB  == propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. it is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. the aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from four different anatolian propolis samples and examined whether eep inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. for the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mic) were determined by using macrodilution method. the mic values of the most effective propolis (tb) were 2 microg/ml for streptococcus sobrinus and enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for micrococcus luteus, candida albicans and c. krusei, 8 microg/ml for streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for escherichia coli and c. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the chemical compositions of eep's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. the main compounds of four anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. although propolis samples were collected from different regions of anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the gram positive bacteria and yeasts. propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and c. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == detection of low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  == biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. an antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. the principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture listeria cells on the fiber. capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. a cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, c11e9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by  launching a 635-nm laser light from an analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. this immunosensor was specific for l. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other listeria species or other microorganisms, including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, lactobacillus plantarum, carnobacterium gallinarum, hafnia alvei, corynebacterium glutamicum, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. the sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) cfu/ml for a pure culture of l. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees c. when l. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees c with 3.5% nacl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) cfu/ml, respectively. in less  than 24 h, this method could detect l. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 cfu/g after enrichment in buffered listeria enrichment broth.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == comparative in vitro and in vivo study of nine alcohol-based handrubs.
AB  == background: hygienic hand disinfection using alcohol-based handrubs (ahrs) is an  alternative method to conventional handwashing in hospital wards. because a documented choice of such products would consider data from in-care evaluation, we designed a comparative study of 9 ahrs both in vitro and in vivo in actual care conditions. methods: the bactericidal activity of ahrs was first measured in vitro against 4 hospital strains exhibiting multiple antibiotic resistance: acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter aerogenes. in a second time, ahrs were tested in an intensive care unit for antibacterial activity against the cutaneous flora of personnel hands and for acceptance by the care personnel. results: the 9 ahrs could be classified in 3 groups on the basis of their in vitro activity: products of the first group  showed a bactericidal activity higher than 4 log(10) against the 4 strains. only  1 of these products presented simultaneously an effective antibacterial activity  against the cutaneous flora of care personnel hands and a good acceptance by the  care personnel. conclusion: the in vitro study allowed the differentiation of the ahrs tested on the basis of bactericidal activity, but evaluation in an in-care situation allowed further discrimination through both antibacterial activity and  acceptance. thus, the combination of in vitro and in vivo evaluations should provide helpful arguments in the choice of ahrs.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

TI  == leitbakteria of microbial biofilm communities causing occlusion of biliary stents.
AB  == biliary stents inserted to relieve obstructive jaundice caused by biliary or pancreatic malignancies inevitably become occluded by microbial growth in the form of diverse microbial community biofilms. the scarce information available on these communities is based on cultivation methods, but such methods usually provide distorted overviews of community composition, so commonalities and differences in biliary stent communities are uncertain. we extracted dna and rna  from the microbial communities of 11 biliary stents explanted from nine patients  in hospitals from two different countries, amplified 16s rrna and rdna sequences, analysed the amplicons by the single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) method, and sequenced and deduced phylogenetic assignments of the major amplicons representing the major biofilm community members. we used a modified robbins device (mrd) to study de novo development of a stent biofilm from a patient stent microbial community. single-strand conformation polymorphism fingerprinting revealed the same six abundant bacterial species, here designated leitbakteria, namely klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and two unculturable bacteria distantly related to e. coli and shigella sonnei, in all of the stent biofilm communities. in the experimental biliary stent system, a sequential colonization of the stent surface was observed, with p. aeruginosa being the pioneer colonizer, followed by k. pneumoniae and one of the unculturable leitbakteria, followed by the remainder of the community. the overview of microbial biofilm communities of biliary stents gained by the use of culture-independent methods revealed new unculturable bacteria as major members of biliary stent biofilms, and the diversity of the abundant members of the stent biofilms is considerably lower than suggested from  earlier studies based on cultivation methods, and that communities from different stents from different patients in different countries are remarkably similar and  have similar major members, the stent leitbakteria.

TI  == comparison of microbial adherence to antiseptic and antibiotic central venous catheters using a novel agar subcutaneous infection model.
AB  == an agar subcutaneous infection model (agar model), which simulates the rat subcutaneous infection model (rat model), was developed to assess the ability of  antimicrobial catheters to resist microbial colonization. the catheters were implanted in the agar and rat models and the insertion sites were infected immediately or on day 7, 14 or 21 post-implantation. the catheters implanted in the agar model were transferred to fresh media one day before infection on day 7, 14 or 21. the efficacy of chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine impregnated (cs)  catheters, cs catheters with higher levels of chlorhexidine (cs+ catheters), minocycline-rifampicin (mr) catheters and silver catheters against staphylococcus aureus and rifampicin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis rif-r2 was compared in the agar and rat models. no significant difference in the adherence or the drug release was found between the in vitro and in vivo models. in both models, cs+ and mr catheters were effective against s. aureus even when infected on day 14, whereas cs catheters were colonized when challenged on day 7. cs+ catheters were  effective against s. epidermidis rif-r2, whereas mr catheters showed adherence when infected on day 7. cs+ catheters prevented colonization of all the organisms including, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans in the agar model, whereas mr catheters were effective only against s. aureus and s. epidermidis strains. silver catheters were ineffective against all the organisms. the agar model may be used to predict the in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters against various pathogens.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by e test.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by e test. we found that the mic(50) and mic(90) values against all members of the enterobacteriaceae family except serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (mic range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. the susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, although serratia and acinetobacter exhibited more or  less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (mic(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. the ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. we propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these  three fluoroquinolones in treating enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). these data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of acinetobacter and p. aeruginosa), as  well as s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae.

TI  == prba, a gene coding for an esterase hydrolyzing parabens in enterobacter cloacae  and enterobacter gergoviae strains.
AB  == the new gene prba encodes an esterase responsible for the hydrolysis of the ester bond of parabens in enterobacter cloacae strain em. this gene is located on the chromosome of strain em and was cloned by several pcr approaches. the prba gene codes for an immature protein of 533 amino acids, the first 31 of which represent a proposed signal peptide yielding a mature protein of a putative molecular mass  of 54.6 kda. this enzyme presents analogies with other type b carboxylesterases,  mainly of eukaryotic origin. the cloning and expression of the prba gene in a strain of escherichia coli previously unable to hydrolyze parabens resulted in the acquisition of a hydrolytic capacity comparable to the original activity of strain em, along with an increased resistance of the transformed strain to methyl paraben. the presence of homologues of prba was tested in additional ubiquitous bacteria, which may be causative factors in opportunistic infections, including enterobacter gergoviae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas agglomerans, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and burkholderia cepacia. among the 41 total strains tested, 2 strains of e. gergoviae and 1 strain of burkholderia cepacia were able  to degrade almost completely 800 mg of methyl paraben liter(-1). two strains of e. gergoviae, named g1 and g12, contained a gene that showed high homology to the prba gene of e. cloacae and demonstrated comparable paraben esterase activities.  the significant geographical distance between the locations of the isolated e. cloacae and e. gergoviae strains suggests the possibility of an efficient transfer mechanism of the prba gene, conferring additional resistance to parabens in ubiquitous bacteria that represent a common source of opportunistic infections.

TI  == multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  == multiple organ failure (mof) is the main cause of death in icus, especially affecting septic patients. it is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. the prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. the objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital icu related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of mof, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. the mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. the main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. a retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the icu in a 4 month period during 1999. fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by accs/sccm criteria. there were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency  patients). apache ii score was calculated on admission and mof, measured for the  first five days, was diagnosed using marshall and meakins criteria. the statistical method used was non-parametric mann-whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. the incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). none of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%),  died. there were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. the most frequent bacteria found were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant acinetobacter baumanii (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), enterobacter aerogenes (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant staphylococcus aureus (2). the mean  value +/- sd of apache ii (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). we conclude that mof due to sepsis in an icu is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high apache ii.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == phenotypic variability of beta-glucoside utilization and its correlation to pathogenesis process in a few enteric bacteria.
AB  == utilization of beta-glucosides is markedly variable in the members of the family  enterobacteriaceae. the results presented here provide molecular clues for evolutionary events that resulted in the phenotypic variability seen amongst the  members of these species. the genomic hybridization of selected enterobacteriaceae members with the escherichia coli bgl and cel genes resulted in detection of a complete homolog of the bgl and cel operons in shigella sonnei, a member that is evolutionarily closest to e. coli. however, the salmonella group of organisms have been shown to carry only a homolog of bglr and bglg regions and the deletions of the bglf and bglb genes. similarly, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and a non-enteric gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa have been shown to carry a homolog of the bglr and bglg regions and deletions of the bglf and bglb genes. the homolog of the cel operon could be identified in s. sonnei and salmonella groups of organisms. possible implications of these observations, in connection with the phenotypic variability seen in beta-glucoside utilization amongst these members, are discussed.

TI  == in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in europe and australia.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

TI  == h(2)o(2) produced by viridans group streptococci may contribute to inhibition of  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus colonization of oral cavities in newborns.
AB  == in an accompanying report, we showed that viridans group streptococci may prevent methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) colonization of the oral cavities of newborns. in the present study, we investigated the mechanism of prevention in vitro. most viridans group streptococci had bacteriocin-like activity and killed mrsa, burkholderia cepacia, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and candida albicans were resistant. the activity was induced only by h(2)o(2)-secreting strains and was inhibited by horseradish peroxidase or catalase in a dose-dependent manner. the mean concentration of h(2)o(2) produced  by 18 strains of viridans group streptococci (1 x 10(8) cfu in 200 microl of culture medium+/-standard deviation was 1.24+/-0.60 mmol. viridans group streptococci inhibited mrsa growth in saliva as well as in culture media. these results indicate that h(2)o(2) produced by viridans group streptococci may inhibit mrsa colonization of oral cavities in newborns.

TI  == [sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria from nosocomial infections. evolution in  resuscitation services of military hospitals].
AB  == objective: the aim of this study, conducted in the french military hospitals, was to monitor the course of the antimicrobial sensibility of bacteria isolated from  nosocomial infection in intensive care units. patients and methods: a prospective study has been conducted from january to december 1998 in all the intensive care  units of the french army. all the non-repetitive strains isolated from nosocomial infection were collected and sent to a reference centre. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method. beta-lactamase were identified by iso-electro-focalisation. antibiotics choice and interpretative criteria were those of the "comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie". results: a total of 849 strains are included in this study. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (20%) followed by escherichia coli (19%) staphylococcus aureus (15%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (11%) and enterococci (7%). imipenem was  the most effective antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae (336 isolates; 100% susceptibility). gentamicin (92%), amikacin (92%) third generation cephalosporins (83%), aztreonam (83%) and ciprofloxacin (78%) were also very effective. resistance to iii generation cephalosporins was correlated with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (blse) in 36% of cases. this blse could be associated with an over production of the constitutive cephalosporinase. the most frequent species producing blse were enterobacter aerogenes (75% of blse) and klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). among the 172 p. aeruginosa isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility were respectively: 71% for imipenem, 62%: tobramycin, 60%: amikacin 59%: ciprofloxacin 59% piperacillin + tazobactam, 55% piperacillin, 53%: ceftazidime and 44% for ticarcillin. seventy per cent of the 96 cons and 50.2% of the 126 s. aureus isolated were resistant to methicillin. a strain of s. aureus and 2 cons strains had intermediate resistance to teicoplanin. twenty per cent of the 59 enterococci strains isolated were resistant to aminopenicillins (10/11 strains of e. faecium), and 9% presented a high level of resistance to gentamicine. one strain of e. faecium was resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: the evolution of the susceptibility to antibiotics in intensive care units reflects the antibiotic pressure and level of cross-transmission. high rates of meticillin-resistance among staphylococci, of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics among p. aeruginosa and of ciprofloxacin among enterobacteriaceae are shown in this study. the implementation of appropriate strategies for surveillance and prevention is necessary.

TI  == convenient test for screening metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria by using thiol compounds.
AB  == a simple disk diffusion test was constructed for detection of imp-1-type metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. two kirby-bauer disks containing ceftazidime (caz) and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor were used in this test. several imp-1 inhibitors such as thiol compounds including 2-mercaptopropionic acid, heavy metal salts, and edta were evaluated for this test. two caz disks were placed on a mueller-hinton agar plate on which a bacterial suspension was spread according to the method recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the distance between the disks was kept to about 4 to 5 cm, and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor was placed near one of  the caz disks within a center-to-center distance of 1.0 to 2.5 cm. for imp-1-producing strains, the growth-inhibitory zone between the two disks expanded, while no evident change in the shape of the growth-inhibitory zone was  observed for caz-resistant strains producing serine beta-lactamases such as ampc  or shv-12. as a result, 2 to 3 microliter of undiluted 2-mercaptopropionic acid or mercaptoacetic acid able to block imp-1 activity gave the most reproducible and clearest results, and caz-resistant strains producing ampc or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were distinguishable from imp-1 producers by this test. a similar observation was made with imp-1-producing clinical isolates  such as serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter spp., and alcaligenes xylosoxidans. the specificity and sensitivity of this test were comparable to those of pcr analysis using bla(imp)-specific primers. therefore, this convenient test would be valuable for daily use in clinical laboratories.

TI  == comparison of five beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial pathogens using the time above mic at different creatinine clearances.
AB  == study objective: to compare the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (t>mic) for five parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial bacterial pathogens at different creatinine clearances (clcr). interventions: serum concentration-time profiles were simulated for cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem at clcr ranging from 120-30 ml/minute. the mic data for 90% of organisms (mic90) were collected for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and a weighted geometric mean mic90 was calculated. the t>mic was calculated as percentage of the dosing interval in which free concentrations exceeded the weighted geometric mean mic90. a t>mic of 70% or greater was considered desirable for all organisms except s. aureus (> or = 50%). measurements and main results: cefepime 2 g every 12 hours (clcr > or = 70 ml/min) and every 24 hours (clcr < or = 60 ml/min) achieved desirable t>mic for all enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus at every clcr. imipenem  0.5 g achieved desirable t>mic for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. freundii, and s. aureus at every clcr. however, imipenem t>mic was less than 70% for the following regimens and organisms: s. marcescens 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 90 ml/min), e. aerogenes 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 80 ml/min), e. cloacae 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 100 ml/min), s. marcescens 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 60-70 ml/min), e. cloacae 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 60-70 ml/min), and e. aerogenes 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 50-70 ml/min). ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours  (clcr 60-100 ml/min) and every 12 hours (clcr 40-50 ml/min) achieved desirable t>mic for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. aureus only. at every dose and clcr, piperacillintazobactam achieved desirable t>mic for s. aureus but  not for any enterobacteriaceae at clcr > 50 ml/minute. piperacillin did not achieve desirable t>mic for any organism, and none of the beta-lactams attained a t>mic of 70% or above for p. aeruginosa at any clcr. conclusion: at every clcr, cefepime achieved a desirable t>mic for more nosocomial pathogens than any other  beta-lactam evaluated. based on pharmacodynamic data, cefepime is an appropriate  empiric choice for treatment of nosocomial infections. however, when p. aeruginosa is a potential pathogen, empiric combination therapy should be considered.

TI  == impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. however, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. from 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens to 22 agents. linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing d, decreasing %s) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing d, increasing %s). the mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing d, decreasing %s and decreasing d, increasing %s relationships. multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.

TI  == the bacteriology of neonatal septicaemia in ile-ife, nigeria.
AB  == the incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in ile-ife, nigeria. gram-positive organisms, specifically staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent  of the isolates. listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic  neonates. pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and escherichia coli from 7 per cent. other gram-negative bacilli cultured were enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), citrobacter freundii, salmonella sp., and proteus sp. (2 per cent each). the bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. the study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. it highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.

AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative  bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.

AB  == qualitative changes in the culturable, aerobic bacterial flora isolated from the  tammar pouch have been documented over the period leading up to oestrus, at the time of anticipated birth and in absence and presence of pouch young of varying ages. in a group of 12 animals studied thirty species of aerobic bacteria were isolated. twenty five species were found in pouches with no pouch young, 9 in pouches with young less than 3 weeks of age and 9 in pouches containing older animals. gram positive organisms including corynebacterium spp., micrococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were the most frequent isolates, regardless of reproductive status. whilst gram-negative rods klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and escherichia coli were found in pouches with and without pouch young, but not in pouches close to oestrus, at the time of birth or in the presence of very young animals (< 6 days). while pouches without  pouch young displayed the greatest diversity of bacterial species, there were still significant numbers of bacterial species in those containing pouch young. results suggest that the microbial population of the tammar pouch does not seriously compromise the well-being of the young animal during crucial stages of  immunological development. the data are consistent with observations on the microflora of the quokka pouch but not with data from the koala.

TI  == bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in nottingham, uk, 1985-1996.
AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

AB  == we prospectively studied the acquisition of ceftazidime-resistant gram-negative bacilli (caz-rgn) in two surgical intensive care units (sicu) during a nonoutbreak period. surveillance cultures were obtained from patients at the time of admission and serially thereafter. caz-rgn isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). three hundred and forty-three patients were enrolled  from whom 1,621 baseline and follow-up cultures were obtained. the most common species isolated from patients were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22), enterobacter cloacae (21), acinetobacter spp. (13), enterobacter aerogenes (11), citrobacter spp. (10), pseudomonas spp. (non p. aeruginosa) (9), and stenotrophomonas spp. (7). for each species, pfge strain types were highly diverse; no single type was  recovered from more than four patients. twenty-eight patients acquired a caz-rgn  during the sicu stay; in six (21%), emergence of resistance from a previously susceptible strain was documented on the basis of matching serial strain types. transmission of caz-rgn between patients occurred but was infrequent, as judged by analyzing strain types of epidemiologically linked patients. in conclusion, colonization with caz-rgn in sicu was associated with diverse species and strains, as determined by molecular typing. emergence of resistance from previously susceptible strains appeared to be more important than horizontal transmission in acquisition of caz-rgn in a nonoutbreak period.

AB  == in a surveillance study conducted during 1992-1993 at 83 medical institutions of  different types and sizes (e.g., laboratories, community hospitals, teaching hospitals) and from different geographical areas of the united states, clinical bacterial isolates were tested for their susceptibility to eight comparative antimicrobial agents (cefepime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, and piperacillin). a total of 12,574 isolates were tested by either the etest method (ab biodisk) or a microdilution method (microscan) in the participating laboratories; 11.8% of these isolates were subsequently retested for quality assurance purposes by both methods in a central laboratory. the results obtained in the central laboratory were essentially the same as the results obtained in the participating laboratories. this article presents data for gram-negative and gram-positive isolates other than streptococcus pneumoniae, the results of which have been previously published. antimicrobial susceptibility results obtained with the two different minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) methods--microscan and etest--showed that  most isolates of enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to cefepime, exceeding the activity of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime, principally because of the  greater activity of cefepime against the species that produce bush group 1 beta-lactamases (predominantly enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and  citrobacter freundii). in addition, the activity of cefepime against pseudomonas  aeruginosa isolates was essentially equivalent to that of ceftazidime and greater than that of third-generation cephalosporins. most methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to all the cephalosporins, whereas methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococci were resistant. overall, the most active antimicrobials in this study were imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime, but the activity of all the antimicrobials varied with different species. categorically, the results from the microdilution and etest methods were equivalent.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial isolates to beta-lactam antibiotics from u.s. clinical trials over a 5-year period.
AB  == results are reported for agar dilution susceptibility testing of 3,075 isolates of aerobic bacteria collected from >200 u.s. institutions, located in 30 different states. these isolates were collected from 1987 through 1991 from patients who participated in cefepime clinical trials. cefepime susceptibility was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, and imipenem. to avoid duplication of strains, only initial isolates were included. cefepime minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) values for enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.5 microg/ml, except for two species, citrobacter freundii and providencia stuartii, with mic90 values of 2 and 1, respectively. the mic90 values of the other cephalosporins were higher, especially for enterobacter aerogenes and c. freundii. the mic90 values of cefepime for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (4 microg/ml) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 microg/ml) were similar to those of cefotaxime for s. aureus (4 microg/ml), and to ceftazidime for p. aeruginosa (8 microg/ml). streptococcus pneumoniae was similar in susceptibility to cefotaxime at 0.06 microg/ml. the activity of cefepime against a diverse group of gram-positive and gram-negative (1987-1991) bacteria isolates demonstrates the excellent activity of cefepime compared to third-generation cephalosporins and imipenem, particularly among c. freundii and e. aerogenes isolates, which were often resistant to other cephalosporins.

TI  == inactivation of glutaraldehyde by reaction with sodium bisulfite.
AB  == the microbiocidal activity of glutaraldehyde was inactivated by reaction with sodium bisulfite via formation of a proposed glutaraldehyde-bisulfite complex. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis of 2% (0.2m) alkaline glutaraldehyde indicated complete loss of glutaraldehyde at a 2.2:1 molar ratio of sodium bisulfite to glutaraldehyde. neither 1.7% (0.17 m) sodium bisulfite alone nor the glutaraldehyde-bisulfite complex was microbiocidal when tested against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and polybac polyseed bod seed inoculum. bacterial inhibition tests indicated that the glutaraldehyde-sodium bisulfite complex had no effect on the growth of sewage microorganisms at concentrations as high as 50-100 ppm (5 x 10(-4)-1 x 10(-3) m), with an ic50 of 230-440 ppm (2.3 x 10(-3)-4.4 x 10(-3) m), based on glutaraldehyde concentration. a 28-close bottle test showed a 5-d biodegradation  of 48% and 51%, and a 15-d biodegradation of 57% and 63% for 3:1 and 2.2:1 bisulfite to glutaraldehyde molar ratios, respectively. acute aquatic toxicity testing with daphnia magna demonstrated an lc50 of 41-109 ppm (4.1 x 10(-4)-10.9  x 10(-4) m) and a no-observed-effect concentration (noec) of 16 ppm (1.6 x 10(-4) m) for the proposed glutaraldehyde-bisulfite complex (based on glutaraldehyde concentration), approximately 10-fold higher than found for glutaraldehyde alone, indicating that the proposed glutaraldehyde-bisulfite complex is less toxic to the environment than glutaraldehyde.

TI  == incidence and susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative bacilli from 20 canadian intensive care units: 1989-1993.
AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in canadian intensive care units. design: the antimicrobial profiles of 1939 gram-negative bacilli isolated in 20 canadian intensive care units were analyzed using a custom designed microscan panel. setting: the majority of the hospitals were tertiary care institutions, but some community hospitals were included. patients: adult intensive care unit patients were the sources of isolates. main results: pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated microorganism overall, with escherichia coli the most common initial isolate. comparison of initial and  repeat isolates showed that p aeruginosa readily acquired resistance to all antibiotic classes except the aminoglycosides. enterobacter aerogenes developed resistance to ciprofloxacin and enterobacter cloacae demonstrated resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics except for imipenem on repeat isolation. other enterobacteriaceae remained susceptible. historical comparison with data derived  four years previously from 15 of the centres showed increased resistance of p aeruginosa and acinetobacter species to ciprofloxacin while other susceptibility  patterns remained stable. conclusions: the prevalence of gram-negative resistance in canadian hospitals is less than that reported in surveys done in some other countries, and was relatively stable over four years.

TI  == the relationship between antecedent antibiotic use and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in group i beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
AB  == gram-negative pathogens are increasingly resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (escs). using a prospective, case-controlled observational study,  we examined the prevalence and the risk factors for development of resistance to  escs in group i beta-lactamase-producing organisms. of the 386 isolates of enterobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter species, and serratia marsescens from 340 consecutive patients, 70 (18.1%) were resistant to escs; the  highest rates of resistance were found among citrobacter freundii (40.9%), enterobacter cloacae (31.1%), and enterobacter aerogenes isolates (18.9%). patients' prior antibiotic use and the mean number of antibiotics used were significantly greater in association with resistant vs. susceptible isolates. resistance was associated with prior use of ceftizoxime or cefotaxime (p = .008), ceftazidime (p = .004), and piperacillin (p = .001). other antibiotics were not associated with resistance. resistance was less frequent in patients receiving escs and an aminoglycoside. we conclude that prior use of escs is associated with the isolation of resistant group i beta-lactamase-producing organisms. concomitant use of an aminoglycoside may decrease this risk.

TI  == [utility of pyrrolidonyl-arylamidase detection for typing enterobacteriaceae and  non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == detection of pyrrolidonyl-aryl-amidase activity (pyr) is an important tool to identify gram-positive cocci, such as staphylococci, enterococci, streptococci, and other related genera. however, only few studies evaluating its usefulness with gram-negative rods have been published. thus, a prospective study including  542 and 215 unique clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae and non-fermentative gram-negative rods, respectively, was undertaken. strains were identified by conventional methods. pyr test was performed using a commercial kit, according to the manufacturer recommendations. positive results were uniformly obtained for the pyr test with the following species: citrobacter spp, klebsiella spp, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans group, serratia marcescens and s. odorifera. on the other hand, negative results were uniformly displayed by e.  coli (including inactive e. coli), protease group, salmonellia spp, shigella spp, acinetobacter spp, burkholderia (pseudomonas) cepacia and flavobacterium spp. variable results were shown in pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) malthophilia, kluyvera cryocrescens, and enterobacter cloacae. pyr  test proved to be a reliable and simple tool to rapidly distinguish certain species belonging to enterobacteriaceae (ie. citrobacter freundii from salmonella spp, and inactive e. coli from k. ozaenae). further studies, including a wide diversity of species, are required to assess usefulness of the pyr test for the identification of non-fermentative gram-negative rods.

TI  == a comparative study of the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux api20e and api20ne identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  == the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter (crystal, becton dickinson microbiology systems) is a new multi-test identification system for gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. one hundred and three selected  gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate api20e or api20ne (biomerieux) reading after overnight incubation. the isolates included in the study, and the number tested,  were as follows: acinetobacter sp, 8; aeromonas hydrophila, 1; citrobacter diversus, 1; citrobacter freundii, 1; escherichia coli, 13; enterobacter aerogenes, 10; enterobacter agglomerans, 2; enterobacter cloacae, 6; klebsiella oxytoca, 6; klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; morganella morganii, 2; proteus mirabilis, 6; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; salmonella sp, 2; salmonella typhi, 1; serratia marcescens, 1; shigella sonnei, 2; shigella sp, 2; vibrio metschnikovii, 1; xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, yersinia enterocolitica, 2. the api20e and api20ne systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the api systems compared to 3 with the crystal. crystal is more convenient than api for routine clinical use because it  requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

TI  == the occurrence of duplicate lysyl-trna synthetase gene homologs in escherichia coli and other procaryotes.
AB  == the lysyl-trna synthetase (lysrs) system of escherichia coli k-12 consists of two genes, lyss, which is constitutive, and lysu, which is inducible. it is of importance to know how extensively the two-gene lysrs system is distributed in procaryotes, in particular, among members of the family enterobacteriaceae. to this end, the enterics e. coli k-12 and b; e. coli reference collection (ecor) isolates ec2, ec49, ec65, and ec68; shigella flexneri; salmonella typhimurium; klebsiella pneumoniae; enterobacter aerogenes; serratia marcescens; and proteus vulgaris and the nonenterics pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus megaterium were  grown in ac broth to a ph of 5.5 or less or cultured in sabo medium at ph 5.0. these growth conditions are known to induce lysrs activity (lysu synthesis) in e. coli k-12. significant induction of lysrs activity (twofold or better) was observed in the e. coli strains, the ecor isolates, s. flexneri, k. pneumoniae, and e. aerogenes. to demonstrate an association between lysrs induction and two distinct lysrs genes, southern blotting was performed with a probe representing an 871-bp fragment amplified from an internal portion of the coding region of the lysu gene. in initial experiments, chromosomal dna from e. coli k-12 strain mc4100 (lyss+ lysu+) was double digested with either bamhi and hindiii or bamhi and sali, producing hybridizable fragments of 12.4 and 4.2 kb and 6.6 and 5.2 kb, respectively. subjecting the chromosomal dna of e. coli k-12 strain gnb10181 (lyss+ delta lysu) to the same regimen established that the larger fragment from  each digestion contained the lysu gene. the results of southern blot analysis of  the other bacterial strains revealed that two hybridizable fragments were obtained from all of the e. coli and ecor collection strains examined and s. flexneri, k. pneumoniae, and e. aerogenes. only one lysu homolog was found with s. typhimurium and s. marcescens, and none was obtained with p. vulgaris. a single hybridizable band was found with both p. aeruginose and b, megaterium. these results show that the dual-gene lysrs system is not confined to e. coli k-12 and indicate that it may have first appeared in the genus enterobacter.

TI  == multicentre comparative study on the antibacterial activity of fk-037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of fk-037, a new parenteral cephalosporin structurally related to cefpirome and cefepime, was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, cefpirome, cefepime, imipenem and meropenem against 1,837 clinical isolates obtained from three spanish hospitals. fk-037 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae isolates at < or = 0.25 microgram/ml, with the exception of enterobacter aerogenes (mic90 1 microgram/ml), enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii (mic90 8 micrograms/ml). in cefotaxime- and ceftazidime-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing shv-2 and shv-6 beta-lactamases, the activity of fk-037, cefpirome and cefepime was similar (mic  range 0.25-32 micrograms/ml). in enterobacteriaceae strains hyper-producing chromosomally inducible beta-lactamases, fk-037 (mic90 range, 0.25-8 micrograms/ml) was 8- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime and ceftazidime but  two- to eightfold less active than cefpirome and cefepime. fk-037 and cefpirome were twofold more active than ceftazidime and cefepime against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, with mic90 values of 16 micrograms/ml. the activity of fk-037, cefpirome and cefepime was two- to eightfold lower in ceftazidime-resistant derepressed pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants. fk-037 (mic range, 0.12-2 micrograms/ml) and the other beta-lactam agents tested were active  against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci; however, only cefpirome and, particularly, fk-037 (mic90 of 32 micrograms/ml) displayed some activity against  methicillin-resistant strains. in penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, the mic90s of fk-037 were 0.03, 0.5 and 1 microgram/ml, respectively.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

AB  == the recovery of bacteria and the speed of detection of microbial growth in platelet concentrates (pc) were studied, comparing a novel automated blood culture system (bact/alert) with two traditional methods. full-scale experiments  were performed with a total of 33 units of pc (average content 320 x 10(9) platelets per unit) obtained from pooled buffy coats. six strains known as possible pc contaminants were tested: s. epidermidis, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, b. cereus, e. aerogenes, and s. sanguis. using an inoculum of 50-98 bacteria/ml,  bacterial contamination was detected in all of 11 pcs on 132 sampling occasions.  with a small inoculum (0.3-9 bacteria/ml), the bacterial contamination was detected in all pcs in which abundant growth appeared, but failed to be detected  in some instances where the bacterial content was very small. all of 11 uninoculated pc controls were negative. with the automated method the time for detection of a culture-positive pc was 6-16 h, clearly shorter than with the two  manual-visual systems. the new system provides a rapid, reliable, and labour-saving method for screening of bacterial contamination in pcs. this would  increase safety particularly if the present 5-day shelf life were extended.

TI  == t lymphocyte responses to antigens of gram-negative bacteria in pyelonephritis.
AB  == we showed previously that large numbers of t lymphocytes accumulate within a few  days in the kidneys of rats with ascending pyelonephritis induced with escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa. cd4+ t cells propagated from the lesions exhibited mhc-restricted proliferative responses to formalin-fixed bacteria of the species used to induce infection. in the present study we investigated further the nature of the antigens responsible for the t cell proliferation and studied the ability of different bacterial strains and species  to produce proliferative responses. we found that heat-killed bacteria were more  stimulatory than formalin-fixed bacteria, and that soluble supernatants of heat-killed organism were also effective. the stimulatory effects of supernatants were destroyed by trypsin and the responses were mhc-restricted. twelve different e. coli strains, with or without characteristics of uropathogenicity in humans, were all highly stimulatory to t cells derived from a kidney infected with a single e. coli strain. strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes,  and serratia marcescens--species of enterobacteriaceae closely related to e. coli--were also stimulatory, whereas more distantly related bacteria--proteus, morganella, and p. aeruginosa--were not. t cells propagated from kidneys infected with p. aeruginosa responded to supernatants of this organism, but not to e. coli supernatants. we conclude that a protein antigen (or antigens) shared by strains  of e. coli and related enterobacteriaceae, but not by other gram-negative bacteria, produce mhc-restricted proliferative responses of cd4+ t cells that infiltrate rat kidneys infected with e. coli.

AB  == three gene libraries of bordetella avium 197 dna were prepared in escherichia coli le392 by using the cosmid vectors pcp13 and pya2329, a derivative of pcp13 specifying spectinomycin resistance. the cosmid libraries were screened with convalescent-phase anti-b. avium turkey sera and polyclonal rabbit antisera against b. avium 197 outer membrane proteins. one e. coli recombinant clone produced a 56-kda protein which reacted with convalescent-phase serum from a turkey infected with b. avium 197. in addition, five e. coli recombinant clones were identified which produced b. avium outer membrane proteins with molecular masses of 21, 38, 40, 43, and 48 kda. at least one of these e. coli clones, which encoded the 21-kda protein, reacted with both convalescent-phase turkey sera and  antibody against b. avium 197 outer membrane proteins. the gene for the 21-kda outer membrane protein was localized by tn5seq1 mutagenesis, and the nucleotide sequence was determined by dideoxy sequencing. dna sequence analysis of the 21-kda protein revealed an open reading frame of 582 bases that resulted in a predicted protein of 194 amino acids. comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the gene encoding the 21-kda outer membrane protein with protein sequences in the national biomedical research foundation protein sequence data base indicated significant homology to the ompa proteins of shigella dysenteriae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. coli, and salmonella typhimurium and to neisseria gonorrhoeae outer membrane protein iii, haemophilus influenzae protein p6, and pseudomonas aeruginosa porin protein f. the gene (ompa) encoding the b. avium 21-kda protein hybridized with 4.1-kb dna fragments from ecori-digested, chromosomal dna of bordetella pertussis and bordetella bronchiseptica and with 6.0- and 3.2-kb dna fragments from ecori-digested, chromosomal dna of b. avium and b. avium-like dna, respectively. a 6.75-kb dna fragment encoding the b. avium 21-kda protein was subcloned into the asd+ vector pya292, and the construct was introduced into the avirulent delta cya delta crp delta asd s. typhimurium chi 3987 for oral immunization of birds. the gene encoding the 21-kda protein was expressed equivalently in b. avium 197, delta asd e. coli chi 6097, and s. typhimurium chi 3987 and was localized primarily in the cytoplasmic membrane and  outer membrane. in preliminary studies on oral inoculation of turkey poults with  s. typhimurium chi 3987 expressing the gene encoding the b. avium 21-kda protein, it was determined that a single dose of the recombinant salmonella vaccine failed to elicit serum antibodies against the 21-kda protein and challenge with wild-type b. avium 197 resulted in colonization of the trachea and thymus with b. avium 197.

TI  == survey of the prevalence of beta-lactamases amongst 1000 gram-negative bacilli isolated consecutively at the royal london hospital.
AB  == beta-lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the microbiology laboratory of the royal london hospital. this survey, performed between january and april, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. the distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. this increase was balanced by a decreased proportion  of enterobacteria. amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, tem-1 (especially),  tem-2, shv-1 and oxa types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. their frequency in escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst proteus mirabilis isolates. an apparent decrease in their frequency amongst enterobacter cloacae isolates, from  48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of p. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. in the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of e. cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia spp. and morganella morganii, and in 2/170 p. aeruginosa isolates. these proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (p approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were  found in 11/70 klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced tem-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified shv-derived enzyme.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of  pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new  quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it  maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.

TI  == the bactericidal effect of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase on bacteria.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase) on some of  the potential bacterial pathogens of the cow was determined. nagase treatment significantly decreased the mean log10 number of actinomyces pyogenes (p less than 0.01) and staphylococcus aureus (p less than 0.05) after 2 and 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees c. similarly nagase treatment significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced the mean log10 number of streptococcus agalactiae and pseudomonas aeruginosa after 4 hours incubation at 37 degrees c. nagase did not reduce the numbers of escherichia coli or enterobacter aerogenes after either 2 or 4 hours incubation. since nagase and presumably other lysosomal enzymes are free on normal mucosal surfaces such as the uterus it is suggested that this direct bactericidal activity may be an important component of the normal defense mechanisms.

TI  == distribution of an l-isoaspartyl protein methyltransferase in eubacteria.
AB  == a protein carboxyl methyltransferase (ec 2.1.1.77) that recognizes age-damaged proteins for potential repair or degradation reactions has been found in all vertebrate tissues and cells examined to date. this enzyme catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from s-adenosylmethionine to the carboxyl groups of d-aspartyl or l-isoaspartyl residues that are formed spontaneously from normal l-aspartyl and l-asparaginyl residues. a similar methyltransferase has been found in two bacterial species, escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, suggesting that this enzyme performs an essential function in all cells. in this study, we show that this enzyme is present in cytosolic extracts of six additional members of the alpha and gamma subdivisions of the purple bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma), rhodobacter sphaeroides (alpha), and the gamma enteric species klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. dna probes from the e. coli methyltransferase gene hybridized only to the chromosomal dna of the enteric species. interestingly, no activity was found  in the plant pathogen erwinia chrysanthemi, a member of the enteric family, nor in rhizobium meliloti or rhodopseudomonas palustris, two members of the alpha subdivision. additionally, we could not detect activity in the four gram-positive species bacillus subtilis, b. stearothermophilus, lactobacillus casei, and streptomyces griseus. the absence of enzyme activity was not due to the presence  of inhibitors in the extracts. these results suggest that many cells may not have the enzymatic machinery to recognize abnormal aspartyl residues by methylation reactions. since the nonenzymatic degradation reactions that generate these residues occur in all cells, other pathways may be present in nature to ensure that these types of altered proteins do not accumulate and interfere with normal  cellular physiology.

TI  == detection of ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-negative bacteria due to alterations in gyra.
AB  == two plasmids containing the cloned escherichia coli wild-type gyra gene were used to transform ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative clinical isolates to screen for dna gyrase a-mediated quinolone resistance. the results show that the technique is simple and applicable to a wide range of gram-negative species including e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the use of an arithmetical mic series of dilutions (as opposed to standard geometrical ones) was found to be essential during screening  for the detection of altered gyrase a. the observations were consistent with the  suggestion that dna gyrase is highly conserved among different species of bacteria and that gyrase a-mediated resistance can occur in all.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system.
AB  == chlorhexidine is widely used as a mouth rinse in the prevention and treatment of  periodontal diseases and dental caries. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system. the controlled release dispenser comprised a polymeric inner core matrix containing the medicament with an outer vinyl membrane controlling the drug release. the effect on the following bacteria was studied: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, wolinella recta, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. chlorhexidine-containing vinyl patches with a diameter of 5.5 mm were placed on blood agar plates containing the various bacteria. the plates were incubated aerobically or anaerobically at 37 degrees c for 24 h or longer, when appropriate, and examined for inhibition of bacterial growth. distinct zones of inhibition were seen surrounding all vinyl patches on all plates with all bacteria. thus, the vinyl dispenser appeared to be an effective vehicle for releasing chlorhexidine to a localized area such as the surface of a tooth, a periodontal pocket, or a root canal.

AB  == we undertook a prospective, randomized comparison of oral ciprofloxacin with standard parenteral therapies for the treatment of biopsy-proven osteomyelitis caused by susceptible organisms. following surgical debridement, the ciprofloxacin patients received 750 mg twice a day, and the other patients received a broad-spectrum cephalosporin or a nafcillin-aminoglycoside combination intravenously (i.v.). there were 31 evaluable patients in the ciprofloxacin group, treated an average of 56 days, and 28 in the i.v. group, treated an average of 47 days. clinical success rates were 24 of 31 (77%) for the ciprofloxacin group and 22 of 28 (79%) for the i.v. group. of the seven failures  in the ciprofloxacin group, one was due to a persistent klebsiella pneumoniae infection and six were due to relapse of the infection within 1 year of therapy.  of the six failures in the i.v. group, one was due to an enterobacter aerogenes strain which emerged resistant and five were due to relapse. the most troublesome etiology was polymicrobial osteomyelitis involving pseudomonas aeruginosa, in which five of six (83%) regimens failed. adverse reactions occurred infrequently, i.e., in 1 of 31 (3%) of the ciprofloxacin patients and in 4 of 28 (14%) of the i.v. patients, yet all reactions responded to therapy and none required protocol  deviation. our data indicate that oral ciprofloxacin monotherapy is as safe and effective as conventional parenteral therapy in cases of osteomyelitis caused by  susceptible organisms.

TI  == new screening test to determine the acceptability of 0.45-micron membrane filters for analysis of water.
AB  == during routine membrane filter (mf) quality control testing, irregularities such  as partial or complete inhibition of microbial growth at grid lines, abnormal spreading of colonies, growth in or along the grid lines, nonwetting areas, poor  colony sheen and metallic sheen on the mf surface with mendo agar, brittleness, decreased recovery, and severe wrinkling were observed with several lots of filters. to study these effects and to develop a more sensitive screening test for mf quality, we compared five different mfs with various types and degrees of  defects by using five stock coliform cultures and five different media. results showed that the enterobacter aerogenes-tryptic soy agar test system detected more mf defects than any other combination did and was superior to the escherichia coli-mfc agar american society for testing and materials method for grid line inhibition. filtered natural samples grown on the same media showed the same effects as were observed with the pure cultures. poor colony sheen and sheen on the mf surface were best detected with enterobacter aerogenes on mendo agar. the  use of tryptic soy agar and mendo agar with this organism permitted the maximum detection of mf irregularities. of the 142 mf lots tested by this method, 30% were acceptable, 10% were marginally acceptable, and 61% were unacceptable. this  method provides a valuable screening test for determining the acceptability of 0.45-microm-pore-size mfs used for coliform and heterotroph analysis and may also be useful in conjunction with other methods.

AB  == the bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefetamet (ro 15-8074) were compared with those of cefadroxil, cefaclor, ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin against a total of 400 bacterial strains isolated from nosocomial respiratory tract and auditory canal infections. the broth macrodilution method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. none of the compounds was effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains. cefetamet was very active against ampicillin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae. proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli strains with the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the strains tested ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/l. cefetamet at a concentration of 8 mg/l inhibited 90% of enterobacter aerogenes and 60% of s. epidermidis strains. in biophotometric studies, subinhibitory concentrations of cefetamet greatly lengthened the lag-phase and flattened the log-phase, the extent varying with the concentrations and species tested. it did not cause detectable lysis in the stationary-phase of the cultures. adding two to 32 times inhibitory concentrations of cefetamet to middle-log cultures, no or moderate lysis occurred., except with esch. coli. this observation suggests that cefetamet is primarily bacteriostatic for some of the strains tested.

AB  == four different intravenous catheter materials, brands teflon, silastic, vialon, and tecoflex, were evaluated in vitro for bacterial adherence after 2 and 24 hours' incubation in trypticase soy broth and after 2 hours' incubation in nutrient-free phosphate buffer (ph 7.2). the organisms used were pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the significant differences in in vitro adherence of the different bacterial species to the various catheters were then evaluated in vivo by intravenous injection of a single bolus of 1 x 10(5) organisms via tail vein of rats with previously placed catheters in their superior venae cavae. there was no association between the in vitro bacterial adherence and the tendency of the in vivo catheters to become colonized. results of scanning electron microscopy of clean catheters and those removed from the rats showed obvious differences in surface characteristics and in clot adhesion between the catheters. these characteristics did not correlate with bacterial adherence in vitro or colonization in vivo. it is concluded that laboratory studies of bacterial adherence to, physical characteristics of, and thrombogenicity of intravenous catheters do not necessarily translate into resistance to clinical catheter sepsis.

AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) is a preparation containing cpz and sbt, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. the antimicrobial activity of sbt/cpz was stronger than that of cpz alone. this increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of sbt was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and mic values. the mic80 of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of cpz alone was 50 micrograms/ml. mic80s of sbt/cpz against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of cpz, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. however, mic80s of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and  proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of cpz alone, and mic80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which  contained 30 micrograms of cpz and 30 micrograms of sbt. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate mic values. to interpret results of the showa sbt/cpz disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than mic  less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml  less than mic less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points  of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of s. aureus, e. faecalis, and p. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to mics. however, if different break points against p. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of  mics. antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == [pseudomonas aeruginosa and surgical intensive care units].
AB  == the prevalence of pseudomonas aeruginosa in intensive care unit (icu) is 19 per cent although its incidence in blood culture is only 3.5 per cent and remains the same even though the total prevalence of this bacterium increases. a review of the clinical results shows that this germ causes severe complications in only 3 per cent of patients. a study by epidemiological markers reveals the presence of  16 different iats serotypes in the icu, this distribution of the serotypes being  similar to this observed in ambulatory patients. the serotype 12 of ps. aeruginosa is multiresistant. in 1984, it represented 22 per cent of the isolated ps. aeruginosa, its incidence decreases in 1985 and in 1986 (14.5%). ps. aeruginosa seems weakly pathogenic for the surgical patients in the icu. on the other hand, the incidence of klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens (014 imm. serotype resistant to tobramycin), enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae increases in blood cultures proportionally to their total prevalence in icu. these bacteria are probably responsible for hospital epidemics.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (ddtc) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmtc) were investigated. both  ddtc and dmtc were effective against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). by agar diffusion, ddtc at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to  34 mm against mrsa. the dmtc produced slightly greater zone sizes against mrsa of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for dmtc against mrsa was 6 micrograms per ml. both ddtc and dmtc were also effective against enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella species, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. the mics of dmtc for klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, salmonella and citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the mics for proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. in addition, dmtc was synergistic with gentamicin against mrsa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. additive and synergistic effects of dmtc were displayed with gentamicin against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant  s. aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == oral ciprofloxacin in the treatment of elderly patients with complicated urinary  tract infections due to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the effectiveness and safety of ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic, were prospectively evaluated in the treatment of patients with complicated urinary tract infections caused by gram-negative organisms resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. twenty-five elderly (mean age, 70.4 years) patients (24 men and one woman) were enrolled. initial pathogens included pseudomonas aeruginosa (15 isolates), escherichia coli (five isolates), enterobacter aerogenes (one isolate), citrobacter freundii (one isolate), serratia species (two isolates), proteus vulgaris (one isolate), and enterococcus (one isolate). patients received 500 mg of ciprofloxacin orally twice daily for one week (mean, 6.98 days). results of urine cultures obtained during therapy were negative in all cases, and at one week post-therapy, 21 of 25 (84 percent) infections were cured. four patients experienced a relapse with p. aeruginosa. repeat urine culture specimens were obtained at four to six weeks from 14 patients who had cures at one week post-therapy, and seven continued to have cures. three patients had late relapses with p. aeruginosa, e. coli, or serratia  marcescens, and four were reinfected with new strains. five patients who received concomitant oral antacids had lower mean peak and trough serum ciprofloxacin levels than did patients not receiving antacids (p less than 0.05, wilcoxon rank  sum test). mild adverse effects were seen in seven patients: eosinophilia (one patient), eosinophilia and reduced white blood cell count (one patient), crystalluria (one patient), granular casts (one patient), elevation of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels (one patient), and nausea (two patients), but none warranted discontinuation of ciprofloxacin therapy. p. aeruginosa isolates from two patients who experienced a relapse showed increases  in minimal inhibitory concentrations from 0.13 to 0.5 and 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, to ciprofloxacin and other antibiotics. orally administered ciprofloxacin was a safe and effective therapy for complicated urinary tract infections in elderly patients.

TI  == incidence of staphylococcus aureus, coliforms and antibiotic-resistant strains of escherichia coli in rural water supplies in port harcourt.
AB  == the bacteriological quality of some rural water supplies in port harcourt was monitored over a 3 month period. the supplies were unsatisfactory as judged by standard plate counts (10(3)/ml) and the presence of presumptive and faecal coliforms and staphylococcus aureus. the recovery of potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g. pseudomonas aeruginosa) further substantiated the existence of health hazards. the most frequently isolated coliforms were escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae. coliform contamination was greater in well water than in river or stream water samples. an antibiotic sensitivity test revealed that 17.5-27.2% of e. coli strains were resistant to three or more antibiotics. escherichia coli isolated from well water samples exhibited the greatest degree of multiple resistance. some strains were resistant to all the six antibiotics tested. the danger of an epidemic of waterborne diseases in the communities as a result of drinking water from these non-potable  sources is noted.

TI  == antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (bw  a509u).
AB  == the thymidine analog 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (bw a509u; azidothymidine [azt])  had potent bactericidal activity against many members of the family enterobacteriaceae, including strains of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, and enterobacter aerogenes. azt also had bactericidal activity against vibrio cholerae and the fish pathogen vibrio anguillarum. azt had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-positive bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, mycobacterium tuberculosis, nontuberculosis mycobacteria, or most fungal pathogens. several lines of evidence indicated that azt must be activated to the nucleotide level to inhibit cellular metabolism: azt was a substrate for e. coli thymidine kinase; spontaneously arising azt-resistant mutants of e. coli ml-30 and s. typhimurium were deficient in thymidine kinase; and intact e. coli ml-30 cells converted [3h]azt to its mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. of the phosphorylated metabolites, azt-5'-triphosphate was the most potent inhibitor of replicative dna synthesis in toluene-permeabilized e. coli pol a mutant cells. azt-treated e. coli cultures grown in minimal medium contained highly elongated cells consistent with the inhibition of dna synthesis. azt-triphosphate was a specific dna chain terminator in the in vitro dna polymerization reaction catalyzed by the klenow fragment of e. coli dna polymerase i. thus, dna chain termination may explain the lethal properties of this compound against susceptible microorganisms.

AB  == the ftsz (sulb) gene of escherichia coli codes for a 40,000-dalton protein that carries out a key step in the cell division pathway. the presence of an ftsz gene protein in other bacterial species was examined by a combination of southern blot and western blot analyses. southern blot analysis of genomic restriction digests  revealed that many bacteria, including species from six members of the family enterobacteriaceae and from pseudomonas aeruginosa and agrobacterium tumefaciens, contained sequences which hybridized with an e. coli ftsz probe. genomic dna from more distantly related bacteria, including bacillus subtilis, branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus, did not hybridize under minimally stringent conditions. western blot analysis, with anti-e. coli ftsz antiserum, revealed that all bacterial species examined contained a major immunoreactive band. several of the enterobacteriaceae were transformed with a multicopy plasmid encoding the e. coli ftsz gene. these transformed strains, shigella sonnei, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter  aerogenes, were shown to overproduce the ftsz protein and to produce minicells. analysis of [35s]methionine-labeled minicells revealed that the plasmid-encoded gene products were the major labeled species. this demonstrated that the e. coli  ftsz gene could function in other bacterial species to induce minicells and that  these minicells could be used to analyze plasmid-endoced gene products.

TI  == inducible type i beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria and resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == mutants, showing either constitutive (depressed) or non-inducible expression of chromosomally-mediated type i beta-lactamase were obtained from clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, ent. aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the wild-type and mutant strains were compared for susceptibility to a range of beta-lactam antibiotics. derepression of beta-lactamase synthesis generally, but  not always, resulted in a marked reduction in susceptibility to the agents tested, including the '3rd generation' cephalosporins. in many cases, the observed resistance would preclude, or severely compromise, the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs. in this context, depressed mutants of enterobacter spp., citro. freundii and ps. aeruginosa could be of primary concern although those of  ser. marcescens, prov. stuartii and morg. morganii often exhibited equally high resistance levels to older beta-lactams. comparison of the susceptibilities of the non-inducible mutants with that of their inducible parents suggested variation in the beta-lactamase inductive potency of different compounds in different organisms. for example, cefoxitin was a powerful inducer in ent. cloacae, citro. freundii and one strain of ps. aeruginosa; similarly cefazolin and cefuroxime were good beta-lactamase inducers in ser. marcescens and morg. morganii. aminothiazolyl-oxime cephalosporins and ureido-penicillins were generally poor inducers. from such comparisons, the contribution of inducible type i beta-lactamase to resistance phenotype could be ascertained.

AB  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, salmonella, and shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit serratia marcescens and providencia species, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae had mics greater than 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae. cefbuperazone did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas species. hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml  and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis with mic90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the p99 e. cloacae beta-lactamase with an i50 of 1 microgram/ml. it was a less effective inhibitor of the k. oxytoca k1 and e. coli tem-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa and resistant e. cloacae. a permeability barrier in e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of  cefbuperazone's activity by edta.

TI  == aztreonam in the treatment of bone and joint infections caused by gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == aztreonam was used successfully in 17 of 17 patients with orthopedic infections due to gram-negative bacilli (11, osteomyelitis; six, septic arthritis). duration of treatment ranged from 14 to 55 days, and the period of follow-up was four to 18 months. causative organisms included pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, enterobacter gergoviae, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, and  enterobacter aerogenes. aztreonam was well tolerated. the only definite reactions attributable to aztreonam were asymptomatic increases in serum aspartate aminotransferase (sgot) and serum alanine aminotransferase (sgpt) in four patients; none of these reactions interfered with completion of therapy. adverse  reactions that were possibly attributable to aztreonam included rash (two patients), diarrhea (one patient), and leukopenia (one patient). all of these patients were receiving antibiotics active against gram-positive organisms in mixed infections in addition to aztreonam. aztreonam is a promising new monobactam without significant toxicity. it has good activity against gram-negative aerobic bacteria, including p. aeruginosa, and is effective in the  treatment of serious infections due to gram-negative aerobes.

TI  == a preliminary survey of aerobic bacteria in breast milk of mothers from the low-income group in nigeria.
AB  == the aerobic bacteria colonizing breast milk of the low-income group in nigeria were quantified to assess its suitability for use in milk banks. in parallel, the nutritional and health status of donating mothers and their infants were assessed by physicians. the aerobic bacteria contained in the specimens included streptococcus salivarius, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermides. in general, the microbial load found in these milk samples is lower than levels considered dangerous. an analysis of the results showed that 50% of the mother's milk is contaminated, 17% of which was infected with primary pathogens. there was no correlation between demographic data, nutritional or health status of either mother or infant and microbial load  in mother's milk. milk obtained from this socio-economic group, is therefore, considered safe for use in milk banks.

TI  == in vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. the compound was highly active against the common members of the enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. ym-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii. the activity of ym-13115 against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. against haemophilus influenzae ym-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. ym-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the concentrations of ym-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78  and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit streptococcus faecalis. ym-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. ym-13115 is extremely active  against p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == treatment of gram-negative infections with aztreonam.
AB  == twenty-one patients with serious gram-negative infections were treated with aztreonam. twenty of these were clinical and microbiologic cures; there was one clinical improvement with microbiologic persistence. no bacteria became resistant. cure rates were: bone and joint (11 of 11); skin and soft tissue (six  of six); pneumonia (two of two); perinephric abscess (one of one); and intra-abdominal abscess (zero of one). the bacteria responsible for these infections included pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), serratia marcescens (two), enterobacter gergoviae (three), enterobacter aerogenes (two), escherichia coli (one), citrobacter diversus (one), and hemophilus influenzae (one). aztreonam was well tolerated. significant serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase elevations developed in three patients, but none was symptomatic and all resolved after therapy was stopped. two patients in whom  a rash developed were receiving other antibiotics (vancomycin and metronidazole), making the cause of the rash unclear. diarrhea developed in a single patient with pseudomonas osteomyelitis, who also was receiving cefazolin for staphylococcus aureus superinfection of his decubitus ulcer. aztreonam was highly effective against gram-negative bacilli, including p. aeruginosa. the only clear-cut side effect was an asymptomatic rise in serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/serum  glutamic-pyruvic transaminase levels in three patients.

TI  == efficacy and safety of aztreonam-clindamycin versus tobramycin-clindamycin in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == a total of 80 patients were randomized to receive either aztreonam or tobramycin  for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-negative bacilli; all these patients received clindamycin concomitantly. a total of 53 patients were randomized to receive aztreonam-clindamycin; of these, 46 were clinically evaluable and 39 were bacteriologically evaluable. of the 46 clinically evaluable patients, 41 were considered cured, 3 failed to be cured, and 2 died during the study period of unrelated causes. of the 39 bacteriologically evaluable patients, 36 were considered cured, and 3 failed to be cured. there were 26 clinically evaluable patients in the group randomized to  receive tobramycin-clindamycin. of them, 22 patients were considered cured, 3 failed to be cured, and 1 died of unrelated causes during the study period. there were 18 bacteriologically evaluable patients in the tobramycin-clindamycin group; 17 were cured, and 1 failed to be cured. the most common pathogens isolated from  the patients were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all of the isolated organisms were susceptible to both tested antibiotics, except for a strain of pseudomonas cepacia resistant to both tested  antimicrobial agents and a strain of enterobacter aerogenes and one of p. aeruginosa that were resistant to aztreonam. very few adverse reactions related to the antibiotics were seen. these effects, when present, were transient and comparable in both studied groups, except for renal-function tests, which were altered in 7.7% of the patients randomized to receive tobramycin-clindamycin and  in none of the patients randomized to receive aztreonam-clindamycin. aztreonam-clindamycin is safe and effective for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli when the organisms are susceptible.

AB  == apalcillin, a naphthydridine derivative of ampicillin, was compared with ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone  against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and with cefsulodin and tobramycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the minimal concentrations of apalcillin at which 50 and 90% of hospital isolates of escherichia coli were inhibited were similar to those of mezlocillin and piperacillin (1.6 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively). apalcillin had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of piperacillin against citrobacter freundii and citrobacter diversus. against klebsiella, apalcillin inhibited 50% of organisms at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, similar to piperacillin. the activity of apalcillin against enterobacter (e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, and e. agglomerans) was similar to that of mezlocillin and piperacillin and greater than that of ticarcillin. the activity of apalcillin against proteus mirabilis was similar to  that of the other agents, as was its activity against indole-positive proteus and providencia. only 40% of serratia were inhibited at an apalcillin concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. apalcillin was as active as piperacillin but twofold less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis. it was as active as piperacillin, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa (apalcillin inhibited 90% of organisms at a concentration of 25 mg/ml). there was an inoculum effect and a difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration with beta-lactamase strains. apalcillin was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamase but not as well by cephalosporinases.

TI  == augmentin: laboratory studies.
AB  == clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam antibiotic which, although it has little intrinsic activity, is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases. when combined with amoxycillin its range of activity includes penicillinase-producing  strains of staphylococcus aureus and many of the beta-lactamase-producing strains of gram-negative bacilli. bacteria sensitive to augmentin include amoxycillin-resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli, in  addition strains of klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and bacteroides fragilis are usually sensitive. the beta-lactamases produced by enterobacter spp, proteus morgani, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa are less susceptible to clavulanic acid and these bacteria are usually resistant  to augmentin (1).

AB  == the growth-inhibiting behaviour of abacterial, liquid pure cultures made up of three water algae (hydrodictyon reticulatum, chlorella vulgaris, aphanothece nidulans) which were made to grow profusely in special culture containers under constant exposure to light and ventilation was examined in ten different species  of microorganisms during a period of contact of 4 days both in the light and in the dark. subjected to the test were the 5 pathogenic species staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and  candida albicans as well the 5 bacterial contamination indicators e. coli (faecal indicator), streptococcus faecalis (enterococci), enterobacter aerogenes ("coliforms"), staphylococcus epidermidis (dermic germ) and bacillus subtilis ("contamination germ"). it was found that --hydrodictyon reticulatum and aphanothece nidulans exert a strong antibacterial effect, while chlorella vulgaris provides no indication of a bacterial growth-inhibiting effect. --this antibiosis is linked with the assimilative activity of the algal cultures, as in  the dark no antibacterial action is discernible --the "antibiotic principle" must be liable to transitory or rapid disintegration because the algal cultures are ineffective in the dark and also culture filtrates of 5-days old algal cultures exercise no growth-inhibiting effect. with respect to the sanitation of waters it is important to state that a profuse growth of algae produces a certain, but hardly reliable "biological water disinfection" and renders difficult the assessment of the quality of a water-course as a result of the elimination of the usual contamination indicators. therefore, additional microbiological quality parameters must be used for assessment of pollution of swimming pools with strong algal growth.

TI  == ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  == the in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the united states. a total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against enterobacteriaceae. of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had ctaz mics < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. only citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime mic(90s) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode mic 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. more than 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8  mg/l. in other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and streptococcus spp. enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime mic90 >8 mg/l. only cefsulodin (mode  mic 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode mic 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against ps. aeruginosa. ceftazidime mic(50s) for neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the mic, and was relatively unaffected  by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). it perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of types i-v and bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. ceftazidime inhibited only type i ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the national committee clinical laboratory standards (nccls). quality control data are presented. tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible mics of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. staph. aureus was the  species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones  or mics. we found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (gr 20263) against routine hospital isolates and highly resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == ceftazidime was found to be highly active against routine hospital isolates of strains of enterobacteriaceae such as escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis, with the mean mics varying between 0.11 and 0.75 mg/l. it had marked activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa with a  mean mic of 1.8 mg/l which was comparable to tobramycin (11 mg/l) and superior to other aminoglycosides, penicillins and cefotaxime. although ceftazidime was considerably more active than cefuroxime and cefamandole against e. coli, k. aerogenes and ent. cloacae, its activity against strains with multi-antibiotic resistance and marked beta-lactamase production was much diminished, with mean mics between 5 and 21 mg/l. these results with ceftazidime suggest it will be a valuable parenteral compound in the treatment of severe bacterial infections due  to strains of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of fr-31564, a phosphonic acid antimicrobial agent.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activity of fr-31564 [sodium hydrogen 3-(n-hydroxyformamido)propylphosphate] against gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was investigated and compared with that of fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. the in  vitro activity of fr-31564 was markedly enhanced when combined with glucose 6-phosphate or fructose 6-phosphate, but not when combined with ribose phosphate, adenosine monophosphate, or glycerol phosphate. in vitro activity of fr-31564 also was enhanced by human or horse blood, but not by human serum. the type of medium had a great effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration, with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations achieved on nutrient agar, 8- to 16-fold less than with mueller-hinton, heart infusion, or trypticase soy agars. fr-31564  was more active than fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and citrobacter. it was less active than fosfomycin against serratia marcescens and proteus mirabilis and did not inhibit gram-positive cocci or anaerobic species. fr-31564 inhibited a number of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and some pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to the other agents. in the presence and absence of human blood fr-31564 showed bactericidal activity, and p. aeruginosa exposed to fr-31564 for  3 h showed a 6-h lag in regrowth. fr-31564 administered by the subcutaneous route was more active in protecting mice challenged with p. aeruginosa than was fosfomycin, carbenicillin, or cefoperazone. it was as active by the oral route in protecting mice challenged with e. coli as was fosfomycin, ampicillin, cephalexin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.

TI  == phagocytic and chemiluminescent responses of mouse peritoneal macrophages to living and killed salmonella typhimurium and other bacteria.
AB  == in the presence of luminol, resident as well as thioglycolate-induced and immunized macrophages emitted chemiluminescence more efficiently when the cells were exposed to living salmonella typhimurium than when they were exposed to the  same bacterium killed by ultraviolet light or heat. this phenomenon was observed  whether or not the bacterium was opsonized. the different response to living and  killed bacteria was also found with escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus morganii, and enterobacter aerogenes, but not with shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, and propionibacterium acnes. the results suggest that macrophages respond better to living, motile bacteria than to nonmotile or killed bacteria. the experimental results obtained with motility mutants of s. typhimurium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa confirm that macrophages exposed to the motile bacteria emit chemiluminescence more efficiently and ingest the motile bacteria at a much faster rate than the nonmotile bacteria.

AB  == binding of 125i-labeled human chorionic gonadotropin to pseudomonas maltophilia is dependent on time, temperature, and ph and the binding to this procaryotic species is hormone-specific and saturable. the equilibrium dissociation constant  is 2.3 x 10(-9) m. there are no cooperative interactions between binding sites (hill coefficient, 1.05). the number of sites is estimaated as 240 fmol/100 mug of protein. nacl and kcl, at concentrations from 1 to 10 mm, have no effect on binding. divalent cations (mg2+ and ca2+) and 1 mm edta inhibit hormone binding.  binding is destroyed by heat or by treatment with pronase of alpha-chymotrypsin and is increased by phospholipase c. binding of the labeled gonadotropin is not observed with other gram-negative organisms--e.g., escherichia coli, pseudomonas  testosteroni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, or enterobacter cloacae.

TI  == [infective situation in a cow barn contaminated with klebsiella mastitis].
AB  == the infection situation in a four-row cow-house for 153 animals with a frequent occurrence of klebsiella mastitis was subject to a detailed analysis. the following results were obtained after two collections of blood and udder-quarter  milk samples examined by the test-tube agglutination, gel precipitation, and bacteriological diagnosis methods: 1. streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from  milk samples 28 and 31 times, pseudomonas aeruginosa 15 and 19 times, staphylococcus arueus 16 and 19 times, klebsiella pneumoniae 6 and 6 times, acinetobacter calcoaceticus once and 4 times, enterobacter aerogenes twice and three times, and escherichia coli twice. the authors failed to determine the causative agent in 26--38 cows (20--30%) with a pathologically changed secretion. 2. double test-tube agglutination performed in a 30-day interval revealed suspected klebsiella antibodies having a titre of 80 + + and higher in 13 dairy cows (12%); however, the suspicion was disproved by the negative results of gel precipitation. 3. the final deduction concerning the exogenic character of klebsiella mastitis should encourage efforts for good housing, due nutrition, efficacious disinfection, and hygienic milk production.

TI  == [approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  == in this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. this system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (ph-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (uripret-g). a total of 130 cultures was investigated. the employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. they included the following species: candida albicans, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus inconstans, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, proteus rettgeri, proteus vulgaris, serratia liquefaciens, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium. employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of cefoxitin and cefamandole.
AB  == cefoxitin and cefamandole were evaluated in vitro against 263 organisms. studies  were performed in mueller-hinton and nutrient broth and agar employing inoculum sizes of 10(6) and 10(8) organisms per ml. at obtainable serum levels both antibiotics were bactericidal for nearly all strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus but were inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus. in agar, cefamandole appeared to be active against most strains of enterobacter and indole-positive proteus, whereas cefoxitin was active against indole-positive proteus but not enterobacter. moreover, in broth medium most strains of enterobacter were not readily inhibited by either antibiotic and only 40 and 73% of indole-positive proteus were inhibited by 10 mug of cefamandole per ml in mueller-hinton and nutrient broth, respectively. however, in both broth media, 10 mug of cefoxitin per ml continued to be inhibitory and bactericidal for most isolates of indole-positive proteus. cefoxitin also was bactericidal against four cephalothin-resistant strains of e. coli. these data suggest that cefoxitin broadens the spectrum of existing cephalosporins by enhancing the activity against indole-positive proteus species as well as some other enterobacteriaceae. on the other hand, with the exception of strains of enterobacter aerogenes, the apparent increased in vitro activity of cefamandole was demonstrated in agar and  not in broth.

TI  == acute severe mastitis in cows of the dutch-friesian breed (author's transl).
AB  == one hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. e. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by st. aureus (19%), c. pyogenes (10%), str. dysgalactiae (9%), str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, aerobacter aerogenes, kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and  p. multocida. in several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. the prognosis will vary with the causative organism. treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.

TI  == the fate of bacteria in frozen red cells.
AB  == units of blood were intentionally contaiminated with suspensions of either aerobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, enterobacter cloacae,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, sarcina lutea, seratia marcesens, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, paracolabacterum aerogenoides (enterobacter  hafriae), mima polymorpha or acinetobacter- calcoaceticus. when inoculation was made prior to glycerolization, the subsequent glycerolization, freezing, thawing, and deglycerolization resulted in roughly a two log reduction in the number of bacteria. when inoculation was made with a final concentration of between 10(1) and 10(5) organisms per milliliter, immediately following deglycerolization or following washing without glycerolization and freezing, no increase in the number of bacteria was seen after 72 hours storage at 4 c. three of the 12 organisms studied decreased in number during 72 hours of storage. these data suggest that the current 24-hour limit on the post-thaw storage of frozen red blood cells may  be unnecessarily restrictive.

TI  == susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to combinations of antimicrobial agents in vitro.

TI  == newer aminoglycosides--amikacin and tobramycin: an in-vitro comparison with kanamycin and gentamicin.
AB  == tobramycin and amikacin are new aminoglycoside antibiotics which resemble gentamicin and kanamycin respectively in pharmacokinetic, toxicological, and some microbiological respects. minimum inhibitory concentrations for these four antibiotics have been determined against 393 bacterial strains (13 species from eight genera) isolated from clinical materialkanamycin was the least active, 89%  of the pseudomonas aeruginosa strains being resistant. resistance was also found  in 21% of the klebsiella aerogenes, 16% of the indoleproducing proteus species, 4% of the e. coli and 3% of the enterobacter spp. tested. providenca stuartii strains were often resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin.apart from these exceptions, however, all the organisms tested were sensitive to all four compounds, gentamicin and tobramycin usually showing the highest intrinsic activity.amikacin was the most active compound against a selection of strains chosen because of their resistance to one or more of the aminoglycosides. thus, amikacin represents a significant advance over kanamycin and seems to be superior to gentamicin in terms of its in-vitro properties. this is especially the case in those unusual circumstances when gentamicin-resistant strains are a problem. we suggest that amikacin warrants further investigation since it may prove to be a valuable alternative to gentamicin in the treatment of life-threatening infections.

TI  == gram-negative bacilli in burns.
AB  == in a period of two years, 865 strains of gram-negative bacilli other than pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from burns were identified by a range of tests. the commonest species were proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and enterobacter  cloacae. many strains of klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes, and bacterium anitratum were also found.a large proportion of the strains were tested for sensitivity to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and carbenicillin, and smaller numbers of strains were tested for sensitivity to cephaloridine, polymyxin, streptomycin, sulphadiazine, sulfamylon, and trimethoprim. the proportion of strains sensitive and resistant to different  antibacterial agents varied widely with species of bacteria. a large proportion of the strains of e. coli and p. mirabilis were resistant to ampicillin, which was much used in treatment; resistance appeared least often towards nalidixic acid, kanamycin, trimethoprim, and gentamicin. multiple resistance occurred less  often among strains of e. coli than among klebsiella spp, enterobacter spp, and p. mirabilis. phage and serological typing of ps. aeruginosa showed that most infections of burns with this organism were due to strains previously found in other patients in the same ward. taken with other evidence, this supported the view that most infections with ps. aeruginosa were not acquired from the patient's own flora but from sources in the hospital environment.

TI  == organization of enzymes in the polyaromatic synthetic pathway: separability in bacteria.
AB  == ultracentrifugation in sucrose density gradients was employed to estimate the molecular weights and to determine possible physical aggregation of the five enzymes catalyzing steps two to six in the prechorismic acid portion of the polyaromatic synthetic pathway in six species of bacteria: escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, aerobacter aerogenes, bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptomyces coelicolor. the five enzymes were not aggregated in  extracts of any of the species examined, nor are the genes encoding these enzymes clustered in those bacterial species for which genetic evidence exists. (an initial examination of the blue-green alga anabaena variabilis indicates nonaggregation in this species also.) this situation in bacteria is in marked contrast to that found in neurospora crassa and other fungi in which the same five enzymes are associated as an aggregate encoded (at least in the case of n. crassa) by a cluster of five genes. in addition, also in contrast to n. crassa, no evidence was obtained for more than one kind of dehydroquinase activity in any of the bacteria examined. these comparative results are discussed in relation to  the origin, evolution, and functional significance of the gene-enzyme relationships existing in the early steps of aromatic biosynthesis in bacteria and fungi.

TI  == capacity of aspartic acid to increase the bacterial count on suspensions of escherichia coli after freezing.
AB  == the addition of 2% trypticase to a minimal salts-glucose plating medium increased the bacterial count of frozen and thawed suspensions of escherichia coli 451b cells, even when precautions were taken to remove toxic trace elements from the plating diluent. hydrolysis of the trypticase with hcl or h(2)so(4) reduced its count-increasing activity. treatment of the h(2)so(4) hydrolysate with a cation-exchange resin greatly improved its capacity to replace trypticase. addition of a mixture of amino acids approximating the composition of casein also increased the plate count when added at a level equivalent to 0.1% casein, but at 2% it depressed the count. tests of amino acids in the mixture revealed that aspartic acid could replace trypticase completely as a supplement to the basal medium. when added at a level of 2.5 mm, aspartic acid doubled and occasionally tripled the plate count of a suspension of frozen and thawed cells. glutamic acid, alanine, and to a lesser extent certain other amino acids also showed a capacity to increase the count. cysteine was without significant effect. serine and other amino acids depressed the count. none of the amino acids or other supplements affected the count of suspensions of cells that had not been frozen.  the effect of adding aspartic acid, cysteine, or trypticase to the basal medium on the bacterial count of suspensions of various strains of e. coli, aerobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, and two species of pseudomonas after freezing was examined. the response to the supplements was unique for each organism.

TI  == degradation of uric acid by certain aerobic bacteria.
AB  == we have isolated and identified nine cultures of aerobic bacteria capable of growing on an elective medium containing uric acid as the only source of carbon,  nitrogen, and energy. four of these cultures were identified as aerobacter aerogenes, two as klebsiella pneumoniae, and the remainder as serratia killiensis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacillus species. another culture identified as p. fluorescens required both glucose and uric acid for growth. when 23 laboratory stock cultures were inoculated into the uric acid medium, a. aerogenes, b. subtilis, mycobacterium phlei, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens were able to grow. these five cultures also grew when the uric acid was replaced  with adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, or allantoin, but growth was poor. in all of these media, including the uric acid medium, addition of glucose along  with the nitrogenous compounds yielded good growth. induction experiments demonstrated that the ability of a. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, s. kiliensis, s. marcescens, b. subtilis, and bacillus sp. to degrade uric acid is an induced property. of these organisms, only bacillus sp. accumulated a small amount of intracellular uric acid.

(university of washington, seattle), w. wiebe, and r. r. colwell. quantitative approach to the study of bacterial species. j. bacteriol. 85:1061-1070. 1963.-the stability of strains of various species of gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria was investigated by subculturing each strain through ten different media, testing the substrains so produced through a standard series of  tests, and analyzing the resulting data by electronic computer. strain stability  was shown to be high [similarity coefficient (s) >/= 80%], and some evidence was  obtained for species stability (s >/= 75%). the limits of variability for a species were studied by use of pseudomonas aeruginosa; 33 p. aeruginosa strains (from the american type culture collection) were tested and found to share a high level of similarity. an analysis was made of the distribution of positive characters among the strains, and the group was found to have a mean total of 35  characters (out of a possible 78 which were coded and included in the computer analyses) with a range of 33 to 39 positive characters in individual organisms. the frequency of occurrence of each positive character and the probability of mutual occurrence of pairs of positive characters were calculated. by use of the  quantitative and qualitative data so obtained, a hypothetical median organism for the p. aeruginosa group was derived. the species may then be defined as consisting of all strains which show an s relationship of 75% or more with the median organism. the general applicability of this concept is discussed.

TI  == action of formaldehyde on microorganisms. i. correlation of activity with formaldehyde metabolism.
AB  == neely, w. brock (the dow chemical co., midland, mich.). action of formaldehyde on microorganisms. i. correlation of activity with formaldehyde metabolism. j. bacteriol. 85:1028-1031. 1963.-the action of formaldehyde in concentrations sublethal for the culture appeared to be at least twofold. the first phase caused a drop in viability, followed by a second phase where bacteriostatic conditions existed. during both these intervals, formaldehyde was being metabolized. as soon as the organism had lowered the formaldehyde concentration to a critical level, the normal growth cycle was resumed, with a resultant increase in cell population.

TI  == in vitro biological activity of cephalothin.
AB  == chang, te-wen (tufts university school of medicine, boston, mass.) and louis weinstein. in vitro biological activity of cephalothin. j. bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. shigella, salmonella, and proteus mirabilis were the most  sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. escherichia coli and aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa and  herellea were highly resistant. penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of s. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with s. aureus. cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. this antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin g but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.

TI  == effect of bromidehypochlorite bactericides on microorganisms.
AB  == a new principle in compounding stable, granular bactericidal products led to unique combinations of a water-soluble inorganic bromide salt with a hypochlorite-type disinfectant of either inorganic or organic type. microbiological results are shown for an inorganic bactericide composed of chlorinated trisodium phosphate containing 3.1% "available chlorine" and 2% potassium bromide, and for an organic bactericide formulated from sodium dichloroisocyanurate so as to contain 13.4% "available chlorine" and 8% potassium bromide. comparison of these products with their nonbromide counterparts are reported for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus lactis, aerobacter aerogenes, and proteus vulgaris. test methods employed were the chambers test, the a.o.a.c. germicidal and detergent sanitizer-official test, and the available chlorine germicidal equivalent concentration test. the minimal killing concentrations for the bromide-hypochlorite bactericides against this variety of organisms were reduced  by a factor 2 to 24 times those required for similar hypochlorite-type disinfectants not containing the bromide.
