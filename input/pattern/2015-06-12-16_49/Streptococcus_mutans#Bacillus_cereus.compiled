TI  - Chemical constituents and biological activities of Albizia myriophylla wood.
AB  - CONTEXT: Albizia myriophylla Benth (Leguminosae) is a medicinal plant widely used in Thailand and other Asian countries as a folk medicine remedy for many ailments. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the chemical compositions, antibacterial activity, and cytotoxicity of A. myriophylla wood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The structure identification of the isolated compounds was established using spectroscopic methods. In vitro antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus and the cytotoxicity against KB cells of extracts and compounds from A. myriophylla were performed using broth microdilution and resazurin microplate assays, respectively. The lupinifolin content in A. myriophylla extracts was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: A rare flavan-3,4-diol (1) together with eight known compounds (2-9) were isolated from the wood of A. myriophylla. Compounds 4-9 exhibited anti-S. mutans activity, of which lupinifolin (5) was the most potent with an MIC value of 0.98 microg/mL, followed by its dihydroxy derivative 4 with an MIC value of 62.5 microg/mL. Compounds 4 and 5 also displayed marked antibacterial activity against B. cereus and S. aureus (MIC value 15.63-125 microg/mL) and showed strong cytotoxic activity against KB cells (IC50 value 4.95-12.55 microg/mL). The lupinifolin contents in ethanol extracts from two different collections of this plant originating from central and southern Thailand were 93.85 and 0.04 mg/g, respectively. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of compounds 1-4 from A. myriophylla. Compounds 4 and 5 showed potent antibacterial and cytotoxic activities compared with other isolates. The anti-S. mutans activity of A. myriophylla extracts seems to be related to the lupinifolin content.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antiinsectan phenolic metabolites of Dalea searlsiae.
AB  - Continued interest in the chemistry of Dalea spp. led to investigation of Dalea searlsiae, a plant native to areas of the western United States. Methanol extractions of D. searlsiae roots and subsequent chromatographic fractionation afforded the new prenylated and geranylated flavanones malheurans A-D (1-4) and known flavanones (5 and 6). Known rotenoids (7 and 8) and isoflavones (9 and 10) were isolated from aerial portions. Structure determination of pure compounds was accomplished primarily by extensive 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy. The absolute configurations of compounds 1-5, 7, and 8 were assigned using electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy. Antimicrobial bioassays revealed significant activity concentrated in the plant roots. Compounds 1-6 exhibited MICs of 2-8 mug/mL against Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus cereus, and oxacillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Aerial metabolites 7-10 were inactive against these organisms, but the presence of 7 and 8 prompted investigation of the antiinsectan activity of D. searlsiae metabolites toward the major crop pest Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm). While compounds 1-10 all caused significant reductions in larval growth rates, associated mortality (33-66%) was highest with flavanone 4 and rotenoids 7 and 8. These findings suggest a differential allocation of antimicrobial and antiinsectan plant resources to root and aerial portions of the plant, respectively.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria from naturally-fermented Manzanilla Alorena green table olives.
AB  - Manzanilla Alorena (or Alorena) table olives are naturally fermented traditional  green olives with a denomination of protection (DOP). The aim of this study was to search for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with technological properties of interest for possible inclusion in a starter or protective culture preparation or also as probiotics. A collection of 144 LAB obtained from Alorena green table olives naturally-fermented by four small-medium enterprises (SMEs) from Malaga (Spain), including lactobacilli (81.94%), leuconostocs (10.42%) and pediococci (7.64%) were studied. REP-PCR clustering and further identification of strains by sequencing of phes and rpo genes revealed that all lactobacilli from the different SMEs were Lactobacillus pentosus. Pediococci were identified as Pediococcus parvulus (SME1) and leuconostocs as Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (SME1 and SME4). Genotyping revealed that strains were not clonally related and exhibited a considerable degree of genomic diversity specially for lactobacilli and also for leuconostocs. Some strains exhibit useful technological properties such as production of antimicrobial substances active against pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans and Salmonella enterica, utilization of raffinose and stachyose, production of bile salt hydrolase, phytase and haeme-dependent catalase activities, growth at 10 degrees C and in the presence of 6.5% NaCl, good acidifying capacity and also resistance to freezing. However, none of the isolates showed protease or amylase activity, and also did not exhibit biogenic amine production from histidine, ornithine, cysteine or tyrosine. On the basis of data obtained, selected strains with potential traits were tested for their survival at low pH and their tolerance to bile salts, and the survival capacity demonstrated by some of the analysed strains are encouraging to further study their potential as probiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Antioxidant, antibacterial and antigiardial activities of Walsura robusta Roxb.
AB  - Walsura robusta Roxb. (Family: Meliaceae) is a well-known multi-purpose medicinal plant, and has been employed for a wide range of disease conditions without documented scientific data. In the current study, four pure isolated compounds, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (1), turpinionoside A (2), (+)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3) and (-)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4), were isolated from the leaves and twigs of W. robusta. Biological evaluation for free radical scavenging, antibacterial and antigiardial activities was performed. We investigated antioxidant effects of the crude extracts as well as the isolated compounds using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH), hydroxyl radical (OH), and superoxide anion (O(2)) scavenging assays. Three phenolic glucosides (1, 3 and 4) were found to possess strong antioxidant activity. They scavenged DPPH(*) with IC(50) values in the range of 51.5-86.6 microM. We also detected the superoxide dismutase-like activities in compounds 3 and 4 which are lignan glucosides, demonstrating potent superoxide scavenging activity with IC(50) values in the range of 0.8 and 0.7 microM, respectively. Other biological activities including antibacterial and antigiardial assays were carried out. Preliminary results demonstrated that most extracts, except the diethyl ether extract, exhibited inhibition zones against all Gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and S. pyogenes. Aqueous extracts of this plant species could inhibit Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Shigella sonnei. However, the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of W. robusta on all tested bacterial strains showed only weak activity, and their MBCs were greater than 25 mg mL(-1). For antigiardial activity, incubation with 2 x 10(5) trophozoites mL(-1) of the culture medium with the crude extracts at concentration ranged from 31.25 to 1000 microg mL(-1) demonstrated no activity (MIC > 1000 microg mL(-1)).
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  - The influence of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. A potassium salt of CLA (CLA-K) was tested against three Gram-positive strains ( Bacillus cereus , Staphylococcus aureus , and Streptococcus mutans ) and five Gram-negative strains ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Salmonella typhimurium , Vibrio parahemolyticus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Proteus mirabilis ). CLA-K-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the Gram-positive strains. The IC(50) value of CLA-K was 0.3 mM for B. cereus, 1.2 mM for S. aureus, and 0.3 mM for S. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mM for K. pneumoniae, 1.2 mM for P. aeruginosa, 1.8 mM for S. typhimurium, 1.8 mM for V. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mM for P. mirabilis. The CLA-K delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower CLA-K concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. All cells grown in the medium containing CLA-K contained CLA in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in Gram-positive than Gram-negative strains. Higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (LDH), protein content, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were evident in Gram-positive strains than in Gram-negative strains. These results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by CLA mediated through the lipid peroxidation of CLA in the membranes and in the medium.
TI  - Rhodomyrtone: a new candidate as natural antibacterial drug from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa.
AB  - Rhodomyrtone [6,8-dihydroxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-(3-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-9-(2-methylpropyl)-4,9 -dihydro-1H-xanthene-1,3(2H)-di-one] from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Aiton) Hassk. displayed significant antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius. Especially noteworthy was the activity against MRSA with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranging from 0.39 to 0.78 microg/ml. As shown for S. pyogenes, no surviving cells were detected within 5 and 6h after treatment with the compound at 8MBC and 4MBC concentrations, respectively. Rhodomyrtone displays no bacteriolytic activity, as determined by measurement of the optical density at 620 nm. A rhodomyrtone killing test with S. mutans using phase contrast microscopy showed that this compound caused a few morphological changes as the treated cells were slightly changed in color and bigger than the control when they were killed. Taken together, the results support the view that rhodomyrtone has a strong bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria, including major pathogens.
TI  - Towards on-site pathogen detection using antibody-based sensors.
AB  - In this paper, the recent progress within biosensors for plant pathogen detection will be reviewed. Bio-recognition layers on sensors can be designed in various ways, however the most popular approach is to immobilise antibodies for specific capture of analytes. Focus will be put on antibody surface-immobilisation strategies as well as the use of antibodies in the widely used sensors, quartz crystal microbalance, surface plasmon resonance and cantilevers. We will describe the available data on antibody-based plant pathogen detection and furthermore use examples from detection of the pathogens Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus anthracis, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli. We will touch upon optimal assay design and further discuss the strengths and limitations of current sensor technologies for detection of viruses, bacteria and fungi.
TI  - In vitro studies of the digestion of caprine whey proteins by human gastric and duodenal juice and the effects on selected microorganisms.
AB  - The in vitro digestion of caprine whey proteins was investigated by a two-step degradation assay, using human gastric juice (HGJ) at pH 2.5 and human duodenal juice (HDJ) at pH 7.5. Different protein and peptide profiles were observed after the first (HGJ) and second (HDJ) enzymatic degradation. The minor whey proteins serum albumin, lactoferrin and Ig were rapidly degraded by HGJ, while alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG) were more resistant and survived both 30 and 45 min of the enzymatic treatment. Further digestion with HDJ still showed intact beta-LG, and the main part of alpha-LA also remained unchanged. The protein degradation by HGJ and HDJ was also compared with treatment by commercial enzymes, by using pepsin at pH 2.5, and a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin at pH 7.5. The two methods resulted in different caprine protein and peptide profiles. The digests after treatment with HGJ and HDJ were screened for antibacterial effects on some selected microorganisms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Streptococcus mutans. Active growing cells of E. coli were inhibited by the digestion products from caprine whey obtained after treatment with HGJ and HDJ. Cells of B. cereus were inhibited only by whey proteins obtained after reaction with HGJ, while the products after further degradation with HDJ demonstrated no significant effect. Screenings performed on cells of Lb. rhamnosus GG and S. mutans all showed no signs of inhibition.
TI  - Structural elements in dextran glucosidase responsible for high specificity to long chain substrate.
AB  - Dextran glucosidase from Streptococcus mutans (SMDG) and Bacillus oligo-1,6-glucosidases, members of glycoside hydrolase family 13 enzymes, have the high sequence similarity. Each of them is specific to alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkage at the non-reducing end of substrate to liberate glucose. The activities toward long isomaltooligosaccharides were different in both enzymes, in which SMDG and oligo-1,6-glucosidase showed high and low activities, respectively. We determined the structural elements essential for high activity toward long-chain substrate. From conformational comparison between SMDG and B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase (three-dimensional structure has been solved), Trp238 and short beta-->alpha loop 4 of SMDG were considered to contribute to the high activity to long-chain substrate. W238A had similar kcat/Km value for isomaltotriose to that for isomaltose, suggesting that the affinity of subsite +2 was decreased by Trp238 replacement. Trp238 mutants as well as the chimeric enzyme having longer beta-->alpha loop 4 of B. subtilis oligo-1,6-glucosidase showed lower preference for long-chain substrates, indicating that both Trp238 and short beta-->alpha loop 4 were important for high activity to long-chain substrates.
TI  - Attenuation regulation of amino acid biosynthetic operons in proteobacteria: comparative genomics analysis.
AB  - Candidate attenuators were identified that regulate operons responsible for biosynthesis of branched amino acids, histidine, threonine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine in gamma- and alpha-proteobacteria, and in some cases in low-GC Gram-positive bacteria, Thermotogales and Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi. This allowed us not only to describe the evolutionary dynamics of regulation by attenuation of transcription, but also to annotate a number of hypothetical genes. In particular, orthologs of ygeA of Escherichia coli were assigned the branched chain amino acid racemase function. Three new families of histidine transporters were predicted, orthologs of yuiF and yvsH of Bacillus subtilis, and lysQ of Lactococcus lactis. In Pasteurellales, the single bifunctional aspartate kinase/homoserine dehydrogenase gene thrA was predicted to be regulated not only by threonine and isoleucine, as in E. coli, but also by methionine. In alpha-proteobacteria, the single acetolactate synthase operon ilvIH was predicted to be regulated by branched amino acids-dependent attenuators. Histidine biosynthetic operons his were predicted to be regulated by histidine-dependent attenuators in Bacillus cereus and Clostridium difficile, and by histidine T-boxes in L. lactis and Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of Thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  - The aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of Thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. Among 3790 isolates (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against Sarcina lutea ATCC 9341, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus mutans DTMU 1, Strep. salivarius DTMU 1, Strep. sanguis DTMU 1, Candida albicans ATCC 13803 and C. albicans DTMU 2, as well as the oral pathogens. These antimicrobial isolates included L17 and N14 which showed the antibacterial activity, D14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and D6 and N8 which showed both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. The isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. They could utilize casein but could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. Their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by pH, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. The activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at pH > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees C. However, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. When the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. The final identification revealed that D6, D14 and N14 were Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and L17 and N8 were Lact. rhamnosus.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of rosemary extracts.
AB  - A rosemary extract commercially exploited (Oxy'less) as an antioxidant of lipids  in foods was dissolved in ethanol (100 mg/ml), and the solution was tested against foodborne microorganisms. For gram-positive bacteria, the MIC of the ethanolic solution was 1% for Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 0.5% for Listeria monocytogenes, 0.5% for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.13% for Streptococcus mutans, and 0.06% for Bacillus cereus. It slowed the growth of Penicillium roquefortii and Botrytis cinerea. Up to 1% of the ethanolic solution had no activity on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Erwinia carotovora and on the yeasts Rhodotorula glutinis and Cryptococcus laurentii. Antibacterial activity of the rosemary extract was strongly influenced by the composition of the media. The MIC was reduced by low pH, high NaCl contents, and low temperatures. Low pH and high NaCl concentration had a synergistic effect on the MIC of the rosemary extract for S. aureus. Lipids, surface-active agents, and some proteins decreased its antibacterial activity, whereas pectin had no effect. The inhibitory effect was little modified by heat treatment (100 degrees C). The natural microflora of pasteurized zucchini broth was inhibited by 0.5% of the rosemary extract. The antibacterial activity was linked to the compounds extracted with hexane, which are presumably phenolic diterpenoids.
TI  - Factors affecting the resting pH of in vitro human microcosm dental plaque and Streptococcus mutans biofilms.
AB  - The aim was to examine factors that potentially control the resting pH, defined as the pH unaffected by meals, of microcosm dental plaques and Streptococcus mutans biofilms under standard conditions, and to examine the effect of supplying urea at concentrations found intraorally. Microcosm plaques were cultured from plaque bacteria-enriched saliva in an 'artificial mouth' with a continuous supply of a medium including 0.25% mucin [Basal Medium Mucin, (BMM), 3.6 ml/hr per plaque] and a periodic supply of sucrose. The steady-state resting pH was 6.4 (range +/- 0.1) in BMM containing no urea and supplied at the standard flowrate. This is a robust property of the ecosystem. In one experiment with a replicated (n = 9) set of measurements, the resting pH was approx. pH 6.3, 6.4, 6.7 and 7.3 with 0, 1, 5 and 20 mmol/l urea in the BMM. The magnitude of sucrose- and urea-induced pH responses was unaffected by elevating the resting pH to produce parallel pH curves. The sucrose-induced pH curves were analogous to those classically reported by Stephan that showed an association between caries activity and increasingly acidic plaque pH responses to glucose. Stopping the BMM flow caused a pH rise, indicating continuing net alkali generation from BMM components in the absence of a fluid flow. Step. mutans monoculture biofilms had an acidic resting pH of 5.0 to 5.3, which increased to 6.8 following an adventitious superinfection by Bacillus cereus. It was concluded that the resting pH in plaque results from a delicate balance between alkali and acid generation, which is in turn dependent both on the bacterial composition of the plaque and on the supply of substrates and buffers from, and metabolite clearance into, flowing oral fluid. In vivo the resting pH will vary with site-specific changing saliva flows. Urea continuously supplied at concentrations normal for saliva and gingival crevicular fluid can raise the resting pH of microcosm plaque by an amount tat in vivo would probably be significant in reducing dental caries.
TI  - Specific antibody-mediated detection of Brochothrix thermosphacta in situ in British fresh sausage.
AB  - A rabbit polyclonal antibody-linked probe was developed which detected 76% of 800 food isolates of the spoilage bacterium Brochothrix thermosphacta when cells were bound to nitrocellulose. In slide cross-reaction tests all six environmental isolates tested were stained but the type strain was not. The antibody did not cross-react with Listeria grayi, L. monocytogenes, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus cereus or B. subtilis. The antibody-linked probe detected Br. thermosphacta in thin sections of British fresh sausage when the viable count was greater than 10(6) g-1. Cells were detected mainly within 1 or 2 mm of the surface on the loose starchy material. They were not detected within muscle blocks or in the centre of the sausage. Such results suggest that growth of this organism occurs close to the surface of the sausage.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and phylogeny of the tet(L) tetracycline resistance determinant encoded by plasmid pSTE1 from Staphylococcus hyicus.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the tetracycline resistance (tet) gene and its regulatory region, encoded by the plasmid pSTE1 from Staphylococcus hyicus, was determined. The tet gene was inducible by tetracycline and encoded a hydrophobic protein of 458 amino acids. Comparisons between the predicted amino acid sequences of the pSTE1-encoded Tet from S. hyicus and the previously sequenced Tet K variants from Staphylococcus aureus, Tet L variants from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus stearothermophilus, and Bacillus subtilis, Tet M variants from Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus as well as Tet O from Streptococcus mutans were performed. An alignment of Tet amino acid sequences revealed the presence of 30 conserved amino acids among these Tet variants. On the basis of the alignment, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. It demonstrated large evolutionary distances between the Tet M and Tet O variants on one hand and the Tet K and Tet L variants on the other hand. The pSTE1-encoded Tet proved to be closely related to the Tet L proteins originally found on small Bacillus plasmids. The observed extensive similarities in the nucleotide sequences of the tet genes and in the deduced Tet amino acid sequences allowed the assignment of the pSTE1-encoded Tet to the Tet proteins of class L.
TI  - Metabolism of 17 beta-estradiol by oral Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans.
AB  - The ability of oral isolates of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans to metabolize 17 beta-estradiol was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography using 4-14C-estradiol as the substrate. All test microorganisms metabolized 17 beta-estradiol. Estrone was the main metabolic product, except for B. cereus, which converted 17 beta-estradiol mainly to unidentified, more polar metabolites. S. sanguis and B. cereus had the most active metabolism but S. mutans and C. albicans were also active.
TI  - Metabolism of progesterone and testosterone by Bacillus cereus strain Socransky 67 and Streptococcus mutans strain Ingbritt.
AB  - Bacillus cereus strain Socransky 67 and Streptococcus mutans strain Ingbritt were grown overnight in complex medium and then in fresh medium flasks for 5 h. The bacterial cells in the medium were centrifuged and resuspended; 4-14C-progesterone or 4-14C-testosterone was added, and the samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees C in a shaking water bath. The metabolites were analyzed with column and thin layer chromatography and radioautography and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. On the basis of the metabolites found it was concluded that B. cereus strain Socransky 67 contains 5 alpha-steroid hydrogenase, and 3 beta-, 17 beta- and 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and probably also steroid hydroxylases, and that S. mutans strain Ingbritt contains 5 alpha- and 5 beta-steroid hydrogenases, and 3 alpha-, 17 beta- and 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. The metabolic activity of B. cereus is several times higher than that of S. mutans. We suggest that the greater ability of B. cereus to metabolize progesterone and testosterone is probably due to its growth milieu in the gingival sulcus, where it is nearer to the gingival tissue.
TI  - Bactericidal action of carbon dioxide laser radiation in experimental dental root canals.
AB  - The ability of a carbon dioxide laser to sterilize the root canal of human teeth  has been investigated. Three oral bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, and Actinomyces viscosus, and three other bacteria, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as experimental organisms. Exposure of cells on glass slides to laser radiation showed there was little difference in the exposure required to kill these six organisms. Complete recovery of bacteria from the root canal was initially a problem and was only achieved when bacterial manipulations and removal were carried out in rapid succession, within 5 min of inoculation. However, the geometry of the instrumented canal and the laser alignment were major factors in achieving consistent cell death of oral bacteria in the root canals. Using sets of 10 teeth, four repeated exposures of 10 W for 1 s was found to sterilize 4 or more of the teeth.
TI  - Cross-reactions of Streptococcus mutans due to cell wall teichoic acid.
AB  - Antisera to the whole cells of Streptococcus mutans cross-reacted with antigen extracts from four other gram-positive species, as well as with those of three other oral streptococci. Similarly, antisera to these bacteria cross-reacted with extracts from S. mutans and with those from each other. Using a purified phenol extract of the walls of S. mutans, which was identified by chemical, immunochemical, and enzymatic analyses as glycerol teichoic acid, the cross-reactions were shown to be specific for a determinant of the teichoic acid backbone. Results were confirmed in immunodiffusion tests where clear bands of identify were shown. These observations point out the need for caution in sereological research empolying extracts of gram-positive bacteria and may be of interest in investigations of periodontal disease.
