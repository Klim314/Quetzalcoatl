TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == evaluation of quantum ii microbiology system for identification of gram-negative  bacteria of veterinary origin.
AB  == the ability of a rapid, semiautomated bacterial identification system, the quantum ii microbiology system (abbott laboratories, irving, tex.), to accurately identify gram-negative bacteria from veterinary sources was evaluated. a total of 378 isolates were tested, including 298 organisms in the family enterobacteriaceae and strains representing acinetobacter sp., aeromonas sp., flavobacterium sp., pasteurella multocida, plesiomonas sp., and pseudomonas spp.  of these isolates, 333 (88.1%) were correctly identified, 20 (5.3%) were not identified, 10 (2.6%) were incorrectly identified at the genus level, and 15 (4.0%) were incorrectly identified at the species level. the quantum ii system correctly identified 268 (89.9%) of the isolates of enterobacteriaceae and 65 (81.3%) of the nonenteric isolates. p. multocida was not identified correctly, and some nonenteric gram-negative bacteria of clinical significance in veterinary medicine are not included in the data base. the quantum ii system provided an accurate identification system for isolates of enterobacteriaceae but had limited usefulness for the identification of other gram-negative bacteria of clinical significance in veterinary medicine.

TI  == in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
