TI  == ocular penetration of topical antibiotics: study on the penetration of chloramphenicol, tobramycin and netilmicin into the anterior chamber after topical administration.
AB  == background: to compare penetration in the aqueous humour of topically applied antibiotics. design: randomized prospective study, department of ophthalmology, university of perugia, italy participants: patients undergoing cataract surgery.  methods: one hundred twenty-two patients were included: 14 received one drop of chloramphenicol suspension; 12 one application of chloramphenicol gel; 11 one drop of netilmicin suspension; 13 one drop of tobramycin suspension; 37 repeated  instillations of chloramphenicol suspension every 10 min for a total of four drops; and 35 repeated instillations of chloramphenicol gel every 10 min for a total of four drops. samples were taken immediately before surgery from the anterior chamber in order to determine the antibiotic by means of high-performance liquid chromatography. samples were taken 45-190 min after the eye drops were instilled. main outcome measures: intraocular penetration of chloramphenicol, netilmicin and tobramicyn. results: after a single administration, netilmicin and tobramycin were undetectable, whereas the chloramphenicol suspension reached a mean concentration of 0.23 +/- 0.21 mug/ml,  and the chloramphenicol gel a mean concentration of 0.13 +/- 0.14 mug/ml. after repeated administrations, the mean concentrations of the chloramphenicol suspension and gel were 0.60 +/- 0.26 mug/ml and 0.58 +/- 0.18 mug/ml, respectively. conclusions: tobramycin and netilmicin do not reach detectable concentrations, whereas chloramphenicol, after multiple administrations, reaches  concentrations that are effective against haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus  parainfluenzae, legionella pneumophila, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus pneumoniae. this means that chloramphenicol can be rationally used in the prophylaxis and treatment of infections supported by sensitive germs.

TI  == haemophilus parainfluenzae has a limited core lipopolysaccharide repertoire with  no phase variation.
AB  == cell surface lipopolysaccharide (lps) is a well characterized virulence determinant for the human pathogen haemophilus influenzae, so an investigation of lps in the less pathogenic haemophilus parainfluenzae could yield important insights. using a panel of 18 commensal h. parainfluenzae isolates we demonstrate that the set of genes for inner core lps biosynthesis largely resembles that of h. influenzae, with an additional heptosyltransferase i gene similar to waac from pasteurella multocida. inner core lps structure is therefore likely to be largely conserved across the two haemophilus species. outer core lps biosynthetic genes are much less prevalent in h. parainfluenzae, although homologues of the h. influenzae lps genes lpsb, non-phase variable lic2a and lgtc, and losa1, losb1 and lic2c are found in certain isolates. immunoblotting using antibodies directed against selected lps epitopes was consistent with these data. we found no evidence for tetranucleotide repeat-mediated phase variation in h. parainfluenzae. phosphocholine, a phase variable h. influenzae lps epitope that has been implicated in disease, was absent in h. parainfluenzae lps as were the respective (lic1) biosynthetic genes. the introduction of the lic1 genes into h.  parainfluenzae led to the phase variable incorporation of phosphocholine into its lps. differences in lps structure between haemophilus species could affect interactions at the bacterial-host interface and therefore the pathogenic potential of these bacteria.

TI  == in vitro potency of doripenem tested against an international collection of rarely isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  == doripenem, a new 1beta-methyl parenteral carbapenem, has very broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic bacteria. as noted here, the spectrum and potency extended to many rarely isolated species sampled by the  doripenem global surveillance program. among the species or species groups with <or=0.14% prevalence (1959 strains tested), doripenem was active against 98.9% of enterobacteriaceae at <or=0.5 microg/ml. similarly, more than 90% of other rarely isolated gram-negative species isolates (aeromonas spp., delftia acidovorans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, neisseria meningitidis, ochrobactrum anthropi, pasteurella multocida, pseudomonas oryzihabitans, and pseudomonas stutzeri) were  inhibited by <or=2 microg/ml of doripenem. the low-prevalence gram-positive pathogens were generally less doripenem susceptible with mic(90) results at >0.25 microg/ml for all tested species except lactococcus garvieae, listeria monocytogenes, and micrococcus spp. in conclusion, doripenem exhibited a very wide spectrum but variable potencies against uncommonly cultured aerobic bacterial pathogens isolated in 2003 to 2007. these results confirm the potential use of this new carbapenem for broad-spectrum empiric or directed antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == occurrence of [copper, zinc]-cofactored superoxide dismutase in pasteurella haemolytica and its serotype distribution.
AB  == fifty-two ovine strains of pasteurella haemolytica and p. trehalosi representing  serotypes 1-16 were examined for the presence of [copper, zinc]superoxide dismutase dna sequences. this was done using a combination of polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers based on the sequence of the [cu,zn]superoxide dismutase gene (sodc) in related species and southern hybridization using a fragment of sodc from p. haemolytica a2 serotype as a probe. both detection methods identified a fragment of the sodc gene in 9/9 strains of p. haemolytica serotype 2 examined and in 5/8 strains of serotype 7. no evidence of this gene was found in any other serotype of p. haemolytica or in any p. trehalosi serotype. comparison of dna sequence showed near identity between sodc from the a2 and a7 serotypes of p. haemolytica and substantial similarity (70%) to sodc previously sequenced in p. multocida, haemophilus parainfluenzae and h. influenzae. analysis by gel electrophoresis of the superoxide dismutase activity  present in cell lysates showed that one or more superoxide dismutase is present in all serotypes. however, cyanide-inhibitable activity, corresponding to [cu,zn]superoxide dismutase, was detected only in those strains of serotypes a2 and a7 which showed evidence of the sodc gene fragment.

TI  == electron microscopy of phages in serotypes of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinobacillus ureae, haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus paraphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, pasteurella haemolytica and pasteurella multocida strains were examined by transmission electron microscopy for the presence of bacteriophages.  phages were detected in serotype a (suny 75) and e (uoh 1705) and in the fresh clinical isolates uoh q1243 and uoh q1247 of a. actinomycetemcomitans. phages were not found in serotype b, c and d strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, in the fresh clinical isolate uoh q1244 of this species or in old strains (including reference strains) of related species from the actinobacillus-haemophilus-pasteurella group.

TI  == activity of meropenem and other antimicrobial agents against uncommon gram-negative organisms.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of meropenem and other antimicrobial agents was tested by agar dilution against 113 uncommon gram-negative pathogens. both meropenem and ceftriaxone showed the most activity against the test isolates. the potency of meropenem was greater than imipenem against pasteurella multocida, eikenella corrodens, haemophilus parainfluenzae, moraxella spp., kingella spp., and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. further work is necessary to assess the in-vivo activity of meropenem against these gram-negative isolates.

TI  == phylogeny of 54 representative strains of species in the family pasteurellaceae as determined by comparison of 16s rrna sequences.
AB  == virtually complete 16s rrna sequences were determined for 54 representative strains of species in the family pasteurellaceae. of these strains, 15 were pasteurella, 16 were actinobacillus, and 23 were haemophilus. a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on sequence similarity, using the neighbor-joining method.  fifty-three of the strains fell within four large clusters. the first cluster included the type strains of haemophilus influenzae, h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. haemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus, h. segnis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. this cluster also contained a. actinomycetemcomitans fdc y4, atcc 29522, atcc 29523, and atcc 29524 and h. aphrophilus nctc 7901. the second cluster included the type strains of a. seminis and pasteurella aerogenes  and h. somnus ovcg 43826. the third cluster was composed of the type strains of pasteurella multocida, p. anatis, p. avium, p. canis, p. dagmatis, p. gallinarum, p. langaa, p. stomatis, p. volantium, h. haemoglobinophilus, h. parasuis, h. paracuniculus, h. paragallinarum, and a. capsulatus. this cluster also contained  pasteurella species a ccug 18782, pasteurella species b ccug 19974, haemophilus taxon c capm 5111, h. parasuis type 5 nagasaki, p. volantium (h. parainfluenzae)  nctc 4101, and p. trehalosi nctc 10624. the fourth cluster included the type strains of actinobacillus lignieresii, a. equuli, a. pleuropneumoniae, a. suis, a. ureae, h. parahaemolyticus, h. parainfluenzae, h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. ducreyi, and p. haemolytica. this cluster also contained actinobacillus species strain ccug 19799 (bisgaard taxon 11), a. suis atcc 15557, h. ducreyi atcc 27722  and hd 35000, haemophilus minor group strain 202, and h. parainfluenzae atcc 29242. the type strain of p. pneumotropica branched alone to form a fifth group.  the branching of the pasteurellaceae family tree was quite complex. the four major clusters contained multiple subclusters. the clusters contained both rapidly and slowly evolving strains (indicated by differing numbers of base changes incorporated into the 16s rrna sequence relative to outgroup organisms).  while the results presented a clear picture of the phylogenetic relationships, the complexity of the branching will make division of the family into genera a difficult and somewhat subjective task. we do not suggest any taxonomic changes at this time.

TI  == application of multivariate analyses of enzymic data to classification of members of the actinobacillus-haemophilus-pasteurella group.
AB  == outer membrane vesicles and fragments from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  actinobacillus lignieresii, actinobacillus ureae, haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus paraphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, pasteurella haemolytica, and pasteurella multocida were isolated and examined semiquantitatively for 19 enzyme activities by using the api zym micromethod. the enzyme contents of vesicles and fragments were compared with the enzyme contents  of whole cells of the same organisms. enzymic data were analyzed by using principal-component analysis and soft independent modeling of class analogy. this technique allowed us to distinguish among the closely related organisms a. actinomycetemcomitans, h. aphrophilus, and h. paraphrophilus. a. actinomycetemcomitans was divided into two groups of strains. a. lignieresii fell outside or on the border of the a. actinobacillus class. a. ureae, h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, p. haemolytica, and p. multocida fell outside the a. actinomycetemcomitans, h. aphrophilus, and h. paraphrophilus classes.

TI  == ceftriaxone administered once or twice a day for treatment of bacterial infections of childhood.
AB  == twenty-six children received a single daily intravenous dose of ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg, for a variety of bacterial infections including abscess (5), cellulitis (5), periorbital cellulitis (5), bacteremia without focus (4), osteomyelitis (2), pneumonia (2), pyelonephritis (2) and otitis media (1). organisms isolated from infectious foci were staphylococcus aureus (9), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), streptococcus pyogenes (3), escherichia coli (2); and haemophilus influenzae type b, nontypable h. influenzae, group b streptococcus, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus parainfluenzae and satelliting streptococcus (1 each). microbiologic  cure was achieved in 20 of 22 (91%) infections and clinical cure in 25 of 26 (96%). fifteen possible adverse reactions occurred in 34 patients evaluable for drug safety; most were mild and self-limited. neutropenia developed in two patients necessitating discontinuation of ceftriaxone in one, followed by prompt  resolution. seventeen children received ceftriaxone, 75 mg/kg/day, in two divided doses for a similar variety of infections. bacteriologic and clinical cure rates  of 100 and 94%, respectively, were demonstrated. leukopenia developed in one patient and resolved when ceftriaxone was discontinued. once a day dosing of ceftriaxone in pediatric patients provides greater ease of administration combined with efficacy equal to that achieved with a divided dosage schedule.

TI  == cellular fatty acid composition of haemophilus species, pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and haemophilus vaginalis (corynebacterium vaginale).
AB  == the fatty acid composition of 35 haemophilus influenzae strains was found to be grossly similar and characterized by relatively large amounts of 14:0, 3-oh-14:0, 16:1 and 16:0. the three c18 fatty acids 18:2, 18:1 and 18:0 were also present, but in much lower concentrations. this general pattern was also found for most of the other species of haemophilus examined (h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. canis, h. gallinarum, h. haemolyticus, and h. parainfluenzae). small but distinct quantitative discrepancies were detected for h. ducreyi and the haemin-independent species h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus and h. suis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to be indistinguishable from h. influenzae. pasteurella multocida also exhibited a fatty acid pattern closely  related to that of haemophilus, but could be distinguished by its higher concentration levels of the c18 fatty acids. the fatty acid pattern of h. vaginalis was considerably different from those of the other species examined. this species lacked 3-oh-14:0 and 18:2 and contained small amounts of 14:0 and 16:0, whereas 18:1 and 18:0 were the major constituents.

TI  == [nitrofurantoin-test for the differentiation of bordetella bronchiseptica (author's transl)].
AB  == bordetella bronchiseptica is primarily resistant against nitrofurantoin (mic greater than 200 mug/ml), and this feature can be used for the differentiation of the organism from other gram-negative coccobacteria. nitrofurantoin paper disks (300 mug) failed to affect the growth of 150 strains of b. bronchiseptica isolated from different animal hosts, but they produced marked inhibition zones in the cultures of the followingspecies: pasteurella multocida, pasteurella pneumotropica, pasteurella haemolytica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, yersinia enterocolitica, francisella tularensis, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, brucella abortus, brucella melitensis, brucella suis and brucella neotomae.
