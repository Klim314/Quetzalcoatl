TI  == molecular identification and quantification of lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented dairy foods of russia.
AB  == russian traditional fermented dairy foods have been consumed for thousands of years. however, little research has focused on exploiting lactic acid bacteria (lab) resources and analyzing the lab composition of russian traditional fermented dairy foods. in the present study, we cultured lab isolated from fermented mare and cow milks, sour cream, and cheese collected from kalmykiya, buryats, and tuva regions of russia. seven lactobacillus species and the bifidobacterium genus were quantified by quantitative pcr. the lab counts in these samples ranged from 3.18 to 9.77 log cfu/ml (or per gram). in total, 599 lab strains were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. the identified lab belonged to 7 genera and 30 species by 16s  rrna and mure gene sequencing and multiplex pcr assay. the predominant lab isolates were lactobacillus helveticus (176 strains) and lactobacillus plantarum  (63 strains), which represented 39.9% of all isolates. the quantitative pcr results revealed that counts of 7 lactobacilli species and bifidobacterium spp. of 30 fermented cow milk samples ranged from 1.19 +/- 0.34 (lactobacillus helveticus in tuva) to 8.09 +/- 0.71 (lactobacillus acidophilus in kalmykiya) log cfu/ml of fermented cow milk (mean +/- standard error). the numbers of bifidobacterium spp., lb. plantarum, lb. helveticus, and lb. acidophilus revealed no significant difference between the 3 regions; nevertheless, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus exhibited different degrees of variation across 3 regions. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of russia have complex compositions of lab species. the diversity of lab might be related to the type of fermented dairy product, geographical origin, and manufacturing process.

TI  == antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
AB  == in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.

TI  == advantageous direct quantification of viable closely related probiotics in petit-suisse cheeses under in vitro gastrointestinal conditions by propidium monoazide--qpcr.
AB  == species-specific quantitative real time pcr (qpcr) alone and combined with the use of propidium monoazide (pma) were used along with the plate count method to evaluate the survival of the probiotic strains lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12, and the bacteriocinogenic and potentially probiotic strain lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei 2a in synbiotic (f1) and probiotic (f2) petit-suisse cheeses exposed throughout shelf-life to in  vitro simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions. the three strains studied showed a reduction in their viability after the 6 h assay. bb-12 displayed the highest survival capacity, above 72.6 and 74.6% of the initial populations, respectively, by plate count and pma-qpcr, maintaining population levels in the range or above 6 log cfu/g. the prebiotic mix of inulin and fos did not offer any additional protection for the strains against the simulated gastrointestinal environment. the microorganisms' populations were comparable among the three methods at the initial time of the assay, confirming the presence of mainly viable and culturable cells. however, with the intensification of the stress induced throughout the various stages of the in vitro test, the differences among the methods increased. the qpcr was not a reliable enumeration method for the quantification of intact bacterial populations, mixed with large numbers of injured and dead bacteria, as confirmed by the scanning electron microscopy results. furthermore, bacteria plate counts were much lower (p<0.05) than with the pma-qpcr method, suggesting the accumulation of stressed or dead microorganisms unable to form colonies. the use of pma overcame the qpcr inability to differentiate between dead and alive cells. the combination of pma and species-specific qpcr in this study allowed a quick and unequivocal way of enumeration of viable closely related species incorporated into probiotic and synbiotic petit-suisse cheeses and under stress conditions.

TI  == catabolic flexibility of mammalian-associated lactobacilli.
AB  == metabolic flexibility may be generally defined as "the capacity for the organism  to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability". the metabolic diversification strategies used by individual bacteria vary greatly from the use of novel or acquired enzymes to the use of plasmid-localised genes and transporters. in this  review, we describe the ability of lactobacilli to utilise a variety of carbon sources from their current or new environments in order to grow and survive. the  genus lactobacillus now includes more than 150 species, many with adaptive capabilities, broad metabolic capacity and species/strain variance. they are therefore, an informative example of a cell factory capable of adapting to new niches with differing nutritional landscapes. indeed, lactobacilli naturally colonise and grow in a wide variety of environmental niches which include the roots and foliage of plants, silage, various fermented foods and beverages, the human vagina and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract (git; including the mouth,  stomach, small intestine and large intestine). here we primarily describe the metabolic flexibility of some lactobacilli isolated from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, and we also describe some of the food-associated species  with a proven ability to adapt to the git. as examples this review concentrates on the following species - lb. plantarum, lb. acidophilus, lb. ruminis, lb. salivarius, lb. reuteri and lb. sakei, to highlight the diversity and inter-relationships between the catabolic nature of species within the genus.

TI  == distribution dynamics of recombinant lactobacillus in the gastrointestinal tract  of neonatal rats.
AB  == one approach to deliver therapeutic agents, especially proteins, to the gastro-intestinal (gi) tract is to use commensal bacteria as a carrier. genus lactobacillus is an attractive candidate for use in this approach. however, a system for expressing exogenous proteins at a high level has been lacking in lactobacillus. moreover, it will be necessary to introduce the recombinant lactobacillus into the gi tract, ideally by oral administration. whether orally administered lactobacillus can reach and reside in the gi tract has not been explored in neonates. in this study, we have examined these issues in neonatal rats. to achieve a high level of protein expression in lactobacillus, we tested the impact of three promoters and two backbones on protein expression levels using mrfp1, a red fluorescent protein, as a reporter. we found that a combination of an l-lactate dehydrogenase (ldhl) promoter of lactobacillus sakei  with a backbone from plem415 yielded the highest level of reporter expression. when this construct was used to transform lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus acidophilus, high levels of mrfp1 were detected in  all these species and colonies of transformed lactobacillus appeared pink under visible light. to test whether orally administered lactobacillus can be retained  in the gi tract of neonates, we fed the recombinant lactobacillus casei to neonatal rats. we found that about 3% of the bacteria were retained in the gi tract of the rats at 24 h after oral feeding with more recombinant lactobacillus  in the stomach and small intestine than in the cecum and colon. no mortality was  observed throughout this study with lactobacillus. in contrast, all neonatal rats died within 24 hours after fed with transformed e. coli. taken together, our results indicate that lactobacillus has the potential to be used as a vehicle for the delivery of therapeutic agents to neonates.

TI  == characterization of tetracycline resistance lactobacilli isolated from swine intestines at western area of taiwan.
AB  == to investigate the frequency of tetracycline resistance (tet-r) lactobacilli in pig intestines, a total of 256 pig colons were analyzed and found to contain typical colonies of tet-r lactic acid bacteria in every sample, ranging from 3.2  x 10(3) to 6.6 x 10(5) cfu/cm(2). from these samples, a total of 159 isolates of  tet-r lactobacilli were obtained and identified as belonging to 11 species, including lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus ruminis, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus letivazi. based on the efsa (2008) breakpoints, all isolates, after mic analysis, were qualified as tet-r, from which the significant high tet-r mic(50) and mic(90) values indicated an ecological distribution of tet-r lactobacilli mostly with high resistance potency in pig colons. pcr-detection identified 5 tet genes in these isolates, the most predominant one being tet (w), followed by tet (m), (l), (k), and (q). their detection rates were 82.0%, 22.5%, 14.4%, 8.1% and 0.9%, respectively. noteworthily, isolates of the same species carrying identical tet gene(s) usually had a wide different mic values. furthermore, strain-subtyping of these isolates  by rep-pcr demonstrated a notable genotypic biodiversity % (average = 62%).

TI  == prevalence and impact of single-strain starter cultures of lactic acid bacteria on metabolite formation in sourdough.
AB  == flavour of type ii sourdoughs is influenced by the ingredients, processing conditions, and starter culture composition. it is, however, not fully clear to what extent different sourdough lactic acid bacteria (lab) contribute to flavour. therefore, two types of flour (rye and wheat) and different lab starter culture strains were used to prepare sourdoughs, thereby leaving the yeast microbiota uncontrolled. all lab starter culture strains tested were shown to be prevalent and to acidify the flour/water mixture to ph values between 3.1 and 3.9 after 24h of fermentation. multiple aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, and carboxylic acids were produced by the sourdough-associated microbiota throughout the fermentation period. based on the organoleptic evaluation of breads produced with these sourdoughs, five lab strains were selected to perform prolonged wheat and rye fermentations as to their capacity to result in an acidic (lactobacillus fermentum imdo 130101, lactobacillus plantarum imdo 130201, and lactobacillus crustorum lmg 23699), buttermilk-like (lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471), or fruity flavour (lactobacillus sakei cg1). upon prolonged fermentation, higher metabolite concentrations were produced. for instance, l. sakei cg1 produced the  highest amounts of 3-methyl-1-butanol, which was further converted into 3-methylbutyl acetate. the latter compound resulted in a fruity banana flavour after 48h of fermentation, probably due to yeast interference. rye fermentations  resulted in sourdoughs richer in volatiles than wheat, including 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-phenylethanol, and ethyl acetate.

TI  == application of novel starter cultures for sourdough bread production.
AB  == sourdough application has been extensively increased in the last years due to the consumers demand for food consumption without the addition of chemical preservatives. several starter cultures have been applied in sourdough bread making targeting the increase of bread self-life and the improvement of sensorial character. more specific, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus sakei as single and mixed cultures were used for sourdough bread making. various sourdough breads were produced with the addition of sourdough perviously prepared with 10%  w/w l. acidophilus, 10% w/w l. sakei and 5% w/w l. acidophilus and 5% w/w l. sakei at the same time. various chemical parameters were determined such as lactic acid, total titratable acidity and ph. the results revealed that the produced sourdough bread made with sourdough containing the mixed culture was preserved for more days (12 days) than all the other breads produced in the frame of this study, since it contained lactic acid in higher concentrations. the respective total titratable acidity varied between 10.5 and 11 ml naoh n/10. the  same sourdough bread had a firmer texture, better aroma, flavor and overall quality compared to other sourdough breads examined in this study, as shown by sensory evaluation tests and results obtained through spme gc-ms analysis, which  revealed significant differences among the different bread types.

TI  == diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  == the present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with bmi and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. the bmi (p < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (p < 0.01 by bacteriology; p < 0.001 by real-time pcr) were higher in the elderly. the number of species in adults was lower (p < 0.05), who were more often colonised with lactobacillus acidophilus (p = 0.031) and l. helveticus (p < 0.001). in contrast, l. plantarum (p = 0.035), l. paracasei (p < 0.001) and  l. reuteri (p = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. l. rhamnosus was detected in adults (p < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. bmi was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (p = 0.008). the higher bmi in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and l. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. plasma glucose values were positively correlated with bmi and negatively correlated with colonisation with l. paracasei (p = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with  l. fermentum (p = 0.052) in the elderly. thus, the species-specific pcr analysis  of lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. the higher counts of intestinal lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher bmi  and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.

TI  == immunomodulatory effect of probiotics enriched diets on uronema marinum infected  olive flounder.
AB  == the effect of five probiotics, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus sakei, bacillus subtilis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae as individual and mixed enriched diet on the seasonal prevalence, activity and intensity of uronema marinum infection in olive flounder paralichthys olivaceus is reported. the growth performance, feed efficiency, blood biochemistry, survival rate, and non-specific immune response of u. marinum infected olive flounder on week 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 were quantified. the prevalence and infection intensity reached a peak from june to december and then it declined from december to march. the scuticocidal activity in the serum was significantly  higher when fed with l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, and s. cerevisiae diets on weeks 2-8. all enriched diets significantly enhanced the weight gain significantly between week 6 and 8; the feed efficiency registered a significantly increase from week 4 to 8 when compared to infected fish fed with control diet. infected fish fed with l. plantarum-supplemented diet had higher survival rate than with other enriched diets. the serum aspartate aminotransferase (got) and alanine aminotransferase (gpt) levels significantly increased when fed with l. plantarum, l. acidophilus or s. cerevisiae-supplemented diet. total protein (tp) and glucose (glu) level significantly increased with any enriched diet from week 4 to 8. the superoxide anion production and serum lysozyme activity registered a significant increase when fed with l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, and s. cerevisiae-supplemented diet from week 4-8. the present study concludes that l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, and s. cerevisiae-supplemented diets act as immunostimulants enhancing the growth, feed efficiency, blood biochemistry, survival rate, and non-specific immune response in u. marinum infected olive flounder.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of probiotic and clinical lactobacillus strains in relation to safety aspects of probiotics.
AB  == the evaluation of the safety of probiotic strains includes the exclusion of antibiotic resistance of clinical importance. ninety-two strains from the genus lactobacillus isolated from probiotics, food, and clinical sources were included  in the investigation. species tested were the l. acidophilus group, l. casei group, l. reuteri/fermentum group, and l. sakei/curvatus group. cell and colony morphology, fermentation patterns, and growth characteristics as well as soluble  whole cell proteins were analyzed. antibiotic resistance against clinically important agents was determined by broth dilution tests. the vana and tet genes were confirmed. resistances occurred mainly against gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, sulfonamides, and, in some cases, glycopeptides. the natural glycopeptide resistance within the l. casei group and l. reuteri appears to be not of clinical relevance, as there was no vana gene present. therefore, the transfer of this resistance is very unlikely. tet-(a), -(b), -(c), -(m), or -(o)  gene could not be detected. the protein fingerprinting within the l. casei group  proved that l. rhamnosus strains of clinical origin clustered together with probiotic strains. for safety evaluations resistance patterns of a broad range of strains are a useful criterion together with the exclusion of known resistance genes (like the vana gene) and can be used for decision making on the safety of probiotics, both by authorization bodies and manufacturers.

TI  == high-level expression of lactobacillus beta-galactosidases in lactococcus lactis  using the food-grade, nisin-controlled expression system nice.
AB  == in this work the overlapping genes (lacl and lacm) encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus reuteri , lb. acidophilus , lb. sakei , and lb. plantarum were cloned into two different nisin-controlled expression (nice) vectors and expressed using lactococcus lactis nz9000 and nz3900 as hosts. the lacl gene, encoding the large subunit of the beta-galactosidases, was fused translationally downstream of the nisin-inducible promoter nisa. chloramphenicol  was employed as selection marker for the standard system using l. lactis nz9000,  whereas lactose utilization based on the complementation of the lacf gene was used as a dominant selection marker for the food-grade system employing l. lactis nz3900. comparison of the standard and the food-grade expression system, differing only in their selection markers, gave considerable differences in volumetric beta-galactosidase activity, ranging from 1.17 to 14 ku/l of fermentation broth, depending on both the origin of the laclm genes and the selection marker used. the occurrence of codons less frequently used by l. lactis especially at the beginning of the lacl gene could be an explanation for the significant differences between the expression levels of laclm from different origins, while plasmid stability might cause the difference obtained when employing the different selection markers.

TI  == lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 increases lactacin b production when it senses live target bacteria.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 is a probiotic strain used in dairy products. production of bacteriocin by l. acidophilus la-5 was achieved when it was grown in co-cultures with the yogurt starter species streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. however, bacteriocin induction was not observed when heat-killed cells were used as inducers. this study demonstrates that l. acidophilus la-5 produces lactacin b and that the bacteriocin expression is controlled by an auto-induction mechanism involving the secreted peptide ip_1800. the transcript level of the lactacin b gene cluster expression was investigated in co-cultures between l. acidophilus la-5 and s. thermophilus sty-31 and a remarkable increase of the bacteriocin structural gene  (lbab) transcription was observed. however, lbab was transcribed constitutively in uninduced l. acidophilus la-5 cells, but the levels of the secreted bacteriocin were not enough to be detected by the agar diffusion assay. a new method for bacteriocin detection was formulated based on the monitoring on real time of lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei growth in presence of the supernatant and the cell wall extracts of pure and induced l. acidophilus la-5. these results showed that part of lactacin b secreted remains adhered to cell envelope.

TI  == high-level expression of recombinant beta-galactosidases in lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus sakei using a sakacin p-based expression system.
AB  == this work presents the cloning and expression of the genes encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus reuteri l103, lactobacillus acidophilus r22, lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1, and lactobacillus sakei lb790. these enzymes  consist of two subunits of approximately 73 and 35 kda, which are encoded by two  overlapping genes, lacl and lacm, respectively. we have cloned these genes into the lactobacillal expression vectors psip403 and psip409, which are based on the  sakacin p operon of l. sakei ( sorvig et al. microbiology 2005, 151, 2439- 2449 ), and expressed them in the host strains l. plantarum wcfs1 and l. sakei lb790.  results varied considerably, ranging from 2.23 to 61.1 u/mg of beta-galactosidase activity, depending on the origin of the laclm genes, the host strain, and the expression vector used. highest expression levels were obtained in a laboratory cultivation of l. plantarum wcfs1 harboring the plasmid peh3r containing the laclm gene from l. reuteri l103. these cultivations yielded approximately 23 000  u of beta-galactosidase activity per liter, corresponding to the formation of roughly 100 mg of recombinant protein per liter of fermentation medium, and beta-galactosidase levels amounted to 55% of the total intracellular protein of the host organism. to further verify the suitability of this expression system, recombinant beta-galactosidase from l. reuteri was purified to apparent homogeneity. the properties of the purified enzyme were essentially identical with the properties of purified native beta-galactosidase from l. reuteri l103. the presented results lead the way to efficient overproduction of beta-galactosidase in a food-grade expression system, which is of high interest for applications in food industry.

TI  == diversity of the genus lactobacillus revealed by comparative genomics of five species.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus contains over 80 recognized species, and is characterized by a high level of diversity, reflected in its complex phylogeny. the authors' recent determination of the genome sequence of lactobacillus salivarius means that five complete genomes of lactobacillus species are available for comparative genomics: l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii and l. sakei. this paper now shows that there is no extensive synteny of the genome sequences of these five lactobacilli. phylogeny based on whole-genome alignments suggested  that l. salivarius was closer to l. plantarum than to l. sakei, which was closest to enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 16s rrna gene relatedness. a total of 593 orthologues common to all five species were identified. species relatedness based on this protein set was largely concordant with genome synteny-based relatedness. a lactobacillus supertree, combining individual phylogenetic trees from each of 354 core proteins, had four main branches, comprising l. salivarius-l. plantarum; l. sakei; e. faecalis; and l. acidophilus-l. johnsonii.  the extreme divergence of the lactobacillus genomes analysed supports the recognition of new subgeneric divisions.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == use of unsupervised and supervised artificial neural networks for the identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of sds-page patterns of whole cell proteins.
AB  == conventional multivariate statistical techniques (hierarchical cluster analysis,  linear discriminant analysis) and unsupervised (kohonen self organizing map) and  supervised (bayesian network) artificial neural networks were compared for as tools for the classification and identification of 352 sds-page patterns of whole cell proteins of lactic acid bacteria belonging to 22 species of the genera lactobacillus, leuconostoc, enterococcus, lactococcus and streptococcus including 47 reference strains. electrophoretic data were pre-treated using the logistic weighting function described by piraino et al. [piraino, p., ricciardi, a., lanorte, m. t., malkhazova, i., parente, e., 2002. a new procedure for data reduction in electrophoretic fingerprints of whole-cell proteins. biotechnol. lett. 24, 1477-1482]. hierarchical cluster analysis provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns but was unable to discriminate some species (leuconostoc, lb. sakei/lb. curvatus, lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus, lb. plantarum/lb. paraplantarum, lc. lactis/lc. raffinolactis). a 7x7 kohonen self-organizing map (ksom), trained with the patterns of the reference strains, provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns and was able to discriminate more species than hierarchical cluster analysis. the map was used in predictive mode to identify unknown strains and provided results which in 85.5% of cases matched the classification obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis. two supervised tools, linear discriminant analysis and a 23:5:2 bayesian network  were proven to be highly effective in the discrimination of sds-page patterns of  lc. lactis from those of other species. we conclude that data reduction by logistic weighting coupled to traditional multivariate statistical analysis or artificial neural networks provide an effective tool for the classification and identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of sds-page patterns of whole cell proteins.

AB  == bacteriocins are natural antimicrobial agents produced by food fermentative bacteria. lactobacillus acidophilus dsm 20079 produces a small bacteriocin, with  a molecular mass of 6.6 kda, designated acidocin d20079. this antimicrobial peptide was extremely heat-stable (30 min at 121 degrees c) and was active over a wide ph range. it was found to be sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, ficin, pepsin, papain, and proteinase k). acidocin d20079 has a narrow inhibitory spectrum restricted to the genus lactobacillus which includes l. sakei ncdo 2714, an organism known to cause anaerobic spoilage of vacuum-packaged meat. maximum production of acidocin d20079 in mrs broth was detected at ph 6.0, and the peptide was purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by sequential cation exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. purified acidocin d20079 spontaneously formed spherulite crystals during dialysis. as the n-terminus was found to be blocked for sequencing, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry was used to determine a partial sequence, and the molecular mass of the bacteriocin in the formed crystals (6.6 kda). estimates of the molecular weight of the partially purified peptide, using tricine-sds-page, in which bacteriocin activity was confirmed by overlayer techniques were in accordance with this value.

TI  == susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.
