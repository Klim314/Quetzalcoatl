TI  == construction of an expressible bac library of the unculturable insect microorganism, stink bug plautia stali symbiont, for the search of biologically active and useful symbiont products.
AB  == while gene products and metabolites of insect symbiotic bacteria may act as useful resources for insect-microbe studies and medicinal use, it is usually difficult to obtain the insect symbionts to some extent in quantity because most  of them are unculturable. in this study, the possibility of using bacterial artificial chromosome (bac) libraries as a heterologous gene expression tool for  the discovery of novel symbiont metabolites was evaluated. a bac library was constructed from the symbiont purified from the posterior midgut cecum of the stink bug plautia stali. the bac library, which consisted of 513 clones with an average insert size of 41 kb, represented greater than five-fold coverage of the  genome. the ability of the bac clones to express plural genes from large-sized insert dna in escherichia coli was examined by the growth of bac-transformed leu  operon-deficient dh10b cells on m9 minimal medium supplemented with glucose. two  bac clones complemented leucine deficiency in dh10b cells; the clones contained the leu operon of the symbiont chromosome. the p. stali symbiont genes introduced into the bac vector are functional in e. coli, and these genes are expressed in an operon unit. bac libraries can be used to generate gene product- and metabolite-libraries, facilitating to characterize potential metabolites of the p. stali symbiont.

TI  == expression of genes derived from the genomic dna fragments of the brown-winged green bug (plautia stali) symbiont in escherichia coli.
AB  == many insect species harbour symbiotic microorganisms (symbionts) that are generally unculturable in media. to utilize symbionts as genome resources, we examined whether insect symbiont genes can be expressed in escherichia coli. 144  plasmid clones were isolated from gene libraries, which were constructed from the genomic dna of the intestinal bacterial symbiont in the brown-winged green bug, plautia stali, using an e. coli system. proteins prepared from a culture of each  clone were analysed using sds-page. a discrete symbiont-specific band was detected in six clones. from the structural analyses of the insert in each clone, the candidate gene encoding the symbiont-specific protein was predicted and the amino acid sequence of the protein was deduced. the amino acid sequence in the n-terminal region of each protein was identical to that deduced from the genomic  dna sequence of the symbiont, but not of the host. the promoter sequences of the  symbiont genes, very similar to those of the corresponding e. coli genes, were found in the insert dna. these findings clearly indicate that genes derived from  genomic dna fragments of the p. stali symbiont can be expressed in e. coli.

TI  == symbiont of the stink bug plautia stali synthesizes rough-type lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == the structures and biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (lps), a major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, have been studied extensively in cultured bacteria such as escherichia coli. in contrast, little is known about the structures and biosynthesis of the lps of unculturable bacteria, including insect symbionts, many of which are gram-negative bacteria. a brown-winged green  bug, plautia stali, is known to harbor a single species of gamma-proteobacterium  in the posterior mid-gut caeca. to characterize the features of its lps, we analyzed the genome sequence of the symbiont, and identified the putative genes involved in lps synthesis. genes involved in the synthesis of lipid a and the core oligosaccharide were found in the genome, but waal, which encodes the o-antigen ligase, was not. furthermore, we characterized the lps of this symbiont using sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and toll-like receptor 4  (tlr4) stimulation assays. consistent with the genomic analysis, the sds-page analysis suggested that the symbiont had rough-type lps, which lacked the o-antigen. the tlr4 stimulation assay demonstrated that lps purified from the symbionts activated nf-kappab-dependent reporter expression, indicating the existence of a bioactive lipid a portion in the lps. these results suggest that the p. stali symbiont produces rough-type lps.

TI  == cleavage sites of the "p3 region" in the nonstructural polyprotein precursor of a dicistrovirus.
AB  == plautia stali intestine virus (psiv) is a member of the family dicistroviridae. dicistroviruses, like picornaviruses, are thought to encode a 3c-like protease; however, the cleavage sites of dicistroviral nonstructural polyprotein precursors are unknown except for those in genome-linked virus protein (vpg) regions. we expressed part of the psiv polyprotein in escherichia coli and detected autoprocessed viral proteins. n-terminal sequence analysis of the autoprocessed proteins showed that q/gwlsw and q/ngvfd in the psiv sequence correspond to 2c/3a and 3c/3d cleavage sites in picornaviruses. alignments of deduced amino acid sequences of the "p3 region" suggest that these cleavage sites can be predicted.
