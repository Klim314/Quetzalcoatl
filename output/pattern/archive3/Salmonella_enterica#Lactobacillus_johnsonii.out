modification of the technical properties of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533 by supplementing the growth medium with unsaturated fatty acids.
the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of supplementing growth medium with unsaturated fatty acids on the technical properties of the probiotic strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533, such as heat and acid tolerance, and inhibition of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium infection. our results showed that the membrane composition and morphology of l. johnsonii ncc 533 were significantly changed by supplementing a minimal lactobacillus medium with oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids. the ratio of saturated to unsaturated plus cyclic fatty acids in the bacterial membrane decreased by almost 2-fold when minimal medium was supplemented with unsaturated fatty acids (10 mug/ml). the subsequent acid and heat tolerance of l. johnsonii decreased by 6- and 20-fold when the strain was grown in the presence of linoleic and linolenic acids, respectively, compared with growth in oleic acid (all at 10 mug/ml). following acid exposure, significantly higher (p < 0.05) oleic acid content was detected in the membrane when growth medium was supplemented with linoleic or linolenic acid, indicating that saturation of the membrane fatty acids occurred during acid stress. cell integrity was determined in real time during stressed conditions using a fluorescent viability kit in combination with flow cytometric analysis. following heat shock (at 62.5 degrees c for 5 min), l. johnsonii was unable to form colonies; however, 60% of the bacteria showed no cell integrity loss, which could indicate that the elevated heat inactivated vital processes within the cell, rendering it incapable of replication. furthermore, l. johnsonii grown in fatty acid-enriched minimal medium had different adhesion properties and caused a 2-fold decrease in s. enterica serovar typhimurium uk1-lux invasion of ht-29 epithelial cells compared with bacteria grown in minimal medium alone. this could be related to changes in the hydrophobicity and fluidity of the membrane. our study shows that technical properties underlying probiotic survivability can be affected by nutrient composition of the growth medium.
individual and co-operative roles of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the killing activity of enteric strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 against enteric, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated pathogens.
the mechanism underlying the killing activity of lactobacillus strains against bacterial pathogens appears to be multifactorial. here, we investigate the respective contributions of hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid in killing bacterial pathogens associated with the human vagina, urinary tract or intestine by two hydrogen peroxide-producing strains. in co-culture, the human intestinal strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and human vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 strains killed enteric salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344, vaginal gardnerella vaginalis dsm 4944 and urinary tract escherichia coli cft073 pathogens. the cell-free culture supernatants (cfcss) produced the same reduction in sl1344, dsm 4944 and cft073 viability, whereas isolated bacteria had no effect. the killing activity of cfcss was heat-stable. in the presence of dulbecco's modified eagle's minimum essential medium inhibiting the lactic acid-dependent killing activity, cfcss were less effective at killing of the pathogens. catalase-treated cfcss displayed a strong decreased activity. tested alone, hydrogen peroxide triggered a concentration-dependent killing activity against all three pathogens. lactic acid alone developed a killing activity only at concentrations higher than that present in cfcss. in the presence of lactic acid at a concentration present in lactobacillus cfcss, hydrogen peroxide displayed enhanced killing activity. collectively, these results demonstrate that for hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus strains, the main metabolites of lactobacillus, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, act co-operatively to kill enteric, vaginosis-associated and uropathogenic pathogens.
hydrogen peroxide production by lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533 and its role in anti-salmonella activity.
the human intestinal isolate lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533 (la1) is a probiotic strain with well-documented antimicrobial properties. previous research has identified the production of lactic acid and bacteriocins as important factors, but that other unidentified factors are also involved. we used the recently published genome sequence of l. johnsonii ncc 533 to search for novel antipathogen factors and identified three potential gene products that may catalyze the synthesis of the known antimicrobial factor hydrogen peroxide, h(2)o(2). in this work, we confirmed the ability of ncc 533 as well as eight different l. johnsonii strains and lactobacillus gasseri to produce h(2)o(2) when resting cells were incubated in the presence of oxygen, and that culture supernatant containing ncc 533-produced h(2)o(2) was effective in killing the model pathogen salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344 in vitro.
identification of lactobacilli isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens and characterization for potential use as probiotics to control salmonella enteritidis.
aims: to select lactobacillus strains from laying hens for potential use as probiotic to control salmonella enteritidis infection. methods and results: one hundred and eighty-six lactobacilli were isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens, and identified at the species level by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. all isolates belonged to the lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri or lactobacillus salivarius phylogenetic groups, with the l. reuteri group being the most predominant group. based on genetic diversity, about 50 representative strains were selected and tested for in vitro properties that could be predictive for probiotic activity in laying hens. salmonella inhibition was shown to be species dependent, and correlated to some extent with the production of lactic acid. a selection of strains was evaluated in a s. enteritidis challenge experiment. two strains, l. reuteri r-17485 and lactobacillus johnsonii r-17504 significantly decreased the colonization of chicks by s. enteritidis in caeca, liver and spleen. conclusions: lactobacilli isolated from laying hens were observed to inhibit salmonella growth in vitro, most probably through production of lactic acid, and to decrease in vivo the s. enteritidis colonization of chicks. significance and impact of the study: the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from laying hens may have probiotic potential in reducing s. enteritidis infection.
adhesive and chemokine stimulatory properties of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains.
five lactobacillus plantarum strains and two lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from african traditionally fermented milk products or children's feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. the relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to ht29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the l. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to ht29 cells. four l. plantarum and two l. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to ht29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. the two l. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the intestinal pathogens listeria monocytogenes scott a, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028. the l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with ht29 cells in a strain-dependent way. these two potential probiotic strains also significantly increased interleukin-8 (il-8) chemokine production by ht29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as il-1, il-6, il-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta), did not occur. altogether, our results suggested that l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii bfe 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains.
kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds.
six lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1, l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and l. rhamnosus gg) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344. all lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. by studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and ph control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. the antibacterial activity of l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus gg was solely due to the production of lactic acid. the antibacterial activity of l. johnsonii la1 and l. plantarum aca-dc 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). the latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. in addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of salmonella into caco-2/tc7 cells.
ph-, lactic acid-, and non-lactic acid-dependent activities of probiotic lactobacilli against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
the mechanism(s) underlying the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacillus strains appears to be multifactorial and includes lowering of the ph and the production of lactic acid and of antibacterial compounds, including bacteriocins and nonbacteriocin, non-lactic acid molecules. addition of dulbecco's modified eagle's minimum essential medium to the incubating medium delays the killing activity of lactic acid. we found that the probiotic strains lactobacillus johnsonii la1, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, and l. rhamnosus gr1 induced a dramatic decrease in the viability of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344 mainly attributable to non-lactic acid molecule(s) present in the cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs). these molecules were more active against serovar typhimurium sl1344 in the exponential growth phase than in the stationary growth phase. we also showed that the production of the non-lactic acid substance(s) responsible for the killing activity was dependent on growth temperature and that both unstable and stable substances with killing activity were present in the cfcss. we found that the complete inhibition of serovar typhimurium sl1344 growth results from a ph-lowering effect.
in vivo characterization of lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 for use as a defined competitive exclusion agent against bacterial pathogens in poultry.
aims: to test the efficacy of lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 in reducing the colonization and shedding of salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis, escherichia coli o78:k80 and clostridium perfringens in poultry. methods and results: specific pathogen-free chicks (1 day old) were dosed with a single oral inoculum of 1x10(9) cfu. lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 and 24 h later were challenged in separate experiments with s. enteritidis (s1400, nalr) and e. coli o78:k80 (ec34195, nalr). there were no significant effects against s. enteritidis whereas colonization of the small intestine by e. coli o78:k80 was reduced significantly. both s. enteritidis and e. coli colonized the caeca and colon to levels equivalent to control birds and there was no reduction in shedding as assessed by a semi-quantitative cloacal swabbing technique. specific pathogen-free chicks (20 day old) were dosed with a single oral inoculum of 1x10(9) cfu l. johnsonii fi9785 and 24 h later were challenged with c. perfringens. a single oral dose of l. johnsonii fi9785 was sufficient to suppress all aspects of colonization and persistence of c. perfringens. conclusions: lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 may be given to poultry for use as a competitive exclusion agent to control c. perfringens. significance and impact of the study: lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 may be a valuable tool to control the endemic disease of necrotic enteritis, thereby reducing economic losses associated with reduced use of antimicrobials in the poultry industry.
