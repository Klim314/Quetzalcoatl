TI  == assessment of the in vitro inhibitory activity of specific probiotic bacteria against different escherichia coli strains.
AB  == background: lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are often associated with health-promoting effects. these live microorganisms, defined as probiotics, are commonly consumed as part of fermented foods, such as yoghurt and fermented milks, or as dietary supplements. escherichia coli is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. as a part of the normal gut microbiota, this microorganism colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans within a few hours after birth. all  e. coli strains can produce a wide variety of biogenic amines responsible for potentially harmful systemic intoxications. enterohemorrhagic e. coli serotype o157:h7 is a pathotype of diarrhoeagenic strains with a large virulence plasmid po157 able to produce 1 or more shiga toxins. methods: the overall aim of this study was to determine the inhibitory effects of different strains of probiotics  on e. coli serotypes, including e. coli o157:h7 (cq9485). in particular, the antagonistic activity of 4 bifidobacterium strains (probiotical spa, italy) and 16 lactic acid bacteria, more specifically 14 lactobacillus spp. and 2 streptococcus spp., was assessed against selected e. coli biotypes (atcc 8739, atcc 10536, atcc 35218, and atcc 25922). the diarrhoeagenic serotype o157:h7 was  also tested. results: the experimental data collected demonstrated an in vitro significant inhibitory effect of 6 lactobacillus strains, namely l. rhamnosus lr04, l. rhamnosus lr06, l. plantarum lp01, l. plantarum lp02, l. pentosus lps01, and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01, and 2 bifidobacterium strains, b. breve br03 and b. breve b632. the inhibiting extent was slightly different among  these strains, with l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01 showing the highest activity on e. coli o157:h7. conclusions: most of the probiotics studied are able to antagonize the growth of the 5 strains of e. coli tested, including the o157:h7 biotype, well known for their characteristic to produce a wide variety of biogenic amines considered responsible for dangerous systemic intoxications.

TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == yoghurt fermented by lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus h+ -atpase-defective mutants exhibits enhanced viability of bifidobacterium breve during storage.
AB  == persistent acid production by lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus during  refrigerated storage is a major cause of reduced viability of probiotic strains such as bifidobacterium breve in yoghurt. it was established that h+ -atpase-defective mutants of lactic acid bacteria have reduced growth and metabolism in low ph environments. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate inhibition of post-acidification and maintenance of b. breve viability in yoghurt fermented by l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus mutants with reduced membrane-bound h+ -atpase activity during refrigerated storage. spontaneous neomycin mutants of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus that had a significantly (p  < or = 0.05) reduced h+ -atpase activity were successfully isolated. yoghurt fermented using l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus sbt0164 no. 55-1 (mutant) starter culture had markedly reduced post-acidification and maintained viability  (> or = 10(8) cfu/ml) of both bifidobacteruim breve jcm 1192(t) and bifidobacteruim breve jcm 7017 during storage at 10 degrees c for 21 days. these  results clearly showed that yoghurt fermented by mutants of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus with reduced membrane-bound h+ -atpase activity has reduced post-acidification that prolongs viability of b. breve in yoghurt during refrigerated storage.

TI  == spotlight on vsl#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, and b. infantis), and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == use of chemical mutagenesis for the isolation of food grade beta-galactosidase overproducing mutants of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == a classical chemical mutagenesis protocol was evaluated for increasing beta-galactosidase production by probiotic bacteria to improve their potential to treat symptoms of lactose malabsorption in humans. two bifidobacterium species (b. breve and b. longum) and one strain each of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus were tested by a single exposure to two chemical mutagens, ethyl methanesulfonate (ems) and n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng). to screen for beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) overproducing mutants, optimized ems and mnng mutant pots for each strain were plated on bhi agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (x-gal). colonies that exhibited a blue color were selected for quantitative beta-gal activities using the o-nitrophenyl-beta-galactoside (onpg) assay. seventy-five mutants were obtained out of more than 2 million colonies screened and showed increased beta-galactosidase activities compared with the wild-type strains. ems gave a higher frequency of beta-gal overproducing mutants than mnng for three of the four strains, s. thermophilus, b. breve, and b. longum, whereas the frequency of  l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus beta-gal mutants was similar with both mutagens. the highest beta-gal increases, when induced during growth in lactose, for mutants of each culture were 137% for l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus; 104% for s. thermophilus; 70% for b. breve; and 222% for b. longum mutants. this food-grade classical approach has the ability to moderately increase beta-gal concentrations in probiotic cultures to improve their potential for treating the symptoms of lactose malabsorption in humans.
