TI  - Response of selected poultry cecal probiotic bacteria and a primary poultry Salmonella typhimurium isolate grown with or without glucose in liquid batch culture.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether fermentation by a cecal probiotic co-culture of an Enterococcus sp. and Veillonella sp. would inhibit the in vitro growth of a S. typhimurium poultry isolate. The growth rates of S. typhimurium and Enterococcus were significantly reduced at pH 5. At the two pH levels, there was a significant (p < 0.001) increase at 24 h in colony forming units for each of the bacteria enumerated from the mixed culture compared to the respective pure culture enumerations. S. typhimurium was not inhibited in mixed cultures. The mixed cultures produced more acetate than any of the pure cultures and lactate produced by Enterococcus appeared to be utilized by Veillonella.
