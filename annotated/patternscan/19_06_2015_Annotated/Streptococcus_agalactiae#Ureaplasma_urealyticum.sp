TI  == antimicrobial resistance of abnormal vaginal discharges microorganisms in ouagadougou, burkina faso.
AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of bacterial strains and fungal strains infecting the vaginal tract and test their sensitivity to antibiotics in women attending saint camille medical centre in ouagadougou. methods: from january 2008 to december 2009, a total of 2 000 vaginal swabs were cultivated for bacterial and fungal identification and isolation. furthermore, bacterial strains were tested for their susceptibility to several antibiotics used in routine in the centre. results: the results revealed that microbial isolation and identification was attempted for 1 536/2 000 sample, a positivity rate of 76.80%. candida albicans (48.76%), followed by escherichia coli (16.67%), streptococcus agalactiae (8.14%) and staphylococcus aureus (7.55%) were the major agents of genital tract infections in patients. mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum combined accounted for less than 7%. trichomonas vaginalis was identified in 1.04% cases. the antimicrobial tests revealed that the microorganisms developed resistance to several antibiotics including beta lactams. however, antibiotics such as cefamenzol, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were still active on these bacteria. conclusions: the results reveal that many sexually active women are infected by one or more microbial pathogens, probably because of the lack of hygiene or the adoption of some risky behaviors, such as not using condoms or having multiple sexual partners. efforts should be made to address these points in the country.

TI  == [possible role of enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis in the etiology of infectious vaginitis].
AB  == vaginitis is a common gynecologic disorder. it is due to several causes, some even unknown. bacteroides fragilis is the most important anaerobe in clinical bacteriology, some strains of this group are notable for being enterotoxigenic and they have been associated with intestinal and extraintestinal syndromes. they have recently been isolated from patients with vaginitis. the purpose of this study was to investigate a possible association of enterotoxigenic b. fragilis with infectious vaginitis. 265 samples of vaginal exudate were processed, 202 from symptomatic patients and 63 healthy women. the identification of the microorganisms was carried out by conventional methods. in 31.2% of symptomatic patients were identified: gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus, candida albicans, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum and streptococcus agalactiae. b. fragilis was identified in 27 symptomatic patients and 5 healthy women. these strains were cultivated in liquid medium and incubated during 48 h at 36 degrees  c in anaerobe chambers. supernatant activity was assayed in ht-29 cells. eighteen b. fragilis strains isolated from symptomatic patients were enterotoxigenic, because induced alterations in target cell morphology. it was not identified in healthy women (p < 0.05). 77.7% of enterotoxigenic b. fragilis strains were not associated with other specific pathogens. this fact suggests that enterotoxigenic b. fragilis could be a cause for vaginitis. the effect of enterotoxin on e-cadherin of vaginal epithelium could facilitate invasion and its possible pathogenic role in the vagina. this is the first report that associates enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis as a possible cause of infectious vaginitis.

TI  == microbiological findings in endometrial specimen: our experience.
AB  == purpose: collection of an endometrial specimen for investigating infectious agents in the endometrial cavity is an invasive technique that is at times difficult and painful. in order to avoid the need for endometrial sampling in the cases of suspected or evident endometrial pathology, the aim of this study is to  investigate the reliability of cervical cultures for detecting infectious agents  present at the endometrial level, comparing the results between cervical cultures and endometrial cultures in women with clinical signs of endometrial inflammation. methods: in a prospective diagnostic study, in the period from january 2009 to october 2010, we enrolled 404 women referred to the department of obstetrics and gynecology for diagnostic hysteroscopy. all the patients underwent cervical and endometrial sampling. cultures for common bacteria, neisseria gonorrhoeae, yeast, and ureaplasma urealyticum were performed. results: the most  frequent infectious agents detected at the endometrial level were common bacteria, which accounted for 69% of all cases. in particular, streptococci were  found in 27% of cases, and bacteria from intestinal flora (enterococcus faecalis  and escherichia coli) was recovered in 31% of cases. u. urealyticum was detected  in 10% and mycoplasma in only one patient (0.2% of cases). no cases of n. gonorrhoeae were found. conclusions: cervical culture has a low concordance with  endometrial culture. in fact in only 33% of cases was the microorganism found in  the cervix the same as that found in the endometrium. these results infer that an endometrial culture is a useful investigative tool for determining the microorganisms in endometrial pathology.

TI  == hiv-infected women of burkina faso: a "reservoir" of mycoplasma infection.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (bv) and genital mycoplasma colonization in 251 hiv-positive  compared to 200 hiv-negative women at the maternal and child health (mch) service of saint camille medical center ouagadougou (burkina faso). methodology: after revealing the cervix with a speculum, we collected swabs of vaginal discharge for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. results: among hiv-positive and hiv-negative women, we identified respectively: mycoplasma hominis (16.7% versus  5.5%); ureaplasma urealyticum (16.3% versus 0.0%); co-infection m. hominis with u. urealyticum (13.14% versus 0.0%); candida albicans (21.11% versus 41.5%); e. coli (9.96% versus 4.0%); and the presence of abundant vaginal discharge (27.5% versus 5.0%) respectively. the nugent's score, utilized for the diagnosis of bv,  was significantly higher in hiv-positive women (p < 0.001) associated with poor vaginal hygiene practices (p < 0.01) and no use of condoms (p < 0.01). enterobacter, klebsiella pneumonia, klebsiella oxitocica, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, trichomonas vaginalis, and gardnerella vaginalis were also isolated, but in a low prevalence  ranging from 0% to 5%. conclusion: these results demonstrate that the hiv-positive women of burkina faso are frequently affected by bv and represent a  reservoir for mycoplasma infection. since these germs can lead to sterility and premature delivery, it is important to develop a policy of screening.

TI  == [association of human papillomavirus infection with other microbial pathogens in  gynecology].
AB  == objective: to investigate correlation between screening assay of human papillomavirus (hpv) and microbial pathogens in gynecology. methods: cervical samples were collected to search for hpv, bacteria and yeast infections in gynecologic outpatients. hpv typing was carried out by pcr and sequencing on cervical brush specimens. chlamydia trachomatis was identified by strand displacement amplification (sda) and the other microorganisms were detected by conventional methods. all data were analyzed to investigate the correlation among them. results: in this cross-sectional study, among 857 enrolled outpatients, there were 266 cases with positive hpv dna, and the rate of infection was 31.0% (266/857). hpv genotype showed that thirty-five different hpv types were identified, of which hpv16 was the most prevalent (14.5%, 38/262), followed by hpv58 (9.2%, 24/262), hpv53 (8.0%, 21/262) and hpv42 (6.1%, 16/262); while other  genotypes were present in less than 5% of hpv positive women. according to the reclassification, the aggregated percentage (high-risk and probably high-risk) of detected hpv was 58.8% (154/262), 27.9% (73/262) for low-risk and 13.4% (35/262)  for unknown-risk hpv types. among hpv positive women, cervical brush specimens results showed that more than 60% cases with normal cytology, 3.8% (10/266) with  high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (hsil), 29.7% (79/266) with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (lsil) and 3.0% (8/266) with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ascus), respectively. statistical analyses revealed there was a significant association between the infected hpv and chlamydia trachomatis or ureaplasma urealyticum (> 10,000 ccu/ml; all p < 0.01),  while no correlation was found between hpv infection and bacterial vaginosis, streptococcus agalactiae, candida, trichomonas vaginalis or ureaplasma urealyticum (</= 10 000 ccu/ml; all p > 0.05). among the cases with bacterial vaginosis, the positive rate of hpv infected was 42.6%. chlamydia trachomatis was one of the high-risk factors for the infection of hpv (or = 2.82, 95% ci: 1.74 -  4.57). mycoplasma hominis was isolated only in 2 cases, no patient was infected with neisseria gonorrhoeae. conclusions: although bacterial vaginosis was not significantly associated with hpv, it was more common among the hpv positive women. there is the significant association between hpv and chlamydia trachomatis or ureaplasma urealyticum which may be increase the infection of hpv. these data  suggest that it may be important to screen for the simultaneous presence of different microorganisms which may have synergistic pathological effects.

TI  == interaction between pathogenic bacteria and intrauterine leukocytes triggers alternative molecular signaling cascades leading to labor in women.
AB  == increased risk of preterm labor has been linked to cervicovaginal infection with  ureaplasma urealyticum and group b streptococci. although various experimental models have been developed to study the role of amniochorion infection in preterm labor, they typically exclude the initial interaction between intrauterine leukocytes (recruited from decidual vessels into the avascular fetal membranes) and infecting bacteria. in this work, we ascertained whether inflammatory molecules secreted by bacterium-activated intrauterine leukocytes stimulate the amniochorion production of mediators involved in human labor. using a two-step process beginning with placental circulating leukocytes as a proxy for intrauterine leukocytes, we found that coincubation of amniochorion explants with plasma from placental whole blood preincubated with group b streptococci resulted in a significant increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (mmp-9) levels in tissue. extensive changes in the connective tissue arrangement and a decrease in collagen content demonstrated the degradation of the extracellular matrix following this treatment. in contrast, plasma from blood preconditioned with u. urealyticum induced a highly significant secretion of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) and prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)) by the  amniochorion without changes in the extracellular matrix organization or content. these data demonstrate that group b streptococci induce degradation of the amniochorion as a result of mmp-9 production, probably via tnf-alpha, whereas u.  urealyticum stimulates the secretion of pge(2), probably via il-1beta, potentially stimulating myometrial contraction. our study provides novel evidence that the immunological cells circulating within the uterine microenvironment respond differentially to an infectious agent, triggering alternative molecular signaling pathways leading to human labor.

TI  == gardnerella, trichomonas vaginalis, candida, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum in the genital discharge of symptomatic fertile and asymptomatic infertile women.
AB  == this study aimed to establish the different prevalence of the microorganisms investigated in the two groups considered: fertile women with symptoms and asymptomatic women with infertility problems. the data from women (n= 952) investigated for two years for quality of genital discharge and the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, trichomonas vaginalis, candida species, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyiticum and chlamydia trachomatis were retrospectively analyzed. in the population of fertile women with symptoms the microrganisms most frequently involved are gardnerella vaginalis (26.6%), candida species (12.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (9.2%). the genital discharges of asymptomatic women with infertility problems are characterized by a prevalence of gardnerella vaginalis (19.7%), enterobacteriaceae or enterococci (12.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (8.6%). the reduction of vaginal lactobacilli flora and the presence of an elevated number of polymorphonucleates  in the vaginal discharge are important parameters to consider for the evaluation  of the health status of the human female urogenital tract. our results indicate that is important to culture the vaginal discharge for streptococcus agalactiae and for prevalence of enterobacteriaceae and enterococci. lastly, the reasons for the prevalence of some microorganisms (gardnerella vaginalis, enterobacteriaceae  and enterococci, streptococcus agalactiae) in the population of infertile asymptomatic women need to be better analyzed especially after the recent studies correlating idiopathic infertility with the presence of cervical cytokines in women with an abnormal vaginal flora.

TI  == [evaluation of microbiological diagnostics in urogenital infections in postmenopausal women].
AB  == objective: to establish the percentage of infections in postmenopausal women with urinary symptoms which can be confirmed by microbiological analysis, the most common causative agents and whether the urethra and vagina in patients with cystitis are concurrently colonized by pathogenic microorganisms. methods: laboratories of the croatian national institute of public health in zagreb, in the period of two years, analyzed 245 samples taken from patients with urinary symptoms who had been postmenopausal at least for a year. urine samples, as well  as urethral and vaginal swabs were taken from each patient and tested for causative agents of urogenital infections, genital mycoplasma and chlamydia trachomatis. results: cystitis was confirmed by microbiological analysis in 31.4% women, urethritis in 24.8%, and vaginitis in 15.1%. the most common causative agent of urethritis was ureaplasma urealyticum, while gardnerella vaginalis was the most common in vaginal infections. e. coli was concurrently isolated in urine, urethral and vaginal samples in 65.1% of patients with e. coli cystitis, while streptococcus agalactiae was isolated in urethral and vaginal samples in each patient with streptococcus agalactiae cystitis. conclusion: mucosal colonization of the urethra and vagina contributes to the incidence of cystitis in postmenopausal women. microbiological diagnostics is necessary to distinguish  between the symptoms of ageing of the urogenital system and infection, with a view to preventing unnecessary antibiotic therapy.

TI  == cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of women with a history of preterm birth.
AB  == preterm birth is associated with elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnfalpha at the maternal-fetal interface. previous studies have suggested that women with a history of preterm birth produce aberrantly strong inflammatory responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps). however many intrauterine infections in women are associated with pathogens including ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis and streptococcus agalactiae (group b  streptococcus) that contain pro-inflammatory factors other than lps. we evaluated whether peripheral blood leukocytes from women with a history of preterm birth produce elevated amounts of tnfalpha upon stimulation with pathogens associated with preterm birth and if pre-treatment with aspirin, an anti-inflammatory medication, decreases the ex vivo production of this cytokine. heat-killed bacteria elicited increased tnfalpha production from leukocytes in a dose-dependent manner, but no differences in tnfalpha production between leukocytes from women with preterm birth and control women with term birth were detected. in women who consumed aspirin each day for one week, tnfalpha production was increased in leukocytes from control women stimulated with escherichia coli and u. urealyticum, but was reduced or unchanged in leukocytes from women with preterm birth. similar trends were observed for a subset of samples stimulated with u. urealyticum and assayed for il-6, il-10, il-1beta and  tnfalpha by bead array. we conclude that leukocytes from women with a history of  preterm birth do not have elevated pro-inflammatory responses to pathogens, and that reproductive history is associated with different effects of aspirin on pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

TI  == comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the national institutes of health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  == we examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. the following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a croatian translation of the nih cpsi questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and stamey localization technique). patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in croatia. an infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), enterococcus in 36 (19%) and escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. in the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: ureaplasma urealyticum, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by e. coli and enterococcus (p<0.001). clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by c. trachomatis, enterococcus and e. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by t. vaginalis.

TI  == human papillomaviruses and genital co-infections in gynaecological outpatients.
AB  == background: high grade hpv infections and persistence are the strongest risk factors for cervical cancer. nevertheless other genital microorganisms may be involved in the progression of hpv associated lesions. methods: cervical samples  were collected to search for human papillomavirus (hpv), bacteria and yeast infections in gynaecologic outpatients. hpv typing was carried out by pcr and sequencing on cervical brush specimens. chlamydia trachomatis was identified by strand displacement amplification (sda) and the other microorganisms were detected by conventional methods. results: in this cross-sectional study on 857 enrolled outpatients, statistical analyses revealed a significant association of  hpv with c. trachomatis and ureaplasma urealyticum (at high density) detection, whereas no correlation was found between hpv infection and bacterial vaginosis, streptococcus agalactiae, yeasts, trichomonas vaginalis and u. urealyticum. mycoplasma hominis was isolated only in a few cases both in hpv positive and negative women and no patient was infected with neisseria gonorrhoeae. conclusion: although bacterial vaginosis was not significantly associated with hpv, it was more common among the hpv positive women. a significant association between hpv and c. trachomatis was found and interestingly also with u. urealyticum but only at a high colonization rate. these data suggest that it may  be important to screen for the simultaneous presence of different microorganisms  which may have synergistic pathological effects.

TI  == [bacteriological finding in the urethra in men with and without non-gonococcal urethritis].
AB  == background/aim: non-gonococcal urethritis (ngu) is a very common sexually transmitted disease. the etiology of the disease is complex and not completely solved. the aim of this study was to determine the bacteriological finding in the urethra in men with and without non-gonococcal urethritis. methods: the study group comprised 200 men with symptoms of urethritis. the control group consisted  of 60 men without symptoms of urethritis. the diagnosis of nongonococcal infection was made by finding of an increased number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (> or = 5) under the microscope in a sample of gram-stain of urethral  smear (x 1 000) and without evidence of neisseria. gonorrhoeae in specimens (negative direct microscopy and cell culture). bacteriological examination included: direct microscopy with the gram-stained and methylblue-stained smears of urethral discharges, and cultivation of specimens under the aerobic/unaerobic  conditions. in addition to standard bacterial examination and performinig direct  imunofluorescence test to detect chlamydia trachomatis (biomerieux, france), urethral smears were also examined for the presence of ureaplasma urealyticum and mycoplasma hominis by commercially available mycofast evolution 2 test (international microbio, france). the finding of mycoplasmas > or = 10(4) ccu/ml  was positive. the data were statistically analyzed using pearson chi2 and student t test. results: c. trachomatis was predominant bacterial species found in urethra in men with nongonococcal urethritis. it was isolated alone and/or mixed  with mycoplasmas and/or other bacteria in 86 (43.0%) of examinees. there was statistically significant difference in finding of c. trachomatis between the study group and the control group (p < 0.001). u. urealyticum was found in men with ngu: 30.2% were with c. trachomatis and 36.0% were without c. trachomatis (p > 0.05). in 16 (8.0%) men with ngu, c. trachomatis was isolated alone, while in 13.0% examinees it occurred with u. urealyticum. staphylococcus saprophyticus was isolated in one subject with ngu, alone. streptococcus agalactiae was found in 1.5% of men with urethritis. anaerobic bacteria were found in 38 (19.0%) subjects with ngu and in 7 (11.7%) subjects from the control group. conclusion: c. trachomatis was predominant bacterial species found in urethra in men with nongonococcal urthretitis. mixed infections were frequent.

TI  == placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in latvia.
AB  == background: to investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (rti) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. methods: in a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of neisseria gonorrhoeae, trichomonas vaginalis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus agalactiae  (gbs), staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis (gds) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). at delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta  was studied. results: some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had rti or endogenous vaginal flora. placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract  colonisation with g. vaginalis (p =0.013), bv (p =0.031), s. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). bv and bv-related g. vaginalis correlated with the  presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. genital tract colonisation with gds and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other rtis (p =0.023). conclusion: histological  placental inflammation is associated with both bv and genital tract colonisation  with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.

TI  == human neutrophil peptides in vaginitis/cervicitis of different etiology.
AB  == development of female genito-urinary infections depends on many factors, such as  immune system activity, virulence of microorganism and production of factors inhibiting the growth of microorganisms. taking into account the possibility of relapses or severe complications, it is very important to appropriately diagnose  and treat infections. because of recently observed increase of microbial resistance to antibiotics, researchers are looking for alternatives. in our study we evaluated and compared the concentration of human neutrophil peptides (hnp 1-3) in cervico-vaginal lavages (cvl), obtained from women with vaginitis/cervicitis. swabs from the posterior vaginal fornix and from the endocervical canal as well as cvl samples were obtained from 32 patients with vaginitis/cervicitis and 29 healthy women (control group). supernatants of cvl were used for determination of concentration of hnp by elisa. the difference between concentrations of hnp 1-3 in studied and control groups was statistically significant (p = 0.018). the maximal concentration was determined in patients with mixed infections (28.41 ng/ml), and group b streptococci, gbs, (28.06 ng/ml), the minimal concentrations in cases of c. trachomatis (mean concentrations did not differ from those in the control group: 16.93 ng/ml and 16.39 ng/ml, respectively). maximal correlation was determined for control-studied group with isolation of gbs (r = 0.79), and very high negative correlation for group of gbs - c. trachomatis (r = -0.98).

TI  == [role of bacteria associated with sexually transmitted infections in the etiology of lower urinary tract infection in primary care].
AB  == introduction: urinary tract infections (uti) are the second most frequent type of infectious pathology treated in primary care clinics. the participation of microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted infection has been reported as a cause of uti; nevertheless this concept is still controversial. to gather data on this subject, we carried out a search for gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis and streptococcus agalactiae besides the common microorganisms involved in uti. methods: a total of 1507 urine cultures from patients with a clinical diagnosis of low uti were analyzed. samples were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar and mcconkey agar, as well as hbt medium for g. vaginalis, and u9b broth and agar e broth for m. hominis and u. urealyticum. the following parameters were analyzed as possible risk factors: age, sex, pregnancy and diabetes status. results. there were 436 (28.9%) positive urine cultures. escherichia coli was isolated in 44.34% of cases. microorganisms  associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in 162 (37%): g. vaginalis (25.7%), u. urealyticum (5.9%), s. agalactiae (3.4%) and m. hominis (2%). uti were more frequent among the 20 to 40 year-old age group, in women and  in diabetic patients. conclusions: microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in a large percentage of cultures, indicating the  need for studies to clarify their role in the etiology of uti.

TI  == intrauterine infection and spontaneous midgestation abortion: is the spectrum of  microorganisms similar to that in preterm labor?
AB  == objective: to determine whether microorganisms associated with intrauterine infection and preterm labor play a contributing role in midgestation abortion. methods: a 4 year retrospective review of spontaneous midgestation abortions for  which autopsy and microbiological cultures of placental and fetal tissue were performed was conducted for a tertiary obstetrics hospital, which included a regional referral service for perinatal and fetal pathology. one hundred twenty-nine spontaneously delivered, nonmacerated, midgestation fetuses or stillbirths (of between 16 and 26 weeks' gestation) and placentas were examined and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, and genital mycoplasmas. results: microorganisms were recovered in 85 (66%) cases (57% placentas, 49% fetuses). among the culture positive cases, 81% had histological chorioamnionitis, 28% fetal pneumonitis, 38% clinical signs of infection, and 62% ruptured membranes at the time of miscarriage. these differed significantly from  culture-negative cases (44%, 5%, 13%, and 34%, respectively). group b streptococcus (gbs) was the most significant pathogen, recovered in 21 cases, 13  as the sole isolate, 94% with chorioamnionitis, and 47% in women with intact membranes. escherichia coli and ureaplasma urealyticum (22 and 24 cases, respectively) occurred mostly as mixed infections, with ruptured membranes. gbs,  mu urealyticum, and streptococcus anginosus group were individually associated with chorioamnionitis, bacteroides/prevotella and s. anginosus with fetal pneumonitis. the spectrum of microorganisms was similar to that in preterm labor  at later gestations; however, gbs appeared to be the most significant pathogen in midgestation miscarriage, especially with intact membranes. conclusions: unsuspected intrauterine infection underlies many spontaneous midgestation abortions. gbs is a key pathogen in this setting.

AB  == seven microorganisms (n. gonorrhoeae, c. albicans, t. vaginalis, g. vaginalis, m. hominis, u. urealyticum and streptococcus of group b) have been assayed in genital samplings of 164 asymptomatic women (control group) and of 374 women suffering from abnormal vaginal secretions (vaginitis group). all these bacteria  except group b streptococci were isolated in the vaginitis group more frequently  than in the control group (p less than 0.01). the proportion of negative cultures for all tested bacteria was 39% in the control group and 6.4% in the vaginitis group (p less than 0.01). this shows an association of these bacteria with 70% of the patients of the vaginitis group and with only 26% of the women of the control group (p less than 0.01). it is to be noted that the ph values are higher in the  group of women with vaginitis than in the control group (p less than 0.01). comparison of the microbial flora during "specific" an "non-specific" vaginitis indicates that g. vaginalis is isolated more frequently in patients with non-specific vaginitis than among those with specific vaginitis (p less than 0.01). likewise, m. hominis is isolated more frequently in groups of women with either non-specific vaginitis or t. vaginalis vaginitis, than in groups of patients with a c. albicans vaginitis (p less than 0,01). the results of this study indicate that there is a causal relationship between vaginitis and the presence of t. vaginalis. c. albicans, g. vaginalis, m. hominis or n. gonorrhoeae, either as a single or a mixed infection, and that there is a relationship between increased ph values and abnormal vaginal secretions.

TI  == association of ureaplasma urealyticum in the placenta with perinatal morbidity and mortality.
AB  == we investigated the presence of ureaplasmas, mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, fungi, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and cytomegalovirus in fetal membranes and evaluated their association with perinatal morbidity and mortality. we cultured 801 placentas from three groups of subjects (144 who died in the perinatal period, 452 neonates admitted to the intensive-care unit, and 205 controls). ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, or both were isolated from 21 per cent of placentas of premature and term infants who died in the perinatal period, 25 per cent of those admitted to intensive care, and 11 per cent of controls. gestational age and birth weight were inversely related to isolation of ureaplasma, and chorioamnionitis was positively related to isolation. the presence of ureaplasmas in the placenta suggests the transcervical migration of these microorganisms from the lower genitourinary tract. these data show a strong association between ureaplasma infection of the placenta and low birth weight of  the neonate and suggest that the association is causal.

TI  == [chlamydia trachomatis in the urogenital tract of pregnant women].
AB  == in two hundred and thirty three prenatal patients from the prenatal clinic of the university of wurzburg cervical, vaginal and urethral swabs were taken for microscopic examination and culture for chlamydia trachomatis (c. trachomatis), neisseria gonorrhoeae (n. gonorrhoeae), trichomonas vaginalis (t. vaginalis), beta-hemolytic streptococci, candida species, ureaplasma urealyticum (u. urealyticum), mycoplasma species and facultatively pathogenic and apathogenic aerobic bacteria. in ten cases (4%) c. trachomatis was found. in six cases hemolytic streptococci group b were detected. fifty two cases showed a candida species. seventy nine cases presented u. urealyticum. one case showed a mycoplasma species and one case showed trichomonas vaginalis. striking was the significantly increased rate of premature rupture of the membranes in the group with u. urealyticum compared to the group without u. urealyticum.

TI  == sexually transmitted conditions among women college students.
AB  == we studied 500 unselected young women who consulted a gynecologist in a student health service. most participants were symptom-free and had normal physical examinations. few sexually transmitted infections were encountered. neisseria gonorrhoeae was recovered from two and trichomonas vaginalis was obtained from 14 of 500 women. chlamydia trachomatis was recovered from 20 (4.6%) of 439 participants. genital warts, genital herpes, and molluscum contagiosum, respectively, were noted in seven, four, and one of the 500 participants. there was no cases of syphilis, scabies, or pediculosis pubis. mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum, respectively, were recovered from 17.6 and 56.8% of the subjects. prevalent vaginal bacteria included lactobacilli, streptococci, staphylococcus epidermidis, and diphtheroids. gardnerella vaginalis was isolated  from the vaginal specimens of about one third of the participants.
