TI  == a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of multispecies probiotics on cognitive reactivity to sad mood.
AB  == background: recent insights into the role of the human microbiota in cognitive and affective functioning have led to the hypothesis that probiotic supplementation may act as an adjuvant strategy to ameliorate or prevent depression. objective: heightened cognitive reactivity to normal, transient changes in sad mood is an established marker of vulnerability to depression and is considered an important target for interventions. the present study aimed to test if a multispecies probiotic containing bifidobacterium bifidum w23, bifidobacterium lactis w52, lactobacillus acidophilus w37, lactobacillus brevis w63, lactobacillus casei w56, lactobacillus salivarius w24, and lactococcus lactis (w19 and w58) may reduce cognitive reactivity in non-depressed individuals. design: in a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, pre- and  post-intervention assessment design, 20 healthy participants without current mood disorder received a 4-week probiotic food-supplement intervention with the multispecies probiotics, while 20 control participants received an inert placebo  for the same period. in the pre- and post-intervention assessment, cognitive reactivity to sad mood was assessed using the revised leiden index of depression  sensitivity scale. results: compared to participants who received the placebo intervention, participants who received the 4-week multispecies probiotics intervention showed a significantly reduced overall cognitive reactivity to sad mood, which was largely accounted for by reduced rumination and aggressive thoughts. conclusion: these results provide the first evidence that the intake of probiotics may help reduce negative thoughts associated with sad mood. probiotics supplementation warrants further research as a potential preventive strategy for  depression.

TI  == isolation and molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium spp. from faeces of the blue-fronted amazon parrot in brazil.
AB  == in brazil, the blue-fronted amazon parrot (amazona aestiva) is a common pet. the  faecal microbiota of these birds include a wide variety of bacterial species, the majority of which belong to the gram-positive lactic acid bacteria (lab) clade. the aim of this study was to investigate differences in the diversity and abundance of lab and bifidobacterium spp. in the cloacae between wild and captive birds and to select, identify and characterise lab for consideration as a parrot  probiotic. cloacal swabs were collected from 26 wild and 26 captive birds. bacterial dna was extracted, and the 16s rrna genes were amplified. the numbers of pcr-positive enterococcus, pediococcus, and lactobacillus species isolated from wild and captive birds were significantly different (p<0.05). enterococcus was the most frequently isolated genus, followed by pediococcus, lactobacillus, lactococcus and bifidobacterium. enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and bifidobacterium bifidum were the most frequently isolated species from all birds. this study increases our understanding of the faecal microbiota, and may help to improve the nutrition and habitat management of captive and wild parrots. the bacterial population identified in the faecal microbiota of clinically healthy wild and captive parrots can serve as a database to analyse variations in the gut microbiota of pathogen-infected parrots and to develop probiotics specific to these genera.

TI  == dahi containing lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum improves phagocytic potential of macrophages in aged mice.
AB  == the present study investigated the effect of dahi containing potential probiotic  bacterial strains on macrophage functions in ageing mice. probiotic dahi was prepared by co-culturing dahi bacteria (lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis biovar diacetylactis) along with lactobacillus acidophilus lavk2 (la-dahi) or combined l. acidophilus lavk2 and bifidobacterium  bifidum bbvk3 (labb-dahi) in buffalo milk. the effect of ageing on phagocytic function was evaluated on 4 mo, 12 mo and 16 mo old mice. the effect of probiotic dahi was evaluated for macrophage functions in ageing mice (12 mo old) fed la-dahi or labb-dahi supplements for 4 months. the production of extracellular superoxide and h2o2 declined in peritoneal macrophages but enhanced in splenic macrophages, while intracellular superoxide declined in both peritoneal and splenic macrophages with ageing in mice. a decline in phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages was also observed in aged mice. supplementation of diet with la-dahi or labb-dahi for 4 months improved production of reactive oxygen species and phagocytic and adherence indices of peritoneal macrophages in aged mice. these results suggest that oral administration of la-dahi or labb-dahi has  potential to improve immune functions in ageing individuals.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == role of sortase-dependent pili of bifidobacterium bifidum prl2010 in modulating bacterium-host interactions.
AB  == bifidobacteria represent one of the dominant groups of microorganisms colonizing  the human infant intestine. commensal bacteria that interact with a eukaryotic host are believed to express adhesive molecules on their cell surface that bind to specific host cell receptors or soluble macromolecules. whole-genome transcription profiling of bifidobacterium bifidum prl2010, a strain isolated from infant stool, revealed a small number of commonly expressed extracellular proteins, among which were genes that specify sortase-dependent pili. expression  of the coding sequences of these b. bifidum prl2010 appendages in nonpiliated lactococcus lactis enhanced adherence to human enterocytes through extracellular  matrix protein and bacterial aggregation. furthermore, such piliated l. lactis cells evoked a higher tnf-alpha response during murine colonization compared with their nonpiliated parent, suggesting that bifidobacterial sortase-dependent pili  not only contribute to adherence but also display immunomodulatory activity.

TI  == role of extracellular transaldolase from bifidobacterium bifidum in mucin adhesion and aggregation.
AB  == the ability of bifidobacteria to establish in the intestine of mammals is among the main factors considered to be important for achieving probiotic effects. the  role of surface molecules from bifidobacterium bifidum taxon in mucin adhesion capability and the aggregation phenotype of this bacterial species was analyzed.  adhesion to the human intestinal cell line ht29 was determined for a collection of 12 b. bifidum strains. in four of them-b. bifidum lmg13195, dsm20456, dsm20239, and a8-the involvement of surface-exposed macromolecules in the aggregation phenomenon was determined. the aggregation of b. bifidum a8 and dsm20456 was abolished after treatment with proteinase k, this effect being more  pronounced for the strain a8. furthermore, a mucin binding assay of b. bifidum a8 surface proteins showed a high adhesive capability for its transaldolase (tal). the localization of this enzyme on the surface of b. bifidum a8 was unequivocally demonstrated by immunogold electron microscopy experiments. the gene encoding tal from b. bifidum a8 was expressed in lactococcus lactis, and the protein was purified to homogeneity. the pure protein was able to restore the autoaggregation phenotype of proteinase k-treated b. bifidum a8 cells. a recombinant l. lactis strain, engineered to secrete tal, displayed a mucin- binding level more than three times higher than the strain not producing the transaldolase. these findings suggest that tal, when exposed on the cell surface of b. bifidum, could  act as an important colonization factor favoring its establishment in the gut.

TI  == age-related decline in macrophage and lymphocyte functions in mice and its alleviation by treatment with probiotic dahi containing lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  == this study evaluated the effects of probiotic dahi administration in ageing mice  on macrophage and lymphocyte functions. probiotic dahi were prepared by co-culturing in buffalo milk (3% fat) dahi bacteria (lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris ncdc-86 and lc. lactis ssp. lactis biovar diacetylactis ncdc-60) along with lactobacillus acidophilus lavk2 (la-dahi) or combined lb. acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum bbvk3 (labb-dahi). four groups of 12 mo old mice were fed for four months, with the supplements (5 g/day) of buffalo milk (3% fat), dahi, la-dahi and labb-dahi, respectively, in addition to basal diet, and a fifth group that received no supplements served as control. the immune functions of young mice (4 mo old) were also compared with those of ageing adult mice (16 mo old). the production of nitric oxide and cytokines il-6 and tnf-alpha declined and that of immunosuppressive prostaglandin e2 (pge2) increased by stimulated peritoneal and splenic macrophages in ageing mice, compared with their young counterparts. the proliferation of stimulated splenocytes diminished and the production of il-2 decreased and that of il-6 and tnf-alpha enhanced in ageing compared with young mice. feeding ageing mice with la-dahi or labb-dahi improved peritoneal macrophage functions stimulating nitric oxide and il-6 and diminishing pge2 production. feeding la-dahi or labb-dahi also improved lymphocyte functions stimulating their proliferation and production of il-2 in ageing mice. to conclude, the probiotic la-dahi and labb-dahi are effective in reversing age related decline in immune functions in mice.

TI  == probiotic dahi containing lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum alleviates age-inflicted oxidative stress and improves expression of biomarkers of ageing in mice.
AB  == the potential benefiting effects of probiotic dahi on age-inflicted accumulation  of oxidation products, antioxidant enzymes and expression of biomarkers of ageing were evaluated in mice. probiotic dahi were prepared by co-culturing in buffalo milk (3% fat) dahi bacteria (lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris ncdc-86 and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis biovar diacetylactis ncdc-60) along with selected  strain of lactobacillus acidophilus lavk2 (la-dahi) or combined l. acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum bbvk3 (labb-dahi). four groups of 12 months old mice  (6 each) were fed for 4 months supplements (5 g/day) of buffalo milk (3% fat), dahi, la-dahi and labb-dahi, respectively, with basal diet. the activities of catalase (cat) and glutathione peroxidase (gpx) declined and the contents of oxidation products, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (tbars) and protein carbonyls, increased in red blood corpuscles (rbcs), liver, kidney and heart tissues and superoxide dismutase (sod) activity increased in rbcs and hepatic tissues during ageing of mice. feeding ageing mice with la-dahi or labb-dahi increased cat activity in all the four tissues, and gpx activity in rbcs and hepatic tissue, and a significant decline in tbars in plasma, kidney and hepatic  tissues and protein carbonyls in plasma. feeding mice with probiotic dahi also reversed age related decline in expression of biomarkers of ageing, peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-alpha, senescence marker protein-30 (smp-30) and klotho in hepatic and kidney tissues. the present study suggests that probiotic dahi containing selected strains of bacteria can be used as a potential nutraceutical intervention to combat oxidative stress and molecular alterations associated with ageing.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic bacteria on salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis in enterocyte-like caco-2 cells.
AB  == invasion of the gut by pathogenic salmonella leads to production of il-8 that initiates inflammatory reactions to combat the bacterium. however, its persistent production causes tissue damage and interventions that suppress il-8 production prevent tissue damage. we hypothesised that probiotics could mediate their benefits via inhibition of il-8 synthesis. caco-2 cells were infected with probiotic bifidobacterium infantis w52, lactobacillus casei w56, lactococcus lactis w58, lactobacillus acidophilus w70, bifidobacterium bifidum w23, or lactobacillus salivarius w24 or pathogenic salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis 857 at 0, 0.2, 1, 2, 10, 20, 100 or 200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell for 1 hour. cells were also exposed to a combination of one probiotic bacterium (200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and the graded numbers of salmonella as either  co-incubation (1 hour) or pre-incubation of the probiotic bacterium (1 hour) followed by salmonella (1 hour). the cells recovered for 2 or 24 hours. il-8 and  hsp70 were determined by elisa and western blot respectively. both probiotics and salmonella induced a dose- and time-dependent synthesis of il-8 but probiotics induced far lower il-8 levels than salmonella. the salmonella-induced il-8 was significantly suppressed by b. infantis w52, l. casei w56 and l. lactis w58 at low numbers of salmonella (0.2 to 20 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and within 2 hours of recovery. the observed probiotic-mediated reduction in il-8 secretion was transient, and lost after a few hours. in addition, these three probiotics induced a significant increase in hsp70 expression while l. acidophilus w70, b. bifidum w23 and l. salivarius w24 induced a weak hsp70 expression and could not suppress the salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis. we conclude that suppression of salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis by caco-2 cells is exhibited by probiotics that induce expression of hsp70, suggesting that the protective role of probiotics could be mediated, at least in part, via hsp70 expression. this suppression is limited to a low number of infecting pathogenic salmonella.

TI  == the effects of selected probiotic strains on the development of eczema (the panda study).
AB  == background: modification of the intestinal microbiota by administration of probiotic bacteria may be a potential approach to prevent allergic disease. we aimed to study primary prevention of allergic disease in high-risk children by pre- and postnatal supplementation of selected probiotic bacteria. methods: in a  double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, a mixture of probiotic bacteria selected by in-vitro experiments (bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, and lactococcus lactis; ecologic panda) was prenatally administered to mothers of high-risk children (i.e. positive family history of allergic disease) and to their offspring for the first 12 months of life. results: parental-reported eczema during the first 3 months of life was significantly lower in the intervention group compared with placebo, 6/50 vs 15/52 (p = 0.035). after 3 months, the incidence of eczema was similar in both groups. cumulative incidence of parental-reported eczema at 1 and 2 years was 23/50 (intervention) vs 31/48 (placebo) and 27 (intervention) vs 34 (placebo), respectively. the number needed to treat was 5.9 at age 3 and 12 months and 6.7 at age 2 years. the intervention group was significantly more frequently colonized with higher numbers of lc. lactis. furthermore, at age 3 months, in vitro production of il-5 (146 pg/ml vs 72 pg/ml; p = 0.04) was decreased in the probiotic-group compared with the placebo-group. conclusions: this particular combination of probiotic bacteria shows a preventive effect on the incidence of eczema in high-risk children, which seems to be sustained during the first 2 years of life. in addition to previous studies, the preventive effect appears to  be established within the first 3 months of life.

TI  == design of a multispecies probiotic mixture to prevent infectious complications in critically ill patients.
AB  == background & aims: although the potential for probiotics is investigated in an increasing variety of diseases, there is little or no consensus regarding the desired probiotic properties for a particular disease in question, nor about the  final design of the probiotic. specific strain selection procedures were undertaken to design a disease-specific multispecies probiotic. methods: from a strain collection of 69 different lactic acid bacteria a primary selection was made of 14 strains belonging to different species showing superior survival in a  simulated gastrointestinal environment. functional tests like antimicrobial activity against a range of clinical isolates and cytokine inducing capacity in cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used to further identify potential strains. results: specific strains inhibited growth of clinical isolates whereas others superiorly induced the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10.  based on functional tests and general criteria regarding probiotic design and safety, a selection of the following six strains was made (ecologic 641); bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis. combination of these strains resulted in a wider antimicrobial spectrum, superior induction of il-10 and silencing of pro-inflammatory cytokines as compared to the individual components. conclusions: application of strict criteria during the design of a disease-specific probiotic prior to implementation in clinical trials may provide a rational basis for use of probiotics.

TI  == selection of probiotic bacteria for prevention of allergic diseases: immunomodulation of neonatal dendritic cells.
AB  == modification of intestinal microbiota early in life by administration of probiotic bacteria may be a potential approach to prevent allergic disease. to select probiotic bacteria for in vivo purposes, we investigated the capacity of probiotic bacteria to interact with neonatal dendritic cells (dc) and studied the ensuing t cell polarizing effect. immature dc were generated from cord blood-derived monocytes and maturation was induced by maturation factors (mf), lipopolysaccharide (lps) plus mf and bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis, lactobacillus salivarius, lactococcus lactis alone or combined with mf. after 12  days of co-culture with dc and staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin b (seb) as antigenic stimulus, cytokine production by autologous t cells was determined by intracellular cytokine staining. additionally, cells were stimulated with cd3 and cd28 monoclonal antibodies and cytokines were measured in supernatants by multiplex assay. the probiotic strains induced partial maturation of dc. full maturation of dc was induced for all strains tested when mf was added. the percentage of interleukin (il)-4 producing t cells was lower in t cell cultures stimulated with b. bifidum matured dc compared to mf and lps matured dc, which coincided with a higher percentage of interferon (ifn)-gamma-producing t cells. furthermore, t cells stimulated by b. bifidum matured dc produced significantly more il-10 compared to mf matured dc. selected species of the bifidobacterium genus prime in vitro cultured neonatal dc to polarize t cell responses and may therefore be candidates to use in primary prevention of allergic diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == viability of probiotic (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in argentinian fresco cheese.
AB  == we evaluated the suitability of argentinian fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. we used cultures of bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), bifidobacterium longum (two strains), bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms,  yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had  a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == binding of mutagens by fractions of the cell wall skeleton of lactic acid bacteria on mutagens.
AB  == the binding effect of cells and cell fractions, cell wall skeleton, cytoplasm, whole cells, and cell wall skeleton treated by lysozyme and alpha-amylase at 37 degrees c for 5 h, on trp-p-1 (3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-[5h]pyrido [4,3-b]indole) and trp-p-2 (3-amino-1-methyl-[5h]-pyrido[4,3-b]indole) were investigated. the cell and cell wall skeleton of streptococcus cremoris z-25 had greater binding activity, but cytoplasm and extract of cell wall skeleton did not bind trp-p-1 and trp-p-2. when the cells or cell wall skeleton were treated with lysozyme and  alpha-amylase, unbound trp-p-1 and trp-p-2 concentrations were greater than that  of the untreated control. it is possible that cell walls may be involved in the binding of mutagenic pyrolyzates to lactic acid bacteria. the cell wall skeleton  of s. cremoris z-25, lactobacillus acidophilus ifo 13951, and bifidobacterium bifidum ifo 14252 showed binding of trp-p-1, 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido(1,2-a:3',2'- d)imidazole, 2-amino-5-phenylpyridine, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline, 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo(4,5-f) quinoline, and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoxaline. the cell wall skeleton of s. cremoris group and streptococcus lactis also showed the binding activity with a n-nitrosodimethylamine. the binding of trp-p-1 to cell walls was  very high, and the binding of mutagenic pyrolyzates was variable with different bacterial species. the peptidoglycan complex and polysaccharides liberated from cell wall skeleton of s. cremoris z-25 showed strong binding of trp-p-2. peptidoglycans has a binding effect of about 19.86 micrograms/mg; polysaccharides had a binding effect of 14 micrograms/mg.
