TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, kl-1y, from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1.
AB  == three bacteriocins from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase hplc. the bacteriocin peptides kl-1x, -1y and -1z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 da, respectively. all three peptides were  stable at ph 2-12 and 25 degrees c and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees c for 30 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min. however, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. kl-1y showed  broad inhibitory activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis dmst 17368, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442, p. aeruginosa atcc 9027, escherichia coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739. kl-1x and -1z inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. kl-1x, kl-1y and kl-1z exhibited synergistic activity. the successful amino acid sequencing of kl-1y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin kl-1y". plantaricin kl-1y exhibited bactericidal activity against bacillus cereus jcm 2152(t). compared to nisin, kl-1y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 au/ml against the growth of bacillus coagulans jcm 2257(t), b. cereus jcm 2152(t), listeria innocua atcc 33090(t), staphylococcus aureus tistr 118, e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only b. coagulans jcm 2257(t) and b. cereus jcm 2152(t). therefore, the novel plantaricin kl-1y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.

TI  == plantaricin iia-1a5 from lactobacillus plantarum iia-1a5 displays bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == plantaricin iia-1a5 is a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum iia-1a5  isolated from indonesian beef. this research aimed to identify the genes involved in plantaricin iia-1a5 production and examine its mode of action against staphylococcus aureus. it has been reported that a bacteriocin structural gene, plnw, is present in genome of l. plantarum iia-1a5. here, we reported the presence of additional genes responsible for plantaricin precursor (plna and plnef) and a gene encoding the quorum sensor of histidine kinase (plnb). it indicates that genes involved in production of plantaricin iia-1a5 are organized  in at least two bacteriocin operons (plnabcd, plnefi) and a structural plnw gene. purified plantaricin iia-1a5 yielded a single band in sds-page with apparent size of 6.4 kda. amino acid composition of purified plantaricin iia-1a5 was mainly composed of cationic glutamic acid and cysteine that allowed the formation of disulphide bonds, suggesting plantaricin iia-1a5 belongs to the pediocin-subclass of class ii bacteriocins. plantaricin iia-1a5 displayed remarkable antibacterial  activity against s. aureus, which was initiated by the adsorption of plantaricin  iia-1a5 onto the cell membrane of s. aureus. the adsorption is hypothesised to be facilitated by non-ionic interactions as it is reduced by the presence of organic solvents or detergents. this adsorption promoted leakage of cellular metabolites  through the cell membrane of s. aureus, as indicated by the release of genetic and proteinaceous material of s. aureus observed at 260 and 280 nm, respectively. the leakage also promoted the release of divalent (ca(2+), mg(2+)) and monovalent (k(+)) cations. the release of these intracellular components might be due to pores formed in the cell membrane of s. aureus by plantaricin iia-1a5 as shown by scanning electron microscopy. altogether, the mode of action of plantaricin iia-1a5 against s. aureus seems to be bactericidal as indicated by lysis of the cell membrane.

TI  == cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and  exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == background: the success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions;  hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use  of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. we investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on  their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected  enteric pathogens. methods: probiotic cultures were inoculated into mrs broth adjusted to ph 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees c. survivors of ph 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees c. cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh mrs broth and incubated at 55 degrees c for 2 h. the cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. the adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. the combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. results: acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and bifidobacterium longum lmg 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. however, for b. longum bb46  and b. bifidum lmg 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. a cocktail containing l. plantarum  + b. longum bb46 + b. longum lmg 13197 best inhibited s. aureus while e. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing l. acidophilus la14 150b + b. longum bb46 + b. bifidum lmg 11041. a cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures  was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. conclusion: multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal  conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.

TI  == [comparison of expression and antibacterial activities of recombinant porcine lactoferrin expressed in four lactobacillus species].
AB  == the coding sequence for the mature peptide of porcine lactoferrin (plf) was synthesized according to the codon usage of lactobacillus, to establish optimized porcine lactoferrin lactobacillus expression system. the gene was ligated into the xho i/bamh i site of lactobacillus expression vector ppg612.1 and the recombinant plasmid ppg612.1-plf was transformed individually into lactobacillus  casei atcc393, lactobacillus pentosus klds1.0413, lactobacillus plantarum klds1.0344 or lactobacillus paracasei klds1.0652 by electroporation. after induction with xylose, expression of the recombinant proteins was detected by western blotting and confocal laser scanning microscopy. secretion of recombinant plf proteins from four recombinant species was determined quantitatively by elisa. the antibacterial activities of recombinant proteins were measured by agar diffusion method. the result shows that plf was correctly expressed in four species of recombinant lactobacillus, with molecular weight of about 73 kda. the  expression levels in recombinant lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei were 9.6 mug/ml, 10.8 mug/ml, 12.5 mug/ml and 9.9 mug/ml, respectively. antimicrobial activity experiment shows that the recombinant proteins were active against e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, listeria, pasteurella. the recombinant plf expressed by recombinant lactobacillus plantarum showed the best antibacterial activity among  all recombinant lactobacillus species. these data represent a basis for the development and application of porcine lactoferrin from recombinant lactobacillus.

TI  == differential profiles of gastrointestinal proteins interacting with peptidoglycans from lactobacillus plantarum and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == peptidoglycan (pgn) is a major cell wall component of gram-positive bacteria that contributes to the regulation of host immunity in the gastrointestinal tract (git). although gram-positive bacteria contain structurally distinct pgns that are considered to differently interact with the git, pgn-binding proteins (pgn-bps) in the git have been poorly understood. in the present study, we purified pgns from lactobacillus plantarum and staphylococcus aureus (named as lp.pgn and sa.pgn, respectively) and identified lp.pgn-bps and sa.pgn-bps in the  lysate of mouse git. lp.pgn activated nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (nod) 1 and nod2, whereas sa.pgn activated nod2, but not nod1, implying that both pgns retained the biological activity and were differently recognized by the host cells. pgn-bps were isolated by precipitation with lp.pgn or sa.pgn and identified using ltq-orbitrap hybrid fourier transform mass spectrometry. three independent experiments demonstrated that 18 lp.pgn-bps and 6 sa.pgn-bps were reproducibly obtained with statistical significance (p<0.05). both lp.pgn and sa.pgn bound to proteins which are related to cytoskeleton, microbial adhesion, and mucosal integrity. lp.pgn selectively bound to proteins related to gene expression, chaperone, and antimicrobial function. however, sa.pgn preferentially interacted with proteins involved in adherence and invasion of pathogens. collectively, these results suggest that bacterial pgns interact with the proteins regulating mucosal homeostasis and immunity in the gut and pgns of commensals and pathogens might be also differentially recognized in the git.

TI  == characterization and bioactivities of an exopolysaccharide produced by lactobacillus plantarum yw32.
AB  == the exopolysaccharide (eps) produced by lactobacillus plantarum yw32 was purified and characterized, and the in vitro bioactivities of the purified eps were also evaluated. the eps had a molecular weight of 1.03x10(5) da, and it consisted of mannose, fructose, galactose and glucose in an approximate molar ratio of 8.2:1:4.1:4.2. microstructural studies of the eps demonstrated a web-like structure composed of compact ropes, and presence of many homogeneous rod-shaped  lumps. the eps also showed high thermal stability with a degradation temperature  of 283.5 degrees c. furthermore, the eps at a dose of 5mg/ml had strong scavenging abilities toward hydroxyl (77.5%) and superoxide radicals (66.5%). the eps exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the formation of biofilms by several pathogenic bacteria, including escherichia coli o157, shigella flexneri cmcc (b), staphylococcus aureus ac1 and salmonella typhimurium  s50333. in vitro antitumor assay of the eps showed that it had good inhibitory activity against colon cancer ht-29 cells. these characteristics and bioactivities of the eps would make it a promising candidate for use as a potential food adjunct in foods with healthy properties.

TI  == characterization of bacteriocin like inhibitory substance produced by a new strain brevibacillus borstelensis ag1 isolated from 'marcha'.
AB  == in the present study, a bacterium isolated from marcha- a herbal cake used as traditional starter culture to ferment local wine in north east india, was evaluated for bacteriocin like inhibitory substance production and was tested against six food borne/spoilage causing pathogens viz. listeria monocytogenes mtcc 839, bacillus subtilis mtcc 121, clostridium perfringens mtcc 450, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides mtcc 107 by using bit/disc method followed by well diffusion method. the bacterial isolate was identified as brevibacillus borstelensis on the basis of phenotypic,  biochemical and molecular characteristics using 16sr rna gene technique. bacteriocin like inhibitory substance produced by brevibacillus borstelensis ag1  was purified by gel exclusion chromatography. the molecular mass of the brevibacillus borstelensis ag1 was found to be 12 kda. purified bacteriocin like  inhibitory substance of brevibacillus borstelensis was further characterized by studying the effect of temperature, ph, proteolytic enzyme and stability. bacteriocin like inhibitory substance was found to be thermostable upto 100 degrees c, active at neutral ph, sensitive to trypsin, and partially stable till  third week of storage thus showing a bright prospective to be used as a potential food biopreservative.

TI  == cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity of gold-supported cerium oxide nanoparticles.
AB  == background: cerium oxide nanoparticles (ceo2) have been shown to be a novel therapeutic in many biomedical applications. gold (au) nanoparticles have also attracted widespread interest due to their chemical stability and unique optical  properties. thus, decorating au on ceo2 nanoparticles would have potential for exploitation in the biomedical field. methods: in the present work, ceo2 nanoparticles synthesized by a chemical combustion method were supported with 3.5% au (au/ceo2) by a deposition-precipitation method. the as-synthesized au, ceo2, and au/ceo2 nanoparticles were evaluated for antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity in raw 264.7 normal cells and a549 lung cancer cells. results: the as-synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by x-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and ultraviolet-visible measurements. the x-ray diffraction study confirmed the formation of cubic fluorite-structured ceo2 nanoparticles with a size of 10 nm. all synthesized nanoparticles were nontoxic towards raw 264.7 cells at doses of 0-1,000 mum except for au at >100 mum. for a549 cancer cells, au/ceo2 had the highest inhibitory effect, followed by both au and ceo2 which showed a similar effect at 500 and 1,000 mum. initial binding of nanoparticles occurred through localized positively charged sites in a549 cells as shown by a shift in zeta potential from positive to negative after 24 hours of incubation. a dose-dependent elevation in reactive oxygen species indicated that  the pro-oxidant activity of the nanoparticles was responsible for their cytotoxicity towards a549 cells. in addition, cellular uptake seen on transmission electron microscopic images indicated predominant localization of nanoparticles in the cytoplasmic matrix and mitochondrial damage due to oxidative stress. with regard to antibacterial activity, both types of nanoparticles had the strongest inhibitory effect on bacillus subtilis in monoculture systems, followed by salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus,  while, in coculture tests with lactobacillus plantarum, s. aureus was inhibited to a greater extent than the other bacteria. conclusion: gold-supported ceo2 nanoparticles may be a potential nanomaterial for in vivo application owing to their biocompatible and antibacterial properties.

TI  == effectiveness of the two microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 and lactobacillus plantarum lp01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium gardnerella vaginalis. bv is not  accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. in contrast, aerobic vaginitis (av) is predominantly associated  with escherichia coli, but streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus are also involved. standard treatment of bv consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. the main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and  recurrences. this study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected  lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize g. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit e. coli, thus identifying a possible use in av. the second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by  bv using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. materials and  methods: for this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to  hinder the growth of g. vaginalis american type culture collection 10231. the bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with lactobacillus plantarum lp01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with bv. the 2 microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 (dsm 26955) and l. plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. the amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. the women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive  nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. a clinical examination was performed and the nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). a statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and  d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. results: l. fermentum  lf15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards g. vaginalis american type culture collection (atcc) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. in the  human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely l. fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01, significantly reduced the nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, p<0.001). eight women (33.3%) recorded a nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. at the  end of the second month, only 4 women registered a nugent score >7, definable as  bv (16.7%, p=0.065 compared with d28). in the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. conclusions: bv, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. furthermore, bv is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. this study suggests the ability of the 2 strains l.  fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01 to counteract acute gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. this could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against gardnerella on  the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. in the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against e. coli, their prospective use in av could also prove interesting.

TI  == inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by crude and fractionated extract from lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == increasing levels of antibiotic resistance by staphylococcus aureus have posed a  need to search for non-antibiotic alternatives. this study aimed to assess the inhibitory effects of crude and fractionated cell-free supernatants (cfs) of locally isolated lactic acid bacteria (lab) against a clinical strain of s. aureus. a total of 42 lab strains were isolated and identified from fresh vegetables, fresh fruits and fermented products prior to evaluation of inhibitory activities. cfs of lab strains exhibiting a stronger inhibitive effect against s. aureus were fractionated into crude protein, polysaccharide and lipid fractions.  crude protein fractions showed greater inhibition against s. aureus compared to polysaccharide and lipid fractions, with a more prevalent effect from lactobacillus plantarum 8513 and l. plantarum bt8513. crude protein, polysaccharide and lipid fractions were also characterised with glycine, mannose  and oleic acid being detected as the major component of each fraction, respectively. scanning electron microscopy revealed roughed and wrinkled membrane morphology of s. aureus upon treatment with crude protein fractions of lab, suggesting an inhibitory effect via the destruction of cellular membrane. this research illustrated the potential application of fractionated extracts from lab  to inhibit s. aureus for use in the food and health industry.

TI  == short communication: development of a direct in vivo screening model to identify  potential probiotic bacteria using caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  == caenorhabditis elegans is an accepted model host to study host-bacteria interactions in the gut, in addition to being a simple model with which to study  conserved aspects of biological signaling pathways in intestinal environments, because these nematode worms have similar intestinal cells to those of humans. here, we used c. elegans to develop a new in vivo screening system for potential  probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab). initially, critical colonization ability of lab strains isolated from korean infant feces was screened in the worm intestinal tract over a period of 5 d. furthermore, we investigated host health-promoting activities, including longevity-extending effects and immune-enhancing activities against foodborne pathogen infection. we identified 4 lab strains that were highly persistent in the nematode gut and that significantly prolonged the longevity of c. elegans and improved the survival of c. elegans in response to infection by staphylococcus aureus. the 4 lab strains we identified showed resistance to acid and bile conditions, assimilated cholesterol, and were able to attach to a mucus layer. the 4 lab isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum using 16s rrna sequencing analysis. taken together, we developed a direct in vivo screening system using c. elegans to study host health-promoting lab. our system is simple, rapid, cost-effective, and reliable, and we anticipate that this system will result in the discovery of many more potential probiotic bacteria for dairy foods.

TI  == purification and characterization of plantaricin zj5, a new bacteriocin produced  by lactobacillus plantarum zj5.
AB  == the aim of this study is to investigate the antimicrobial potential of lactobacillus plantarum zj5, a strain isolated from fermented mustard with a broad range of inhibitory activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. here we present the peptide plantaricin zj5 (pzj5), which is an extreme ph and heat-stable. however, it can be digested by pepsin and proteinase k. this  peptide has strong activity against staphylococcus aureus. pzj5 has been purified using a multi-step process, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interactions and reverse-phase chromatography. the molecular mass of the peptide was found to be 2572.9 da using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). the primary structure of this peptide was determined using amino  acid sequencing and dna sequencing, and these analyses revealed that the dna sequence translated as a 44-residue precursor containing a 22-amino-acid n-terminal extension that was of the double-glycine type. the bacteriocin sequence exhibited no homology with known bacteriocins when compared with those available in the database, indicating that it was a new class iid bacteriocin. pzj5 from a food-borne strain may be useful as a promising probiotic candidate.

TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == purification and characterisation of plantaricin zj008, a novel bacteriocin against staphylococcus spp. from lactobacillus plantarum zj008.
AB  == a novel bacteriocin, plantaricin zj008 produced by lactobacillus plantarum zj008  isolated from fresh milk, was purified by xad 2, cation exchange chromatograph, gel chromatograph, and rp-hplc. mass spectrometry based on maldi-tof indicated that the bacteriocin had a molecular of 1334.77 da. only five of twenty amino acids could be identified by edman degradation. this bacteriocin was highly thermostable (121 degrees c, 30 min) and exhibited narrow ph stability (ph 4.0-5.0). it was sensitive to alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin, papain, and pepsin. however it still had 80% of activity after treatment by proteinase k. the action  mode of this peptide functioned as bactericidal, but it did not lead to lysis of  cells. this bacteriocin exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against tested gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially staphylococcus spp. these results suggested that this bacteriocin appears potentially very useful to  control and inhibit staphylococcus spp. in the food industry.

TI  == evaluation of indirect impedance for measuring microbial growth in complex food matrices.
AB  == the suitability of indirect impedance to accurately measure microbial growth in real food matrices was investigated. a variety of semi-solid and liquid food products were inoculated with bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus plantarum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enteriditis, candida tropicalis or zygosaccharomyces rouxii and co2 production was monitored using a conductimetric (don whitely r.a.b.i.t.) system. the majority (80%) of food and microbe combinations produced  a detectable growth signal. the linearity of conductance responses in selected food products was investigated and a good correlation (r(2) >/= 0.84) was observed between inoculum levels and times to detection. specific growth rate estimations from the data were sufficiently accurate for predictive modeling in some cases. this initial evaluation of the suitability of indirect impedance to generate microbial growth data in complex food matrices indicates significant potential for the technology as an alternative to plating methods.

TI  == probiotic assessment of enterococcus durans 6hl and lactococcus lactis 2hl isolated from vaginal microflora.
AB  == forty-five lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from the vaginal specimens of healthy fertile women, and the identities of the bacteria were confirmed by sequencing of their 16s rdna genes. among these bacteria, only four isolates were able to resist and survive in low ph, bile salts and simulated in vitro digestion conditions. lactococcus lactis 2hl, enterococcus durans 6hl, lactobacillus acidophilus 36yl and lactobacillus plantarum 5bl showed the best resistance to these conditions. these strains were evaluated further to assess their ability to adhere to human intestinal caco-2 cells. lactococcus lactis 2hl and e. durans 6hl were the most adherent strains. in vitro tests under neutralized ph proved the antimicrobial activity of both strains. results revealed that the growth of escherichia coli o26, staphylococcus aureus and shigella flexneri was suppressed  by both lab strains. the antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that these strains were sensitive to all nine antibiotics: vancomycin, tetracycline, ampicillin, penicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol. these data suggest that e. durans 6hl and lactococcus lactis 2hl could be examined further for their useful properties and could be developed  as new probiotics.

AB  == platelet-activating factor receptor (pafr) plays an important role in bacterial infection and inflammation. we examined the effect of the bacterial cell wall components lipopolysaccharide (lps) and lipoteichoic acid (lta) from lactobacillus plantarum (plta) and staphylococcus aureus (alta) on pafr expression in thp-1, a monocyte-like cell line. lps and alta, but not plta, significantly increased pafr expression, whereas priming with plta inhibited lpsmediated or alta-mediated pafr expression. expression of toll-like receptor (tlr) 2 and 4, and cd14 increased with lps and alta treatments, but was inhibited by plta pretreatment. neutralizing antibodies against tlr2, tlr4, and cd14 showed that these receptors were important in lps-mediated or alta-mediated pafr expression. pafr expression is mainly regulated by the nuclear factor kappa b signaling pathway. blocking paf binding to pafr using a pafr inhibitor indicated  that lps-mediated or alta-mediated paf expression affected tnf-alpha production.  in the mouse small intestine, plta inhibited pafr, tlr2, and tlr4 expression that was induced by heat-labile toxin. our data suggested that plta has an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the expression of pafr that was induced by pathogenic ligands.

TI  == interaction of antimicrobial peptide plantaricin149a and four analogs with lipid  bilayers and bacterial membranes.
AB  == the amidated analog of plantaricin149, an antimicrobial peptide from lactobacillus plantarum nric 149, directly interacts with negatively charged liposomes and bacterial membranes, leading to their lysis. in this study, four pln149-analogs were synthesized with different hydrophobic groups at their n-terminus with the goal of evaluating the effect of the modifications at this region in the peptide's antimicrobial properties. the interaction of these peptides with membrane models, surface activity, their hemolytic effect on red blood cells, and antibacterial activity against microorganisms were evaluated. the analogs presented similar action of plantaricin149a; three of them with no hemolytic effect (< 5%) until 0.5 mm, in addition to the induction of a helical element when binding to negative liposomes. the n-terminus difference between the analogs and plantaricin149a retained the antibacterial effect on s. aureus and p. aeruginosa for all peptides (mic50 of 19 mum and 155 mum to plantaricin149a, respectively) but resulted in a different mechanism of action against the microorganisms, that was bactericidal for plantaricin149a and bacteriostatic for  the analogs. this difference was confirmed by a reduction in leakage action for the analogs. the lytic activity of plantaricin149a is suggested to be a result of the peptide-lipid interactions from the amphipathic helix and the hydrophobic residues at the n-terminus of the antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == probiotic potential of lactobacillus plantarum ld1 isolated from batter of dosa,  a south indian fermented food.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum ld1 was isolated from dosa batter and identified by biochemical, physiological and genetic methods. species level identification was  done by 16s rdna amplification and sequencing. the probiotic potential of strain  ld1 was assessed by different standard parameters. cell surface hydrophobicity was recorded to be 62 % with sat value <0.007 m. seventy-eight percent of viable  count was found after treatment with simulated gastric juice containing pepsin (ph 2.0). bile salt tolerance and bile salt hydrolase activity were also demonstrated by strain ld1. the culture supernatant was able to inhibit food-borne as well as clinical pathogenic microorganisms such as staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, urogenic escherichia coli and vibrio sp. strain ld1 was found to be sensitive to  most of the antibiotics used in the study. since strain has been isolated from food source that is most typical of southern india, it would be safe for further  consumption in probiotic products.

TI  == plantaricin ld1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of lactobacillus plantarum ld1.
AB  == plantaricin ld1, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum ld1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees c for 20 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a ph range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of  organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. the crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase k showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. the molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kda, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. it inhibited not only related strains but also other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b-4562, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis nrrl b-1821, enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354, enterobacter cloacae nrrl b-14298, micrococcus  luteus, staphylococcus aureus, urogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and vibrio sp. these properties of plantaricin ld1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.

TI  == high-level expression, purification and characterisation of porcine beta-defensin 2 in pichia pastoris and its potential as a cost-efficient growth promoter in porcine feed.
AB  == porcine beta-defensin 2 (pbd2), a recently discovered porcine defensin that is produced by the intestine, exerts antimicrobial activities and innate immune effects that are linked to intestinal diseases in pigs. here, we report a codon-optimised protein corresponding to mature pbd2 cdna that was expressed and  purified in pichia pastoris yeast. the highest amount of secreted protein (3,694.0 mg/l) was reached 144 h into a 150-h induction during high-density cultivation. precipitation followed by gel exclusion chromatography yielded 383.7 mg/l purified recombinant pbd2 (rpbd2) with a purity of ~93.7 %. two recombinant  proteins of 5,458.5 and 5,258.4 da were detected in the mass spectrum due to variation in the amino-terminus. the rpbd2 exhibited high antimicrobial activity  against a broad range of pig pathogenic bacteria (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic] 32-128 mug/ml); the highest activity was observed against salmonella choleraesuis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus suis (mic 32-64  mug/ml). however, rpbd2 also inhibited the growth of probiotics such as lactobacillus plantarum, bacillus subtilis and saccharomyces cerevisiae, but at lower efficacies than the pathogens. purified or unpurified rpbd2 also maintained high activity over a wide range of ph values (2.0-10.0), a high thermal stability at 100 degrees c for 40 min and significant resistance to papain, pepsin and trypsin. in addition, the activity of rpbd2 towards s. aureus was unaffected by 10 mm dithiothreitol (dtt) and 20 % dimethyl sulphoxide (dmso). our results suggest that pbd2 could be produced efficiently in large quantities in p. pastoris and be a substitute for traditional antibiotics for growth promotion in  the porcine industry.

TI  == differential effects of low and high doses of lipoteichoic acid on lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-6 production.
AB  == objective: interleukin-6 (il-6), which is increased in patients who are suffering from septic shock, is an important mediator of the inflammatory response. here, we examined the priming effect of lipoteichoic acid (lta) and lipopolysaccharide  (lps) on il-6 production in a monocyte-like cell line. methods: thp-1 cells were  primed by treatingwith a low or high dose of lta isolated from staphylococcus aureus (alta) and then re-treated with lps. il-6 production, receptor expression, and the variation of signaling molecules were examined by elisa, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting, respectively. results: lps-mediated il-6 production was dramatically increased in thp-1 cells pretreated with a low dose alta, while it was significantly decreased when a high dose of alta was given along with lps. lps-induced il-6 production in low dose alta priming cells mediated by nf-kappab and mapks pathways, and akt functioned as a negative regulator of il-6 production. together, the results of this study suggest that different doses of bacterial cell surface components can mediate a diverse range of responses with respect to inflammatory cytokine production.

TI  == lactobacilli reduce chemokine il-8 production in response to tnf-alpha and salmonella challenge of caco-2 cells.
AB  == the probiotic properties of two selected lactobacilli strains were assessed. l. salivarius and l. plantarum displayed higher hydrophobicity (48% and 54%, resp.)  and coaggregation ability with four pathogens (from 7.9% to 57.5%). l. salivarius and l. plantarum had good inhibitory effects on s. aureus (38.2% and 49.5%, resp.) attachment to caco-2 cells. live lactobacilli strains and their conditioned media effectively inhibited il-8 production (<14.6 pg/ml) in tnf-alpha-induced caco-2 cells. antibiotic-treated and the sonicated lactobacilli also maintained inhibitory effects (il-8 production from 5.0 to 36.3 pg/ml); however, the heat-treated lactobacilli lost their inhibitory effects (il-8 production from 130.2 to 161.0 pg/ml). these results suggest that both the structural components and the soluble cellular content of lactobacilli have anti-inflammatory effects. we also found that pretreatment of caco-2 cells with lactobacilli inhibited s. typhimurium-induced il-8 production (<27.3 pg/ml). however, lactobacilli did not inhibit il-8 production in caco-2 cells pretreated  with s. typhimurium. these results suggest that the tested lactobacilli strains are appropriate for preventing inflammatory diseases caused by enteric pathogens  but not for therapy. in short, l. salivarius and l. plantarum are potential candidates for the development of microbial ecological agents and functional foods.

TI  == human pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses in drosophila: disease modeling, lessons, and shortcomings.
AB  == drosophila has been the invertebrate model organism of choice for the study of innate immune responses during the past few decades. many drosophila-microbe interaction studies have helped to define innate immunity pathways, and significant effort has been made lately to decipher mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis. here we catalog 68 bacterial, fungal, and viral species studied in  flies, 43 of which are relevant to human health. we discuss studies of human pathogens in flies revealing not only the elicitation and avoidance of immune response but also mechanisms of tolerance, host tissue homeostasis, regeneration, and predisposition to cancer. prominent among those is the emerging pattern of intestinal regeneration as a defense response induced by pathogenic and innocuous bacteria. immunopathology mechanisms and many microbial virulence factors have been elucidated, but their relevance to human health conventionally necessitates  validation in mammalian models of infection.

TI  == potential probiotic attributes and antagonistic activity of an indigenous isolate lactobacillus plantarum dm5 from an ethnic fermented beverage "marcha" of north eastern himalayas.
AB  == a novel isolate dm5 identified as lactobacillus plantarum displayed in vitro probiotic properties as well as antimicrobial activity. it showed adequate level  of survival to the harsh conditions of the gastrointestinal tract and survived low acidic ph 2.5 for 5 h. artificial gastric juice and intestinal fluidic environment decreased the initial viable cell population of isolate dm5 only by 7% and 13%, respectively, while lysozyme (200 microg/ml) and bile salt (0.5%) enhanced its growth. it was found to deconjugate taurodeoxycholic acid, indicating its potential to reduce hypercholesterolemia. isolate dm5 demonstrated cell surface hydrophobicity of 53% and autoaggregation of 54% which are the prerequisite for adhesion to epithelial cells and colonization to host. bacteriocin activity of isolate was found to be 6400 au/ml as it inhibited the growth of food borne pathogens escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and alcaligenes faecalis. the bactericidal action of bacteriocin from isolate was analyzed by flow cytometry, rendering its use as prospective probiotic and starter culture in food industry.

TI  == evaluation and functional characterization of a biosurfactant produced by lactobacillus plantarum cfr 2194.
AB  == the study details the investigations on the ability of lactobacillus plantarum cfr 2194, an isolate from kanjika, a rice-based ayurvedic fermented product, to produce biosurfactant. surfactant production, as a function of fermentation time, indicates that the maximum production occurred at 72 h under stationary conditions. isolation, partial purification, and characterization of the biosurfactant produced have been carried out, and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) spectra demonstrated that biosurfactants were constituted by  protein and polysaccharide fractions, i.e., possessed the structure typical of glycoprotein, which is affected by the medium composition and the phase of growth of the biosurfactant-synthesizing strain. critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the biosurfactant was found to be 6 g l(-1). the emulsification index (ei), emulsification activity (ea), and emulsion stability (es) values of the biosurfactant have confirmed its emulsification property. aqueous fractions of the produced biosurfactant exhibited a significant antimicrobial activity against the food-borne pathogenic species: escherichia coli atcc 31705, e. coli mtcc 108, salmonella typhi, yersinia enterocolitica mtcc 859, and staphylococcus aureus f 722. more importantly, the biosurfactant from l. plantarum showed antiadhesive property against above food-borne pathogens. the results thus indicate the potential for developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of food contact surfaces and health-care prosthesis using these biosurfactants.

TI  == lipoteichoic acid of streptococcus mutans interacts with toll-like receptor 2 through the lipid moiety for induction of inflammatory mediators in murine macrophages.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is a pathogenic gram-positive bacterium that is closely associated with dental caries and subsequent pulpal inflammation. although lipoteichoic acid (lta) is considered a major virulence factor of gram-positive bacteria, little is known about the innate immunity to s. mutans lta. in this study, we purified lta from s. mutans (sm.lta) through n-butanol extraction, hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, and ion-exchange column chromatography to investigate its immunological properties using murine macrophages. the sm.lta preparation had no detectable contamination with endotoxins, proteins, or nucleic acids. upon exposure to sm.lta, the murine macrophage cell-line raw 264.7 cells produced tnf-alpha and nitric oxide (no) in  a dose-dependent manner. sm.lta preferentially bound to and activated cho/cd14/tlr2 cells rather than cho/cd14/tlr4 cells, which are stable transfectants expressing cd14 and tlr2 or cd14 and tlr4, respectively. sm.lta could not induce tnf-alpha or no production in macrophages derived from tlr2-deficient mice whereas it dose-dependently induced those inflammatory mediators in wild-type macrophages. tlr2-dependent induction of no by sm.lta was  also confirmed in raw 264.7 cells using specific antibodies blocking tlr2. furthermore, sm.lta deacylated by alkaline hydrolysis neither stimulated tlr2 nor induced tnf-alpha or no production, suggesting that sm.lta lipid moieties are crucial for the immuno-stimulatory activity of sm.lta. unlike staphylococcus aureus lta, which has potent immuno-stimulating activity, sm.lta showed a modest  induction of no production comparable to ltas of other oral bacteria enterococcus faecalis and lactobacillus plantarum. in conclusion, our results suggest that the sm.lta interacts with tlr2 through the lipid moiety for the induction of inflammatory mediators in macrophages.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

AB  == cheese whey hydrolyzates supplemented with phenylpyruvic acid (ppa) and commercial nutrients can be efficiently metabolized by lactobacillus plantarum cect-221 to biosynthesize some compounds with attractive applications in the food market. the main metabolites of cell-free extracts were antimicrobial compounds such as phenyllactic acid (pla) and lactic acid (la). the production of pla by l. plantarum cect-221 was evaluated in the man-rogosa-sharpe broth supplemented with two biosynthetic precursors: phenylalanine or ppa. using 30.5 mm ppa, the microorganism increased sevenfold the concentration of pla producing 16.4 mm pla  in 46 h. a concentration of 40 mm ppa was a threshold to avoid substrate inhibition. the biosynthesis of whey hydrolyzates as a carbon source was enhanced by fed-batch fermentation of ppa; the average productivity of pla increased up to 45.4 +/- 3.02 mm after 120 h with a product yield of 0.244 mm mm(-1); meanwhile,  la reached 26.1 +/- 1.3 g l(-1) with a product yield of 0.72 g g(-1). cell-free fed-batch extracts charged in wells showed bacteriocin activity with halos of 7.49 +/- 1.44 mm in plates inoculated with carnobacterium piscicola and antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus (11.54 +/- 1.14 mm), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.17 +/- 2.46 mm), listeria monocytogenes (7.75 +/- 1.31 mm), and salmonella enterica (3.60 +/- 1.52 mm). additionally, the analysis of the volatile composition of the headspace of this cell-free extract revealed that l. plantarum is a potential producer for natural aromas, such as acetophenone, with high price in the market. this is the first report of pla production from cheese whey and ppa. the extracts showed bacteriocin activity and potential to be applied as an antimicrobial in the elaboration of safer foods.

TI  == vitamin c inhibits staphylococcus aureus growth and enhances the inhibitory effect of quercetin on growth of escherichia coli in vitro.
AB  == quercetin is a natural flavonoid possessing a number of health beneficial effects. its bioactivity is restricted by low solubility and sensitivity to oxidative degradation, factors that are often ignored in laboratory studies. we studied the antimicrobial effects of quercetin on staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and lactobacillus plantarum at concentrations at which it is soluble and investigated how the antioxidant vitamin c modulates these activities. s. aureus was the most sensitive of the studied bacteria. after 12 hours of culturing, 90 microm quercetin decreased the growth of s. aureus to 75 % of the value for a control culture. 1 mm vitamin c combined with 90 microm quercetin diminished the growth of s. aureus drastically to 3 % of that of the control culture supplemented with vitamin c only. interestingly, vitamin c by itself inhibited the growth of s. aureus as well, and 5 mm vitamin c inhibited growth completely. the growth inhibition of e. coli was slightly but significantly better in the presence of both quercetin and vitamin c than in the  presence of quercetin alone. probiotic l. plantarum was resistant to quercetin in the presence and absence of vitamin c. enhancement of quercetin's antimicrobial activity by vitamin c is partly explained by the stabilizing effect of vitamin c  on quercetin. even though the acidity of vitamin c contributes to the inhibition  of s. aureus growth, neutralized vitamin c also inhibits the growth efficiently even without quercetin. our results suggest that vitamin c affects the metabolism of s. aureus and that these changes are likely to result in the observed growth inhibition. although vitamin c itself is a powerful antioxidant, its aerobic metabolism increases oxidative stress on bacterial cells. vitamin c may therefore be a safe and natural alternative for restricting the growth of s. aureus when non-toxicity is required.

TI  == inhibition of staphylococcus aureus adherence to caco-2 cells by lactobacilli and cell surface properties that influence attachment.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that can colonize human and animal intestinal tracts, causing certain gastrointestinal diseases. the adherence of enteric pathogens to host intestinal epithelial cells is important for their pathogenesis. in the present study, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum were investigated in vitro to examine their ability to competitively exclude s. aureus. various factors involved in attachment, including bacterial status and cell concentration, growth phase, competition patterns, and surface-layer protein extracts, were also investigated. live lactobacilli in the mid-log growth phase exhibited maximum inhibitory activity when lactobacilli were pre- or co-incubated with s. aureus. however, the inhibitory activity was significantly reduced when the lactobacilli were inactivated by heating or treated with licl. furthermore, both lactobacilli possessed certain cell surface properties, such as hydrophobicity, autoaggregation, and coaggregation ability. l. salivarius and l. plantarum strongly inhibited s. aureus adherence to caco-2 cells and their inhibition activity was significantly influenced by several factors that affect adhesion inhibition.

TI  == characteristics of microbial biofilm on wooden vats ('gerles') in pdo salers cheese.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to characterize microbial biofilms from 'gerles' (wooden vats for making pdo salers cheese) and identify their role in milk inoculation and in preventing pathogen development. gerles from ten farms producing pdo salers cheese were subjected to microbial analysis during at least  4 periods spread over two years. they were distinguished by their levels of lactobacillus (between 4.50 and 6.01 log cfu/cm(2)), gram negative bacteria (between 1.45 and 4.56 log cfu/cm(2)), yeasts (between 2.91 and 5.57 log cfu/cm(2)), and moulds (between 1.72 and 4.52 log cfu/cm(2)). they were then classed into 4 groups according their microbial characteristics. these 4 groups were characterized by different milk inoculations (with either sour whey or starter culture, daily or not), and different washing procedures (with water or whey from cheese making). the farm gerles were not contaminated by salmonella, listeria monocytogenes or staphylococcus aureus. only one slight, punctual contamination was found on one gerle among the ten studied. even when the milk was deliberately contaminated with l. monocytogenes and s. aureus in the 40 l experimental gerles, these pathogens were found neither on the gerle surfaces nor in the cheeses. using 40 l experimental gerles it was shown that the microbial biofilms on the gerle surfaces formed in less than one week and then remained stable. they were mainly composed of a great diversity of lactic acid bacteria (leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus hilgardii,...), gram positive catalase positive bacteria (curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, curtobacterium oceanosedimentum citrococcus spp., brachybacterium rhamnosum, kocuria rhizophila, arthrobacter spp....) and yeast (kluyveromyces lactis, kluyveromyces marxianus). in less than  1 min, even in a 500 l farm gerle, the gerle's microbial biofilm can inoculate pasteurized milk with micro-organisms at levels superior to those in raw milk.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == probiotic features of two oral lactobacillus isolates.
AB  == in this study, we checked lactobacilli strains of human origin for their potential as probiotic. samples were collected from oral mucosa of 16 healthy individuals, out of which twenty isolates were obtained and two of them were selected and identified as lactobacillus plantarum (g1) and l. casei (g3). both isolates exhibited antagonistic action towards pathogenic microorganisms such as  staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella abony, and clostridium sporogenes, but not on the growth of candida albicans. the bacteriocin activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6358-p was shown only by  l. plantarum g1. moreover, the isolates g1 and g3 showed good viability in the acid gastric environment and in the gut environment containing bovine bile salts. the viability of g1 and g3 isolates in the gastrointestinal tract, and the adhesion to the intestinal mucosa were also confirmed in vivo. the biochemical tests of blood samples revealed lower levels of serum triglycerides and cholesterol, as well as reduced activity of alkaline phosphatase in all lactobacilli-treated wistar rats, compared to control ones. no toxicity for nmri  ham mice was observed. according to our experimental results, these findings imply that l. plantarum g1 and l. casei g3 could be characterized as potential probiotics.

TI  == structure of plantaricin locus of lactobacillus plantarum 8p-a3.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum 8p-a3 is a strain which is well known on the russian pharmaceutical market and it is included in several probiotic products. the strain has been widely used since 1973 but the mechanisms of its antibacterial activity were unknown. l. plantarum 8p-a3 expressed high antagonistic activity against the wide range of bacterial pathogens including streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae strains. dna sequence analysis of l. plantarum 8p-a3 genome revealed the presence of a complete plantaricin locus of about 20,000 bp encoding genes of at least two bacteriocins--plantaricins ef and  nc8. the plantaricin locus found in l. plantarum 8p-a3 is homologous to the plantaricin cluster in l. plantarum j51.

TI  == antibiosis of vineyard ecosystem fungi against food-borne microorganisms.
AB  == fermentation extracts from fungi isolated from vineyard ecosystems were tested for antimicrobial activities against a set of test microorganisms, including five food-borne pathogens (staphylococcus aureus ep167, acinetobacter baumannii (clinically isolated), pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, escherichia coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) and candida albicans my1055) and two probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum lch17 and lactobacillus brevis lch23). a total of 182 fungi was grown in eight different media, and the fermentation extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity. a total of 71 fungi produced extracts active against at least one pathogenic microorganism, but not against any probiotic bacteria. the gram-positive bacterium s. aureus ep167 was more susceptible to antimicrobial fungi broth extracts than gram-negative bacteria and pathogenic fungi. identification of active fungi based on internal transcribed spacer rrna sequence analysis revealed that species in the orders pleosporales, hypocreales and xylariales dominated. differences in antimicrobial selectivity were observed  among isolates from the same species. some compounds present in the active extracts were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.  antimicrobial metabolites produced by vineyard ecosystem fungi may potentially limit colonization and spoilage of food products by food-borne pathogens, with minimal effect on probiotic bacteria.

TI  == inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by lysostaphin-expressing lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 in a modified genital tract secretion medium.
AB  == lactobacillus species are a predominant member of the vaginal microflora and are  critical in maintaining an acidic vaginal environment thought to contribute to the prevention of a number of urogenital diseases. however, during menstruation the ph of the vaginal environment increases to neutrality, a ph conducive for staphylococcus aureus proliferation and the production of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (tsst-1) in susceptible women. in order to generate lactobacillus species capable of expressing lysostaphin (an endopeptidase that cleaves the cell wall of s. aureus) in a modified genital tract secretion medium (mgts) under neutral-ph conditions, six prominent proteins from lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 spent medium were identified by mass spectrometry. sequences for promoters, signal peptides, and mature lysostaphin were used to construct plasmids that were subsequently transformed into l. plantarum wcfs1. the promoter and signal sequences of lp_3014 (putatively identified as a transglycosylase) or the promoter sequence of lp_0789 (putatively identified as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) with the signal sequence of lp_3014 exhibited lysostaphin activity on buffered medium containing heat-killed s. aureus. the cassettes were integrated into the chromosome of l. plantarum wcfs1, but only the cassette containing the promoter and signal sequence from lp_3014 had integrated into the  appropriate site. coculture assays using buffered mgts showed that lysostaphin expressed from l. plantarum wcfs1 reduced the growth of tsst-1-producing strains  of s. aureus under neutral-ph conditions. this study provides the basis for determining whether lysostaphin-producing lactobacillus strains could potentially be used as a means to inhibit the growth of s. aureus during menstruation.

TI  == site-specific protein labeling with amine-containing molecules using lactobacillus plantarum sortase.
AB  == modification of proteins with small molecules is a widely used and powerful tool  in biological research. enzymatic approaches are particularly promising because substrate specificity allows for site-specific modification. sortase a, a transpeptidase from staphylococcus aureus, cleaves between the t and g residues in the sequence lpxtg, and subsequently links the carboxyl group of the t residue to an amino group of n-terminal glycine oligomers by a native peptide bond. although gram-positive bacteria have several kinds of sortases, there are few reports concerning their expression and substrate specificity. here, we demonstrate site-specific protein modification with primary amine-containing molecules catalyzed by lactobacillus plantarum sortase. enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) was employed as a model protein, and an amine-containing biotin molecule was site-specifically conjugated with lpqtseq-tagged egfp. we developed a novel lactobacillus plantarum sortase that has different substrate specificity compared to staphylococcus aureus sortase. amine-directed protein modification was achieved using the lactobacillus plantarum sortase ''lpqtseq'' sequence original recognition tag. our results demonstrate a promising method for expanding the capabilities of site-specific protein-small molecule modification.

TI  == antagonistic intestinal microflora produces antimicrobial substance inhibitory to pseudomonas species and other spoilage organisms.
AB  == chicken intestine harbors a vast number of bacterial strains. in the present study, antimicrobial substance produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of healthy chicken was detected, characterized, and purified. based on 16s rrna sequencing, the bacteria were identified as lactobacillus plantarum vn. the antimicrobial substance produced by this bacterium was designated vn-1 and exhibited a broad-spectrum of activity against  many important pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, salmonella typhimurium, and erwinia amylovova. vn-1 was determined to be thermostable, insensitive to ph  values ranging from 2.0 to 8.0, resistant to various organic solvents and to enzymatic inactivation. the inhibition kinetics displayed a bactericidal mode of  action. this study revealed an antimicrobial substance with low molecular mass of less than 1 kda as determined by ultrafiltration and having features not previously reported for lab isolated from chicken intestines. the detection of this antimicrobial substance addresses an important aspect of biotechnological control agents of spoilage caused by pseudomonas spp. and promises the possibility for preservation of refrigerated poultry meat. practical application: the newly characterized antimicrobial substance and designated as vn-1 may have the potential to be used in food preservation.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum (vr1) isolated from an ayurvedic medicine (kutajarista) ameliorates in vitro cellular damage caused by aeromonas veronii.
AB  == background: lactobacillus plantarum is considered as a safe and effective probiotic microorganism. among various sources of isolation, traditionally fermented foods are considered to be rich in lactobacillus spp., which can be exploited for their probiotic attribute. antibacterial property of l. plantarum has been demonstrated against various enteric pathogens in both in vitro and in vivo systems. this study was aimed at characterizing l. plantarum isolated from kutajarista, an ayurvedic fermented biomedicine, and assessing its antagonistic property against a common enteropathogen aeromonas veronii. results: we report the isolation of l. plantarum (vr1) from kutajarista, and efficacy of its cell free supernatant (cfs) in amelioration of cytotoxicity caused by aeromonas veronii. on the part of probiotic attributes, vr1 was tolerant to ph 2, 0.3% bile salts and simulated gastric juice. additionally, vr1 also exhibited adhesive property to human intestinal ht-29 cell line. furthermore, cfs of vr1 was antibacterial to enteric pathogens like pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, aeromonas veronii and clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa and e. coli. detailed study regarding the effect of vr1 cfs on a. veronii cytotoxicity showed a significant decrease in vacuole formation and detrimental cellular changes in vero cells. on the other hand, a. veronii cfs caused disruption of tight junction proteins zo-1 and actin in mdck cell line, which was prevented by pre-incubation with cfs of vr1. conclusions: this is the first study to report isolation of l. plantarum (vr1) from kutajarista and characterisation for its probiotic attributes. our study demonstrates the antagonistic property of vr1 to a. veronii and effect of vr1 cfs in reduction of  cellular damage caused by a. veronii in both vero and mdck cell lines.

TI  == growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens by kimchi prepared with bacteriocin-producing starter culture.
AB  == kimchi (starter kimchi) was prepared with leuconostoc citreum gj7, a bacteriocin  producer, with the objective of preventing growth and/or survival of foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhi, and staphylococcus  aureus. numbers of the pathogens inoculated to 5.41 to 5.63 log cfu/ml into the filtrate of freshly made starter kimchi remained stable for the first 12 h of incubation at 10 degrees c. reductions of 2.69, 2.88, and 3.42 log cfu/ml were observed 48 h after inoculation with e. coli o157:h7, s. typhi, and s. aureus, respectively. use of the bacteriocin-producing starter culture for kimchi fermentation significantly reduced the numbers of pathogens in the filtrate. reductions of 3.85, 4.45, and 5.19 log cfu/ml were observed 48 h after inoculation for e. coli o157:h7, s. typhi, and s. aureus, respectively. presumably, the antimicrobial activity came from the ingredients of kimchi such as sulfur-containing compounds, low ph (approximately ph 4.5) produced by the conversion of sugars into organic acids and the bacteriocins potentially produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab), such as kimchicin gj7. together, these data suggest that addition of a starter culture capable of producing bacteriocins could serve as a strategy to protect the fermented product from delivering pathogens upon consumption and that the kimchi filtrate itself may be used as a food preservative. practical application: the adaptation of the starter fermentation into kimchi induced a faster die off of the pathogens as compared to natural fermentation. the in situ bateriocin-production by leuc. citreum gj7 in kimchi would act with antimicrobial kimchi ingredients in a synergistic manner to protect the fermented product from delivering pathogens upon consumption.

TI  == multi-spectrometric analyses of lipoteichoic acids isolated from lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == lipoteichoic acid is a major cell wall virulence factor of gram-positive bacteria. ltas from various bacteria have differential immunostimulatory potentials due to heterogeneity in their structures. although recent studies have demonstrated that lta isolated from lactobacillus plantarum (plta) has anti-inflammatory properties and is less inflammatory than ltas from pathogenic bacteria, little is known about the structure of plta. in this study, high-field  nmr spectra of the plta were compared with those of lta from pathogenic bacterium, staphylococcus aureus (alta). the 2d nmr results demonstrated that plta possesses alpha-linked hexose sugar substituents on the poly-glycerophosphate backbone instead of n-acetylglucosamine substituents, and unsaturated fatty acids in its glycolipids. the sugar substituents were revealed  as an approximately 29:1 molar ratio of the glucose to galactose by hpaec-pad analysis. maldi-tof/tof ms analyses identified the presence of unsaturated fatty  acids in the glycolipid moieties of plta. in addition, the glycolipid structure was found to be composed of trihexosyl-diacyl- and/or trihexosyl-triacyl-glycerol ceramide units by means of unique fragment ions of the glycolipids. these results enabled us to elucidate the plta structure, which is distinctively different from canonical lta structure, and suggest that the unique immunological property of plta might be caused by the plta structure.

TI  == inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni,  listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the  inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.

AB  == phenolic acids (benzoic, phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids) are the most abundant phenolic structures found in fecal water. as an approach towards the exploration of their action in the gut, this paper reports the antimicrobial activity of thirteen phenolic acids towards escherichia coli, lactobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the growth of e. coli atcc 25922 was inhibited by only four of the phenolic acids tested at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml, whereas pathogenic e. coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) was susceptible to ten of them. the genetically manipulated e. coli lpxc/tolc strain was highly susceptible to phenolic acids. the growth of lactobacilli (lactobacillus paraplantarum lch7, lactobacillus plantarum lch17, lactobacillus fermentum lph1, l. fermentum cect 5716, lactobacillus brevis lch23, and lactobacillus coryniformis cect 5711) and pathogens (s. aureus ep167 and c. albicans my1055) was also inhibited by phenolic acids, but to varying extents. only p. aeruginosa pao1 was not susceptible to any of the phenolic compounds tested. structure-activity relationships of phenolic acids and some of their diet precursors [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] were established, based on multivariate analysis of microbial activities. the antimicrobial properties of phenolic acids reported in this paper might be relevant in vivo.

TI  == morphology, release characteristics, and antimicrobial effect of nisin-loaded electrospun gelatin fiber mat.
AB  == gelatin electrospun (e-spun) fiber mats containing nisin were produced by electrostatic spinning of gelatin-nisin in 70% (vol/vol) acetic acid aqueous solutions. varying nisin loading concentration (0 to 3% [wt/wt]) did not affect the fiber average diameter, whereas increasing gelatin concentration from 20 to 24% (wt/vol) caused an increase in the average diameter. all nisin-loaded gelatin e-spun fiber mats demonstrated inhibition against lactobacillus plantarum tistr 850. however, all fiber mats were fragile and easily dissolved in water. cross-linking by saturated glutaraldehyde vapor at 37 degrees c for 5 min was done to strengthen the mat. tensile strength, young's modulus, and elongation of  the cross-linked gelatin-nisin e-spun fiber mats varied in the range of 2.6 to 20.3 mpa, 163 to 966 mpa, and 1.7 to 5.9% , respectively. cross-linking did not affect the mat's inhibition activity against l. plantarum tistr 850. nisin retention in cross-linked antimicrobial gelatin e-spun fiber mats was in the range of 1.0 to 1.22% . increasing temperature caused an increase in nisin release, but increasing water activity did not cause a significant difference in  nisin release over 50 h. after storage at 25 degrees c for 5 months, the antimicrobial gelatin e-spun fiber mat still showed inhibition against l. plantarum tistr 850. the mats also inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus  and listeria monocytogenes but not salmonella typhimurium.

TI  == peptidoglycan from lactobacilli inhibits interleukin-12 production by macrophages induced by lactobacillus casei through toll-like receptor 2-dependent and independent mechanisms.
AB  == we previously showed that lactobacillus strains having a rigid cell wall resistant to intracellular digestion can stimulate macrophages to induce large a  quantity of interleukin-12 (il-12). in this study, we examined the influence of lactobacilli and bacterial cell wall components on il-12 production by macrophages that was induced by lactobacillus casei, which has a rigid cell wall. easily digestible lactobacilli such as lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus  plantarum or their intact cell walls (icws) weakly or very weakly induced il-12 production by macrophages, and inhibitedl. casei-induced il-12 production. while  the icw of l. casei was resistant to intracellular digestion and did not inhibit  l. casei-induced il-12 production, its polysaccharide-depleted icw, i.e. intact peptidoglycan, was sensitive to intracellular digestion and inhibited l. casei-induced il-12 production. furthermore, the peptidoglycans of l. johnsonii,  l. plantarum and staphylococcus aureus also inhibited l. casei-induced il-12 production. peptidoglycans from lactobacilli suppressed l. casei-induced expression of il-12p40 but not il-12p35 mrna. inhibition of il-12 production by peptidoglycan was mitigated in toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2)-deficient macrophages  compared with the inhibition in wild-type macrophages. a derivative of the minimal structural unit of peptidoglycan (6-o-stearoyl-muramyl dipeptide) recognized by nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (nod2) could also suppress l. casei-induced il-12 production. these findings demonstrate that easily digestible bacteria and peptidoglycan suppress il-12 production through pattern recognition receptors such as tlr2 and nod2. il-12 production in the gut  may be negatively regulated by the simultaneous inhibitory actions of various resident bacteria that are susceptible to intracellular digestion.

TI  == biopreservation of refrigerated and vacuum-packed dicentrarchus labrax by lactic  acid bacteria.
AB  == two lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected from 100 lab isolated from various sea products to examine their use in dicentrarchus labrax preservation. the isolates, tentatively named strain nr 3 and 7, were identified as lactobacillus plantarum and l. pentosus, respectively. they showed antagonistic activity against psychrotroph, pathogenic, and coliform bacteria. the antagonistic activity of strain 3 was suggested to be by bacteriocins since activity was abolished by protease treatment, while that of strain 7 was due to the effect of  ph decrease caused by the produced organic acids. their use prevented total volatile basic nitrogen contents (tvb-n) and trimethylamine (tma) to some extent, suggesting that inoculation could extend the period of storage.

AB  == to examine their potential as probiotics, acid and bile tolerance, antibiotics resistance, adhesion capacity to caco- 2 and ht-29, and antibacterial activity, of lab isolated from korean fermented foods such as dongchimi, kimchi, meju, and  doenjang were assayed against foodborne pathogenic bacteria. dc 55, dc 136, dc 222, kc 117, kc 21, kc 24, kc 34, kc 43, mj 301, mj 54, sp 170, and sp 33 strains were resistant to acid and bile conditions. in particular, dc 55, dc 136, kc 24,  kc 43, and mj 301 strains were highly resistant to higher than 20 microg/ml concentrations of vancomycin, streptomycin sulfate, or amoxicillin, whereas, dc 222, kc 117, kc 21, kc 34, mj 54, and sp 33 strains were susceptible to lower than 2microg/ ml concentrations of those antibiotics. the adhesion to ht-29 and caco-2 cells varied with the strains tested in a strain-dependent manner. the highest level of adhesion was observed with dc 55, kc 21, kc 24, and mj 301 strains, having higher than 50% of adhesion to ht-29 or caco-2 cells. in addition, staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive to kc 21, showing an inhibition of about 70%, and the antibacterial activity of kc 21 against s. aureus resulted most likely from both organic acids and bacteriocin. based on its phenotypic characteristics and utilization of various sugars, the kc 21 strain was identified as lactobacillus plantarum.

TI  == characterization and purification of a new bacteriocin with a broad inhibitory spectrum produced by lactobacillus plantarum lp 31 strain isolated from dry-fermented sausage.
AB  == aims: characterization and purification of a new bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum lp 31 strain, isolated from argentinian dry-fermented sausage. methods and results: lactobacillus plantarum lp 31 strain produces an antimicrobial compound that inhibits the growth of food-borne pathogenic bacteria. it was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, was stable to heat and catalase and exhibited maximum activity in the ph range from 5.0 to 6.0. consequently, it was characterized as a bacteriocin. it was purified by rp (reverse-phase) solid-phase extraction, gel filtration chromatography and rp-hplc. plantaricin produced by lact. plantarum lp 31 is a peptide with a molecular weight of 1558.85 da as determined by maldi-tof mass spectrometry and contains 14 amino acid residues. it was shown to have a bactericidal effect against pseudomonas sp., staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus and listeria monocytogenes. conclusions: the bacteriocin produced by lact. plantarum lp 31 may be considered as a new plantaricin according to its low molecular weight and particular amino acid composition. significance and impact of the study: in view  of the interesting inhibitory spectrum of this bacteriocin and because of its good technological properties (resistance to heat and activity at acidic ph), this bacteriocin has potential applications as a biopreservative to prevent the growth of food-borne pathogens and food spoilage bacteria in certain food products.

TI  == selection of lactic acid bacteria from fermented plant beverages to use as inoculants for improving the quality of the finished product.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented plant beverages were selected based on  their antibacterial actions against potential food borne pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus psscmi 0004, escherichia coli psscmi 0001, salmonella typhimurium psscmi 0034 and vibrio parahaemolyticus vp 4). antibacterial activities were measured using an agar spot method. the lactobacillus plantarum w90a strain isolated from a wild forest noni (morinda coreia ham) beverage was used as an inoculant. three different inoculation procedures were conducted with  the fruit of wild forest noni fermentations to establish which one was the best for controlling the numbers of yeast in the finished product. a 5% inoculum of l. plantarum w90a (lab set), initial cell density 8.6 log cfu ml(-1), produced a better product and inhibitory properties against the test organisms, particularly e. coli psscmi 0001 than one with no inoculum or with a 5% inoculum from a previous natural fermented product. an lab inoculum resulted in a reduced total bacterial count and no yeast throughout fermentation period (90 days). the lower  yeast resulted in a reduction of the ethanol content to 2.9 g l(-1) compared to 12.2 g l(-1) inthe culture with no inoculum. the highest acidity (1.3-1.4%) with  the same ph (3.3) was observed in both sets of inoculated fermentations, whereas  the uninoculated set gave a ph value of 3.7 (1.2% acidity).

TI  == binding and cellular activation studies reveal that toll-like receptor 2 can differentially recognize peptidoglycan from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == although much progress has been made toward the identification of innate immune receptors, far less is known about how these receptors recognize specific microbial products. such studies have been hampered by the need to purify compounds from microbial sources and a reliance on biological assays rather than  direct binding to monitor recognition. we have employed surface plasmon resonance (spr) binding studies using a wide range of well defined synthetic muropeptides derived from gram-positive (lysine-containing) and gram-negative (diaminopimelic  acid (dap)-containing) bacteria to demonstrate that toll-like receptor 2 can recognize peptidoglycan (pgn). in the case of lysine-containing muropeptides, a limited number of compounds, which were derived from pgn remodeled by bacterial autolysins, was recognized. however, a wider range of dap-containing muropeptides was bound with high affinity, and these compounds were derived from nascent and remodeled pgn. the difference in recognition of the two classes of muropeptides is proposed to be a strategy by the host to respond appropriately to gram-negative and -positive bacteria, which produce vastly different quantities of pgn. it was also found that certain modifications of the carboxylic acids of isoglutamine and dap can dramatically reduce binding, and thus, bacterial strains may employ such modifications to evade innate immune detection. cellular activation studies employing highly purified pgn from bacillus licheniformis, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus support the structure binding relationship. the data firmly establish toll-like receptor 2 as an innate immune sensor for pgn and provides an understanding of host-pathogen interactions at the molecular level.

TI  == technological and safety properties of lactobacillus plantarum strains isolated from a tunisian traditional salted meat.
AB  == a total of 17 strains of lactobacillus plantarum, isolated from a tunisian traditional salted meat and identified by biochemical and molecular methods, were characterized according to their technological properties including acidifying, antimicrobial and enzymatic activities as well as antibiotic resistance in order  to select the most suitable for use as starter cultures for the production of fermented sausages. all the strains studied showed good acidifying activity and were able to reduce the ph to less than 4.3 in 72, 48 and 24h at 15, 25 and 37 degrees c respectively. the majority of strains displayed antimicrobial activities against salmonella arizonae, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeuroginosa and escherichia coli, however characterization of the antimicrobial substances showed that none of the strains could produce bacteriocins. all the l. plantarum strains were able to hydrolyze casein, whereas none of them was found to possess lipolytic activity. the majority of strains of l. plantarum were resistant to tetracycline, erythromycin, rifampicin, ampicillin and penicillin g.

TI  == differential immunostimulatory effects of gram-positive bacteria due to their lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acid (lta) is a major immunostimulating component in the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria as lipopolysaccharide of gram-negative bacteria. however, lta is expressed on not only pathogenic but also nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria. in order to examine whether the immunostimulating potentials of gram-positive bacteria are correlated with their ltas, we prepared  highly pure ltas from staphylococcus aureus (pathogenic), bacillus subtilis (non-pathogenic), or lactobacillus plantarum (beneficial). when a murine macrophage cell-line, raw 264.7, was stimulated with heat-killed bacteria, both s. aureus and b. subtilis induced nitric oxide (no) production in a dose-dependent manner while l. plantarum showed a minimal induction. interestingly, purified ltas from s. aureus and b. subtilis, but not from l. plantarum, were able to induce the production of no. the differential inflammatory potentials of ltas coincided with their abilities to activate toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2), which is known to recognize gram-positive bacteria and lta, and transcription factors nf-kappab and ap-1. similar results were obtained with the expression of cytokines related to inflammation by raw 264.7 and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well. the ability of lta to induce tnf-alpha and no production was abolished when the ltas were treated with  0.2 n naoh. collectively, we suggest that the immunostimulating potentials of gram-positive bacteria differ due to their ltas with differential potencies in the stimulation of tlr2.

TI  == interference of lactobacillus plantarum strains in the in vitro conjugative transfer of r-plasmids.
AB  == probiotic compounds, which are often constituted of lactobacilli, exert a number  of health benefits through maintenance of the intestinal ecosystem balance. among the important interactions that occur in the gut microbiota, plasmid transfer by  mating is an increasing cause of concern, particularly when antibiotic-resistant  genes are involved. because lactobacilli seem to be able to influence this mechanism, the aim of the present work was to investigate the in vitro capability of two lactobacillus plantarum strains (one bacteriocin producer and one nonproducer) to interfere with the conjugation processes. for this purpose different matings were performed adding to the donor and recipient cells l. plantarum 35d bac+ and l. plantarum 396/1 bac- as agents of interference. conjugations added with a staphylococcus aureus strain or without any agent of interference were used as controls. the results of our experiments demonstrated that both lactobacillus strains were able to decrease mating frequency. statistically significant differences in the viable transconjugants were obtained in the presence and in the absence of the lactobacilli. the effect was almost the same with the two l. plantarum independent of bacteriocin production. in the trial performed with s. aureus, no decrease in mating frequency was observed, confirming that the capability to interfere with r-plasmid transfer ability could be a property of the tested l. plantarum strains.

TI  == antibacterial effects of long-chain polyphosphates on selected spoilage and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of four long-chain food-grade polyphosphates were studied at concentrations allowed in the food industry (<5,000 ppm) in defined basal media by determining the inhibition of growth of three gram-negative and four gram-positive spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. both generation time and lag phase of escherichia coli k-12, e. coli o157: h7, and salmonella typhimurium were increased with all of the polyphosphates tested. bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus were more sensitive to polyphosphates, but not in all cases, with multiphased growth. the growth of lactobacillus plantarum was inhibited by polyphosphates at concentrations above 750 ppm, but the lag time of  listeria monocytogenes was shortened by the presence of polyphosphates. no single polyphosphate was maximally inhibitory against all bacteria. polyphosphates with  chain lengths of 12 to 15 were significantly different from those with chain lengths of 18 to 21 depending on the organism and concentrations of polyphosphate used. overall, higher polyphosphate concentrations resulted in greater inhibition of bacterial growth.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.

TI  == inhibitory effects of lactobacillus plantarum lipoteichoic acid (lta) on staphylococcus aureus lta-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha production.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a common etiologic agent for gram-positive sepsis, and its lipoteichoic acid (lta) may be important in causing gram-positive bacterial septic shock. here, we demonstrate that highly purified lta (plta) isolated from  lactobacillus plantarum inhibited aureus lta (alta)-induced tnf-alpha production  in thp- cells. whereas plta scarcely induced tnf-alpha production, alta induced excessive tnf-alpha production. interestingly, alta-induced tnf-alpha production  was inhibited by plta pretreatment. compared with plta, alta induced strong signal transduction through the myd88, nf-kappab, and map kinases. this signaling, however, was reduced by a plta pretreatment, and resulted in the inhibition of alta-induced tnf-alpha production. whereas dealanylated ltas, as well as native ltas, contributed to tnf- induction or tnf-alpha reduction, deacylated ltas did not, indicating that the acyl chain of lta played an important role in the lta-mediated immune regulation. these results suggest that  plta may act as an antagonist for alta, and that an antagonistic plta may be a useful agent for suppressing the septic shock caused by gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == many fructosamine 3-kinase homologues in bacteria are ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases potentially involved in protein deglycation.
AB  == the purpose of this work was to identify the function of bacterial homologues of  fructosamine 3-kinase (fn3k), a mammalian enzyme responsible for the removal of fructosamines from proteins. fn3k homologues were identified in approximately 200 (i.e. approximately 27%) of the sequenced bacterial genomes. in 11 of these genomes, from phylogenetically distant bacteria, the fn3k homologue was immediately preceded by a low-molecular-weight protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (lmw-ptp) homologue, which is therefore probably functionally related to the fn3k homologue. five bacterial fn3k homologues (from escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, staphylococcus aureus and thermus thermophilus) were overexpressed in e. coli, purified and their kinetic properties investigated. four were ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases acting best on free lysine and cadaverine derivatives, but not on ribulosamines bound to the alpha amino group of amino acids. they also phosphorylated protein-bound ribulosamines or erythrulosamines, but not protein-bound fructosamines, therefore having properties similar to those of mammalian fn3k-related protein. the e. coli fn3k homologue (ynia) was inactive on all tested substrates. the lmw-ptp of t. thermophilus, which forms an operon with an fn3k homologue, and an lmw-ptp of s.  aureus (ptpa) were overexpressed in e. coli, purified and shown to dephosphorylate not only protein tyrosine phosphates, but protein ribulosamine 5-phosphates as well as free ribuloselysine 5-phosphate and erythruloselysine 4-phosphate. these lmw-ptps were devoid of ribulosamine 3-phosphatase activity. it is concluded that most bacterial fn3k homologues are ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases. they may serve, in conjunction with a phosphatase, to deglycate products of glycation formed from ribose 5-phosphate or erythrose 4-phosphate.

TI  == lipoteichoic acid from lactobacillus plantarum elicits both the production of interleukin-23p19 and suppression of pathogen-mediated interleukin-10 in thp-1 cells.
AB  == in this study, the stimulatory effects of different lactic acid bacteria strains, and their subcellular fractions, on the thp-1 cell line were evaluated. lactobacillus plantarum was found in particular to induce high levels of il-23p19 mrna, but it moderately induced tnf-alpha production. il-10 production was not entirely affected by l. plantarum stimulation. when subcellular fractions of l. plantarum were used to treat thp-1 cells, il-23p19 mrna expression was enhanced in a dose-responsive manner, specifically by lipoteichoic acid (lta). the cotreatment of thp-1 cells by both l. plantarum and staphylococcus aureus lta resulted in decreased il-10 production when compared with cells treated by s. aureus lta alone. taken together, these data suggest that lta isolated from l. plantarum elicits stimulatory effects upon the expression of il-23p19 and inhibitory effects on pathogen-mediated il-10 production.

AB  == plantaricin-149 is a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum nric 149 (a  lab isolated from pineapple), which consists of a peptidic chain made up of 22 amino acid residues [kato et al. j. ferment. bioeng. 1994; 77: 277-282]. in this  work, a synthetic c-terminal amidated peptide analog denoted pln149a was prepared by spps-fmoc chemistry and the antagonistic activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was tested. the secondary structure was studied by circular dichroism (cd) and the vicinity of the tyrosine residue by fluorescence  spectroscopy under different conditions. we report the results of the interaction of pln149a with reverse micelles prepared from the amphiphilic aot in cyclohexane. synthetic plantaricin was active against one strain of staphylococcus aureus and four strains of listeria genus at ph 5.5 and 7.4 and, like its natural variant, inhibited l. plantarum atcc 8014. the data derived from spectroscopic measurements in presence of aot reverse micelles suggest that the secondary structure of the peptide upon interaction is an alpha-helix. in this membrane model, the hydrophobic side of the alpha-helix is inserted into the micelles, leaving the lysines exposed to the solvent and interacting with the polar moieties of aot. the fluorescence data point out that the n-terminal tyrosine residue is close to the micellar interface.

TI  == adhesive and chemokine stimulatory properties of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains.
AB  == five lactobacillus plantarum strains and two lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from african traditionally fermented milk products or children's  feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. the relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to ht29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the l. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to ht29 cells. four l. plantarum and two l. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to ht29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. the two l. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the  intestinal pathogens listeria monocytogenes scott a, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028. the l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with ht29 cells in a strain-dependent way. these two potential probiotic strains  also significantly increased interleukin-8 (il-8) chemokine production by ht29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as il-1, il-6, il-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta), did not occur. altogether, our results suggested that l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii bfe 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains.

TI  == limitations in the use of drosophila melanogaster as a model host for gram-positive bacterial infection.
AB  == aims: to examine sensitivities of various drosophila melanogaster strains towards human pathogenic and nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria. methods and results: the d. melanogaster oregon r strain was infected by injecting the thorax with a needle containing escherichia coli (negative control), listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus (both food-borne pathogens), listeria innocua, bacillus subtilis, carnobacterium maltaromaticum, lactobacillus plantarum or pediococcus acidilactici (all nonpathogenic bacteria). listeria monocytogenes and s. aureus killed the host rapidly compared with the negative control. infection with l. innocua, b. subtilis or c. maltaromaticum also resulted in a high fly mortality,  whereas lact. plantarum and p. acidilactici resulted in a slightly increased mortality. four additional d. melanogaster lines, three of which had been selected for heat, cold and desiccation resistance respectively, were subjected to infection by l. monocytogenes, s. aureus and e. coli. mortality rates were comparable with that of the oregon r strain. conclusions: use of the injection method shows the limitation of d. melanogaster as a model host for gram-positive  bacteria as opportunistic infection by nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria results in partial or high mortality. in addition, lines of fruit flies resistant to various stress exposures did not show an increased resistance to infection by  gram-positive pathogens under the conditions tested. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrates the inadequacy of d. melanogaster infected by  the injection method in order to distinguish between virulent and nonvirulent gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of long-chain, water-soluble, dendritic tricarboxylato amphiphiles.
AB  == objectives: to measure the antimicrobial activities of three series of homologous, dendritic tricarboxylato (three-headed) amphiphiles against a battery of bacteria and fungi. methods: three series of homologous dendritic amphiphiles  were synthesized containing c13 to c22 fatty chains. susceptibility of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus plantarum, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), mycobacterium smegmatis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans and aspergillus niger to the amphiphiles was measured by broth microdilution and reported as the mic. results: several amphiphiles from each homologous series, designed and constructed to overcome the low solubility of saturated long-chain fatty acids, had antimicrobial activity against mrsa (mic =  36 mg/l), c. albicans (mic = 4.4 mg/l), s. cerevisiae (mic = 1.1 mg/l) and m. smegmatis (mic = 8.9 mg/l). these amphiphiles had considerably better antimicrobial activities than the corresponding saturated fatty acids. alkyl chain length influenced the values of mic; longer chains (c18-c22) were generally more antimicrobial, but there was no uniform pattern among the microorganisms tested. conclusions: as the antimicrobial activity of the amphiphiles increased with increasing chain length, it is anticipated that maximum activity was not reached with these series. thus, the identification of the optimal chain length would provide a target compound for development of low-cost, topical microbicides and anti-infectives. further, these series of dendritic amphiphiles with the very long chains can be used as new water-soluble probes for elucidation of membrane structure and for identification of novel targets for antimicrobial design.

TI  == antimicrobial and cytotoxic knotwood extracts and related pure compounds and their effects on food-associated microorganisms.
AB  == knotwood or bark extracts prepared from 30 species of hard and soft wood trees as well as selected pure compounds (lignans, stilbenes and flavonoids) were assayed  for their antimicrobial activity against a battery of both gram positive and negative bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi (bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus plantarum, escherichia coli, salmonella infantis, pseudomonas fluorescens, candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae, aspergillus fumigatus and penicillium brevicompactum). by far the most consistent antibacterial and antifungal properties were associated with extracts of pinus species. these extracts showed also cytotoxicity against a mouse hepatoma cell line. both antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties correlated  with the stilbene content of the extracts. purified stilbenes showed the most consistent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, while purified lignans had marginal effects, only. the results suggest that stilbenes account both for the antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties of pinus knotwood extracts.

TI  == identification and sequence of a tet(m) tetracycline resistance determinant homologue in clinical isolates of escherichia coli.
AB  == the presence of the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(m) in human clinical  isolates of escherichia coli is described for the first time in this report. the  homologue was >99% identical to the tet(m) genes reported to occur in lactobacillus plantarum, neisseria meningitidis, and streptococcus agalactiae, and 3% of the residues in its deduced amino acid sequence diverge from tet(m) of  staphylococcus aureus. sequence analysis of the regions immediately flanking the  gene revealed that sequences upstream of tet(m) in e. coli have homology to tn916; however, a complete is26 insertion element was present immediately upstream of the promoter element. downstream from the termination codon is an insertion sequence that was homologous to the isvs1 element reported to occur in  a plasmid from vibrio salmonicida that has been associated with another tetracycline resistance determinant, tet(e). results of mating experiments demonstrated that the e. coli tet(m) gene was on a mobile element so that resistance to tetracycline and minocycline could be transferred to a susceptible  strain by conjugation. expression of the cloned tet(m) gene, under the control of its own promoter, provided tetracycline and minocycline resistance to the e. coli host.

TI  == lactobacilli in the female genital tract in relation to other genital microbes and vaginal ph.
AB  == background: the relationship between lactobacilli and other microbes and the association with vaginal ph in the female genital tract were examined. the study  also included evaluation of the possibility of supplying probiotics to the genital tract by using panty liners impregnated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus plantarum lb931. methods: this was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study involving 191 healthy fertile women. specified microbes were counted and vaginal ph was measured once a month for five consecutive months. results: major individual variations in the genital  microflora composition and the vaginal ph were found among the women. the number  of lactobacilli was significantly related to vaginal ph (p<0.001) and approximately 70% of the women were permanent carriers of individual lactobacilli strains. women with high numbers of lactobacilli were less prevalent with group b streptococci than women with low numbers (p=0.036), and these women had a lower mean vaginal ph. the number of lactobacilli also correlated with the prevalence of yeast. lb931 could be found in 86% of the labial samples and 54% of the vaginal samples. conclusions: high numbers of lactobacilli may contribute to a low vaginal ph and seem to have a negative influence on group b streptococci. lb931 could be transferred from the panty liners to both the vagina and the labial fold.

TI  == the assessment of biological activities associated with the major constituents of the methanol extract of 'wild carrot' (daucus carota l) seeds.
AB  == daucus carota l. (family: apiaceae alt. umbelliferae), commonly known as 'wild carrot' or 'queen anne's-lace,' is an ecologically invasive erect biennial naturalized to scotland. the ethnobotanical uses of this species include applications in the treatment of cough, diarrhea, dysentery, cancer, malaria and  tumors, and as an antiseptic, abortifacient, aphrodisiac, carminative, stimulant, stomachic and tonic. the major constituents isolated from the methanol extract of d. carota seeds by reversed-phase preparative high performance chromatography were luteolin, luteolin 3'-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside and luteolin 4'-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside, three flavones. the constituents were assessed for their antibacterial and free radical scavenging activities, as well as toxicity towards brine shrimp. among these three flavones, luteolin showed the highest degree of free radical scavenging activity (rc50 = 4.3 x 10(-4) mg/ml) in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) assay. both luteolin and its 4'-o-glucoside  demonstrated bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] = 5.0 x 10(-2) - 1.0 x 10(-1) mg/ml). luteolin also demonstrated antibactericidal activity against bacillus cereus and citrobacter freundii (mic = 5.0 x 10(-2) mg/ml). luteolin 3'-o-glucoside showed bactericidal activity against bacillus cereus and lactobacillus plantarum (mic = 2.5 x 10(-1) mg/ml and 5 x 10(-1) mg/ ml, respectively). in the brine shrimp lethality assay, the ld50 value of luteolin was 5.3 x 10(-2) mg/ml, and that of its 3'-o-glucoside and 4'-o-glucoside were >  1.0 mg/ml.

AB  == the aim was to select potentially probiotic lactobacilli from 88 strains isolated from unpasteurized milk and cheese products, and to incorporate these bacteria in a viable state into a soft cheese, without changing its quality. the survival of  these bacteria was assessed in acidic and bile conditions, after freezing at -80  degrees c. four strains from unpasteurized camembert--two lactobacillus plantarum strains and two lb. paracasei/casei strains--were identified and typed by pcr and pfge and were found to display potentially probiotic characteristics in addition  to resistance to low ph and bile. these characteristics were resistance to lysozyme, adhesion to caco-2 cells, antimicrobial effects against common foodborne pathogens (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., escherichia coli, innocuity following the ingestion of high doses by mice and appropriate antibiotic susceptibility profiles. the potential of lb. plantarum strain ucma 3037 for incorporation into a soft cheese (pont-l'eveque registered designation of origin (rdo)) was investigated. this strain grew well and survived in sufficient numbers (more than 10(7) cfu/g throughout the shelf-life of the product) in the cheese. this strain did not change the quality  score of the product until the best before date (75 days after manufacture). thus, unpasteurized camembert is a natural source of potentially probiotic lactobacilli, which could be used as an additive in the development of potentially probiotic soft cheeses. further work is required to demonstrate the persistence and efficacy of these strains in the human host upon ingestion.

TI  == interactions between high pressure homogenization and antimicrobial activity of lysozyme and lactoperoxidase.
AB  == it was the objective of this work to evaluate the effect of high pressure homogenization on the activity of antimicrobial enzymes such as lysozyme and lactoperoxidase against a selected group of gram positive and gram negative species inoculated in skim milk. lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum and listeria monocytogenes were the most pressure resistant species while bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas putida, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris and salmonella enteritidis were found to  be very sensitive to the hyperbaric treatment. the enzyme addition enhanced the instantaneous pressure efficacy on almost all the considered species as indicated by their instantaneous viability loss following the treatment. moreover, the combination of the enzyme and high pressure homogenization significantly affected the recovery and growth dynamics of several of the considered species. although l. monocytogenes was slightly sensitive to pressure, the combination of the two stress factors induced a significant viability loss within 3 h and an extension of lag phases in skim milk during incubation at 37 degrees c. the hypothesis formulated in this work is that the interaction of high pressure homogenization and lysozyme or lactoperoxidase is associated to conformational modifications of  the two proteins with a consequent enhancement of their activity. this hypothesis is supported by the experimental results also regarding the increased antimicrobial activity against l. plantarum of the previously pressurised lysozyme with respect to that of the native enzyme.

AB  == dendritic cells (dc) are the main orchestrators of specific immune responses. depending on microbial information they encounter in peripheral tissues, they promote the development of th1, th2 or unpolarized th cell responses. in this study we have investigated the immunomodulatory effect of non-pathogenic intestinal gram-negative (escherichia coli, bacteroides vulgatus,veillonella parvula, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive (bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum and staphylococcus aureus) bacteria on human monocyte-derived dc (modc). none of the gram-positive bacteria  (gpb) primed for th1 or th2 development. in contrast, despite the low levels of il-12 they induce, all gram-negative bacteria (gnb) primed modc for enhanced th1  cell development, which was dependent on il-12 and an additional unidentified cofactor. strikingly, gnb-matured modc expressed elevated levels of p19 and p28 mrna, the critical subunits of il-23 and il-27, respectively, suggesting that the il-12 family members may jointly be responsible for their th1-driving capacity. purified major cell wall components of either gnb or gpb did not yield th cell profiles identical to those obtained with whole bacteria, and could not explain the induction of the il-12 family members nor th1 priming by gnb. importantly, this study gives indications that the expression of the different il-12 family members is dictated by different priming conditions of immature dc.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a greek dry-fermented sausage in respect of their technological and probiotic properties.
AB  == a total of 147 lactic acid bacteria was isolated from two types of naturally fermented dry sausages at four different stages of the ripening process studied in order to select the most suitable strains according to their technological characteristics including probiotic properties and antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens. identification of the isolates revealed that 90% were lactobacilli, 4% enterococci, 3% pediococcus sp. and sporadic isolates of weissella viridescens, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, and leuconostoc sp. the isolated strains of lactobacillus sakei (49 isolates), lactobacillus curvatus (24 isolates) and lactobacillus plantarum (7 isolates) were further characterized. all strains could grow at 15 degrees c, whereas the majority of the strains was able to grow in the presence of 6.5% nacl and on acetate agar. the enzymatic potential of the strains was evaluated using the api zym system. during in vitro  investigations all strains exhibited high leucine and valine aminopeptidase activities and moderate acid phosphatase and phosphohydrolase activities. some strains showed very weak lipolytic activity. the enzyme profiling is an important factor for selection of strains as starter cultures. a large majority of the strains tolerated 0.1% bile salts whereas 58% of lactobacillus curvatus strains and all lactobacillus plantarum strains were resistant to 0.3% bile salts. all lactobacillus sakei strains and the majority of lactobacillus curvatus and lactobacillus plantarum strains exhibited an anti-listerial activity against three listeria monocytogenes strains. a percentage of 75, 50 and 29% of lactobacillus sakei, l. curvatus and l. plantarum strains, respectively, could inhibit two staphylococcus aureus strains. the contribution of the selected strains to a possible inhibition of listeria monocytogenes and s. aureus in situ  on fermented meats would be of considerable interest to enhance the hygienic quality of these products.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == molecular characterization of tet(m) genes in lactobacillus isolates from different types of fermented dry sausage.
AB  == the likelihood that products prepared from raw meat and milk may act as vehicles  for antibiotic-resistant bacteria is currently of great concern in food safety issues. in this study, a collection of 94 tetracycline-resistant (tc(r)) lactic acid bacteria recovered from nine different fermented dry sausage types were subjected to a polyphasic molecular study with the aim of characterizing the host organisms and the tet genes, conferring tetracycline resistance, that they carry. with the (gtg)(5)-pcr dna fingerprinting technique, the tc(r) lactic acid bacterial isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. sakei subsp. carnosus, l. sakei subsp. sakei, l. curvatus, and l. alimentarius and typed to the intraspecies level. for a selection of 24 tc(r) lactic acid bacterial isolates displaying unique (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprints, tet genes were determined by means of pcr, and only tet(m) was detected. restriction enzyme analysis with acci and scai revealed two different tet(m) allele types. this grouping was confirmed by partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame, which indicated that the two allele types displayed high sequence similarities (>99.6%) with tet(m) genes previously reported in staphylococcus aureus mrsa 101 and in neisseria meningitidis, respectively. southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed that the isolates contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids. in addition to the tet(m) gene, one isolate also contained an erm(b) gene on a different plasmid from the one encoding the tetracycline resistance. furthermore, it was also shown by pcr that the tet(m) genes were not located on transposons of the tn916/tn1545 family. to our knowledge, this is the first detailed molecular study demonstrating that taxonomically and genotypically diverse lactobacillus strains from different types of fermented meat products can be a host for plasmid-borne tet genes.

TI  == bacterial contamination of cucumber fruit through adhesion.
AB  == in this study, the adhesion of bacteria to fresh cucumber surfaces in aqueous suspension was shown to be dependent on time of incubation, inoculum species and  concentration, and temperature. the adhesion of bacteria to the fruit in wash water was less extensive at lower temperatures and shorter exposure times. various species of bacteria were adsorbed to cucumber surfaces in the following relative order: salmonella typhimurium > staphylococcus aureus > lactobacillus plantarum > listeria monocytogenes. cells were adsorbed at all temperatures tested (5, 15, 25, and 35 degrees c) at levels that depended on incubation time,  but the numbers of cells adsorbed were larger at higher incubation temperatures.  levels of adhesion of bacteria to dewaxed fruit were higher for l. monocytogenes  and lower for salmonella typhimurium, l. plantarum, and s. aureus than were levels of adhesion to waxed fruit.

TI  == the lactoperoxidase system increases efficacy of high-pressure inactivation of foodborne bacteria.
AB  == the inactivation of eight different bacteria comprising escherichia coli lmm1010  and mg1655, respectively a pressure-resistant strain and the corresponding wild-type, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum, by high hydrostatic pressure in skim milk supplemented with the lactoperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-thiocyanate (lp) system at naturally occurring  concentration was studied. in the absence of pressure treatment, the lp system had either no effect, i.e. on s. typhimurium and e. coli lmm1010, a growth inhibiting effect, i.e. on e. coli mg1655, l. innocua, s. aureus, l. plantarum and e. faecalis, or a bactericidal effect, i.e. on p. fluorescens. the presence of the lp system affected inactivation by high pressure in a cell density-dependent manner. at low cell concentration (10(6) cfu/ml), the lp system strongly increased high-pressure inactivation as measured immediately after pressure treatment of all bacteria except the pressure-resistant e. coli. at high cell density (10(9) cfu/ml), only inactivation of l. innocua, e. faecalis and l.  plantarum were enhanced. for both e. coli strains, the fate of the bacteria during 24 h following pressure treatment was also studied. it was found that in the presence of the lp system, considerable further inactivation occurred in the  first hours after pressure treatment. the potential of the lp system to improve the bactericidal efficiency of high-pressure treatment for food preservation is discussed.

TI  == characterization of the tetracycline resistance plasmid pmd5057 from lactobacillus plantarum 5057 reveals a composite structure.
AB  == the 10,877bp tetracycline resistance plasmid pmd5057 from lactobacillus plantarum 5057 was completely sequenced. the sequence revealed a composite structure containing dna from up to four different sources. the replication region had homology to other plasmids of lactic acid bacteria while the tetracycline resistance region, containing a tet(m) gene, had high homology to sequences from  clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus. within the tetracycline resistance region a lactobacillus is-element was found. the remaining part of the plasmid contained three open reading frames with unknown functions. the composite structure with several truncated genes suggests a recent assembly of the plasmid. this is the first sequence of an antibiotic resistance plasmid isolated from l. plantarum.

TI  == bacterial inactivation by high-pressure homogenisation and high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  == the resistance of five gram-positive bacteria, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus plantarum, listeria innocua and leuconostoc  dextranicum, and six gram-negative bacteria, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas fluorescens  and two strains of escherichia coli, to high-pressure homogenisation (100-300 mpa) and to high hydrostatic pressure (200-400 mpa) was compared in this study. within the group of gram-positive bacteria and within the group of gram-negative  bacteria, large differences were observed in resistance to high hydrostatic pressure, but not to high-pressure homogenisation. all gram-positive bacteria were more resistant than any of the gram-negative bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation, while in relative to high hydrostatic pressure resistance both groups overlapped. within the group of gram-negative bacteria, there also existed another order in resistance to high-pressure homogenisation than to high hydrostatic pressure. further it appears that the mutant e. coli lmm1010, which is resistant to high hydrostatic pressure is not more resistant to high-pressure  homogenisation than its parental strain mg1655. the preceding observations indicate a different response of the test bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation compared to high hydrostatic pressure treatment, which suggests that the underlying inactivation mechanisms for both techniques are different. further, no sublethal injury could be observed upon high-pressure homogenisation  of y. enterocolitica and s. aureus cell population by using low ph (5.5 7), nacl  (0 6%) or sds (0-100 mg/l) as selective components in the plating medium. finally, it was observed that successive rounds of high-pressure homogenisation have an additive effect on viability reduction of y. enterocolitica and s. aureus.

AB  == antibacterial activities of six chitosans and six chitosan oligomers with different molecular weights (mws) were examined against four gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens, salmonella typhimurium, and vibrio parahaemolyticus) and seven gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, bacillus megaterium, b. cereus, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, and l. bulgaricus). chitosans showed higher antibacterial activities than chitosan oligomers and markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria tested although inhibitory effects differed with mws of chitosan and the particular bacterium. chitosan generally showed stronger bactericidal effects with gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria in the presence of 0.1% chitosan. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of chitosans ranged from 0.05% to >0.1% depending on the bacteria and mws of chitosan. as a chitosan solvent, 1% acetic acid was effective in inhibiting the growth of most of the bacteria tested except for lactic acid bacteria that were more effectively suppressed with 1% lactic or formic acids. antibacterial activity of chitosan was inversely affected by ph (ph 4.5-5.9 range tested), with higher activity at lower ph value.

AB  == the bacterial flora of the intestine and the bacteria found in liver, mesenteric  lymph nodes, portal and arterial blood after d-galactosamine-induced liver injury, with and without pretreatment with lactobacillus plantarum dsm 9843, were studied in the rat. dominating representatives were identified to species level by 16s rdna sequencing and typed by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and by restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) for strain definition. it was proven that bacterial strains from the intestine occur at extraintestinal sites after liver injury. lactobacillus spp. dominated the intestinal flora and were also the most frequently found genus in the liver and the mesenteric lymph nodes. some of  the blood isolates, identified as staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris and bacteroides merdae, were not found as a dominating part of the mucosal flora. treatment with l. plantarum before liver injury decreased translocation and made  the intestinal flora increasingly dominated by lactobacilli.

TI  == microbiological and biochemical characteristics of canestrato pugliese cheese made from raw milk, pasteurized milk or by heating the curd in hot whey.
AB  == canestrato pugliese cheeses were produced from raw ewes' milk (r and r(ii) cheeses), pasteurized ewes' milk (p cheese) and by heating the curd in hot whey according to a traditional protocol (t cheese). r(ii) differed from r cheese mainly by having been produced from raw milk with a higher number of somatic cells, 950.000 vs. 750.000 ml(-1), respectively. compared to p and t cheeses, r and r(ii) cheeses had a higher concentration (one or two orders of magnitude) of  cheese-related bacteria such as adventitious mesophilic lactobacilli, enterococci and staphylococci. at the end of ripening, all cheeses contained less than 1.0 log cfu g(-1) of total and fecal coliforms, and escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus were not detected. as shown by phenotypic identification and rapd-pcr, r cheese contained the largest number of mesophilic lactobacilli species and the greatest diversity of strains within the lactobacillus plantarum  species. primary proteolysis did not differ appreciably among the cheeses. on the contrary, both urea-page and the rp-hplc analyses of the water-soluble n fractions showed the more complex profiles in cheeses produced by raw milks. r and r(ii) cheeses had the highest values of water-soluble n/total n (ca. 30%) and the highest concentration of total free amino acids (ca. 40 mg g(-1) which approached or exceeded those reported for italian cheeses with very high level of proteolysis during ripening. the main differences between r-r(ii) and p-t cheeses were the concentrations of aspartic acid, proline, alanine, isoleucine, histidine and lysine. the water-soluble extracts of r and r(ii) cheeses contained levels of amino-, imino- and di-peptidase activities, which were about twice those found in p and t cheeses. cheeses differed slightly in the concentration of total free fatty acids that ranged between 1673 and 1651 mg kg(-1) in r and r(ii) cheeses, and 1397 and 1334 mg kg(-1) in p and t cheeses. butyric, caproic, capric, palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids were found at the highest concentrations.

TI  == selective sensitization of bacteria to peroxide damage associated with fluoride inhibition of catalase and pseudocatalase.
AB  == fluoride and sulfide are known inhibitors of heme catalases in acid environments. staphylococcus aureus h cells were found to be sensitized by fluoride or sulfide  to h2o2 killing at acid ph values in the range of 3.5 to 4.0, and catalase activity was reduced concomitantly. in contrast, fluoride had little effect on h2o2 killing of streptococcus mutans gs-5, which has fluoride-insensitive peroxidase activity, but still is more sensitive to h2o2 than is s. aureus in the absence of fluoride. fluoride but not sulfide was inhibitory also for the mn-containing, non-heme pseudocatalase of lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14431 over a wide ph range, and this inhibitory effect was reflected in enhanced h2o2 killing in the presence of fluoride. in addition, we found that catalase-positive s. aureus or neisseria sicca could protect catalase-negative s. mutans against killing by h2o2 in mixed suspensions, but protection was compromised by fluoride  or sulfide under acid conditions. thus, catalase-positive organisms could protect a catalase-negative organism against peroxide damage, but inhibition of catalase  reduced protection. these findings are pertinent to the widespread use of fluoride and peroxide in oral health care products.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == [cloning and gene expression in lactic acid bacteria].
AB  == the possibility of using the genera lactobacillus and lactococcus as vector representatives is widely discussed at present. the prospects of the construction of recombinant bacteria are closely connected with the solution of a number of problems: the level of the transcription of cloned genes, the effectiveness of the translation of heterologous mrna, the stability of protein with respect to bacterial intracellular proteases, the method by protein molecules leave the cell (by secretion or as the result of lysis). to prevent segregation instability, the construction of vector molecules on the basis of stable cryptic plasmids found in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria was proposed. high copying plasmids with low molecular weight were detected in l. plantarum and l. pentosus strains. several plasmids with molecular weights of 1.7, 1.8 and 2.3 kb were isolated from bacterial cells to be used as the basis for the construction of vector molecules. genes of chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistance from staphylococcus aureus  plasmids were used as marker genes ensuring cell transformation. the vector plasmids thus constructed exhibited high transformation activity in the electroporation of different strains, including l. casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum and l. brevis which could be classified with the replicons of a wide circle of hosts. but the use of these plasmids was limited due to the risk of the uncontrolled dissemination of recombinant plasmids. l. acidophilus were also found to have strictly specific plasmids with good prospects of being used as the basis for the creation of vectors, incapable of dissemination. in addition to the search of strain-specific plasmids, incapable of uncontrolled gene transmission, the use of chromosome-integrated heterologous  genes is recommended in cloning to ensure the maximum safety.

AB  == the involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin a, aflatoxin b1, and fumonisin  b1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. the strains used in this study included escherichia coli (ft 101), streptococcus agalactiae (ft 311, ft 313, ft 315), staphylococcus aureus (ft 192), yersinia enterocolitica (ft 430), salmonella infantis (ft 431), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (ft 432), lactobacillus plantarum (ft234) and lactobacillus casei (ft 232). tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. a combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. it was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. the objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the  toxic effects of the mycotoxins. the data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by t-2 toxin, aflatoxin b1 and ochratoxin a and that  this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme q10 plus l-carnitine.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == molecular analysis of the locus responsible for production of plantaricin s, a two-peptide bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum lpco10.
AB  == a 4.5-kb region of chromosomal dna carrying the locus responsible for the production of plantaricin s, a two-peptide bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus  plantarum lpco10 (r. jimenez-diaz, j. l. ruiz-barba, d. p. cathcart, h. holo, i.  f. nes, k. h. sletten, and p. j. warner, appl. environ. microbiol. 61:4459-4463,  1995), has been cloned, and the nucleotide sequence has been elucidated. two genes, designated plsa and plsb and encoding peptides alpha and beta, respectively, of plantaricin s, plus an open reading frame (orf), orf2, were found to be organized in an operon. northern blot analysis showed that these genes are cotranscribed, giving a ca. 0.7-kb mrna, whose transcription start point was determined by primer extension. nucleotide sequences of plsa and plsb revealed that both genes are translated as bacteriocin precursors which include n-terminal leader sequences of the double-glycine type. the role of orf2 is unknown at the moment, although it might be expected to encode an immunity protein of the type described for other bacteriocin operons. in addition, several other potential orfs have been found, including some which may be responsible for the regulation of bacteriocin production. two of them, orf8 and orf14, show strong homology with histidine protein kinase and response regulator genes, respectively, which have been found to be involved in the regulation of the production of other bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria. a third orf, orf5, shows homology with gene agrb from staphylococcus aureus, which is involved in the mechanism of regulation of the virulence phenotype in this species. thus, an  agr-like regulatory system for the production of plantaricin s is postulated.

TI  == sequence analysis and characterization of pom1, a small cryptic plasmid from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and its use in construction of a new family of cloning vectors for butyrivibrios.
AB  == as a preliminary step in the development of vector systems, we have isolated and  begun to characterize small, cryptic plasmids from several strains of the rumen bacterium butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. we present here the complete nucleotide sequence of butyrivibrio plasmid pom1, which was isolated from b. fibrisolvens bu49. while it is very similar in size to the previously characterized butyrivibrio plasmids prjf1 and prjf2, pom1 exhibits a restriction pattern which  is quite distinct. analysis of sequence data reveals that pom1 contains only two  open reading frames of significant length (orf1 and orf2), both of which are required for self-replication and maintenance. the protein encoded in orf1 shows  homologies with pre (plasmid recombination enzyme) proteins encoded in plasmids from gram-positive organisms such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, lactobacillus plantarum, and bacillus thuringiensis. the putative translation product of orf2, on the other hand, resembles rep (replication) proteins of a different group of gram-positive plasmids, for which the staphylococcus plasmid psn2 is a prototype. unlike the other characterized-butyrivibrio plasmids, pom1 appears to replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism. experimental evidence showing the presence of a single-stranded replication intermediate consistent with this mechanism is presented. pom1 has been used in the construction of a new escherichia coli-b. fibrisolvens shuttle vector, psmerm1, which has been successfully used to introduce a cloned gene into b. fibrisolvens harboring the prjf1 plasmid.

TI  == inhibition of microbial growth by ajoene, a sulfur-containing compound derived from garlic.
AB  == ajoene, a garlic-derived sulfur-containing compound that prevents platelet aggregation, exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. growth of gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, mycobacterium smegmatis, and streptomyces griseus, was inhibited at 5 micrograms of ajoene per  ml. staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus plantarum also were inhibited below 20 micrograms of ajoene per ml. for gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and xanthomonas maltophilia, mics were between 100 and 160 micrograms/ml. ajoene also inhibited yeast growth at concentrations below 20 micrograms/ml. the microbicidal effect of ajoene on growing cells was observed at slightly higher concentrations than the corresponding mics. b. cereus and saccharomyces cerevisiae were killed at 30 micrograms of ajoene per ml after 24 h of cultivation when cultivation was started at 10(5) cells per ml. however, the minimal microbicidal concentrations for resting cells were at 10 to 100 times higher concentrations than the corresponding mics. the disulfide bond in ajoene appears to be necessary for the antimicrobial activity of ajoene, since reduction by cysteine, which reacts with disulfide bonds, abolished its antimicrobial activity.

TI  == studies on bacteriocinogenic lactobacillus isolates from selected nigerian fermented foods.
AB  == ten bacteriocin-producing (bacteriocinogenic) lactobacillus isolates obtained from three nigerian fermented foods namely: kenkey, ogi and wara were tested against the following indicator organisms: lactobacillus plantarum and food borne pathogens comprising enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli, serratia, pseudomonas, vibrio cholerae, aeromonas sobria, aeromonas cavice, salmonella typhimurium, plesiomonas shigelloides and staphylococcus aureus. all the bacteriocinogenic lactobacillus were found to inhibit l. plantarum while some inhibited some of the food borne pathogens listed above. the antimicrobial activities of bacteriocins from l. plantarum kky12 and l. casei ogm12 were caused by proteins detectable in the culture liquids. they are designated plantacin n and caseicin a and they have narrow antimicrobial spectra. plantacin n from l. plantarum kky12 was active against l. plantarum, pseudomonas, aeromonas sobria and aeromonas cavice whereas caseicin a from l. casei ogm12 inhibited l. plantarum, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and vibrio cholerae. caseicin a is stable at 121 degrees c/15 mins, and both are inactivated by proteolytic enzymes. the bacteriocinogenic properties of the local isolates of lactobacillus can help to reduce hygienic risk and the spoilage of fermented foods.

TI  == the gene encoding plantaricin a, a bacteriocin from lactobacillus plantarum c11,  is located on the same transcription unit as an agr-like regulatory system.
AB  == purification and amino acid sequencing of plantaricin a, a bacteriocin from lactobacillus plantarum c11, revealed that maximum bacteriocin activity is associated with the complementary action of two almost-identical peptides, alpha  and beta (j. nissen-meyer, a. g. larsen, k. sletten, m. daeschel, and i. f. nes,  j. gen. microbiol. 139:1973-1978, 1993). a 5-kb chromosomal hindiii restriction fragment containing the structural gene of plantaricin a was cloned and sequenced. only one gene encoding plantaricin a was found. the gene, termed plna, encodes a 48-amino-acid precursor peptide, of which the 22 and 23 c-terminal amino acids correspond to the purified peptides. northern (rna) blot analysis demonstrated that a probe complementary to the coding strand of the plantaricin a gene hybridized to a 3.3-kb mrna transcript. further analysis of the 3.3-kb transcript demonstrated that it contains three additional open reading frames (plnb, plnc and plnd) downstream of plna. the dna sequences of plnb, plnc, and plnd revealed that their products closely resemble members of bacterial two-component signal transduction systems. the strongest homology was found to the accessory gene regulatory (agr) system, which controls expression of exoproteins during post-exponential growth in staphylococcus aureus. the finding  that plnabcd are transcribed from a common promoter suggests that the biological  role played by the bacteriocin is somehow related to the regulatory function of the two-component system located on the same operon.

AB  == rampant dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats fed a high sucrose diet without infection of mutans streptococci, in which increased numbers of lactobacilli and s. aureus were demonstrated in the oral flora. administration of either penicillin or piperacillin, effective against all isolates of lactobacilli, markedly inhibited the caries induction in these rats, while severe dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats given vancomycin that is inhibitory against s. aureus. these results suggested that certain lactobacilli might induce dental caries in hyposalivated rats fed a sucrose diet. three strains of lactobacillus species isolated from the hyposalivated rats were made resistant to erythromycin. the caries-inducing activity of these erythromycin-resistant lactobacilli was studied in hyposalivated rats giving erythromycin in the drinking water at a concentration of 500 micrograms/ml. after a 61-day experimental period, severe dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats infected with l. fermentum ty1r. on the other hand, low caries incidence was found in hyposalivated rats infected with either l. acidophilus ty7r or l. plantarum ty3r. these results indicate that l. fermentum may be one of causative  agents of dental caries in hyposalivated rats fed a sucrose diet.

AB  == one hundred strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from dry cured sausages were tested for antagonistic activity against a set of test strains. nine of 52 strains of lactobacillus casei and three of 48 strains of lact. plantarun produced inhibition zones against the indicator species. the substance excreted by lact. casei crl 705 was active against lact. plantarum, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus and a wide range of gram-negative bacteria.  the activity of the antibacterial compound from lact. casei crl 705 was destroyed by papain, trypsin and pepsin, but was resistant to heat (100 degrees c for 20 min), lysozyme and catalase. the agent was produced during the growth cycle and when the concentrated and neutralized supernatant fluid was added to a fresh culture of sensitive cells it produced a rapid inactivation. a decrease in optical density (o.d.) over time, indicative of cell lysis, was also observed. these characteristics allowed us to identify the inhibitory compound as a bacteriocin which we termed lactocin 705.

TI  == effect of environmental conditions during soya-bean fermentation on the growth of staphylococcus aureus and production and thermal stability of enterotoxins a and  b.
AB  == during tempe manufacture, staphylococcus aureus was able to survive in newly started soya-bean soaks (final ph 4.7), whereas it died during soaks with accelerated souring (final ph 4.0). no s. aureus were detected after subsequent heat treatment of soaked beans. s. aureus strain s6 could produce enterotoxins a  and b if inoculated on cooked soya-beans. its growth and enterotoxin production were not influenced by inoculation rate nor by the presence of actively growing rhizopus oligosporus, the fungus responsible for tempe formation. enterotoxin levels were highest after 48 h fermentation. presence of lactobacilli (l. brevis  or l. plantarum) during the tempe fermentation did not influence staphylococcal growth, but enterotoxin levels were reduced. reduced oxygen pressure did not affect staphylococcal growth, but resulted in lower enterotoxin levels after 48 h incubation. the thermal stability of enterotoxin a in tempe was significantly lower than in brain heart infusion broth of comparable ph. heating of enterotoxin-containing tempe mash reduced enterotoxin a by 99.7% as measured with elisa and animal feeding methods.

TI  == influence of lactic starter inoculation, curd heating and ripening temperature on staphylococcus aureus behaviour in manchego cheese.
AB  == growth and survival of staphylococcus aureus were investigated in 52 lots of raw  ewe's milk manchego cheese manufactured and ripened under different conditions. a 5.8-fold reduction in s. aureus counts after 60 days of ripening was obtained by  inoculating milk with 1% streptococcus lactis culture, and a further 2.0-fold reduction could be achieved by adding 0.1% lactobacillus plantarum culture. curd  heating temperature had a significant effect on s. aureus survival, with counts 4-5 times lower in cheese from 30 degrees c curd than in cheese from curd heated  at 36-40 degrees c. ripening temperature was the parameter with the greatest influence on s. aureus counts, which reached in cheese cured at 10 degrees c or 20 degrees c for 60 days levels 10 and 100 times lower, respectively, than in cheese held at 5 degrees c.

TI  == activation of the human complement cascade by bacterial cell walls, peptidoglycans, water-soluble peptidoglycan components, and synthetic muramylpeptides--studies on active components and structural requirements.
AB  == cell walls isolated from 29 strains of 24 gram-positive bacterial species, whose  peptidoglycans belong to the group a type of schleifer and kandler's classification, with one exception (arthrobacter sp.), were shown to activate the complement cascade in pooled fresh human serum mainly through the alternative pathway and partly through the classical one. the complement-activating effect of cell walls (5 species) possessing group b type peptidoglycan, except those of corynebacterium insidiosum, was weaker than that of the walls with group a type peptidoglycan. preparations of peptidoglycan isolated from cell walls of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and lactobacillus plantarum also activated the alternative pathway of the complement cascade, but less effectively than the respective parent cell walls. a water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits (seps), which was prepared from staphylococcus epidermidis peptidoglycans by treatment with a cross-bridge degrading endopeptidase, retained most of the complement-activating ability of the parent cell walls. a peptidoglycan "monomer," seps-m, which was obtained by hydrolysis of the glycan chain of seps with endo-n-acetylmuramidase to disaccharide units did not activate complement. in conformity with this finding, neither synthetic n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine (mdp) nor mdp-l-lys-d-ala activated the complement cascade. among several lipophilic derivatives of mdp, 6-o-(3-hydroxy-3-docosylhexacosanoyl)-mdp-l-lys-d-ala (bh48-mdp-l-lys-d-ala) and  6-o-(2-tetradecylhexadecanoyl)-mdp (b30-mdp) were shown to activate complement through the alternative as well as the classical pathway and exclusively through  the classical pathway, respectively. the finding that a d-isoasparagine analog of b30-mdp caused the same effect as the parent molecule strongly suggests that the  activation of complement by b30-mdp is different from that caused by cell wall peptidoglycans and a water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits.

TI  == antibacterially active substituted anilides of carboxylic and sulfonic acids.
AB  == anilides of carboxylic and sulfonic acids were prepared and tested for antimicrobial activity. while these anilides were ineffective against gram-negative organisms, there was a good correlation between chemical structure  and biological activity against gram-positive species. both the nature and position of the benzene ring substituents and the length of the carbon side chain affected the activity and specificity of the compounds. the highest activity was  observed when the acyl or sulfuryl moiety had a c7-c9 side chain attached. the conh and so2nh bridging groups were equally effective. the attachment of cooh or  cooch3 groups in the omega-position did not effect activity, but the substitution of the acidic proton of the sulfonamide group by an alkyl group rendered the compound inactive. six compounds, which were substituted anilides of sulfonic acids, fatty acids, or the analagous alpha-methylene-substituted acids, were bacteriostatic at 10 ppm against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus plantarum. one of these compounds, 2-hydroxy-5-nitroanilide of alpha-methylenedecanoic acid, was bactericidal at 1 ppm.

TI  == on the relationship between glycerophosphoglycolipids and lipoteichoic acids in gram-positive bacteria. ii. structures of glycerophosphoglycolipids.
AB  == 1. eight glycerophosphoglycolipids were isolated from six gram-positive bacteria. besides sn-glycero-1-phospho-beta-gentiobiosyldiacylglycerol (i) and sn-glycero-1-phospho-alpha-kojibiosyldiacylglycerol (ii), three novel structures  have been established: 1,2-di-o-acyl-3-o-[6-(sn-glycero-1-phospho)-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 leads to 2)-(6-o-acyl-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl)]glycerol (iii), 1,2-di-o-acyl-3-o-[6-(sn-glycero-1-phospho)-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 leads to 6)-alpha-d-galactopyranosyl-(1 leads to 2)-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl]glycerol (iv),  and 1,2-di-o-acyl-3-o-[6-(sn-glycero-1-phospho)-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 leads to 6)-alpha-d-galactopyranosyl-(1 leads to 2)-(6-o-acyl-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl)]glycerol (v). 2. compound i was isolated from bacillus licheniformis, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, compound ii from a group b streptococcus, compounds ii and iii from streptococcus lactis, compounds iv and v from lactobacillus casei. lactobacillus plantarum contained besides compounds iv and v a glycerophosphate derivative of 1,2-di-o-acyl-3-o-[alpha-d-galactopyranosyl (1 leads to 2)-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl]glycerol. 3. identical structural features of the described glycerophosphoglycolipids and the corresponding lipoteichoic acids are  discussed.

TI  == structural requirements for arthritogenicity of peptidoglycans from staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus plant arum and analogous synthetic compounds.
AB  == the comparative studies on the arthritogenicity of chemically well defined peptidoglycans (pg)2 from the cell walls of staphylococcus aureus (fda 209p) and  lactobacillus plantarum (atcc 8014) showed that 1) a polymer of disaccharide-peptide with or without the presence of n-acetylglucosaminyl-ribitol-teichoic acid produced severe arthritis; 2) oligosaccharide-peptides with or without the special structure (n-acetylglucosaminyl-ribitol-teichoic acid in s. aureus, a polymer of rhamnose and glucose in l. plantarum) produced severe disease; 3) disaccharide-heptapeptide-disaccharide with or without the presence of either glucose-ribitol-teichoic acid or a polymer of rhamnose and glucose appeared to be arthritogenic but much less effective for disease production; 4) n-acetylmuramyl-heptapeptide-n-acetylmuramic acid and disaccharide-hexapeptide were non-arthritogenic; 5) none of the synthetic n-acetylmuramyl-peptides, including tetrapeptide, produced the disease. thus it is concluded that arthritis-inducing activity is related to the peptidoglycan moiety but not to the special structure, and the most important moiety responsible for disease production may be located in a chain length of two or more disaccharide units on  pg subunits. however, it is discussed that non-arthritogenicity of peptidoglycans, including synthetic compounds, may be due to a lack of adjuvanticity in rats rather than a lack of antigenic determinant(s) responsible  for production of arthritis.

TI  == deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. the small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("fukushima type 1"). bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. the results: 1) among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were staphylococcus (s.) epidermidis and lactobacillus  (l.) bifidus. species of which none of the strains split were escherichia (e.) coli, e. communior, e. freundii, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. buchneri, l. cellobiosus, l. bulgaricus, s. aureus, aerobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was  intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all  of the strains split were bacteroides (b.) vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, corynebacterium (c.) granulosum, c. avidum, peptostreptococcus (peptostrept.) putridus, eubacterium (eubact.) lentum, peptococcus (pept.) grigoroffii, pept. anaerobius, veillonella (v.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were coryne. diphtheroides, eubact. parvum, peptostrept. intermedius. species of which none of the strains split were coryne, parvum, peptostrept. micros, v. alcalescens, v. parvula, catenabacterium (catena.) catenaforme, and catena. filamentosum. 3) all or none, or almost all or none, of  the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.

TI  == immunoadjuvant activities of peptidoglycan subunits from the cell walls of staphyloccus aureus and lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == attempts were made to isolate and identify the unit chemical structure essential  for manifestation of the immunoadjuvant activities characteristic of bacterial cell walls. the n-acetylmuramyl-peptide subunit monomers, nalpha-(n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutaminyl)-nepsilon-(glycylglycyl)-l-lysyl -d-alanine from the cell walls of staphylococcus aureus (fda 209p) and n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutaminyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid and/or n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutaminyl-meso-diaminopimelyl-d-alanine from those of lactobacillus plantarum (atcc 8014), were shown to be unit chemical entities with definite adjuvant activity both in stimulation of antibody production and in induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions.

TI  == immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible micrococcus lysodeikticus (nctc 2665) and lysozyme-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of staphylococcus aureus (copenhagen), streptococcus pyogens (group a, type 6; s43/100), streptococcus salivarius (ifo 3350), streptococcus faecalis (ifo 12580), streptococcus mutans (bht), lactobacillus plantarum (atcc 8014), bacillus megaterium (ifo 12068), corynebacterium diphtheriae (park-williams no. 8), mycobacterium smegmatis, and actinomyces viscous (atcc 15987). evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.

TI  == mode of action of glycine on the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan.
AB  == the mechanism of glycine action in growth inhibition was studied on eight different species of bacteria of various genera representing the four most common peptidoglycan types. to inhibit the growth of the different organisms to 80%, glycine concentrations from 0.05 to 1.33 m had to be applied. the inhibited cells showed morphological aberrations. it has been demonstrated that glycine is incorporated into the nucleotide-activated peptidoglycan precursors. the amount of incorporated glycine was equivalent to the decrease in the amount of alanine.  with one exception glycine is also incorporated into the peptidoglycan. studies on the primary structure of both the peptidoglycan precursors and the corresponding peptidoglycan have revealed that glycine can replace l-alanine in position 1 and d-alanine residues in positions 4 and 5 of the peptide subunit. replacement of l-alanine in position 1 of the peptide subunit together with an accumulation of uridine diphosphate-muramic acid (udp-murnac), indicating an inhibition of the udp-murnac:l-ala ligase, has been found in three bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus cellobiosus and l. plantarum). however, discrimination against precursors with glycine in position 1 in peptidoglycan synthesis has been observed only in s. aureus. replacement of d-alanine residues  was most common. it occurred in the peptidoglycan with one exception in all strains studied. in corynebacterium sp., c. callunae, l. plantarum, and l. cellobiosus most of the d-alanine replacing glycine occurs c-terminal in position 4, and in c. insidiosum and s. aureus glycine is found c-terminal in position 5.  it is suggested that the modified peptidoglycan precursors are accumulated by being poor substrates for some of the enzymes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. two mechanisms leading to a more loosely cross-linked peptidoglycan and to morphological changes of the cells are considered. first, the accumulation of glycine-containing precursors may lead to a disrupture of the normal balance between peptidoglycan synthesis and controlled enzymatic hydrolysis during growth. second, the modified glycine-containing precursors may be incorporated. since these are poor substrates in the transpeptidation reaction, a high percentage of muropeptides remains uncross-linked. the second mechanism may be the more significant in most cases.

TI  == inhibition on bacteria by 5-fluoronicotinic acid and other analogues of nicotinic acid.
AB  == streightoff, frank (the lilly research laboratories, indianapolis, ind.). inhibition of bacteria by 5-fluoronicotinic acid and other analogues of nicotinic acid. j. bacteriol. 85:42-48. 1963.-several compounds related to 5-fluoronicotinic acid (5-fna) have been demonstrated to inhibit streptococcus sp. (viridans group), staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and lactobacillus  plantarum in vitro. the most active compounds were 5-fna and 5-fluoronicotinamide (5-fnam). the growth of streptococcus sp. was inhibited more than 50% by 0.05 mug/ml of 5-fna or 0.5 mug/ml of 5-fnam. the inhibition of streptococcus sp. from 1 part of 5-fna or 5-fnam was reversed by 4 and 2 parts of nicotinic acid, respectively. the inhibition of e. coli from 100 parts of 5-fna or 5-fnam was reversed by 1 part of nicotinic acid. inhibitions by most other active compounds  could be reversed by nicotinic acid. in experiments with mice, eight compounds related to 5-fna had activity against streptococcus pyogenes; 5-fna, 5-fnam, and  5-fluoro-n-dimethylaminomethylnicotinamide protected all mice at 83 mg/kg x two treatments subcutaneously. the action of 200 mg/kg x two treatments of 5-fna was  reversed by 20 mg/kg x two treatments of nicotinic acid. the activity of 5-fna was not increased by modifications at the number 3 or 5 positions on the pyridine ring or by any other structural changes.
