TI  == prevotella intermedia induces severe bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia in mice with upregulated platelet-activating factor receptor expression.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of respiratory infection worldwide. although oral hygiene has been considered a risk factor for developing pneumonia, the relationship between oral bacteria and pneumococcal infection is unknown. in  this study, we examined the synergic effects of prevotella intermedia, a major periodontopathic bacterium, on pneumococcal pneumonia. the synergic effects of the supernatant of p. intermedia (pisup) on pneumococcal pneumonia were investigated in mice, and the stimulation of pneumococcal adhesion to human alveolar (a549) cells by pisup was assessed. the effects of pisup on platelet-activating factor receptor (pafr) transcript levels in vitro and in vivo were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr, and the differences between the effects of pneumococcal infection induced by various periodontopathic bacterial species were verified in mice. mice inoculated with s. pneumoniae plus pisup exhibited a significantly lower survival rate, higher bacterial loads in the lungs, spleen, and blood, and higher inflammatory cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) than those infected without pisup. in a549 cells, pisup increased pneumococcal adhesion and pafr transcript levels. pisup also increased  lung pafr transcript levels in mice. similar effects were not observed in the supernatants of porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum. thus, p. intermedia has the potential to induce severe bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia with enhanced pneumococcal adhesion to lower airway cells.

TI  == spontaneously draining acute otitis media in children: an observational study of  clinical findings, microbiology and clinical course.
AB  == objectives: to study the outcome of acute otitis media (aom) with otorrhoea in children managed initially without antibiotics, in relation to bacterial and clinical findings, and to identify those who may benefit from antibiotics. methods: otherwise healthy, not otitis prone children aged 2-16 y, presenting with aom with spontaneous otorrhoea, were recruited from primary care and followed at selected ear, nose and throat (ent) clinics. specimens for bacterial  investigations were obtained; symptoms were registered on a daily basis. the main outcomes measured were the frequency of children treated with antibiotics due to  persisting aom within 9 days in relation to clinical and bacteriological findings, and new aom within 3 months. results: twelve of 71 children who completed the trial received antibiotics during the first 9 days due to lack of improvement. one received antibiotics after 16 days due to relapsing aom and 6 received antibiotics after 30 days due to new aom. at 2-4 days following inclusion, over 70% of children showed normalized eardrum status and markedly reduced secretion. alloiococcus otitidis was found in 23 samples, streptococcus pneumoniae in 12, streptococcus pyogenes in 6, and fusobacterium nucleatum in 5.  mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, and fusobacterium necrophorum were not detected. antibiotics were prescribed more extensively to children with a pulsating eardrum and abundant purulent secretion. all children with s. pyogenes  received antibiotics, whereas children with only a. otitidis did not. conclusions: the results suggest that antibiotics are indicated in aom with otorrhoea and the presence of abundant purulent secretion, a pulsating eardrum, or the presence of s. pyogenes. the presence of only a. otitidis was not associated with a more prolonged course or the need for antibiotics.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sodium citrate against streptococcus pneumoniae and several oral bacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study is to assess the antibacterial activity of sodium citrate against streptococcus pneumoniae and several oral bacteria. methods and results: the antibacterial activity was determined by broth microdilution method. the results showed that although enterocuccus faecium ob7084 and klebsiella pneumoniae ob7088 had high tolerance to sodium citrate, several oral bacteria including fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532(t) , streptococcus mutans jcm5705(t) and strep. pneumoniae nbrc102642(t) were susceptible. furthermore, the bactericidal activity of sodium citrate against strep. pneumoniae nbrc102642(t) was not influenced by ph in the range of 5.0-8.0, whereas that of sodium lactate  was weakened at neutral or weak alkaline ph. when strep. pneumoniae nbrc102642(t) was treated with sodium citrate for 2 h, many burst cells were observed. however, addition of mgcl(2) or cacl(2) to an assay medium weakened the antimicrobial activity although zncl(2) or mncl(2) did not influence. conclusions: independent  of ph, sodium citrate inhibited the growth of oral bacteria, which suggests that  the mechanism is different from that of sodium lactate. significance and impact of the study: the results presented in this study would be available for understanding the antimicrobial property of sodium citrate.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

TI  == evaluation of 4 swab transport systems for the recovery of atcc and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms.
AB  == despite limitations of swab transport systems (sts), many clinical samples and bacterial isolates are sent on these devices. we evaluated the performance of 4 commercial sts: m40 transystem (s1, copan italia, bovezzo, italy), uni-ter (s2, meus, piove di sacco, italy), euromed (s3, lab service, surbo, italy), and eurotubo (s4, deltalab, rubi, spain). survival of atcc and clinical strains with  characterized resistance mechanisms, stored at room temperature and using the roll-plate method (nccls m40-a) after holding times of 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h, and 7 days, was assessed. after 24 h, only s1 was able to maintain streptococcus  pneumoniae (atcc 6305), haemophilus influenzae (10211), and neisseria meningitidis (13090) viability with a percentage range of recovery with respect to the baseline count at zero time of 104-184%. neisseria gonorrhoeae (43069) was uncultivable after 6 h with all sts except s1 (46% recovery). eighteen percent recovery after 24 h and 7% after 6 h was observed for fusobacterium nucleatum (25586) and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (27337), respectively, but only with s1. resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates do not affect survival with any of the sts.

TI  == bactericidal activities of methoxyfluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin  against aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens in serum.
AB  == gatifloxacin (bristol-myers squibb) and moxifloxacin (bayer) are new methoxyfluoroquinolones with broad-spectrum activity against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens of the respiratory tract. in this investigation, we analyzed  the bactericidal activity in serum over time of these antimicrobials against three aerobic (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus) and four anaerobic (peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus magnus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella melaninogenica) bacteria associated with respiratory tract infections. serum samples were obtained from 11 healthy male subjects following a single 400-mg oral dose of gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. these samples were collected prior to and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after the dose of each drug. gatifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 12 h against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic  = 0.5 micro g/ml), peptostreptococcus micros (mic = 0.25 micro g/ml), and f. nucleatum (mic = 0.5 micro g/ml) and 24 h against h. influenzae (mic = 0.03 micro g/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), peptostreptococcus magnus  (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), and prevotella melaninogenica (mic = 0.5 micro g/ml). moxifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 24 h against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), h. influenzae (mic = 0.015 micro g/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic = 0.06 micro g/ml), f. nucleatum (mic = 0.5 micro g/ml), prevotella melaninogenica (mic =0.5 micro g/ml), peptostreptococcus magnus (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), and peptostreptococcus micros (mic = 0.25 micro g/ml). the results from this pharmacodynamic study suggest that these fluoroquinolones would have prolonged killing activity against these organisms in vivo and may have clinical utility in the treatment of mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections.

TI  == phosphorylcholine-dependent cross-reactivity between dental plaque bacteria and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.
AB  == antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (pc) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain pc as determined by reactivity with pc-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (igg) g anti-pc are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. these data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-pc responses. recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for pc are elevated in apoe-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ldl) (oxldl) in atherosclerotic plaques. these data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-pc could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxldl, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. we therefore examined the ability of human anti-pc to bind to pc-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition  assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-pc to  pc-bearing actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. our results indicated that pc-bearing strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed  up to 80% of anti-pc igg antibody from human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc  bound to a pc-bearing strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a pc-negative strain. oxldl also absorbed anti-pc from human sera, and oxldl but not ldl reacted with up to 80% of the anti-pc in human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc bound directly to oxldl but not to ldl. the data indicate that pc-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxldl. we propose that pc-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to pc that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.

TI  == two cases of diskitis attributable to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  == diskitis, an inflammation of the intervertebral disk, is generally attributable to staphylococcus aureus and rarely staphylococcus epidermidis, kingella kingae,  enterobacteriaciae, and streptococcus pneumoniae. in many cases, no bacterial growth is obtained from infected intervertebral discs. although anaerobic bacteria were recovered from adults with spondylodiscitis, these organisms were not reported before from children. the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 2 children with diskitis is reported. patient 1. a 10-year-old male presented with  6 weeks of low back pain and 2 weeks of low-grade fever and abdominal pain. physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between thoracic vertebra 11 and lumbar vertebra 2. the patient had a temperature of 104 degrees f. laboratory tests were within normal limits, except  for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr), which was 58 mm/hour. blood culture showed no growth. magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed minimal inflammatory changes in the 12th thoracic vertebra/first lumbar vertebra  disk. there was no other abnormality. a computed tomography (ct)-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded bloody material, which was sent for aerobic  and anaerobic cultures. gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and gram-positive cocci in chains. cultures for anaerobic bacteria yielded heavy growth of peptostreptococcus magnus, which was susceptible to penicillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. the patient was treated with intravenous penicillin  600 000 units every 6 hours for 3 weeks, and then oral amoxicillin, 500 mg every  6 hours for 3 weeks. the back pain resolved within 2 weeks, and the esr returned  to normal at the end of therapy. follow-up for 3 years showed complete resolution of the infection. patient 2. an 8-year-old boy presented with low back pain and low-grade fever, irritability, and general malaise for 10 days. he had had an upper respiratory tract infection with sore throat 27 days earlier, for which he  received no therapy. the patient had a temperature of 102 degrees f, and physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between the second and fourth lumbar vertebrae. laboratory tests were normal, except for  the esr (42 mm/hour). radiographs of the spine showed narrowing of the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space and irregularity of the margins of the vertebral endplates. a ct scan revealed a lytic bone lesion at lumbar vertebra 4, and bone scan showed an increase uptake of (99m)technetium at the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space. ct-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded cloudy nonfoul-smelling material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and fusiform gram-negative bacilli.  anaerobic culture grew light growth of fusobacterium nucleatum. the organism produced beta-lactamase and was susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, metronidazole, and imipenem. therapy with clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours was given parenterally for 3 weeks and orally for 3 weeks. back pain resolved within 2 weeks. a 2-year follow-up showed complete resolution and no recurrence. this report describes, for the first time, the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from children with diskitis. the lack of their recovery in previous reports and the absence of bacterial growth in over two third of these studies may be caused by the use of improper methods for their collection, transportation, and cultivation. proper choice of antimicrobial therapy for diskitis can be accomplished only by identification of the causative organisms and its antimicrobial susceptibility. this is of particular importance in infections caused by anaerobic bacteria that are often resistant to antimicrobials used to empirically treat diskitis. this was the case in our second patient, who was infected by f nucleatum, which was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. the origin of the anaerobic bacteria causing the infection in our patient is probably of endogenous nature. the presence of abdominal pain in the first child may have been attributable to a subclinical abdominal pathothology. the preceding pharyngitis in the second patient may have  been associated with a potential hematogenous spread of f nucleatum. p magnus has been associated with bone and joint infections. this report highlights the importance of obtaining disk space culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from all children with diskitis. future prospective studies are warranted to elucidate the role of anaerobic bacteria in diskitis in children.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == microbiology of the transition from acute to chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == repeated aspirations of sinus secretions by endoscopy was performed in five patients over a period of 34-50 days and, ultimately, surgical drainage was done  in three who presented with acute maxillary sinusitis that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and became chronic. the aspirates were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. most of the bacteria isolated from the first culture were aerobic or facultative bacteria: streptococcus pneumoniae (three isolates), haemophilus influenzae non-type-b (two) and moraxella catarrhalis (one). three of these cultures yielded bacteria that were resistant to the antimicrobial agents prescribed for treatment. failure to respond to therapy was associated with the emergence of resistant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in subsequent aspirates. these organisms included fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. eradication of the infection was achieved in all instances following the administration of antimicrobial agents effective against these bacteria, and in three instances by surgical drainage. this study illustrates the microbial dynamics of maxillary sinusitis that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == the relationship between fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  == mixed infections with three fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. fifteen fusobacterium isolates (eight f. nucleatum, four f. necrophorum, and three f. varium) and one isolate each of bacteroides fragilis, b. asaccharolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, group a beta-haemolytic streptococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before  and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. after co-inoculation  of fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, s. aureus and k. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were fusobacterium isolates, while fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than group a streptococci  and e. coli. mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with fusobacterium spp. and k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa or bacteroides spp. suppression of fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with group a streptococci. the additive or synergistic capabilities of fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.

TI  == bacterial colonization, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia following tracheostomy and long-term intubation in pediatric patients.
AB  == serial tracheal cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from 27 pediatric patients during one year of follow-up. the patients had required tracheostomy and prolonged intubation for periods ranging from 3 to 12 months (average, 7 1/2 months). cultures of tracheal aspirates yielded 1,508 isolates of pathogenic aerobic (969 isolates) and anaerobic (539 isolates) bacteria. the most frequent aerobic isolates were streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus. the predominant anaerobes were anaerobic gram-positive cocci, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides fragilis. replacement of one pathogen by another occurred frequently. tracheobronchitis occurred in 24 patients, all of whom had episodes of pneumonia. the data suggest that anaerobic bacteria are a part of the bacterial flora in colonization, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia in  patients with tracheostomy and prolonged intubation.
