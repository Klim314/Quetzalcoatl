TI  == intestinal microbiota was assessed in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis b virus infection. intestinal microbiota of hbv cirrhotic patients.
AB  == to unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis b virus (hbv), chronic hepatitis b, decompensated hbv cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative pcr and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and clostridium perfringens in fecal crude dna and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. data analysis indicated that 16s rrna gene copy numbers for faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of hbv cirrhotic patients. the bifidobacteria/enterobacteriaceae (b/e) ratio, which may  indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 +/- 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 +/- 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis b to  0.64 +/- 0.09 in patients with decompensated hbv cirrhosis (for all, p < 0.01). this suggests that b/e ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. the data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. fecal secretory iga and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in decompensated hbv cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance.

TI  == real-time polymerase chain reaction quantification of specific butyrate-producing bacteria, desulfovibrio and enterococcus faecalis in the feces of patients with colorectal cancer.
AB  == background and aim: bacterial metabolites produced in the bowel are potentially related to the genesis of colorectal cancer. butyrate is protective against cancer, whereas hydrogen sulfide and oxygen free radicals can be toxic to the epithelium. the present study was designed to quantitate eubacterium rectale, faecalibacterium prausnitzii (both butyrate-producing bacteria), desulfovibrio (sulfate-reducing bacteria), and enterococcus faecalis (that produces extracellular superoxide) in the feces of patients with colorectal cancer. methods: dna was extracted from feces of 20 patients with colorectal cancer, nine patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer and 17 healthy volunteers. real-time  polymerase chain reaction using primers aimed at 16s rdna was used to quantitate  the above bacterial species or genus, and this was expressed relative to amplification of universal sequences conserved among all bacteria. results: levels of e. rectale and f. prausnitzii were decreased approximately fourfold (p  = 0.0088 and 0.0028, respectively) in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy control volunteers. levels of desulfovibrio were not significantly different between the three groups. e. faecalis populations were significantly higher in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy volunteers (p = 0.0294). conclusions: butyrate producers were decreased and e. faecalis increased in the feces of colon cancer patients. these shifts in the colonic bacterial population  could potentially lead to epithelial cell damage and increased turnover and may be a factor leading to colon cancer.

TI  == characterisation of intestinal bacteria in infant stools using real-time pcr and  northern hybridisation analyses.
AB  == real-time pcr and northern hybridisations were used to quantify bacterial populations in the large gut of infants. pcr primers for rapid, sensitive, high throughput detection of bifidobacteria, bacteroides, sulphate-reducing bacteria and enterococcus faecalis, based on analysis of 16s rrna genes were used. bacterial populations were analysed in faeces from 40 infants aged 0-6, 7-12 and  13-24 months. the effects of breast versus bottle feeding was also investigated.  real-time pcr indicated that bacteroides and desulfovibrio numbers increased markedly in the 7-12 and 13-24 month age groups, and that the reverse occurred with ent. faecalis. with the exception of desulfovibrios, this was seen with northern hybridisations, which also showed increased colonisation by the clostridium coccoides group and faecalibacterium prausnitzii after 6 months. both methodologies indicated increased bifidobacteria in breast-fed babies, and higher levels of desulfovibrios in bottle-fed children.

TI  == characterization of bacterial communities in feces from healthy elderly volunteers and hospitalized elderly patients by using real-time pcr and effects of antibiotic treatment on the fecal microbiota.
AB  == fecal bacteria were studied in healthy elderly volunteers (age, 63 to 90 years; n = 35) living in the local community, elderly hospitalized patients (age, 66 to 103; n = 38), and elderly hospitalized patients receiving antibiotic treatment (age, 65 to 100; n = 21). group- and species-specific primer sets targeting 16s rrna genes were used to quantitate intestinal bacteria by using dna extracted from feces and real-time pcr. the principal difference between healthy elderly volunteers and both patient cohorts was a marked reduction in the bacteroides-prevotella group following hospitalization. reductions in bifidobacteria, desulfovibrio spp., clostridium clostridiiforme, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were also found in the hospitalized patients. however, total 16s rrna gene copy numbers (per gram of wet weight of feces) were  generally lower in the stool samples of the two groups of hospitalized patients compared to the number in the stool samples of elderly volunteers living in the community, so the relative abundance (percentage of the group- and species-specific rrna gene copies in relation to total bacterial rrna gene copies) of bifidobacteria, desulfovibrio spp., c. clostridiiforme, and f. prausnitzii did not change. antibiotic treatment resulted in further reductions in the numbers of bacteria and their prevalence and, in some patients, complete elimination of certain bacterial communities. conversely, the numbers of enterobacteria increased in the hospitalized patients who did not receive antibiotics, and due to profound changes in fecal microbiotas during antibiotic treatment, the opportunistic species enterococcus faecalis proliferated.
