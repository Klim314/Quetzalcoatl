TI  == prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteroides fragilis group isolated from stool samples in north lebanon.
AB  == fifty one strains of the bacteroides fragilis group were isolated from 45 fecal samples. classical phenotypic identification showed that 16 isolates were b. thetaiotaomicron, 12 b. uniformis, 9 b. eggerthii, 7 b. vulgatus, 3 b. caccae, 2  parabacteroides distasonis with 1 identified b. ovatus and 1 b. fragilis. the 51  strains were tested for susceptibility against 16 antimicrobial agents and the mics for metronidazole were determined. the tests showed that imipenem, meropenem and chloramphenicol were the most effective antibiotics (98%, 98% and 92.16% of susceptibility, respectively) followed by ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, rifampin (88.24% susceptibility), moxifloxacin 86.27% and tigecycline 84.31%. ofloxacin and cefotaxime were the least effective antibiotics with 27.45% and 0% of activity respectively. only six of the 51 isolated strains were resistant to metronidazole with mics = 64 mg/l (1 strain) and > 256 mg/l (5 strains).

TI  == application of quantitative real-time pcr for rapid identification of bacteroides fragilis group and related organisms in human wound samples.
AB  == our goal was to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qrt-pcr) method to detect bacteroides fragilis group and related organisms from clinical specimens. compared to conventional anaerobic culture, qrt-pcr can provide accurate and more rapid detection and identification of b. fragilis group and similar species. b. fragilis group and related organisms are the most frequently isolated anaerobic pathogens from clinical samples. however, culture and phenotypic identification is quite time-consuming. we designed specific primers and probes based on the 16s rrna gene sequences of bacteroides caccae, bacteroides eggerthii, b. fragilis, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides stercoris, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, odoribacter splanchnicus (bacteroides splanchnicus), parabacteroides distasonis (bacteroides distasonis) and parabacteroides merdae (bacteroides merdae), and detected these species by means of qrt-pcr in 400 human surgical wound infection samples or closed abscesses. the target bacteria were detected from 31 samples (8%) by culture, but from 132 samples (33%) by qrt-pcr (p-value < 0.001). b. uniformis was the most common species (44 positive samples) according to qrt-pcr while culture showed it to be b. fragilis (16 positive samples). additionally, for each species qrt-pcr detected higher counts than culture did; this may reflect detecting dna of dead organisms by qrt-pcr. qrt-pcr is a rapid and sensitive method which has great potential for detection of b. fragilis group and related organisms in wound samples.

TI  == lessons learned from the anaerobe survey: historical perspective and review of the most recent data (2005-2007).
AB  == background: the rationale and lessons learned through the evolution of the national survey for the susceptibility of bacteroides fragilis group from its initiation in 1981 through 2007 are reviewed here. the survey was conceived in 1980 to track emerging antimicrobial resistance in bacteroides species. methods:  data from the last 11 years of the survey (1997-2007), including 6574 isolates from 13 medical centers, were analyzed for in vitro antimicrobial resistance to both frequently used and newly developed anti-anaerobic agents. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotics were determined using agar dilution  in accordance with clinical and laboratory standards institute recommendations. results: the analyses revealed that the carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, and doripenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active agents against these pathogens, with resistance rates of 0.9%-2.3%. in the most recent 3 years of the survey (2005-2007), resistance to some agents was shown to depend on the species, such as ampicillin-sulbactam against bacteroides distasonis (20.6%)  and tigecycline against bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides eggerthii ( approximately 7%). very high resistance rates (>50%) were noted for moxifloxacin  and trovafloxacin, particularly against bacteroides vulgatus. during that period  of study, non-b. fragilis bacteroides species had >40% resistance to clindamycin. metronidazole-resistant bacteroides strains were also first reported during that  period. conclusions: in summary, resistance to antibiotics was greater among non-b. fragilis bacteroides species than among b. fragilis and was especially greater among species with a low frequency of isolation, such as bacteroides caccae and b. uniformis. the emergence of resistance among the non-b. fragilis bacteroides species underscores the need for speciation of b. fragilis group isolates and for clinicians to be aware of associations between species and drug  resistance.

TI  == relative abundance of bacteroides spp. in stools and wastewaters as determined by hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension.
AB  == a molecular method, termed hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension (hope),  was used to determine the relative abundances of predominant bacteroides spp. present in fecal microbiota and wastewaters. for this analysis, genomic dna in feces of healthy human adults, bovines, and swine and in wastewaters was extracted and total bacterial 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified and used as the dna templates for hope. nineteen oligonucleotide primers were designed to detect  14 bacteroides spp. at different hierarchical levels (domain, order, cluster, and species) and were arranged into and used in six multiplex hope reaction mixtures. results showed that species like b. vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. caccae, b.  uniformis, b. fragilis, b. eggerthii, and b. massiliensis could be individually detected in human feces at abundances corresponding to as little as 0.1% of pcr-amplified 16s rrna genes. minor species like b. pyogenes, b. salyersiae, and  b. nordii were detected only collectively using a primer that targeted the b. fragilis subgroup (corresponding to approximately 0.2% of pcr-amplified 16s rrna  genes). furthermore, bac303-related targets (i.e., most bacteroidales) were observed to account for 28 to 44% of pcr-amplified 16s rrna genes from human fecal microbiota, and their abundances were higher than those detected in the bovine and swine fecal microbiota and in wastewaters by factors of five and two,  respectively. these results were comparable to those obtained by quantitative pcr and to those reported previously from studies using whole-cell fluorescence hybridization and 16s rrna clone library methods, supporting the conclusion that  hope can be a sensitive, specific, and rapid method to determine the relative abundances of bacteroides spp. predominant in fecal samples.

TI  == rapid identification of the species of the bacteroides fragilis group by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers.
AB  == we report a rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay to identify the 10 bacteroides fragilis group species - bacteroides caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b. stercoris, b.  thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis and b. vulgatus. these 10 species were first divided into three subgroups by multiplex pcr-g, followed by three multiplex pcr  assays with three species-specific primer mixtures for identification to the species level. the primers were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna, the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and part of the 23s rrna gene. the established two-step multiplex pcr identification scheme was applied to the identification of 155 clinical isolates of the b. fragilis group that were previously identified to the species level by phenotypic tests. the new scheme was more accurate than phenotypic identification, which was accurate only 84.5% of the time. the multiplex pcr scheme established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of the b. fragilis group species. this will permit more accurate assessment of the role of various b. fragilis group members in infections and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the group members.

TI  == sphingolipid composition in bacteroides species.
AB  == sphingolipid profiles of strains from species of genus bacteroides, and representative strains from prevotella and porphyromonas, were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and infrared spectrophotometry. two major types of phosphosphingolipid, ceramide phosphorylethanolamine and ceramide phosphorylglycerol, were detected in b. fragilis, b. ovatus, b. uniformis, b. caccae, b. eggerthii, b. thetaiotaomicron, and b. stercoris, but not in b. merdae, b. distasonis, and b. vulgatus. strains from the genera prevotella and porphyromonas also contained these two sphingolipids. these sphingolipid profiles were conserved within the species tested, and may be useful for differentiation and recognition of relationships within the genera bacteroides, prevotella and porphyromonas.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of bacteroides and other genera of gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  == a numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of bacteroides, polyphyromonas, prevotella [not prevotella (labroue, 1976)] and fusobacterium. isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. computation of similarity coefficients was  followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. at the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) fusobacterium mortiferum, f. necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum and f.  varium; (3) b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformus and b. vulgatus; (4) b. splanchnicus; (5) porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) b. bivius (prevotella bivia); (7) b. disiens (p. disiens); (8) b. intermedius (p. intermedia);and (9) b. melaninogenicus (p. melaninogenica). single isolates of b. ruminicola (p. ruminicola), b. denticola (p. denticola) and b. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.

TI  == rapid differentiation of the species of the genus bacteroides sensu stricto by capillary gas chromatography of cellular carbohydrates.
AB  == whole-cell hydrolysates of bacteroides fragilis, the type species of the genus bacteroides castellani and chalmers 1919, and the genetical closely related species b. vulgatus, b. ovatus, b. eggerthii, b. distasonis, b. uniformis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. stercoris, b. merdae, and b. caccae were used to determine characteristic carbohydrate patterns by capillary gas chromatography. on the basis of the chemical derivatization of the carbohydrates seven characteristic peaks for peracetylated aldononitriles and nine characteristic peaks for peracetylated o-methyloximes were selected from the carbohydrate fingerprints of  the reference strains to prepare a dichotomous identification key. the classification of an unknown strain supposed to belong to the formerly called 'bacteroides fragilis group' is possible with this key. some of the advantages of the technique were that the identification of bacteroides fragilis-like strains requires only 4-5 h after primary isolation and that the bacteria can be exposed  to oxygen because viability of the organisms is not necessary. sophisticated anaerobic techniques can therefore be avoided for identification.

TI  == prevotella, a new genus to include bacteroides melaninogenicus and related species formerly classified in the genus bacteroides.
AB  == it was recently proposed that the genus bacteroides should be restricted to bacteroides fragilis (the type species) and closely related organisms (viz., b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b. stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, and b. vulgatus). by contrast, the moderately saccharolytic, predominantly oral bacteroides species, which include b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and related species, form a phenotypically and phylogenetically coherent group of species which differ so significantly from the emended description of the genus bacteroides that they should not be classified in the same genus. therefore, we formally propose that these species be reclassified in a new genus, prevotella. the type species is prevotella melaninogenica.
