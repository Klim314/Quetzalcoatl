TI  - Function and molecular architecture of the Yersinia injectisome tip complex.
AB  - By quantitative immunoblot analyses and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we determined that the needle of the Yersinia enterocolitica E40 injectisome consists of 139 +/- 19 YscF subunits and that the tip complex is formed by three to five LcrV monomers. A pentamer represented the best fit for an atomic model of this complex. The N-terminal globular domain of LcrV forms the base of the tip complex, while the central globular domain forms the head. Hybrids between LcrV and its orthologues PcrV (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) or AcrV (Aeromonas salmonicida) were engineered and recombinant Y. enterocolitica expressing the different hybrids were tested for their capacity to form the translocation pore by a haemolysis assay. There was a good correlation between haemolysis, insertion of YopB into erythrocyte membranes and interaction between YopB and the N-terminal globular domain of the tip complex subunit. Hence, the base of the tip complex appears to be critical for the functional insertion of YopB into the host cell membrane.
TI  - Occurrence of N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones in extracts of some Gram-negative bacteria evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
AB  - Acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs) are self-generated signal molecules that mediate population density-dependent gene expression (quorum sensing) in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria. These signal molecules diffuse from bacterial cells and accumulate in the medium as a function of cell growth. In selected foods AHLs contribute to product spoilage. As different bacterial species produce AHL analogs that differ in length of the N-acyl chain, ranging from 4 to 14 carbons and in the substitution at the C-3 position of the side chain (i.e., oxo or hydroxyl group), the suitability and applicability of a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry direct method for characterizing trace amounts of AHLs was evaluated using N-heptanoyl-homoserine lactone as internal standard. Crude cell-free supernatants of bacterial cultures of Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Serratia liquefaciens were screened for AHL production in selected ion monitoring mode, using the prominent fragment at m/z 143. The observed profiles of distinguishable N-acyl-homoserine lactones occurring in bacterial extracts were compared and discussed. The presence of a labile 3-oxo-hexanoylhomoserine lactone was evidenced but serious difficulties arose in estimating its concentration as thermal degradation occurs during the gas chromatographic separation. Its electron impact mass spectra was, however, given and interpreted.
TI  - Characterization of a Type III secretion substrate specificity switch (T3S4) domain in YscP from Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - The length of the needle ending the Yersinia Ysc injectisome is determined by YscP, a protein acting as a molecular ruler. In addition, YscP is required for Yop secretion. In the present paper, by a systematic deletion analysis, we localized accurately the region required for Yop secretion between residues 405 and 500. As this C-terminal region of YscP has also been shown to control needle length it probably represents the substrate specificity switch of the machinery. By a bioinformatics analysis, we show that this region has a globular structure, an original alpha/beta fold, a P-x-L-G signature and presumably no catalytic activity. In spite of very limited sequence similarities, this structure is conserved among the proteins that are presumed to control the needle length in many different injectisomes and also among members of the FliK family, which control the flagellar hook length. This region thus represents a new protein domain that we called T3S4 for Type III secretion substrate specificity switch. The T3S4 domain of YscP can be replaced by the T3S4 domain of AscP (Aeromonas salmonicida) or PscP (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) but not by the one from FliK, indicating that in spite of a common global structure, these domains need to fit their partner proteins in the secretion apparatus.
