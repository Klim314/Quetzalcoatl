TI  - In vitro fermentation of commercial alpha-gluco-oligosaccharide by faecal microbiota from lean and obese human subjects.
AB  - The fermentation selectivity of a commercial source of a-gluco-oligosaccharides (BioEcolians; Solabia) was investigated in vitro. Fermentation by faecal bacteria from four lean and four obese healthy adults was determined in anaerobic, pH-controlled faecal batch cultures. Inulin was used as a positive prebiotic control. Samples were obtained at 0, 10, 24 and 36 h for bacterial enumeration by fluorescent in situ hybridisation and SCFA analyses. Gas production during fermentation was investigated in non-pH-controlled batch cultures. a-Gluco-oligosaccharides significantly increased the Bifidobacterium sp. population compared with the control. Other bacterial groups enumerated were unaffected with the exception of an increase in the Bacteroides-Prevotella group and a decrease in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii on both a-gluco-oligosaccharides and inulin compared with baseline. An increase in acetate and propionate was seen on both substrates. The fermentation of a-gluco-oligosaccharides produced less total gas at a more gradual rate of production than inulin. Generally, substrates fermented with the obese microbiota produced similar results to the lean fermentation regarding bacteriology and metabolic activity. No significant difference at baseline (0 h) was detected between the lean and obese individuals in any of the faecal bacterial groups studied.
TI  - Molecular-phylogenetic characterization of the microbiota in ulcerated and non-ulcerated regions in the patients with Crohn's disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota has been established in Crohn's disease (CD), but the molecular characterization of this dysbiosis in Chinese subjects with CD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the predominant bacterial composition of the faecal and mucosal-associated microbiota in Chinese CD patients using culture-independent techniques. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Eighteen patients with CD and 9 healthy controls were included in this study. The faeces and the intestinal mucosal tissues from the ulcerated and nonulcerated sites were subjected to bacterial community fingerprinting using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The predominant bacterial composition in the faeces and mucosa was determined with DNA sequencing and BLAST. We showed that the bacterial diversity in the faeces of CD patients was reduced compared with that in healthy controls (p<0.01). The faecal bacterial dysbiosis of the patients was characterized by an elevated abundance of gamma-Proteobacteria (especially Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri) and a reduced proportion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Five bacterial species defined the microbiota imbalance of the ulcerated mucosa in CD, including an increase in Escherichia coli, a decrease in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Lactobacillus coleohominis, Bacteroides sp and Streptococcus gallolyticus in the bacterial community as compared with the nonulcerated (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first description of intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in Chinese CD patients. These results allow a better understanding of the faecal and mucosal microbiota in CD, showing a predominance of some opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in beneficial bacterial species. The findings may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of CD in Chinese population.
TI  - The antimicrobial action of chitosan, low molar mass chitosan, and chitooligosaccharides on human colonic bacteria.
AB  - Antibacterial effect of chitooligosaccharides (COS) and low molar mass chitosans  (LMWC) is considered as one of the most important characteristics of chitosan (CS) hydrolysates. Here, we show the in vitro effect of different COS, LMWC, and CS on representative anaerobic bacteria isolated from human colon as a possibility of targeting modification of colonic microflora composition by supplementation of dietary CS products by humans. Specific growth rate of seven selected nonpathogenic anaerobic bacterial strains (Clostridium paraputrificum, Clostridium beijerinckii, Roseburia intestinalis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Blautia coccoides) was determined in the presence of 0.25 and 0.5% COS (2, 3, and 6 kDa), 0.025 and 0.05% of LMWC (10 and 16 kDa), and 0.025 and 0.1% of CS in vitro. The growth rate decreased in all strains in the presence of COS and LMWC in higher concentrations in comparison to control incubations. A relatively higher resistance to CS hydrolyzates was detected in R. intestinalis and F. prausnitzii, and more susceptible were bacteria belonging to Bacteoides sp. and Clostridium sp. The antimicrobial activity, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined. The antimicrobial activity increased with the degree of polymerization (DP). MIC ranged from 0.25 to 4.5% in dependence on bacterial strain and DP of CS/LMWC. MBC also decreased with DP. The most effective antimicrobial action was detected in LMWC with 16 kDa and CS. Weak antimicrobial activity was found in COS with small molecules (2 and 3 kDa).
TI  - Dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  RNA probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "GoArray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Fecal 16S rDNA from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six CD patients were used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cRNA that was hybridized to the microarray. Differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific primer sets. RESULTS: The microarray analyses showed that Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides fragilis group, B. vulgatus, Ruminococcus albus, R. callidus, R. bromii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the CD patients, while Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Listeria sp. were more abundant in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: The microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum Firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. In addition, the microarray showed that Enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the CD patients. This microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  - Duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. A panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16S rRNA sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of Bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus flavefaciens-Ruminococcus bromii, Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides, and Eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. Nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of bacteria related to R. flavefaciens-R. bromii and E. cylindroides. The ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. The Roseburia-related strain A2-183(F) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by cross-feeding. In contrast, Roseburia intestinalis L1-82(R) and Eubacterium sp. strain A2-194(R) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that A2-194(R) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. These results suggest that many low-G+C-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. Thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics from their effects in vitro.
