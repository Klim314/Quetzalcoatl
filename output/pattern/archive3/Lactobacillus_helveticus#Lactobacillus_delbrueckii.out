selected adjunct cultures remarkably increase the content of bioactive peptides in bulgarian white brined cheese.
some lactic acid bacteria strains in milk media are capable of releasing bioactive peptides. in this study, we evaluated the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace)inhibitory activity of 180 lactic acid bacteria and selected several lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and l. casei strains that demonstrated strong ace-inhibitory activity. the aim was to carry out a molecular study on the bioactive peptides released by the strains with the best ace-inhibitory properties and by the strains demonstrating a calcium-binding effect. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of bioactive peptides in bulgarian white cheese. peptides with the strongest ace-inhibitory activity were purified and sequenced. the strains were assessed for production of peptides with calcium-binding properties. these peptides were isolated, purified and sequenced. two strains releasing bioactive peptides with the strongest ace-inhibitory and calcium-binding activities were selected for development of cheese starters. the strain with the best ace-inhibitory activity was l. helveticus a1, which releases the peptide ala-leu-pro-met as a main contributor to the ace inhibition. the strain with the best calcium-binding activity was l. casei c3 releasing the peptide splspspspe (fraction 15-20 of ss-casein) as a main contributor to calcium binding. after pilot production of cheeses with the developed starters, the ace-inhibitory and calcium-binding effects were confirmed during the cheese ripening. the addition of the two selected adjunct cultures led to increased production of bioactive peptides in the cheese. in this way, it is possible to increase the functional properties of bulgarian white brined cheese.
evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.
use of pcr-based methods and pfge for typing and monitoring homofermentative lactobacilli during comte cheese ripening.
this study investigated the genotypic characteristics of selected and wild homofermentative thermophilic lactobacilli strains during ripening of comte cheeses, made into two cheese plants. both amplification and restriction analysis of the 16s rrna gene (pcr-ardra) and classical biochemical tests were used to identify isolates. diversity within homofermentative lactobacilli was not found in their species composition since the same two species lactobacillus helveticus and l. delbrueckii susbp. lactis were isolated from cheeses. in cheeses made with natural whey starter, it appeared that the most likely sources of l. helveticus and l. delbrueckii susbp. lactis were the starter and raw milk, respectively. the examination of rapd profiles of lactobacilli strains revealed 19 rapd groups among 50 isolates, which were different from selected starter strains. using rapd, rep-pcr, and pfge to identify selected starter strains during cheese ripening, we showed that l. helveticus decreased quickly while l. delbrueckii susbp. lactis sustained high viability during ripening. the use of selected l. delbrueckii susbp. lactis strains diminished the genetic diversity among strains isolated from cheese, probably in preventing the raw milk microflora from growing.
characterization of natural isolates of lactobacillus strains to be used as starter cultures in dairy fermentation.
the technological relevant characteristics of five homofermentative lactobacilli  strains, isolated from natural fermented hard cheeses, were studied. isolates crl 581 and crl 654, from argentinian artesanal hard cheeses, and isolates crl 1177, crl 1178, and crl 1179, from italian grana cheeses, were identified as lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus helveticus, respectively, by physiological and biochemical tests, sds-page of whole-cell proteins and sequencing of the variable (v1) region of the 16s ribosomal dna. all strains showed high levels of beta-galactosidase activity. however, proteolytic activity varied widely among isolates. strains crl 581, crl 654, and crl 1177 hydrolyzed alpha- and beta-caseins and were able to coagulate reconstituted skim milk in less than 16 h at 42 degrees c. according to the substrate specificity, these proteinases have a caseinolytic activity comparable to that of the p(iii)-type of lactococcal proteinases. no strains produced inhibitor substances (bacteriocin) and all were insensitive to attack by 14 l. helveticus- and l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis-specific bacteriophages.
characterization of bacteriocins produced by strains from traditional bulgarian dairy products.
a result of extensive screening of over 300 strains from the collection of elby bulgaricum, plc, thirty six strains were selected as producers of bacteriocins, active closely related lactic acid bacterial species and some food spoilage bacteria. the selected strains belong to l. helveticus, l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, which are rare bacteriocin producers. nineteen nonidentified producers were characterized by molecular taxonomic approaches--m13 fingerprinting, repetitive pcr, ribotyping and hybridization with species-specific probes, which allowed to affiliate them to the species l. delbrueckii. several strains were found to harbour plasmids of different size. the estimated activity against food borne pathogens makes the isolated substances perspective as safe food preservatives and the producing strains could be used as components of starters with improved quality.
preliminary characterization of microflora of comte cheese.
the evolution of the microflora of three comte cheeses made in duplicate with raw milk from three different sources was followed during ripening. the same starter was used with each type of milk. the comparison of the cheeses did not reveal any significant difference in the development of the microflora. starter lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus), which are added at the beginning of manufacture, decreased quickly in the first stages of ripening supporting the hypothesis of cell autolysis. other microorganisms, i.e. homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli (lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, lact. paracasei ssp. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. fermentum), pediococci, enterococci and propionibacteria grew in cheese from small numbers in fresh curd. the characterization of strep. thermophilus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that wild strains were also able to grow in the curd. the values for the genome size of 11 strep. thermophilus strains determined in this investigation were in the range of 1.8-2.3 mbp. the potential role of starter and raw milk microflora in cheese flavour development was considered.
kinetic studies of the action of lactacin f, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus johnsonii that forms poration complexes in the cytoplasmic membrane.
the bacteriocin lactacin f is bactericidal against lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus, and enterococcus faecalis. activity against l. delbrueckii was recently shown to be dependent on two peptides, lafa and lafx, which are encoded within the lactacin f operon (t. r. klaenhammer, fems microbiol. rev. 12:39-87, 1993). it has been proposed that two peptides form an active lactacin f complex. in this study, the action of lactacin f against e. faecalis atcc 19443 and the effects of various environmental parameters were investigated in detail. addition of lactacin f induced the loss of k+ from cells of l. delbrueckii, lactobacillus johnsonii 88-4, and e. faecalis, while the lactacin f producer l. johnsonii vpi 11088 was not affected by the bacteriocin. lactacin f caused an immediate loss of cellular k+, depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane, and hydrolysis of internal atp in e. faecalis. lactacin f induced loss of k+ in 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide-treated cells, indicating that pores are formed in the absence of a proton motive force. atp hydrolysis was not due to dissipation of the proton motive force but was most likely caused by efflux of inorganic phosphate, resulting in a shift of the atp hydrolysis equilibrium. action of lactacin f was optimal at acidic ph values and was reduced in the presence of di- and trivalent cations. the lanthanide gadolinium (gd3+) prevented action of lactacin f completely at a concentration of 0.2 mm. lactacin f-induced loss of cell k+ was severely reduced at low temperatures, presumably as a result of increased ordering of the lipid hydrocarbon chains in the cytoplasmic membrane.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
identification and characterization of helveticin v-1829, a bacteriocin produced  by lactobacillus helveticus 1829.
lactobacillus helveticus 1829 produced an antimicrobial agent, designated helveticin v-1829, that demonstrated antagonistic activity against closely-related species. the agent was excreted into mrs agar, and was present in the supernatant fluids from both overnight broth and clotted milk cultures. it was heat labile (inactivated by 50 degrees c for 30 min) and was stable over the ph range 2.5 to 6.5. production of the substance was ph-dependent and maximum yields were obtained in mrs broth cultures maintained at ph 5.5. helveticin v-1829 was partially purified following growth of the producing strain in a semi-defined mrs medium and precipitating the cell-free filtrate with ammonium sulphate to 30% saturation. the cleared supernatant fluid was then brought to 60% saturation and the resulting precipitate pelleted and dialysed in 0.3 mol/l phosphate buffer. the partially purified inhibitor was sensitive to several proteolytic enzymes, and it was bactericidal in its mode of action against indicator cells of lact. helveticus 1844 and lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 1489, indicating that it was a bacteriocin. a dna probe specific for the helveticin j structural gene failed to hybridize to total genomic dna of lact. helveticus 1829, indicating that helveticin v-1829 is not significantly related to helveticin j.
[sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
sensitivity of 278 cultures of thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. it was shown that all cultures of l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii and 94.1 per cent of l. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. the cultures of l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.
