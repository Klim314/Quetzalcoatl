TI  == identification and characterization of the insertion element is1070 from leuconostoc lactis nz6009.
AB  == a novel insertion sequence, designated is1070, was identified on the lactose plasmid of leuconostoc lactis nz6009 by nucleotide sequence analysis. the 1027-bp sequence contains partially matched (24 of 28 bp) inverted repeats and has one long open reading frame. the deduced 305-amino-acid sequence demonstrated homology to transposases of is30 from escherichia coli, is4351 from bacteroides fragilis, is1086 from alcaligenes eutrophus, is1161 from streptococcus salivarius, isas2 from aeromonas salmonicida and a putative protein encoded by orf3 of virus spv1-r8a2 b from spiroplasma citri. at least fifteen is1070-like sequences were detected in the genome of the parent lc. lactis strain and five of these were situated on plasmids. analysis of the direct repeats of two of these copies with that of is1070 revealed differences in the target duplication lengths.
