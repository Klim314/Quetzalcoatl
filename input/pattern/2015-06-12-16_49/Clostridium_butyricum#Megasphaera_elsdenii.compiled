TI  - Impact of organic loading rate on biohydrogen production in an up-flow anaerobic  packed bed reactor (UAnPBR).
AB  - This study assesses the impact of organic loading rate on biohydrogen production  from glucose in an up-flow anaerobic packed bed reactor (UAnPBR). Two mesophilic UAPBRs (UAnPBR1 and 2) were tested at organic loading rates (OLRs) ranging from 6.5 to 51.4 g COD L(-1)d(-1). To overcome biomass washout, design modifications were made in the UAnPBR2 to include a settling zone to capture the detached biomass. The design modifications in UAnPBR2 increased the average hydrogen yield from 0.98 to 2.0 mol-H2 mol(-1)-glucose at an OLR of 25.7 g COD L(-1)d(-1). Although, a maximum hydrogen production rate of 23.4 +/- 0.9 L H2 L(-1)d(-1) was achieved in the UAnPBR2 at an OLR of 51.4 g COD L(-1)d(-1), the hydrogen yield dropped by 50% to around 1 mol-H2 mol(-1)-glucose. The microbiological analysis (PCR/DGGE) showed that the biohydrogen production was due to the presence of the hydrogen and volatile acid producers such as Clostridium beijerinckii, Clostridium butyricum, Megasphaera elsdenii and Propionispira arboris.
TI  - Inhibition of the autoxidation of ascorbate and norepinephrine by extracts of Clostridium butyricum, Megasphaera elsdenii and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The autoxidation of ascorbate and of norepinephrine in Krebs Ringer phosphate medium, pH 7.4, was studied. The autoxidation of the two substances was determined spectrophotometrically at 265 and 480 nm respectively. The effect of dialyzed extracts (m.w. greater than 12,000) from Escherichia coli (aerobe), Megasphaera elsdenii, and Clostridium butyricum (obligate anaerobes) was examined and compared to similarly prepared extracts from rat serum and cerebral cortex. The assay medium contained cellular components diluted 10(3)-10(6)-fold. Up to 10(4)-fold dilution there was a substantial reduction in the rate of both autoxidation reactions, but the preparations from M. elsdenii and C. butyricum were conspicuously less effective. After 5 min heat treatment at 100 degrees C the anaerobic preparations produced less than 20% inhibition, while the activity of the other preparations remained unchanged at 75-95% inhibition. These and earlier experiments involving additional mammalian species (Mishra and Kovachich, Neurosci. Lett., 43: 103-108, 1983) and plants (Mishra and Kovachich, Life Sci., 34: 2207-2212, 1984) suggest that a high level of heat-stable antioxidant activity in one or both of these autoxidation tests (denatured plant extracts only inhibit ascorbate autoxidation) is a general characteristic of organisms that thrive in oxygen-rich atmosphere.
