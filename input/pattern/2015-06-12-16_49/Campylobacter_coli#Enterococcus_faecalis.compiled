TI  - Estimation of cultivable bacterial diversity in the cloacae and pharynx in Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus).
AB  - In this work, we describe the biodiversity of cloacal and pharynx culture-based bacteria (commensal and pathogenic), in 75 Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) from two geographic areas. We address the question of whether the cultivable microbiota of vultures is organised into assemblages occurring by chance. In addition, we assess bacterial diversity in both anatomic regions and geographic areas. Bacterial diversity was represented by 26 Gram-negative and 20 Gram-positive genera. The most common genera were Escherichia, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Clostridium and Lactococcus. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis were the most common species in cloacal and pharyngeal samples. Staphylococcus and Erysipelothrix were isolated from the pharynx and Salmonella and Corynebacterium from the cloacae, and no Campylobacter was isolated from the cloacal swabs. Ten cloacal swabs were positive for Salmonella, of which five isolates were Salmonella enterica serotype 4,(5),12:i:-, one isolate was S. enterica serotype Derby, three isolates were S. enterica serotype 61:k:1,5,7 and one isolate was S. enterica serotype Infantis. The null modelling approach revealed that the commensal bacteria of vultures are not structured in assemblages. On the other hand, differences in bacterial genus and species richness between cloacal and pharyngeal samples or between geographic areas were clear, with the pharynx in vultures from both geographic areas being richer. The results of this study indicate also that vultures can serve as a reservoir of certain pathogenic zoonotic bacteria. The dissemination of these zoonotic pathogens in wildlife could be prevented by periodic sanitary surveys.
TI  - Experimental study of the impact of antimicrobial treatments on Campylobacter, Enterococcus and PCR-capillary electrophoresis single-strand conformation polymorphism profiles of the gut microbiota of chickens.
AB  - An experiment was conducted to compare the impact of antimicrobial treatments on  the susceptibility of Campylobacter, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, and on the diversity of broiler microbiota. Specific-pathogen-free chickens were first orally inoculated with strains of Campylobacter and Enterococcus faecium. Birds were then orally treated with recommended doses of oxytetracycline, sulfadimethoxine/trimethoprim, amoxicillin or enrofloxacin. Faecal samples were collected before, during and after antimicrobial treatment. The susceptibility of Campylobacter, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis strains isolated on supplemented or non-supplemented media was studied and PCR-capillary electrophoresis single-strand conformation polymorphism (CE-SSCP) profiles of the gut microbiota were analysed. Enrofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter were selected in the enrofloxacin-treated group and showed the Thr86Ile mutation in the gyrA gene. Acquisition of the tetO gene in Campylobacter coli isolates was significantly more frequent in birds given oxytetracycline. No impact of amoxicillin treatment on the susceptibility of Campylobacter could be detected. Ampicillin- and sulfadimethoxine/trimethoprim-resistant Enterococcus faecium were selected in amoxicillin-treated broilers, but no selection of the inoculated vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium could be detected, although it was also resistant to tetracycline and sulfadimethoxine/trimethoprim. PCR-CE-SSCP revealed significant variations in a few peaks in treated birds as compared with non-treated chickens. In conclusion, antimicrobial treatments perturbed chicken gut microbiota, and certain antimicrobial treatments selected or co-selected resistant strains of Campylobacter and Enterococcus.
TI  - Intestinal microbiota and species diversity of Campylobacter and Helicobacter spp. in migrating shorebirds in Delaware Bay.
AB  - Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we examined the bacterial diversity and  the presence of opportunistic bacterial pathogens (i.e., Campylobacter and Helicobacter) in red knot (Calidris canutus; n = 40), ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres; n = 35), and semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla; n = 22) fecal samples collected during a migratory stopover in Delaware Bay. Additionally, we studied the occurrence of Campylobacter spp., enterococci, and waterfowl fecal source markers using quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays. Of 3,889 16S rRNA clone sequences analyzed, the bacterial community was mostly composed of Bacilli (63.5%), Fusobacteria (12.7%), Epsilonproteobacteria (6.5%), and Clostridia (5.8%). When epsilonproteobacterium-specific 23S rRNA gene clone libraries (i.e., 1,414 sequences) were analyzed, the sequences were identified as Campylobacter (82.3%) or Helicobacter (17.7%) spp. Specifically, 38.4%, 10.1%, and 26.0% of clone sequences were identified as C. lari (>99% sequence identity) in ruddy turnstone, red knot, and semipalmated sandpiper clone libraries, respectively. Other pathogenic species of Campylobacter, such as C. jejuni and C. coli, were not detected in excreta of any of the three bird species. Most Helicobacter-like sequences identified were closely related to H. pametensis (>99% sequence identity) and H. anseris (92% sequence identity). qPCR results showed that the occurrence and abundance of Campylobacter spp. was relatively high compared to those of fecal indicator bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp., E. faecalis, and Catellicoccus marimammalium. Overall, the results provide insights into the complexity of the shorebird gut microbial community and suggest that these migratory birds are important reservoirs of pathogenic Campylobacter species.
TI  - Food-borne zoonotic pathogens and antimicrobial resistance of indicator bacteria  in urban wild boars in Barcelona, Spain.
AB  - Wildlife is increasingly abundant in urban environments, but little is known about the zoonotic pathogens carried by these populations. Urban wild boars are of particular concern because this species is well-known as a pathogen reservoir, and thus, we studied selected zoonotic pathogens in urban wild boars in Barcelona, Spain (n=41). Salmonella enterica was found in 5.00% (95% CI 0.61-16.91) and Campylobacter coli in 4.88% (95% CI 0.6-16.53) of the animals. E. coli O157:H7 and C. jejuni were not found. Other thermophilic Campylobacter were moderately prevalent (19.51%, 95% CI 8.82-34.87). Additionally, we screened for antimicrobial resistance in indicator bacteria: resistance was most frequent in Enterococcus faecium (95% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (50%) and Escherichia coli (10%). For the first time resistance to linezolid in bacteria carried by wildlife is reported. These findings pose a concern for public health, and thus, further research is needed on wildlife in urban environments.
TI  - Screening for lactic acid bacteria capable of inhibiting Campylobacter jejuni in  in vitro simulations of the broiler chicken caecal environment.
AB  - Thermotolerant Campylobacter spp., specifically Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, are the most common bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis in developed countries. Consumption of improperly prepared poultry products and cross contamination are among the main causes of human campylobacteriosis. The aim of this study was to identify lactic acid bacterial (LAB) strains capable of inhibiting C. jejuni growth in initial in vitro trials ('spot-on-lawn' method), as well as in batch fermentation studies mimicking the broiler caecal environment. These experiments served as an indication for using these strains to decrease the capability of Campylobacter to colonise and grow in the chicken caeca during primary production, with the aim of reducing the number of human campylobacteriosis cases. A total of 1,150 LAB strains were screened for anti-Campylobacter activity. Six strains were selected: members of the species Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus agilis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus salivarius, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. After treatment with catalase, proteinase K and a-chymotrypsin, anti-Campylobacter activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid (CSF) for all six strains was retained, which indicated that activity was probably not exerted by bacteriocin production. Based on the activity found in CSF, the compounds produced by the selected strains are secreted and do not require presence of live bacterial producer cells for activity. During initial in vitro fermentation experiments, the E. faecalis strain exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for C. jejuni and was selected for further fermentation experiments. In these experiments we tested for therapeutic or protective effects of the E. faecalis strain against C. jejuni MB 4185 infection under simulated broiler caecal growth conditions. The best inhibition results were obtained when E. faecalis was inoculated before the C. jejuni strain, lowering C. jejuni counts at least one log compared to a positive control. This effect was already observed 6 h after C. jejuni inoculation.
TI  - Fate of pathogens in a simulated bioreduction system for livestock carcasses.
AB  - The EU Animal By-Products Regulations generated the need for novel methods of storage and disposal of dead livestock. Bioreduction prior to rendering or incineration has been proposed as a practical and potentially cost-effective method; however, its biosecurity characteristics need to be elucidated. To address this, Salmonella enterica (serovars Senftenberg and Poona), Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli and a lux-marked strain of Escherichia coli O157 were inoculated into laboratory-scale bioreduction vessels containing sheep carcass constituents. Numbers of all pathogens and the metabolic activity of E. coli O157 decreased significantly within the liquor waste over time, and only E. faecalis remained detectable after 3months. Only very low numbers of Salmonella spp. and E. faecalis were detected in bioaerosols, and only at initial stages of the trial. These results further indicate that bioreduction represents a suitable method of storing and reducing the volume of livestock carcasses prior to ultimate disposal.
TI  - Identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against Campylobacter.
AB  - Bacteriocins produced by Lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control Campylobacter and Salmonella in live poultry. This finding is of relevance since Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. In the present work, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from the cecum of twenty Tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against Campylobacter were further characterized. Following their preliminary confirmation as LAB, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16S- 23S PCR, specific lactobacilli PCR, and a biphasic approach. Most of the LAB isolated belonged to the genus Lactobacillus, among them Lb. sakei (33.3%), Lb. salivarius (19.4%), Lb. reuteri (8.6%), and Lb. curvatus (8.6%). The other LAB strains included those of the genus Weissella (16.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), Lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and Streptococcus sp. (2.7%). The Lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against C. jejuni and C. coli. The activity of three of them, Lb. salivarius SMXD51, Lb. salivarius MMS122, and Lb. salivarius MMS151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.
TI  - Screening of Australian plants for antimicrobial activity against Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of acute enteritis in humans, with  symptoms such as diarrhoea, fever and abdominal cramps. In this study, 115 extracts from 109 Australian plant species were investigated for their antimicrobial activities against two C. jejuni strains using an in vitro broth microdilution assay. Among the plants tested, 107 (93%) extracts showed activity at a concentration between 32 and 1024 microg/mL against at least one C. jejuni strain. Seventeen plant extracts were selected for further testing against another six C. jejuni strains, as well as Campylobacter coli, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis. The extract from Eucalyptus occidentalis demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with an inhibitory concentration of 32 microg/mL against C. jejuni and B. cereus. This study has shown that extracts of selected Australian plants possess antimicrobial activity against C. jejuni and thus may have application in the control of this organism in live poultry and retail poultry products.
TI  - A DNA array based assay for the characterization of microbial community in raw milk.
AB  - An oligonucleotide array based on PCR method containing a combination of probes for taxonomic markers and species-specific virulence genes was developed for the simultaneous identification of 14 Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and food-borne pathogenic bacteria in raw milk. The hypervariable regions V3 and V6 of 16S, together with a variable region of 23S rRNA genes and several genes specific for virulence factors were selected. Universal primers and multiplex PCR were used for the rapid differentiation of bacterial species and low concentration of specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were detected in milk. The dominant species such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, andLeuconostoc lactis were identified by indirect-labelling reactions based upon incorporation of amino-allyl dUTPs. The results regarding food-borne pathogens detection showed highly specific hybridisation patterns with the genomic DNA from Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella thyphimurium, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica. A clear differentiation of dominant species present in a complex microbial community such as raw milk was achieved by the application of short oligonucleotide probes which discriminate sequences differing by few nucleotides.
TI  - Backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments and secondary-structure of the conserved hypothetical protein HP0892 of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - HP0892 (SwissProt/TrEMBL ID O25552) is a 90-residue conserved hypothetical protein from Helicobacter pylori strain 26695, with a calculated pI of 9.38 and a molecular mass of 10.41 kDa. It belongs to the Plasmid stabilization system protein family (PF05016) in the Pfam database. Proteins with sequence similarity to HP0892 exist in Vibrio choierae, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter jejuni, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli O157. Here we report the sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments of HP0892 using multidimentional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. About 97.0% (422/ 435) of the HN, N, CO, C Alpha , C Beta resonances of 90 residues of HP0892 were assigned. On the basis of the resonance assignments, three helical regions and four strand regions were identified using the CSI program. This study is a prerequisite for calculating the solution structure of HP0892, and will be useful for studying its interaction with other molecules.
TI  - Evaluation of the enteric microflora of captive whooping cranes (Grus americana)  and sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis).
AB  - The enteric flora of captive whooping cranes (Grus americana) and sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) has not been well described, despite its potential importance in the understanding of both the normal condition of the intestinal physiology of these animals and the altered colonization within disease states in these birds. Nineteen whooping cranes and 23 sandhill cranes housed currently at the Calgary Zoo or its affiliated Devonian Wildlife Conservation Centre (DWCC) in Calgary, Alberta were sampled from October 2004-February 2005 by collecting aerobic and anaerobic cloacal swabs from each bird. There were seven major groupings of bacteria isolated from both species of crane. Gram-positive cocci, coliforms, and gram-negative bacilli were the most prevalent types of bacteria isolated for both crane species, with Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus Group D, not Enterococcus the bacterial species isolated most commonly. There was a significant difference in the average number of isolates per individual between the two crane species but no differences between age or gender categories within crane species. Campylobacter sp. were isolated from five whooping cranes. The potential zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from one whooping crane and C. upsaliensis was isolated from a second. Three other isolates were unspeciated members of the Campylobacter genus and likely belong to a species undescribed previously. The evaluation of the enteric cloacal flora of whooping cranes and sandhill cranes illustrates that differences exist between these two closely related crane species, and highlights the potential implications these differences may have for current practices involving captive wildlife.

TI  - Microbial drug efflux proteins of the major facilitator superfamily.
AB  - Drug efflux proteins are widespread amongst microorganisms, including pathogens.  They can contribute to both natural insensitivity to antibiotics and to emerging antibiotic resistance and so are potential targets for the development of new antibacterial drugs. The design of such drugs would be greatly facilitated by knowledge of the structures of these transport proteins, which are poorly understood, because of the difficulties of obtaining crystals of quality. We describe a structural genomics approach for the amplified expression, purification and characterisation of prokaryotic drug efflux proteins of the 'Major Facilitator Superfamily' (MFS) of transport proteins from Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Brucella melitensis, Campylobacter jejuni, Neisseria meningitides and Streptomyces coelicolor. The H. pylori putative drug resistance protein, HP1092, and the S. aureus QacA proteins are used as detailed examples. This strategy is an important step towards reproducible production of transport proteins for the screening of drug binding and for optimisation of crystallisation conditions to enable subsequent structure determination.
TI  - Detection and identification of intestinal pathogenic bacteria by hybridization to oligonucleotide microarrays.
AB  - AIM: To detect the common intestinal pathogenic bacteria quickly and accurately.  METHODS: A rapid (<3 h) experimental procedure was set up based upon the gene chip technology. Target genes were amplified and hybridized by oligonucleotide microarrays. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy strains of bacteria in pure culture belonging to 11 genera were successfully discriminated under comparatively same conditions, and a series of specific hybridization maps corresponding to each kind of bacteria were obtained. When this method was applied to 26 divided cultures, 25 (96.2%) were identified. CONCLUSION: Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus sp., Bacillus cereus, Vibrio cholerae, Enterococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni can be detected and identified by our microarrays. The accuracy, range, and discrimination power of this assay can be continually improved by adding further oligonucleotides to the arrays without any significant increase of complexity or cost.
TI  - Backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments and secondary-structure of conserved hypothetical protein HP0894 from Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - HP0894 (SwissProt/TrEMBL ID O25554) is an 88-residue conserved hypothetical protein from Helicobacter pylori strain 26695 with a calculated pI of 8.5 and a molecular weight of 10.38 kDa. Proteins with sequence similarity to HP0894 exist in Vibrio choierae, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter jejuni, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli O157, etc. Here we report the sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments of HP0894. About 97.5% (418/429) of the HN, N, CO, Ca, Cbeta resonances of the 88 residues of HP0894 were assigned. On the basis of these assignments, three helical regions and four strand regions were identified using the CSI program. This study is a prerequisite for calculating the solution structure of HP0894, and studying its interaction with its substrates, if any, and/or with other proteins.
TI  - Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., verocytotoxic Escherichia coli, and antibiotic resistance in indicator organisms in wild cervids.
AB  - Faecal samples were collected, as part of the National Health Surveillance Program for Cervids (HOP) in Norway, from wild red deer, roe deer, moose and reindeer during ordinary hunting seasons from 2001 to 2003. Samples from a total of 618 animals were examined for verocytotoxic E. coli (VTEC); 611 animals for Salmonella and 324 animals for Campylobacter. A total of 50 samples were cultivated from each cervid species in order to isolate the indicator bacterial species E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis / E. faecium for antibiotic resistance pattern studies. Salmonella and the potentially human pathogenic verocytotoxic E. coli were not isolated, while Campylobacter jejuni jejuni was found in one roe deer sample only. Antibiotic resistance was found in 13 (7.3%) of the 179 E. coli isolates tested, eight of these being resistant against one type of antibiotic only. The proportion of resistant E. coli isolates was higher in wild reindeer (24%) than in the other cervids (2.2%). E. faecalis or E. faecium were isolated from 19 of the samples, none of these being reindeer. All the strains isolated were resistant against one (84%) or more (16%) antibiotics. A total of 14 E. faecalis-strains were resistant to virginiamycin only. The results indicate that the cervid species studied do not constitute an important infectious reservoir for either the human pathogens or the antibiotic resistant microorganisms included in the study.
TI  - Active membrane transport and receptor proteins from bacteria.
AB  - A general strategy for the expression of bacterial membrane transport and receptor genes in Escherichia coli is described. Expression is amplified so that the encoded proteins comprise 5-35% of E. coli inner membrane protein. Depending upon their topology, proteins are produced with RGSH6 or a Strep tag at the C-terminus. These enable purification in mg quantities for crystallization and NMR studies. Examples of one nutrient uptake and one multidrug extrusion protein from Helicobacter pylori are described. This strategy is successful for membrane proteins from H. pylori, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Microbacterium liquefaciens, Brucella abortus, Brucella melitensis, Campylobacter jejuni, Neisseria meningitides, Streptomyces coelicolor and Rhodobacter sphaeroides.
TI  - Analysis of the prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes in clinical isolates  of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in a Japanese hospital.
AB  - Prevalence of seven tetracycline resistance (TC(R)) genes--tet(L), tet(M), tet(K), tet(O), tet(S), tet(T), and tet(U)--which are known to be distributed to gram-positive cocci was analyzed for 224 Enterococcus faecalis and 46 Enterococcus faecium clinical isolates obtained in a Japanese hospital. Any of the TC(R) genes was detected in 75.9% of all the enterococcal strains. The tet(M) was detected at highest rates in both E. faecalis (75.0%) and E. faecium (69.6%), followed by tet(L), which was harbored in 6.7% of E. faecalis isolates and 30.4% of E. faecium isolates. The tet(O), tet(S), and tet(T) were detected in E. faecalis at low frequencies mostly associated with tet(M), while tet(K) and tet(U) were not detected. Nucleotide sequences of tet(S) from E. faecalis strains were identical to that reported in Listeria monocytogenes. Sequences of tet(O) from two E. faecalis strains were almost identical to each other and also to those from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Campylobacter jejuni, and Campylobacter coli, although minor sequence divergence was observed. The tet(T), which had been reported only in Streptococcus pyogenes, was found in five E. faecalis strains. Sequence of the enterococcal tet(T) differed from that of S. pyogenes by only four nucleotides (four amino acids) and showed high sequence identity (99.8%, amino acid level). Enterococcal strains with any one TC(R) gene or those with two TC(R) genes showed generally similar MICs of tetracyclines, and no evident difference in resistance level was observed.
TI  - Effect of the growth promoter avilamycin on emergence and persistence of antimicrobial resistance in enteric bacteria in the pig.
AB  - AIM: To assess the effect of the growth promoter avilamycin on emergence and persistence of resistance in enteric bacteria in the pig. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pigs (treated with avilamycin for 3 months and controls) were challenged with multi-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 and faecal counts were performed for enterococci, Escherichia coli, S. Typhimurium and Campylobacter (before, during and 5 weeks post-treatment). Representative isolates were tested for antibiotic resistance and for the presence of resistance genes. Avilamycin-resistant Enterococci faecalis (speciated by PCR) were isolated from the treated pigs and continued to be detected for the first week after treatment had ceased. The avilamycin-resistance gene was characterized by PCR as the emtA gene and speciation by PCR. MIC profiling confirmed that more than one strain of Ent. faecalis carried this gene. There was no evidence of increased antimicrobial resistance in the E. coli, Salmonella and Campylobacter populations, although there was a higher incidence of tetB positive E. coli in the treated pigs than the controls. CONCLUSION: Although avilamycin selects for resistance in the native enterococci population of the pig, no resistant isolates were detected beyond 1 week post-treatment. This suggests that resistant isolates were unable to persist once selective pressure was removed and were out-competed by the sensitive microflora. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our data suggest the risk of resistant isolates becoming carcass contaminants and infecting humans could be minimized by introducing a withdrawal period after using avilamycin and prior to slaughter.
TI  - [Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study].
AB  - Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study. Between January and December 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the Bact-Alert system (14,960 FAN aerobics, 3,855 FAN anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 FAN pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of Buenos Aires city, one of La Plata city and three of the Buenos Aires province. A total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. Only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (Staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; Enterococcus faecalis 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae 2; Campylobacter spp 1; Escherichia coli 1; Enterobacter cloacae 1; Enterobacteraerogenes 1; Citrobacter freundii 1; Klebsiella pneumoniae 1; Proteus mirabilis 1; Serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of Cryptococcus neoformans). Of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the anaerobic standard (65% were Propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the FAN aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% Bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by FAN pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and 1.4% by FAN anaerobic bottle. Our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the Bact-Alert system is unnecessary.
TI  - Optimization of PCR-based methods for rapid detection of Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli and Yersinia enterocolitica serovar 0:3 in wastewater samples.
AB  - PCR-based methods were evaluated for their adequacy to assess the removal of pathogens from wastewater samples. For the development and optimization of the methods, samples were taken at two different sites from two different constructed wetlands. Campylobacter jejuni/coli and Yersinia enterocolitica serogroup 0:3 were selected as model pathogens and Enterococcus faecalis as a standard microbiological indicator. The chosen PCR protocols were optimized for wastewater DNA extracts in order to obtain high sensitivity and reproducibility independently of the background flora. All PCR protocols were successfully performed and reproducible with a background of up to 10(10) nontarget cells per reaction. Five cells of Y. enterocolitica, 50 cells of C. jejuni/coli, and 500 cells of E. faecalis per 100ml treated water could be detected. The method detection limit in the settled wastewater was higher: 200 cells per 100ml for Y. enterocolitica, 2000 cells per 100ml for C. jejuni/coli, and 20,000 cells per 100ml for E. faecalis. C. jejuni/coli and Y. enterocolitica PCRs were adapted to municipal wastewater, with higher loads of potential PCR inhibitors. Sensitivity was lower for this type of wastewater: 200 cells of Y. enterocolitica and 2000 cells of C. jejuni/coli were detected per 100ml treated wastewater, 2500 cells of Y. enterocolitica and 25,000 cells of C. jejuni/coli per 100ml settled wastewater. The developed PCR methods enable the detection of C. jejuni/coli, Y. enterocolitica serogroup 0:3 and E. faecalis within 12h. They show specificity, reproducibility and low detection limits for the investigated pathogens.
TI  - Molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  - Plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to E. faecalis JH2-2, Lactococcus lactis Bu2, and Listeria innocua L19. Its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (Plasmid 46 (2001) 170). The gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pIP501 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Erythromycin resistance is due to a 23S ribosomal RNA methyl transferase, again as found in pIP501 (ermB). The aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon Tn5405 of Staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). Identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. pRE25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pIP501. Of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsB, traC, trsF, trsJ, and trsL). The enterococcal part is joined into the pIP501 part by insertion elements IS1216V of E. faecium Tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of IS1062 (E. faecalis) and IS1485 (E. faecium). pRE25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.
TI  - Diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on Helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  - Among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (AA) is one of the most important. AA has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on Helicobacter pylori. However, there are limited studies on the possible role of AA and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (PA) on the growth and survival of H. pylori. In the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that AA in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mM) inhibited H. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. In contrast, under aerobic conditions AA in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mM) significantly increased the survival of H. pylori presumably eliminating the toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. The hydrophobic derivative of AA, PA (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mM). This effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium sporogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. Among these bacterial strains, PA showed a similar inhibitory effect on B. cereus and B. subtilis as observed with H. pylori. The results suggest that PA may be considered an important AA derivative in eradication of H. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.
TI  - Small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  - Taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. Importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. Here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. Large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two S. aureus libraries, highly representative. Consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. The use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in animals.
AB  - There is currently no systematic surveillance or monitoring of antibiotic resistance in Australian animals. Registration of antibiotics for use in animals is tightly controlled and has been very conservative. Fluoroquinolones have not been registered for use in food producing animals and other products have been removed from the market because of human health concerns. In the late 1970s, the Animal Health Committee coordinated a survey of resistance in Salmonella and Escherichia coli isolates from cattle, pigs and poultry and in bovine Staphylococcus aureus. Some additional information is available from published case reports. In samples collected prior to the withdrawal of avoparcin from the market, no vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium or Enterococcus faecalis were detected in samples collected from pigs, whereas some vanA enterococci, including E. faecium and E. faecalis, were found in chickens. No vanB enterococci were detected in either species. Virginiamycin resistance was common in both pig and poultry isolates. Multiple resistance was common in E. coli and salmonellae isolates. No fluoroquinolone resistance was found in salmonellae, E. coli or Campylobacter. Beta-lactamase production is common in isolates from bovine mastitis, but no methicillin resistance has been detected. However, methicillin resistance has been reported in canine isolates of Staphylococcus intermedius and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli has been found in dogs.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of intestinal bacteria from Swiss poultry flocks before the ban of antimicrobial growth promoters.
AB  - From the crop and the caecum of Swiss broilers slaughtered between November 1997  and January 1998, Escherichia coli, enterococci, staphylococci, lactobacilli and Campylobacter species were isolated. After identification to the genus or species level, their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) for several clinically used antimicrobial agents were determined with the E-Test stripes and compared to those from studies in other European countries. All strains of Enterococcus faecalis (n = 38), E. faecium (27), staphylococci (n = 39) and lactobacilli (n = 14) showed a hundred percent resistance against bacitracin which was included in the feed of the mother animals, but not in the feed of the investigated animals. E.coli strains (n = 60) showed higher resistance incidences than in comparable studies from Finland and Denmark, but lower than those in studies from Italy and Germany. In staphylococci, low resistance rates were observed. A high susceptibility of the 13 Campylobacter jejuni strains was found against therapeutically used antimicrobials. These data can be used as a baseline to determine antibiotic resistance rates after implementation of the growth promotor ban in 1999 in Switzerland.
TI  - Use of oleic acid to reduce the population of the bacterial flora of poultry skin.
AB  - The effect of oleic acid on native bacterial flora of poultry skin was examined.  Skin from commercial broiler carcasses was washed once or twice in solutions of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10% (wt/vol) oleic acid and rinsed in peptone water. Aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacter, and enterococci in the rinsates were enumerated. Significantly fewer aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacter, and enterococci were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in oleic acid than from control samples. Additionally, fewer bacteria were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in higher concentrations of oleic acid than from skin washed in lower concentrations of the fatty acid. In most cases, there was no significant difference in the number of bacteria recovered from rinsates of skin washed once or twice in solutions of oleic acid. Washing skin samples twice in 10% solutions of oleic acid significantly reduced the number of aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacter, and enterococci that remained attached to the skin. Campylobacter sp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes isolates possessed the least resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid in vitro, while Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed higher resistance. Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus lentus, and Salmonella Typhimurium had the greatest resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid. Findings indicate that oleic acid reduces the number of bacteria on the skin of processed broilers and that the fatty acid is bactericidal to several spoilage and pathogenic bacteria associated with poultry.
TI  - In-vitro activity of moxifloxacin against fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of aerobic gram-negative bacilli and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - MICs of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, and those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin for 19 genetically characterized fluoroquinolone-resistant strains were determined by the agar dilution method. The MICs of moxifloxacin for Escherichia isolates with one mutation in gyrA (corresponding to Ser83-->Leu or Asp87-->Gly substitution) were 0.25-0.5 mg/L, while those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin were 0.06-0.25, 1 and 0.12-0.5 mg/L, respectively. These values were four- to 16-fold higher than those of the same antibiotics for the wild-type strain, E. coli KL16. Similar results were observed with clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. harbouring one mutation in gyrA leading to the substitution of Ser83 by Phe or Tyr. In the presence of two mutations in the E. coli gyrA gene, the MICs of moxifloxacin ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin were 2, 0.5, 4 and 1 mg/L, respectively; these were 32 times higher than the MICs of these agents for E. coli KL16. The MICs of the four quinolones for triple mutants with two mutations in gyrA and one in parC were even higher, i.e. 8, 8, 16 and 8-16 mg/L, respectively. The MICs of moxifloxacin for Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni strains with a gyrA mutation leading to Thr86-->Ile substitution ranged from 1 to 2 mg/L, while the MICs of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin were 16-32 mg/L, 8-16 and 4-8 mg/L, respectively. For high-level ciprofloxacin-resistant (MICs of 32 mg/L) clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis with one substitution at position 83 in GyrA (E. coli coordinates), the MICs of moxifloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin were 8-16, > or = 128 and 32 mg/L respectively. In conclusion, moxifloxacin and other fluoroquinolones exhibit cross-resistance against aerobic gram-negative bacilli and enterococci. The in-vitro activity of moxifloxacin was greater than that of ofloxacin and slightly less than that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, but greater than those of the three other compounds tested against Campylobacter spp and E. faecalis.
TI  - Resistance to antimicrobial agents used for animal therapy in pathogenic-, zoonotic- and indicator bacteria isolated from different food animals in Denmark: a baseline study for the Danish Integrated Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring Programme (DANMAP).
AB  - This study describes the establishment and first results of a continuous surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria isolated from pigs, cattle and broilers in Denmark. The three categories of bacteria tested were: 1) indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (Campylobacter coli/jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus hyicus, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). A total of 3304 bacterial isolates collected from October 1995 through December 1996 were tested for susceptibility to all major classes of antimicrobial agents used for therapy in Denmark. Bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. Acquired resistance to all antimicrobials was found. The occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. In general, resistance was observed more frequently among isolates from pigs than from cattle and broilers. The association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed, as is the occurrence of resistance in other countries. The results of this study show the present level of resistance to antimicrobial agents among a number of bacterial species isolated from food animals in Denmark. Thus, the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies has been established, enabling the determination of trends over time.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from food animals to antimicrobial growth promoters and related therapeutic agents in Denmark.
AB  - This study was conducted to describe the occurrence of acquired resistance to antimicrobials used for growth promotion among bacteria isolated from swine, cattle and poultry in Denmark. Resistance to structurally related therapeutic agents was also examined. Three categories of bacteria were tested: 1) indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus hyicus, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). All antimicrobials used as growth promoters in Denmark and some structurally related therapeutic agents (in brackets) were included: Avilamycin, avoparcin (vancomycin), bacitracin, carbadox, flavomycin, monensin, olaquindox, salinomycin, spiramycin (erythromycin, lincomycin), tylosin (erythromycin, lincomycin), and virginiamycin (pristinamycin). Bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. Breakpoints for growth promoters were established by population distribution of the bacteria tested. A total of 2,372 bacterial isolates collected during October 1995 to September 1996 were included in the study. Acquired resistance to all currently used growth promoting antimicrobials was found. A frequent occurrence of resistance were observed to avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavomycin, spiramycin, tylosin and virginiamycin, whereas resistance to carbadox, monensin, olaquindox and salinomycin was less frequent. The occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. The highest levels of resistance was observed among enterococci, whereas less resistance was observed among zoonotic bacteria and bacteria pathogenic to animals. The association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed. The results show the present level of resistance to growth promoters in bacteria from food animals in Denmark. They will form the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies, thereby enabling the determination of trends over time.
TI  - Sepsis in children with human immunodeficiency virus infection. The Madrid HIV Pediatric Infection Collaborative Study Group.
AB  - The aims of this retrospective study were to review the frequency and patterns of bacterial sepsis in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The charts of 233 human immunodeficiency virus-infected children cared for during a 10-year period in 4 tertiary hospitals in Madrid were reviewed. There were 43 episodes of sepsis in 31 (13%) children. Twenty of them had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 10 were class PA2 and 1 was class P1B. The most common organisms recovered were: nontyphoidal Salmonella, 10 cases (23%); Streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 cases (21%); Staphylococcus epidermidis, 6 cases (14%); Escherichia coli, 5 cases (12%); Enterococcus faecalis, 4 cases (9%); Campylobacter jejuni, 2 cases (5%). In 28 episodes of bacteremia there were other sites of associated infection: pneumonia, 6 cases; urinary tract infection (UTI), 5 cases; gastrointestinal disease, 4 cases; catheter-related bacteremia, 12 cases. Eight patients had more than 1 episode of bacteremia. The rate of complications was high: 6 children had septic shock; and 2 of them developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. There was 1 death directly related to sepsis.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - Determination of the chromosomal size of three different strains of Enterococcus  faecalis and one strain of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the chromosomal size of three different strains of Enterococcus faecalis and one strain of Enterococcus faecium. The size determinations of OG1X, a strain of E. faecalis widely used in many laboratories for genetic studies, using Sma I, Not I, and Sfi I alone or in combination, ranged from 2,750 to 2,761 kb. Using the same enzymes as with OG1X, the size of HH-67, a plasmid-free clinical isolate of E. faecalis, was determined to be 2,170-2,288 kb and the size of JH2-2, an E. faecalis recipient strain, ranged from 2,008 to 2,135 kb. The size range generated for GE-1, a plasmid-free E. faecium strain, with the use of Sma I, Not I, and Apa I was 2,045-2,155 kb. Although OG1X differed in size from the other three enterococci, each individual enterococcal strain generated reproducible results in different experiments. However, for both E. faecalis OG1X and E. faecium GE-1, one of the enzymes used generated a considerably smaller molecular size than that generated by the other two enzymes. The discrepancy was due to visually undiscernible comigrating fragments, and serves to point out a potential source of error if fewer than two enzymes are used to size a genome. The size discrepancies were resolved by digesting individual fragments with a second enzyme. The molecular sizes of these enterococcal strains are larger than that recently reported for Campylobacter, smaller than that of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and similar (OG1X) or smaller (JH2-2, HH67, and GE-1) than the 2,819-kb reported for Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  - In order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (OFLX) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. The following conclusions were reached. 1. Comparison of the MIC distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of OFLX-resistant isolates with the passage of time of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella ssp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Most common elevations of MIC values against these bacteria were observed in MIC80 and MIC90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in MIC50 values. However, MIC50's of OFLX against Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. Most of the OFLX-resistant strains of S. aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA). Furthermore, MIC80 of OFLX against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. Susceptibility of Streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. The results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. Bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of OFLX-resistant strains even in 1990 were Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. 4. Recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of OFLX-resistant strains among many bacteria. However, the bacteria which contained high percentages of OFLX-resistant strains except for MRSA were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of MIC values were only observed in MIC80 and MIC90. These results suggested that OFLX preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. In this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated antimicrobials. Lomefloxacin was very active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). In common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Legionella spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Vibrio spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of Bacteroides spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) or Clostridium difficile MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of Clostridium perfringens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Mycoplasma hominis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), and Urea-plasma urealyticum (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the MIC with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the MIC. These results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant of the pneumococcal transposon Tn1545: evolutionary relationships and transcriptional analysis of aphA-3 genes.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant aphA-3 encoded by transposon Tn1545 from Streptococcus pneumoniae was determined and compared to those of plasmids pJH1 and pIP1433 from Streptococcus faecalis and Campylobacter coli, respectively. The three sequences were found to be identical and differed by two substitutions and the deletion of a codon from that of plasmid pSH2 from Staphylococcus aureus. Comparison of the 5' noncoding sequences indicated that the regions containing the aphA-3 gene in pJH1 and in Tn1545 evolved independently by deletion from a sequence similar to that found in pIP1433. In the latter plasmid, aphA-3 is transcribed from a promoter, P1, which is flanked by two 12-base pair direct repeats. The rearrangement observed in pJH1 removed one of these recombinogenic sites and altered the -10 and 3' flanking sequences of P1. The promoter thus generated. P1', allows expression of similar level of kanamycin resistance as P1. However, fusion experiments carried out with a promotorless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene indicated that the canonical promoter P1 is significantly less efficient than P1'. From analysis of the thermodynamic properties of these promoters, we conclude that this difference in strength reflects the melting properties of the -10 sequences. The transition from pIP1433 to pJH1 may correspond to the progression of a molecule structurally unstable to a more stable one combined with the need to maintain an efficient promoter upstream of the aphA-3 gene. The deletion event in Tn1545, which occurred between the two 12-base pair directly repeated sequences, removed P1 in its entirety.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
