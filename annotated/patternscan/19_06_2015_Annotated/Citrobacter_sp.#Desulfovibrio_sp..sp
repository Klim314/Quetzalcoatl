TI  == the effect of heavy metals on microbial community structure of a sulfidogenic consortium in anaerobic semi-continuous stirred tank reactors.
AB  == the effect of heavy metals on community structure of a heavy metal tolerant sulfidogenic consortium was evaluated by using a combination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene and dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsrb) gene fragments, 16s rrna gene cloning analysis and fluorescence  in situ hybridization (fish). for this purpose, four anaerobic semi-continuous stirred tank reactors (referred as r1-r4) were run in parallel for 12 weeks at heavy metal loading rates of 1.5, 3, 4.5 and 7.5 mg l(-1) d(-1) each of cu(2+), ni(2+), zn(2+), and cr(6+), respectively. the abundance ratio of desulfovibrio vulgaris detected by fish to total cell counts was consistent with the obtained results of cloning and dgge. this indicated that d. vulgaris was dominant in all  analyzed samples and played a key role in heavy metal removal in r1, r2, and r3.  in contrast, after 4 weeks of operation of r4, a distinct biomass loss was observed and no positive hybridized cells were detected by specific probes for the domain bacteria, sulfate-reducing bacteria and d. vulgris. high removal efficiencies of heavy metals were achieved in r1, r2 and r3 after 12 weeks, whereas the precipitation of heavy metals in r4 was significantly decreased after 4 weeks and almost not observed after 6 weeks of operation. in addition, the anaerobic bacteria, such as pertrimonas sulfuriphila, clostridium sp., citrobacter amalonaticus, and klebsiella sp., identified from dgge bands and clone library were hypothesized as heavy metal resistant bacteria at a loading rate of 1.5 mg l(-1) d(-1) of cu(2+), ni(2+), zn(2+), and cr(6+.)

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of tce-dechlorinating consortia enriched on a variety of electron donors.
AB  == two rapidly fermented electron donors, lactate and methanol, and two slowly fermented electron donors, propionate and butyrate, were selected for enrichment  studies to evaluate the characteristics of anaerobic microbial consortia that reductively dechlorinate tce to ethene. each electron donor enrichment subculture demonstrated the ability to dechlorinate tce to ethene through several serial transfers. microbial community analyses based upon 16s rdna, including terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) and clone library/sequencing, were performed to assess major changes in microbial community structure associated with electron donors capable of stimulating reductive dechlorination.  results demonstrated that five phylogenic subgroups or genera of bacteria were present in all consortia, including dehalococcoides sp., low g+c gram-positives (mostly clostridium and eubacterium sp.), bacteroides sp., citrobacter sp., and delta proteobacteria (mostly desulfovibrio sp.). phylogenetic association indicates that only minor shifts in the microbial community structure occurred between the four alternate electron donor enrichments and the parent consortium.  inconsistent detection of dehalococcoides spp. in clone libraries and t-rflp of enrichment subcultures was resolved using quantitative polymerase chain reaction  (q-pcr). q-pcr with primers specific to dehalococcoides 16s rdna resulted in positive detection of this species in all enrichments. our results suggest that tce-dechlorinating consortia can be stably maintained on a variety of electron donors and that quantities of dehalococcoides cells detected with dehalococcoides specific 16s rdna primer/probe sets do not necessarily correlate well with solvent degradation rates.
