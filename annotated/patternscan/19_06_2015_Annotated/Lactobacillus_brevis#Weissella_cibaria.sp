TI  == three-phase succession of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria to reach a stable ecosystem within seven days of natural bamboo shoot fermentation as revealed by different molecular approaches.
AB  == microbial community structure and population dynamics during spontaneous bamboo shoot fermentation for production of 'soidon' (indigenous fermented food) in north east india were studied using cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent molecular approaches. cultivation-dependent analyzes (pcr amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis and rrna gene sequencing) and cultivation-independent analyzes (pcr-dgge, qpcr and illumina amplicon sequencing) were conducted on the time series samples collected from three independent indigenous soidon fermentation batches. the current findings revealed three-phase succession of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria to attain a stable ecosystem within 7 days natural fermentation of bamboo shoots. weissella spp. (weissella cibaria, uncultured weissella ghanensis) and lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris predominated the early phase (1 - 2 days) which was joined by leuconostoc citreum during the mid phase (3 days), while lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus plantarum emerged and became dominant in the late phase (5 - 7 days) with concurrent disappearance of w. cibaria and l. lactis subsp. cremoris.  lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and uncultured lactobacillus acetotolerans were  predominantly present throughout the fermentation with no visible dynamics. the above identified dominant bacterial species along with their dynamics can be effectively utilized for designing a starter culture for industrialization of soidon production. our results showed that a more realistic view on the microbial ecology of soidon fermentation could be obtained by cultivation-dependent studies complemented with cultivation-independent molecular approaches. moreover, the critical issues to be considered for reducing methodological biases while studying the microbial ecology of traditional food fermentation were also highlighted with this soidon fermentation model. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == construction of a shuttle vector based on the small cryptic plasmid pjy33 from weissella cibaria 33.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid, pjy33, from weissella cibaria 33 was characterized. pjy33 was  2365 bp in size with a gc content of 41.27% and contained two putative open reading frames (orfs). orf1 encoded a putative hypothetical protein of 134 amino  acids. orf2 was 849 bp in size, and its putative translation product exhibited 87% identity with a replication initiation factor from a plasmid from w. cibaria  klc140. a weissella-escherichia coli shuttle vector, pjy33e (6.5 kb, em(r)), was  constructed by ligation of pjy33 with pbluescript ii sk(-) and an erythromycin resistance gene (em(r)). pjy33e replicated in lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella confusa. a  single-stranded dna intermediate was detected from lb. brevis 2.14 harbouring pjy33e, providing evidence for rolling-circle replication of pjy33. most lb. brevis 2.14 cells (85.9%) retained pjy33e after one week of daily culturing in mrs broth without em. an aga gene encoding alpha-galactosidase (alpha-gal) from leuconostoc mesenteroides was successfully expressed in lb. brevis 2.14 using pjy33e, and the highest level of alpha-gal activity (36.13 u/mg protein) was observed when cells were grown on melibiose.

TI  == use of sourdough fermentation and mixture of wheat, chickpea, lentil and bean flours for enhancing the nutritional, texture and sensory characteristics of white bread.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the addition of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours to wheat flour bread. type i sourdough containing legumes or wheat-legume flours were prepared and propagated (back slopped) in laboratory, according to traditional protocols that are routinely used for making typical italian breads. based on kinetic of acidification and culture-dependent data, the wheat-legume sourdough was further characterized and selected for bread making. as determined by rapd-pcr and partial sequencing of 16s rdna gene analyses, lactic acid bacteria in wheat-legume sourdough included lactobacillus plantarum,  lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, weissella cibaria, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus coryneformis, lactobacillus rossiae, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus paraplantarum. two breads containing 15% (w/w) of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours were produced using selected wheat-legume sourdough (wlsb) and traditional wheat sourdough (wsb). compared to wheat yeasted bread (wyb), the level of total free amino acids (faa) was higher in wsb and wlsb. phytase and antioxidant activities were the highest in wlsb. compared to bread wyb, the addition of legume flours decreased the in vitro protein digestibility (ivpd) (wyb versus wsb). however, the dough fermentation with wslb favored an increase of ivpd. according to the levels of carbohydrates, dietary fibers and resistant starch, wsb and wlsb showed lower values of hydrolysis index (hi) compared to wyb. as showed by texture and image analyses and sensory evaluation of breads, a good acceptability was found for wsb and, especially, wlsb breads.

TI  == bacteriophage ecology in a commercial cucumber fermentation.
AB  == to reduce high-salt waste from cucumber fermentations, low-salt fermentations are under development. these fermentations may require the use of starter cultures to ensure normal fermentations. because potential phage infection can cause starter  culture failure, it is important to understand phage ecology in the fermentations. this study investigated the phage ecology in a commercial cucumber fermentation. brine samples taken from a fermentation tank over a 90-day period were plated onto deman-rogosa-sharpe agar plates. a total of 576 lactic acid bacterial isolates were randomly selected to serve as potential hosts for phage isolation. filtered brine served as a phage source. fifty-seven independent phage isolates were obtained, indicating that 10% of the bacterial isolates were sensitive to phage attack. phage hosts include lactobacillus brevis (67% of all hosts), lactobacillus plantarum (21%), weissella paramesenteroides, weissella cibaria, and pediococcus ethanolidurans. nearly 50% of phages were isolated on day 14, and the majority of them attacked l. brevis. some phages had a broad host range and were capable of infecting multiple hosts in two genera. other phages were species specific or strain specific. about 30% of phage isolates produced turbid pinpoint plaques or only caused reduced cell growth on the bacterial lawns. six phages with distinct host ranges were characterized. the data from this study showed that abundant and diverse phages were present in the commercial cucumber fermentation, which could cause significant mortality to the lactic acid bacteria population. therefore, a phage control strategy may be needed in low-salt cucumber fermentations.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == the use of lactobacillus brevis ps1 to in vitro inhibit the outgrowth of fusarium culmorum and other common fusarium species found on barley.
AB  == a total of 129 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were screened for antifungal activity against common fusarium spp. isolated from brewing barley. four out of the five most inhibiting isolates were identified as lactobacillus brevis, whereas one belonged to weissella cibaria. l. brevis ps1, the isolate showing the largest inhibition spectrum, was selected and the influence of its freeze-dried cell-free supernatant (cfsp) on germination of macroconidia as well as mycelia growth was investigated using fusarium culmorum as target organism.addition of cfsp into the growth medium at concentrations > or = 2% altered the growth morphology of f.culmorum, whereas at concentrations > 5% the outgrowth of germ tubes from macroconidia was delayed and distorted. the presence of 10% cfsp completely inhibited the outgrowth of f. culmorum macroconidia. the activity of the compounds produced by l. brevis ps1 was higher at low ph values, i.e. ph < 5. heating and/or proteolytic treatment reduced the inhibitory activity of cfsp, indicating that l. brevis produces organic acids and proteinaceous compounds which are active against fusarium spp.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in french wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific pcr.
AB  == the lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the midi-pyrenees area (south western france) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. however, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. in the present study, a total of 290 lab isolates were identified by pcr amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional french sourdoughs. overall, the lab isolates belonged to 6 genera: lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), pediococcus (38%, 1 species), leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), weissella (4%, 2 species), lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: l. plantarum, l. curvatus, l. paracasei, l. sanfranciscensis, l. pentosus, l. paraplantarum, l. sakei, l. brevis, p. pentosaceus, l. mesenteroides, l. citreum, w. cibaria, w. confusa, l. lactis and  e. hirae. facultative heterofermentative lab represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to l. plantarum and p. pentosaceus. obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (l. sanfranciscencis, l. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas leuconostoc and weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. detection of some lab species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. the number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative lab species have been revealed. results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of lab cocci in the sourdough  ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.

TI  == effect of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria starters on health-promoting and sensory properties of tomato juices.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus plantarum, weissella cibaria/confusa, lactobacillus brevis, pediococcus pentosaceous, lactobacillus sp. and enterococcus faecium/faecalis were identified from raw tomatoes by biolog system, partial 16s  rrna gene sequence and subjected to typing by random amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr) analysis. ten autochthonous strains were singly used to ferment tomato juice (tj) via a protocol which included fermentation at 25 degrees c for 17 h and further storage at 4 degrees c for 40 days. unstarted tj and tj fermented with an allochthonous strain of l. plantarum  were used as the controls. all autochthonous strains grew well in tj reaching cell densities ca. 10,000 and 10 times higher than unstarted tj and tj fermented  with the allochthonous strain. viscosity of tjs fermented with autochthonous strains was generally the highest, especially when started with w. cibaria/confusa which synthesized exo-polysaccharides. overall, unstarted tj and  tj fermented with the allochthonous strain showed marked decreases of ascorbic acid (asc), glutathione (gsh) and total antioxidant activity (tta) during storage. on the contrary, several tjs fermented with autochthonous strains, especially with l. plantarum pom1 and pom 35, maintained elevated values of asc,  gsh and taa. the variation of color indexes mirrored the above behavior. tjs fermented with the above two autochthonous strains were compared to controls based on volatile components through purge and trap or solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (pt or spme-gc/ms) analysis. as shown by principal component analysis a large number of volatiles belonging to various chemical classes markedly differentiated tjs fermented with autochthonous strains with respect to controls.

TI  == characterization of italian cheeses ripened under nonconventional conditions.
AB  == four italian cheeses (casciotta di urbino, barricato san martino, vento d'estate, and ubriaco di raboso) nonconventionally ripened under different plant materials  (walnut leaves, herbs, hay, and wine by-products, respectively) were compared for compositional, microbiological, biochemical, and volatile profile characteristics. mean values for gross composition were rather similar. because primary starters were not used for manufacture, the endogenous lactic acid bacteria were mainly present (7.0 to 9.0 log10 cfu/g). except for lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides, which were commonly identified in 3 cheeses, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus sanguinicola, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus durans/enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella  cibaria/weissella confusa were variously found in the 4 cheeses. random amplification of polymorphic dna-pcr analysis showed the biodiversity among the strains, and the species of lactobacilli were in part grouped according to their  origin. as shown by the principal component analysis of reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography data for the ph 4.6-soluble fractions and by the determination of free aa, the secondary proteolysis of barricato san martino and  vento d'estate mainly differed from the other 2 cheeses. purge-and-trap and solid-phase microextraction were coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine volatile compounds. vento d'estate showed the highest levels of almost all chemical classes, and casciotta di urbino was characterized  by a very low level of volatile components. esters, ketones, and terpenes were the chemical classes that mainly differentiated the cheeses. several volatile compounds seemed to be released directly from the plant materials used for ripening, especially terpenes for vento d'estate cheese. the lowest level of volatile free fatty acids was found in casciotta d'urbino, in which rennet paste  was not used during manufacture. the highest concentration of free fatty acids, especially butyric and caproic acids, was found in vento d'estate cheese.

TI  == the biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in greek traditional wheat sourdoughs is reflected in both composition and metabolite formation.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from greek traditional wheat sourdoughs  manufactured without the addition of baker's yeast. application of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of total cell protein, randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr, dna-dna hybridization, and 16s ribosomal dna sequence analysis, in combination with physiological traits such as fructose fermentation and mannitol production, allowed us to classify the isolated bacteria into the species lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus paralimentarius, and weissella cibaria. this consortium seems to be unique for the greek traditional wheat sourdoughs studied. strains of the species w. cibaria have not been isolated from sourdoughs previously. no lactobacillus pontis or lactobacillus panis strains were found. an l. brevis-like isolate (aca-dc 3411 t1) could not be identified properly and might be a new sourdough lab species. in addition, fermentation capabilities associated with the lab detected have been studied. during laboratory fermentations, all heterofermentative sourdough lab strains produced lactic acid, acetic acid, and ethanol. mannitol was produced from fructose that served as an additional electron acceptor. in addition to glucose, almost all of the lab isolates fermented maltose, while fructose as the sole carbohydrate source was fermented by all sourdough lab tested except l. sanfranciscensis. two of the l. paralimentarius isolates tested did not ferment maltose; all strains were homofermentative. in the presence of both maltose and fructose in the medium, induction of hexokinase activity occurred in all sourdough lab species mentioned  above, explaining why no glucose accumulation was found extracellularly. no maltose phosphorylase activity was found either. these data produced a variable fermentation coefficient and a unique sourdough metabolite composition.
