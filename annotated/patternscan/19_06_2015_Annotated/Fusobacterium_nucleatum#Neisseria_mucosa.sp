TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == bacterial adhesion on the titanium and zirconia abutment surfaces.
AB  == objective: microorganisms harboring the oral cavity, mainly those related to periodontal diseases, are the most potential etiologic factor of failure in long-term implant treatment. the material used for abutment components may influence the adhesion and colonization of microbial species. the aim of this in  vivo investigation was to evaluate the biofilm formation on machined (mpt) or cast titanium (cpt) and zirconia abutments (zc). methods: six healthy subjects were enrolled in this randomized crossover clinical investigation. the study was  conducted in three phases according to abutment surface evaluated. each subject used an individual oral splint containing four disks of the same tested substrate, two located in the anterior and two in the posterior region, totalizing 12 specimens for subject. participants were asked to use the removable intraoral splint during 24 h. dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify 38 bacterial species colonizing formed biofilm on the abutment substrates. results: pathogens and non-pathogens species were found colonizing the three substrates surfaces. fusobacterium nucleatum, neisseria mucosa, porphyromonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobios, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus parasanguinis, and tanerella forsythia were the only species with no significant differences over the tested materials (p > 0.05). all the other target species presented significant differences sought by friedman test (p < 0.0001). conclusions: there was a significant difference in the total bacterial count between the three groups. cpt presented the higher mean counts, followed by mpt and zc. cpt group also showed a higher mean incidence of species than mpt and zc. the anterior or posterior region of disks placement did not show significant differences in relation to bacterial adhesion.

TI  == comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  == background: surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. the aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and  the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the mann-whitney u test. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. results: mean  total dna probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (p <0.01). precleaning edentate biofilms  had higher counts and proportions of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of tannerella forsythia, selenomonas noxia, and neisseria mucosa. by day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day  7 (p <0.01). succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. both groups demonstrated increased proportions of s. mitis and s. oralis by day 1. n.  mucosa, veillonella parvula, and eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. conclusions: "mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == a microbiological profile of symptomatic teeth with primary endodontic infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections associated with symptomatic teeth. samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 symptomatic (n = 30) or asymptomatic (n = 30) single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in symptomatic cases were fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, veillonella parvula, treponema socranskii, enterococcus faecalis, and campylobacter gracilis  and in asymptomatic cases were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, e. faecalis, eubacterium saburreum, and neisseria mucosa. total bacterial counts and counts of tannerella forsythia were significant higher in symptomatic cases (p < 0.05), whereas levels of propionibacterium acnes were reduced in this group of teeth. the data of the present investigation suggested an association between higher total bacterial counts and levels of t. forsythia and the presence of pain.

TI  == improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  == background: terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. however, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) origins  is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. to minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. methods: genescan-1000 rox was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (mw) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (fam) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16s recombinant rna gene of porphyromonas gingivalis. using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of  the conventional method. microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new mw size definition. bacterial species were assigned to peaks using  trfma, a web-based tool for t-rflp analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. results: using the new size definition, the average  sizing error for 40 t-rfs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. more than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by t-rflp. conclusion: the size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the t-rflp analysis. this provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == infection at titanium implants with or without a clinical diagnosis of inflammation.
AB  == objectives: to assess the microbiota at implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis, implant mucositis, or being clinically healthy. material and methods: clinical and microbiological data were collected from 213 subjects (mean age: 65.7+/-14) with 976 implants in function (mean: 10.8 years, sd+/-1.5). forty species were identified by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: implant mean % plaque score was 41.8+/-32.4%. periodontitis defined by bone loss was found in 44.9% of subjects. implant mucositis was diagnosed in 59% and peri-implantitis in 14.9% of all cases. neisseria mucosa, fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, f. nucleatum sp. polymorphum, and capnocytophaga sputigena dominated the implant sub-mucosal microbiota and the sub-gingival microbiota at tooth sites. implant probing pocket depth at the implant site with the deepest probing depth was correlated with levels of eikenella corrodens (r=0.16, p<0.05), the levels of f. nucleatum sp. vincentii (r=0.15, p<0.05), porphyromonas gingivalis (r=0.14, p<0.05), and micromonas micros (r=0.17, p=0.01). e. corrodens was found in higher levels at implants with mucositis compared with implant health (p<0.05). subjects who lost teeth due to periodontitis had higher yields of f. nucleatum sp. vincentii (p<0.02) and n. mucosa (p<0.05). independent of implant status subjects with teeth had higher levels of p. gingivalis (p<0.05), and leptotrichia buccalis (p<0.05). conclusions: at implant sites studied, few bacteria differed by whether subjects were dentate or not or by implant status.

TI  == distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.
