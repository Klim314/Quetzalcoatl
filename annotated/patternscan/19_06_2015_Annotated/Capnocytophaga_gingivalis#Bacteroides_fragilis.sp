TI  == discrimination based on gly and arg/ser at position 673 between dipeptidyl-peptidase (dpp) 7 and dpp11, widely distributed dpps in pathogenic and environmental gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, an asaccharolytic gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium, expresses the novel asp/glu-specific dipeptidyl-peptidase (dpp) 11 (ohara-nemoto, y. et al. (2011) j. biol. chem. 286, 38115-38127), which has been categorized as  a member of the s46/dpp7 family that is preferential for hydrophobic residues at  the p1 position. from that finding, 129 gene products constituting five clusters  from the phylum bacteroidetes have been newly annotated to either dpp7 or dpp11,  whereas the remaining 135 members, mainly from the largest phylum proteobacteria, have yet to be assigned. in this study, the substrate specificities of the five clusters and an unassigned group were determined with recombinant dpps from typical species, i.e., p. gingivalis, capnocytophaga gingivalis, flavobacterium psychrophilum, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, and shewanella putrefaciens. consequently, clusters 1, 3, and 5 were found to be dpp7 with rather broad substrate specificity, and clusters 2 and 4 were dpp11. an unassigned s. putrefaciens dpp carrying ser(673) exhibited asp/glu-specificity more preferable to glu, in contrast to the asp preference of dpp11 with arg(673)  from bacteroidetes species. mutagenesis experiments revealed that arg(673)/ser(673) were indispensable for the asp/glu-specificity of dpp11, and that the broad specificity of dpp7 was mediated by gly(673). taken together with  the distribution of the two genes, all 264 members of the s46 family could be attributed to either dpp7 or dpp11 by an amino acid at position 673. a more compelling phylogenic tree based on the conserved c-terminal region suggested two gene duplication events in the phylum bacteroidetes, one causing the development  of dpp7 and dpp11 with altered substrate specificities, and the other producing an additional dpp7 in the genus bacteroides.

TI  == e-test: a new technique for antimicrobial susceptibility testing for periodontal  microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to validate the epsilometer test (e-test) method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of selected periodontopathic microorganisms  using the agar dilution method as a standard. the e-test has been developed to provide a direct quantification of antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms. the device consists of a predefined, continuous, and exponential  gradient of antibiotic concentrations immobilized along a rectangular plastic test strip. after 48 hours incubation a drop-shaped inhibition zone intersects the graded test strip at the inhibitory concentration (ic) of the antibiotic. twenty-two subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites were plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% rabbit blood or 5% sheep blood and trypticase soy agar supplemented with vancomycin and bacitracin. a total of 60 strains of key periodontal pathogens (prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga) isolated from 22 sites of 12 patients were studied. the antibiotics tested were clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and ampicillin at concentrations above and below the achieved blood or gingival crevicular fluid levels. as a standard reference the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the  agar dilution method. mics were compared with ics determined using the e-test method. the results showed an agreement ranging from 67% to 100%; sensitivity ranging from 75% to 100%; predictability ranging from 56% to 100% and specificity ranging from 33% to 96%. the e-test ics for ampicillin, cefoxitin, and metronidazole against the gram-negative capnophilic and microaerophilic rods and  the black-pigmented anaerobic rods ics for ampicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline showed a high percentage of agreement with the agar dilution mics.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == sialidase (neuraminidase) activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic  bacteria.
AB  == a filter paper spot test with 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate was used to study the prevalence of sialidase activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria. a total of 567 isolates representing four genera of obligate anaerobes and four genera of capnophilic organisms was tested. sialidase activity was detected in 94% of 66 isolates from the bacteroides fragilis group,  98% of 66 b. bivius isolates, and all isolates of the following species (number of isolates follows species name): b. capillosus, 4; b. levii, 2; b. denticola, 22; b. loescheii, 23; b. melaninogenicus, 32; b. forsythus, 44; and b. buccalis,  2. however, sialidase activity was detected in only 29% of 7 b. buccae isolates,  79% of 14 b. disiens isolates, and 55% of 11 b. oralis isolates. sialidase activity was not detected among any of 13 isolates of b. gracilis, 12 isolates of b. ureolyticus, 61 isolates of b. intermedius, or 26 isolates of b. corporis. porphyromonas (bacteroides) asaccharolytica (20 isolates) and p. endodontalis (8  isolates) did not demonstrate sialidase activity, while 25 isolates of p. gingivalis were sialidase positive. sialidase activity was found in 10 (100%) of  10 isolates of capnocytophaga ochracea of c. sputigena but not in any of 4 c. gingivalis isolates. other gram-negative anaerobic or capnophilic bacteria, including the following, were negative for sialidase activity: fusobacterium nucleatum, 39 isolates; wolinella recta, 19 isolates; eikenella corrodens, 17 isolates; haemophilus aphrophilus, 10 isolates; and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 10 isolates. these data demonstrate sialidase activity in  several species of the genera bacteroides and porphyromonas and suggest that this characteristic may be useful for identification.

TI  == [gene cloning of an actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 antigen that reacts to peripheral blood sera in advanced destructive periodontitis patients].
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) has been implicated in the etiology of juvenile periodontitis and also of advanced destructive periodontitis (adp). it has been reported that the levels of the igg antibody against the a.a. in the  peripheral blood sera of the adp patients were often high as well as those against the bacteroides gingivalis. to clone the genes of antigen reactive to the sera of the adp patients, we constructed a phage library of the a.a. strain y4 dna in lambda l47, which was then screened by the immunochemical detection method using a serum from the adp patient. of about 1,000 phage clones six were positive with the serum and also the sera of the other patients, and were named 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 respectively. restriction enzyme and southern blot analyses indicated  that clones 8 and 9 were identical and that these clones, 3 to 8 were overlapping since they shared in common the 4 kbp and 5kbp hinc ii dna fragments of the a.a.  the cloned dna fragment hybridized to the dnas of the two other strains of the a.a. but did not to those of the bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides gigivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea and fusobacterium nucleatum. these results suggest that the dna sequence encoding an  a.a. y4 antigen strongly reactive to the sera of the adp patients was present specifically in the a.a. but not in the other bacteria isolated from the periodontal patients. thus, the dna could serve also as a dna probe for the diagnosis of periodontitis.

TI  == ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  == the fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides loeschii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptococcus prevotii, clostridium sporogenes, and propionibacterium acnes. the fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of b. gingivalis  and b. intermedius. in addition, strains of the nonoral bacteroides species b. asaccharolyticus and b. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. no such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of streptococcus, veillonella, actinomyces, lactobacillus, actinobacillus, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, or haemophilus species.

TI  == reaction of clinical isolates and typed strains of the family bacteroidaceae with rabbit anti-bacteroides sera examined by radial immunodiffusion.
AB  == antisera were produced which were reactive with bacteroides fragilis, b. gingivalis, or b. melaninogenicus subsp. melaninogenicus. anti-b. gingivalis serum exhibited strong reactions with strains of homologous species and reacted with only one other species, b. thetaiotaomicron. antigens shared by organisms of the b. fragilis group and b. melaninogenicus subspecies of the bacteroidaceae must be considered when serological methods are used for their identification.
