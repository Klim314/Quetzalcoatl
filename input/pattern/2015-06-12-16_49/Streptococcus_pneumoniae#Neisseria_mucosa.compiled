TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Booster vaccinations: can immunologic memory outpace disease pathogenesis?
AB  - Almost all current vaccines work by the induction of antibodies in serum or on the mucosa to block adherence of pathogens to epithelial cells or interfere with microbial invasion of the bloodstream. However, antibody levels usually decline after vaccination to undetectable amounts if further vaccination does not occur. Persistence of vaccine-induced antibodies usually goes well beyond the time when they should have decayed to undetectable levels because of ongoing "natural" boosting or other immunologic mechanisms. The production of memory B and T cells is of clear importance, but the likelihood that a memory response will be fast enough in the absence of a protective circulating antibody level likely depends on the pace of pathogenesis of a specific organism. This concept is discussed with regard to Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis; hepatitis A and B; diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis; polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella; rotavirus; and human papilloma virus. With infectious diseases for which the pace of pathogenesis is less rapid, some individuals will contract infection before the memory response is fully activated and implemented. With infectious diseases for which the pace of pathogenesis is slow, immune memory should be sufficient to prevent disease.
TI  - Mucosal vaccination against bacterial respiratory infections.
AB  - Mucosal vaccination offers attractive advantages to conventional systemic vaccination, such as higher levels of antibodies and protection at the airway surface. This review gives an overview of recent experimental and clinical data on nasal, oral and sublingual vaccines against bacterial respiratory pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , Neisseria meningitidis , Moraxella catarrhalis , Bordetella pertussis , Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Subsequently, we discuss further vaccine development that opens the focus to clinical use.
TI  - A pneumococcal MerR-like regulator and S-nitrosoglutathione reductase are required for systemic virulence.
AB  - A transcriptional regulator, NmlR(sp), has been identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae that is required for defense against nitric oxide (NO) stress. The nmlR(sp) gene is cotranscribed with adhC, which encodes an alcohol dehydrogenase that is able to reduce S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) with NADH as reductant. nmlR(sp) and adhC mutants exhibited a reduced level of NADH-GSNO oxidoreductase activity and were more susceptible to killing by NO than were wild-type cells. Comparison of the virulence of wild-type and mutant strains by use of a mouse model system showed that NmlR(sp) and AdhC do not play a key role in the adherence of pneumococci to the nasopharynx in vivo. An intraperitoneal challenge experiment revealed that both NmlR(sp) and AdhC were required for survival in blood. These data identify novel components of a NO defense system in pneumococci that are required for systemic infection.
TI  - Nasal carriage of pathogenic bacteria in medical students: effects of clinic exposure on prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of community-acquired and nosocomial infections worldwide. One important source of this pathogen for nosocomial infections is the nasal carriage of S. aureus among hospital personnel. There are only a few studies investigating the carriage of S. aureus in a community of medical students. Oral and nasal flora of 179 medical students with varying clinical exposures were determined. Oral cultures revealed no nosocomial pathogen and nasal cultures showed an increasing rate of S. aureus carriage with increasing clinical exposure. Methicillin resistance also demonstrated a tendency toward increasing with increasing clinical exposure.
TI  - Nasopharyngeal aerobic bacterial flora and Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in deaf children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the nasopharyngeal aerobic bacterial flora and Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in deaf children and the role of flora in deafness. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, controlled study. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs were collected from 87 deaf children with acquired etiology at Zonguldak primary school for the deaf and 56 healthy children. The children with genetic base (syndromic or nonsyndromic, familial or sporadic, AD, AR or X-linked recessive), and also with the history of drug exposure, head trauma, birth trauma, prematurity, hyperbilirubinemia and the viral diseases with high fever (like mumps and measles) were excluded from the study. Swabs were inoculated on to a variety of bacteriological culture media, which were then incubated in an appropriate atmosphere. Colonisation of Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria menengitidis, Moraxella catarrhalis and S. aureus in upper respiratory tract were investigated. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates were determined according to National committee for clinical laboratory standards (NCCLS) guidelines. RESULTS: Although, the rates of colonization of the nasopharyngeal aerobic bacteria and nasal S. aureus did not differ significantly between deaf children and normal healthy subjects, less colonization rates were found in deaf children than normal healthy subjects. S. aureus was isolated from 18 (20.7%) deaf children. All S. aureus isolates from deaf children were susceptible to oxacillin. Penicillin susceptibility rate was 22.2%. CONCLUSION: It is considered that nasopharyngeal and nasal colonizations of deaf children with potentially pathogenic aerobic bacterial flora is not a significant risk factor for acquired infections when compared with healthy children.
TI  - Identification of the conjugative mef gene in clinical Acinetobacter junii and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates.
AB  - The mef gene, originally described for gram-positive organisms and coding for an  efflux pump, has been identified in clinical isolates of Acinetobacter junii and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. These strains could transfer the mef gene at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) into one or more of the following recipients: gram-negative Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria perflava/sicca and Neisseria mucosa and gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis. Three Streptococcus pneumoniae strains could transfer the mef gene into Eikenella corrodens, Haemophilus influenzae, Kingella denitrificans, M. catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, N. perflava/sicca, and N. mucosa at similar frequencies. The mef gene can thus be transferred to and expressed in a variety of gram-negative recipients.
TI  - Phosphorylcholine decoration of lipopolysaccharide differentiates commensal Neisseriae from pathogenic strains: identification of licA-type genes in commensal Neisseriae.
AB  - Phosphorylcholine (ChoP) is a potential candidate for a plurispecific vaccine, because it is present on surface components of many mucosal organisms, including Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, ChoP has been detected on pili of Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In this study, we demonstrate the presence of the phosphorylcholine epitope on the lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of several species of commensal Neisseriae (Cn), a property that differentiates commensal from the pathogenic strains of Neisseriae. In an extended survey of 78 strains, we confirmed the exclusive expression of the ChoP epitope on pili of pathogenic Neisseriae. Despite the presence of pili on Cn, which are homologous to Class II pili of N. meningitidis, they did not react with anti-ChoP antibody. This observation was further supported by the fact that 14C-labelled choline was incorporated only in the LPSs of Cn. Analysis of the LPS of N. lactamica strain NL4 revealed two distinct and interconvertible molecular species of LPS with high and low levels of reactivity with anti-ChoP antibody. In addition, on/off phase variation gave rise to frequent modulation in the levels of antibody reactivity. A concurrent modulation was also observed in the binding of C-reactive protein, CRP, a ChoP-binding reactant that is implicated in bacterial clearance. Genetic analysis showed the presence of a gene in several Cn spp. with significant sequence identity to H. influenzae licA. This gene encodes choline kinase and is also involved in phase variation of the LPS-associated ChoP in H. influenzae. In contrast, licA-like genes were not identified in the pathogenic Neisseria strains tested. They are absent from N. meningitidis strain Z2491 genome database. These data suggest that the genetic basis for ChoP incorporation in Cn LPS resembles that in H. influenzae spp. and may be distinct from that generating the ChoP epitope on pili of pathogenic Neisseriae. Further, the modulation of ChoP expression on Cn LPS, and corresponding modulation of CRP binding, has the potential to confer the property of immune avoidance and thus of persistence on mucosa.
TI  - The effect of cigarette smoke on adherence of respiratory pathogens to buccal epithelial cells.
AB  - Smoking is associated with an increased risk of respiratory tract infection in adults. In children, exposure to cigarette smoke is a risk factor for respiratory tract infection and bacterial meningitis: Active smoking and passive exposure to cigarette smoke is also associated with carriage of some potentially pathogenic species of bacteria in both adults and children. The aims of the study were to determine the effect of active smoking on: (1) bacterial binding to epithelial cells; (2) expression of host cell antigens that act as receptors for some species; and (3) the effects of passive exposure to water-soluble components of cigarette smoke on bacterial binding. Flow cytometry was used to assess binding to buccal epithelial cells of the following species labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate: Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria lactamica, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus. Flow cytometry was also used to assess expression of host cell antigens which have been identified as bacterial receptors. For each species, binding to cells of smokers was significantly higher than to cells of non-smokers; however, expression of host cell antigens was similar on epithelial cells of both groups. Non-dilute cigarette smoke extract reduced binding of bacteria to epithelial cells, but dilutions between 1 in 10 and 1 in 320 enhanced binding. We conclude that smokers might be more densely colonised by a variety of potentially pathogenic bacteria. The enhanced bacterial binding to epithelial cells of smokers is not related to enhanced expression of host cell antigens that can act as receptors for some species, but possibly to components in the smoke that alter charge or other properties of the epithelial cell surface. Passive coating of mucosal surfaces with components of cigarette smoke might enhance binding of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  - Mannan-binding protein (MBP), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. After binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, MBP activates the classical pathway of the complement system. To investigate the binding capacity of MBP to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of MBP to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. Salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), used as a positive control strain, showed binding of radiolabelled MBP at a level of 80% compared with binding of MBP to zymosan. Binding of labelled MBP to Salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. The binding was inhibited by unlabelled MBP, by mannose and by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of MBP binding capacities could be determined. The encapsulated Neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group A were included: n = 22), N. mucosa (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low MBP binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-40.1%). Escherichia coli K1 (n = 11), Strep. suis (n = 5), Strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and N. meningitidis serogroup A (n = 2) showed intermediate MBP binding capacity of 58.4% (95% CI 40.0-76.8%). A third group consisting of non-encapsulated Listeria monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated H. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated N. meningitidis (n = 2), N. cinera (n = 1) and N. subflava (n = 1) strains had a high MBP binding capacity of 87.5% (95% CI 62.5-112.5%). The majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low MBP binding capacity.
TI  - The predominant microflora of the palatal mucosa in an elderly island population.
AB  - The prevalence and microbiology of macrophotographically documented denture stomatitis were studied in denture wearers participating in an interdisciplinary health-monitoring project (Koster Health Project) on the Koster islands, Sweden. Upper dentures were used by 26.6% of the adult population, and 59.2% of the denture wearers had stomatitis. Denture stomatitis type I was identified as sialadenitis. The more severe forms of denture stomatitis (types II and III) demonstrated increased recovery of microorganisms in the palatal mucosa in addition to sialadenitis. Only one proband showed increased growth of fungi. Hemophilus spp. and Bacteroides spp. were the predominating microorganisms in stomatitis types II and III. Shifts in the normal oral flora are suggested to be an important factor for the development of denture stomatitis. It is concluded that bacterial colonization on the palatal mucosa may play an important role in denture stomatitis in this relatively healthy population.
TI  - Humoral immune response patterns of human mucosae: induction and relation to bacterial respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Immunoglobulin-producing cells in mucosal tissues, quantitatively the body's most important humoral immune system, synthesize mainly dimers and larger polymers of IgA (poly-IgA) with incorporated J (joining) chain. Poly-IgA is actively transported to exocrine secretions by a transmembrane epithelial glycoprotein called secretory component. Enhancing secretory immunity by oral vaccination is an interesting possibility, but mucosal antigen uptake and local immune regulation are complex and only partly understood. Immunoglobulin isotype response patterns in the upper respiratory mucosa and distal gut are strikingly different. The preferential production of IgA1 in nasal and bronchial mucosae is intriguing in view of the frequent synthesis of IgA1-specific proteases by Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis. A relationship of proneness to produce invasive disease and enzymatically induced deterioration of secretory immunity has been proposed. Differences in mucosal immune response patterns among patients with selective IgA deficiency or IgG subclass deficiencies also suggest that local humoral immunity is an important variable in resistance to infections.
TI  - [Quantitative bacterial ecology of normal nasal mucosa].
AB  - A quantitative research into the aerobic bacteria of human nasal cavities has been carried out; 183 healthy individuals observed, negative results 18 (9.83%). Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria, were numerically determined and the incidence of each single species or genus exactly specified. Among gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacter, Providencia, Proteus, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia, Herella, Pseudomonas, and among the Hyphomycetes, Candida albicans have been identified and their number calculated. Diphteroid bacteria were also detected and counted; among them, the Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum seemed to be the most frequent and numerous species. Finally, interference phenomena in vivo by Staphylococcus aureus and environmental and nourishment competition by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus and Diphtheroids were noted.
TI  - [Allergization of the body by Neisseria meningitidis. I. The problem of the occurrence of N. meningitidis in cases of bronchial asthma of bacterial etiology (author's transl)].
AB  - The object of the authors work was the examination of nasopharyngeal swabs on the prevalence of Neisseria meningitidis. A group of 222 patients suffering from asthma bronchiale of bacteriological etiology was under observation in order to be able to prepare an autovaccine. Nasopharyngeal swabs were inoculated on special nutrient media. Neisseria meningitidis was found in 22%, mainly from nasopharyngeal swabs, together with Haemophilus sp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In 59% of examined cases the positive findings lasted longer than 1 year. 46% of isolated strains belonged to group B, about 30% of strains were untypable. The problem of allergisation of people suffering from asthma bronchiale with these strains and the question of preparing an autovaccine from Neisseria meningitidis is discussed.
