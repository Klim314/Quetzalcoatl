TI  == axenic culture of a candidate division tm7 bacterium from the human oral cavity and biofilm interactions with other oral bacteria.
AB  == the diversity of bacterial species in the human oral cavity is well recognized, but a high proportion of them are presently uncultivable. candidate division tm7  bacteria are almost always detected in metagenomic studies but have not yet been  cultivated. in this paper, we identified candidate division tm7 bacterial phylotypes in mature plaque samples from around orthodontic bonds in subjects undergoing orthodontic treatment. successive rounds of enrichment in laboratory media led to the isolation of a pure culture of one of these candidate division tm7 phylotypes. the bacteria formed filaments of 20 to 200 mum in length within agar plate colonies and in monospecies biofilms on salivary pellicle and exhibited some unusual morphological characteristics by transmission electron microscopy, including a trilaminated cell surface layer and dense cytoplasmic deposits. proteomic analyses of cell wall protein extracts identified abundant polypeptides predicted from the tm7 partial genomic sequence. pleiomorphic phenotypes were observed when the candidate division tm7 bacterium was grown in dual-species biofilms with representatives of six different oral bacterial genera. the tm7 bacterium formed long filaments in dual-species biofilm communities with actinomyces oris or fusobacterium nucleatum. however, the tm7 isolate grew as short rods or cocci in dual-species biofilms with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, or streptococcus gordonii, forming notably robust biofilms with the latter two species. the ability to cultivate tm7 axenically should majorly advance understanding of the physiology,  genetics, and virulence properties of this novel candidate division oral bacterium.

TI  == molecular methods for diagnosis of odontogenic infections.
AB  == purpose: historically, the identification of microorganisms has been limited to species that could be cultured in the microbiology laboratory. the purpose of the present study was to apply molecular techniques to identify microorganisms in orofacial odontogenic infections (ois). materials and methods: specimens were obtained from subjects with clinical evidence of oi. to identify the microorganisms involved, 16s rrna sequencing methods were used on clinical specimens. the name and number of the clones of each species identified and the combinations of species present were recorded for each subject. descriptive statistics were computed for the study variables. results: specimens of pus or wound fluid were obtained from 9 subjects. a mean of 7.4 +/- 3.7 (standard deviation) species per case were identified. the predominant species detected in  the present study that have previously been associated with ois were fusobacterium spp, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella oris. the predominant species detected in our study that have not been previously associated with ois were dialister pneumosintes and eubacterium brachy. unculturable phylotypes accounted for 24% of the species identified in our study. all species detected were obligate or facultative anaerobes. streptococci were not detected. conclusions: molecular methods have enabled us to detect previously cultivated and not-yet-cultivated species in ois; these methods could change our  understanding of the pathogenic flora of orofacial ois.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.
