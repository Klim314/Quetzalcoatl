TI  - The probiotic VSL#3 has anti-inflammatory effects and could reduce endoscopic recurrence after surgery for Crohn's disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Probiotic formulations of single species of bacteria have not  been effective in preventing the recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgery. We investigated the ability of VSL#3, a mixture of 8 different bacterial probiotic species, to prevent Crohn's disease recurrence after surgery in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Within 30 days of ileocolonic resection and re-anastomosis, patients with Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to groups given 1 sachet of VSL#3 (900 billion viable bacteria, comprising 4 strains of Lactobacillus, 3 strains of Bifidobacterium, and 1 strain of Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus) (n = 59) or matching placebo (n = 60). Colonoscopy was performed at days 90 and 365 to evaluate the neoterminal ileum for disease recurrence and obtain mucosal biopsies for cytokine analysis. Patients from both groups with either no or mild endoscopic recurrence at day 90 received VSL#3 until day 365. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at day 90. RESULTS: At day 90, the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic lesions did not differ significantly between VSL#3 (9.3%) and placebo (15.7%, P = .19). The proportions of patients with non-severe lesions at day 90 who had severe endoscopic recurrence at day 365 were 10.0% in the early VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 for the entire 365 days) and 26.7% in the late VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 from days 90 through 365) (P = .09). Aggregate rates of severe recurrence (on days 90 and 365) were not statistically different, 20.5% of subjects in the early VSL#3 group and 42.1% in the late VSL#3 group. Patients receiving VSL#3 had reduced mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels compared with placebo at day 90 (P < .05). Crohn's disease activity index and inflammatory bowel disease quality of life scores were similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistical differences in endoscopic recurrence rates at day 90 between patients who received VSL#3 and patients who received placebo. Lower mucosal levels of inflammatory cytokines and a lower rate of recurrence among patients who received early VSL#3 (for the entire 365 days) indicate that this probiotic should be further investigated for prevention of Crohn's disease recurrence.

TI  - Genomics of Streptococcus salivarius, a major human commensal.
AB  - The salivarius group of streptococci is of particular importance for humans. This group consists of three genetically similar species, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus vestibularis and Streptococcus thermophilus. S. salivarius and S. vestibularis are commensal organisms that may occasionally cause opportunistic infections in humans, whereas S. thermophilus is a food bacterium widely used in dairy production. We developed Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and comparative genomic analysis to confirm the clear separation of these three species. These analyses also identified a subgroup of four strains, with a core genome diverging by about 10%, in terms of its nucleotide sequence, from that of S. salivarius sensu stricto. S. thermophilus species displays a low level of nucleotide variability, due to its recent emergence with the development of agriculture. By contrast, nucleotide variability is high in the other two species of the salivarius group, reflecting their long-standing association with humans. The species of the salivarius group have genome sizes ranging from the smallest ( approximately 1.7Mb for S. thermophilus) to the largest ( approximately 2.3Mb for S. salivarius) among streptococci, reflecting genome reduction linked to a narrow, nutritionally rich environment for S. thermophilus, and natural, more competitive niches for the other two species. Analyses of genomic content have indicated that the core genes of S. salivarius account for about two thirds of the genome, indicating considerable variability of gene content and differences in potential adaptive features. Furthermore, we showed that the genome of this species is exceptionally rich in genes encoding surface factors, glycosyltransferases and response regulators. Evidence of widespread genetic exchanges was obtained, probably involving a natural competence system and the presence of diverse mobile elements. However, although the S. salivarius strains studied were isolated from several human body-related sites (all levels of the digestive tract, skin, breast milk, and body fluids) and included clinical strains, no genetic or genomic niche-specific features could be identified to discriminate specific group.
TI  - Treatment of atopic dermatitis eczema with a high concentration of Lactobacillus  salivarius LS01 associated with an innovative gelling complex: a pilot study on adults.
AB  - GOALS: To evaluate the efficacy of a highly concentrated Lactobacillus salivarius preparation containing a gelling complex formed by Streptococcus thermophilus ST10 and tara gum in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated an improvement in AD symptoms after administration of the probiotic strain L. salivarius LS01. S. thermophilus ST10 and tara gum create a gelling complex that adheres to intestinal mucus and improves barrier function. STUDY: A prospective, controlled pilot trial was carried out to evaluate how the association of S. thermophilus ST10 and tara gum could improve the activity of L. salivarius LS01 administered at high doses to adults with AD. Twenty-five patients were included into the study: 13 were treated for 1 month with the active formulation, whereas 12 represented the placebo group. Scoring Atopic Dermatitis index was determined before and at the end of probiotic administration. Fecal samples were also collected to evaluate changes in bacterial counts of Staphylococcus aureus and clostridia. RESULTS: A significant improvement in SCORAD index was observed in the probiotic group after 1 month of treatment, whereas no significant changes occurred in placebo patients. A slight decrease in fecal S. aureus count was observed in probiotic-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Data obtained in this study suggest a potential role for L. salivarius LS01 in the treatment of AD. The addition of tara gum and S. thermophilus ST10 seems to improve the overall efficacy of the probiotic strain, in particular shortening the time required for the onset of the positive effects. Further studies to investigate the activity of this preparation are advisable.
TI  - Functional screening of antibiotic resistance genes from a representative metagenomic library of food fermenting microbiota.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) represent the predominant microbiota in fermented foods. Foodborne LAB have received increasing attention as potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance (AR) determinants, which may be horizontally transferred to opportunistic pathogens. We have previously reported isolation of AR LAB from the raw ingredients of a fermented cheese, while AR genes could be detected in the final, marketed product only by PCR amplification, thus pointing at the need for more sensitive microbial isolation techniques. We turned therefore to construction of a metagenomic library containing microbial DNA extracted directly from the food matrix. To maximize yield and purity and to ensure that genomic complexity of the library was representative of the original bacterial population, we defined a suitable protocol for total DNA extraction from cheese which can also be applied to other lipid-rich foods. Functional library screening on different antibiotics allowed recovery of ampicillin and kanamycin resistant clones originating from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus genomes. We report molecular characterization of the cloned inserts, which were fully sequenced and shown to confer AR phenotype to recipient bacteria. We also show that metagenomics can be applied to food microbiota to identify underrepresented species carrying specific genes of interest.
TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 during manufacture and storage of white brined cheese.
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a major foodborne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans. Survival of E. coli O157:H7 during processing and storage of white brined cheese was investigated. Cheeses were prepared using pasteurized milk inoculated with a 4 strain E. coli O157:H7 cocktail (7 log(10) CFU/g) with or without yogurt starter culture (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) and stored in 10% or 15% NaCl brine at 10 and 21 masculineC for 28 d. NaCl concentration, water activity (a(w)), pH, and numbers of E. coli O157:H7 and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were determined in cheese and brine. E. coli O157:H7 was able to survive in cheese stored in both brines at 10 and 21 masculineC regardless of the presence of starter LAB, although the latter significantly enhanced E. coli O157:H7 reduction in cheese or its brine at 10 masculineC. E. coli O157:H7 numbers were reduced by 2.6 and 3.4 log(10) CFU/g in cheese stored in 10% and 15% NaCl brine, respectively, in the presence of starter LAB and by 1.4 and 2.3 log(10) CFU/g, respectively, in the absence of starter LAB at 10 masculineC. The pathogen survived, but at lower numbers in the brines. The salt concentration of cheese stored in 10% brine remained about 5% during ripening, but in 15% brine, the NaCl level increased 1.6% to 8.1% (w/w) by 28 d. Values of pH and a(w) slightly decreased 1 d after exposure to brine and reached 5.5 to 6.6 and 0.88 to 0.94, respectively, in all treatments.
TI  - The yogurt amino acid profile's variation during the shelf-life.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the yogurt amino acid profile starting from marketing through the whole shelf-life. The evaluation of the proteolytic activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, allows to deduce their vitality during the shelf-life period and within 45 days. METHODS: Three types of full fats yogurts have been analyzed (a) natural white (b) sweet white and (c) whole fruit - in two stages: t0 (first day of shelf-life) and t1 (end of shelf-life). The proteins have been analyzed by the Kjeldahl method and the amino acid profile by HPLC. RESULTS: In natural yogurt a significant increase of the amount of free amino acids has been observed during the period of shelf-life (97%). In the sweetened full fats and fruit yogurt, instead, there is a lower increase of respectively 33% and 39% CONCLUSIONS: In whole milk natural yogurt, based on our data, the proteolytic activity seems to persist during the entire period of the shelf-life and this can be considered an index of bacterial survival, especially of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus during the marketing process.
TI  - Control of natural transformation in salivarius Streptococci through specific degradation of sigmaX by the MecA-ClpCP protease complex.
AB  - Competence for natural DNA transformation is a tightly controlled developmental process in streptococci. In mutans and salivarius species, the abundance of the central competence regulator sigma(X) is regulated at two levels: transcriptional, by the ComRS signaling system via the sigma(X)/ComX/SigX-inducing peptide (XIP), and posttranscriptional, by the adaptor protein MecA and its associated Clp ATPase, ClpC. In this study, we further investigated the mechanism and function of the MecA-ClpC control system in the salivarius species Streptococcus thermophilus. Using in vitro approaches, we showed that MecA specifically interacts with both sigma(X) and ClpC, suggesting the formation of a ternary sigma(X)-MecA-ClpC complex. Moreover, we demonstrated that MecA ultimately targets sigma(X) for its degradation by the ClpCP protease in an ATP-dependent manner. We also identify a short sequence (18 amino acids) in the N-terminal domain of sigma(X) as essential for the interaction with MecA and subsequent sigma(X) degradation. Finally, increased transformability of a MecA-deficient strain in the presence of subinducing XIP concentrations suggests that the MecA-ClpCP proteolytic complex acts as an additional locking device to prevent competence under inappropriate conditions. A model of the interplay between ComRS and MecA-ClpCP in the control of sigma(X) activity is proposed.
TI  - Effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  - Bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) were prepared from growth of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525, Escherichia coli 08, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Bacillus subtilis 168, Bacillus coagulans 185A, B. coagulans 7050, Clostridium sporogenes PA3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. The inhibitory effects of CFS on the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and Tulane virus in RAW 264.7 and LLCMK2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of CFS or after exposure of host cells to CFS. Slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and Tulane virus in the continuous presence of CFS of B. subtilis 168 and E. faecalis 19433, respectively. CFS cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. Virus persisted in the CFS that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of CFS on virions. The viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.
TI  - Viability of probiotic Lactobacillus casei in yoghurt: defining the best processing step to its addition.
AB  - Probiotics are live microorganisms capable of producing beneficial effects on its host when consumed in adequate amounts. To exert these effects, foods must contain probiotic microorganisms in populations above 10(6) CFU/g or mL throughout its shelf life. One of the strategies to ensure high population of probiotics in fermented milk is to add them during or after the fermentation process separately from the starter cultures. The objective of this study was to investigate the behavior of the probiotic microorganism Lactobacillus casei added to yoghurt in different stages of production. Yoghurts with L. casei were produced at different stages: before addition of starter (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), added together with this culture and at the end of fermentation. Yoghurt without probiotic added was produced as a control. The products were stored at 4 degrees C and analyzed after 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of storage. In these periods, the populations ofprobiotic and starter cultures were enumerated and the parameters pH and acidity were analyzed. The results were evaluated using analysis of variance and Tukey's test, both at 5% significance level. L. casei remained viable in populations of more than 10(8) CFU / g during 21 days of storage, which is suitable to define the formulations as probiotics. When the different stages of the addition of probiotics in yoghurts were evaluated there was no statistical difference between the formulations (p < 0.05) for populations of L. casei except for the first day of storage.
TI  - Diversity of human small intestinal Streptococcus and Veillonella populations.
AB  - Molecular and cultivation approaches were employed to study the phylogenetic richness and temporal dynamics of Streptococcus and Veillonella populations in the small intestine. Microbial profiling of human small intestinal samples collected from four ileostomy subjects at four time points displayed abundant populations of Streptococcus spp. most affiliated with S. salivarius, S. thermophilus, and S. parasanguinis, as well as Veillonella spp. affiliated with V. atypica, V. parvula, V. dispar, and V. rogosae. Relative abundances varied per subject and time of sampling. Streptococcus and Veillonella isolates were cultured using selective media from ileostoma effluent samples collected at two time points from a single subject. The richness of the Streptococcus and Veillonella isolates was assessed at species and strain level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and genetic fingerprinting, respectively. A total of 160 Streptococcus and 37 Veillonella isolates were obtained. Genetic fingerprinting differentiated seven Streptococcus lineages from ileostoma effluent, illustrating the strain richness within this ecosystem. The Veillonella isolates were represented by a single phylotype. Our study demonstrated that the small intestinal Streptococcus populations displayed considerable changes over time at the genetic lineage level because only representative strains of a single Streptococcus lineage could be cultivated from ileostoma effluent at both time points.
TI  - Effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: A bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients may be modulated by probiotics. We assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic IBS symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating IBS symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), where appropriate. The random-effects model was employed in cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. RESULTS: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. Probiotics improved pain scores if they contained Bifidobacterium breve (SMD, - 0.34; 95% CI, - 0.66; -0.02), Bifidobacterium longum (SMD, -0.48; 95% CI, - 0.91; -0.06), or Lactobacillus acidophilus (SMD, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.61; -0.01) species. Distension scores were improved by probiotics containing B. breve (SMD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.77; -0.13), Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus plantarum (SMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -1.00; -0.06) species. All probiotic species tested improved flatulence: B. breve (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.75;- 0.10), B. infantis, L. casei, L. plantarum (SMD, -0.60; 95% CI, -1.07; -0.13), B. longum, L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (SMD, -0.61; 95% CI, -1.01; -0.21). There was not a clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for IBS patients, and the effects on each IBS symptom are likely species-specific. Future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.
TI  - Assessment of the susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria to biocides.
AB  - Biocides are antimicrobial compounds that are widely used in the food industry and medical environments. In this study, we determined the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) by the microdilution method of four different biocides for a large collection of LAB of different origins. The tested isolates belong to 11 species of the Lactobacillus genus and to Streptococcus thermophilus, Streptococcus salivarius and Lactococcus garvieae. The results obtained in this study indicate that low susceptibilities to benzalkonium chloride (BC), triclosan (Tr), chlorhexidine (Ch), and sodium hypochlorite (SH) are not frequent among LAB. Moreover, no systematic co-tolerance between two or more tested biocides was found; that is, strains displaying high MIC values and thus low sensitivity to one of the biocides did not show higher MIC values for the other biocides.
TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics in preventing episodes of acute otitis media in high-risk children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested that probiotics (proB) and/or prebiotics (preB) could reduce the burden of infection in infants and toddlers. We aimed to determine whether follow-up formula supplemented with proB and preB could reduce the risk of acute otitis media (AOM). METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from November 2007 to April 2009, 37 pediatricians in France enrolled children 7 to 13 months of age with high risk of AOM who were randomly assigned to receive follow-up formula supplemented with proB (Streptococcus thermophilus NCC 2496, Streptococcus salivarius DSM 13084, Lactobacillus rhamnosus LPR CGMCC 1.3724) and preB (Raftilose/Raftiline) or follow-up formula alone (placebo). During 12 months, the 2 groups were compared for number of AOM episodes diagnosed (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes by the Poisson model (incidence rate ratio [IRR]) or logistic regression (odds ratio; and 95% confidence interval [95% CI]) after adjustment on covariates of interest. RESULTS: We enrolled 224 children (112 in each group). All children were vaccinated (4 doses) with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; demographic characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. In total, 486 AOM episodes were reported, 249 and 237 in the treatment and control groups, respectively. The treatment and control groups did not differ in incidence of AOM (IRR 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8-1.2), lower respiratory tract infections (IRR 0.9, 0.7-1.2) or number of antibiotic treatment courses (IRR = 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8-1.2). Treatment was not associated with recurrent AOM (odds ratio 1.0, 95% CI: 0.5-1.7). With regard to gastrointestinal disorders, both formulas were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The proB and preB included in follow-up formula given to children at 7 to 13 months of age did not reduce the risk of AOM, recurrent AOM, antibiotic use or lower respiratory tract infections at 1 year.
TI  - Occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  - The distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD, in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. ZmpB was ubiquitous in the Mitis and Salivarius groups of the genus Streptococcus and in the genera Gemella and Granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. IgA1 protease activity was observed in all members of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. oralis, S. sanguinis, and Gemella haemolysans, was variably present in S. mitis and S. infantis, and absent in S. gordonii, S. parasanguinis, S. cristatus, S. oligofermentans, S. australis, S. peroris, and S. suis. Phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpB, and zmpD genes in S. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. Presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. The widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpB, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. IMPORTANCE: The paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. This study maps the presence of the corresponding genes and enzyme activities in S. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera Streptococcus, Gemella, and Granulicatella. The distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpB is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. The ZmpB protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the Mitis and Salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. The relative sequence diversification of the IgA1 protease, ZmpB, and ZmpD is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen S. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.
TI  - Production of multiple bacteriocins from a single locus by gastrointestinal strains of Lactobacillus salivarius.
AB  - Bacteriocins produced by Lactobacillus salivarius isolates derived from a gastrointestinal origin have previously demonstrated efficacy for in vivo protection against Listeria monocytogenes infection. In this study, comparative genomic analysis was employed to investigate the intraspecies diversity of seven L. salivarius isolates of human and porcine intestinal origin, based on the genome of the well-characterized bacteriocin-producing strain L. salivarius UCC118. This revealed a highly conserved megaplasmid-borne gene cluster in these strains involved in the regulation and secretion of two-component class IIb bacteriocins. However, considerable intraspecific variation was observed in the structural genes encoding the bacteriocin peptides. They ranged from close relatives of abp118, such as salivaricin P, which differs by 2 amino acids, to completely novel bacteriocins, such as salivaricin T, which is characterized in this study. Salivaricin T inhibits closely related lactobacilli and bears little homology to previously characterized salivaricins. Interestingly, the two peptides responsible for salivaricin T activity, SalTalpha and SalTbeta, share considerable identity with the component peptides of thermophilin 13, a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus thermophilus. Furthermore, the salivaricin locus of strain DPC6488 also encodes an additional novel one-component class IId anti-listerial bacteriocin, salivaricin L. These findings suggest a high level of redundancy in the bacteriocins that can be produced by intestinal L. salivarius isolates using the same enzymatic production and export machinery. Such diversity may contribute to their ability to dominate and compete within the complex microbiota of the mammalian gut.
TI  - Some low homogenization pressures improve certain probiotic characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-K.
AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus are dairy cultures widely used in the manufacture of cultured dairy products. Commonly used homogenization pressures in the dairy industry are 13.80 MPa or less. It is not known whether low homogenization pressures can stimulate bacteria to improve their probiotic characteristics. Objectives were to determine the effect of homogenization at 0, 3.45, 6.90, 10.34, and 13.80 MPa on acid tolerance, bile tolerance, protease activity, and growth of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB-12, S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus ST-M5, and L. acidophilus LA-K. The cultures were individually inoculated in cool autoclaved skim milk (4 degrees C) and homogenized for 5 continuous passes. Growth and bile tolerance of samples were determined hourly for 10h of incubation. Acid tolerance was determined every 20 min for 120 min of incubation. Protease activity was determined at 0, 12, and 24h of incubation. All homogenization pressures studied improved acid tolerance of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB-12 but had no beneficial effect on protease activity and had negative effects on growth and bile tolerance. A pressure of 6.90 MPa improved acid tolerance, bile tolerance, and protease activity of S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus ST-M5, but none of the homogenization pressures studied had an effect on its growth. Homogenization pressures of 13.80 and 6.90 MPa improved acid tolerance and bile tolerance, respectively, of L. acidophilus LA-K but had no effect on protease activity and its growth. Some low homogenization pressures positively influenced some characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and L. acidophilus LA-K. Culture pretreatment with some low homogenization pressures can be recommended for improvement of certain probiotic characteristics.
TI  - Characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  - The study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from fermented foods in Xi'an, China. LAB strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of Lactobacillus (n = 73), and Streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16S rRNA gene. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and S. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). Some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. Minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of Lactobacillus. The erm(B) gene was detected from two strains of each of L. fermentum and L. vaginalis, and one strain of each of L. plantarum, L. salivarius, L. acidophilus, L. animalis, and S. thermophilus. The tet genes were identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. This is the first time, the authors identified tet(S) gene from L. brevis and L. kefiri. The erm(B) gene from L. fermentum NWL24 and L. salivarius NWL33, and tet(M) gene from L. plantarum NWL22 and L. brevis NWL59 were successfully transferred to Enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. It was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in Xi'an, China and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of yogurt on aberrant crypt foci formation in the rat colon and colorectal tumorigenesis in RasH2 mice.
AB  - The inhibitory effects of yogurt consisting of milk fermented by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain 2038 and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strain 1131 on formation of colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in rats and also on development of colorectal tumors in transgenic mice harboring human prototype c-Ha-ras genes (rasH2 mice) were examined. F344 rats and rasH2 mice were fed commercial diet containing freeze-dried yogurt or starter medium (non-fermented milk). Rats were inoculated orally with heterocyclic amine 2-amino-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine hydrochloride (PhIP) for two weeks. The rats were necropsied 14 days after the PhIP treatment, and ACF in the colon and rectum were counted. RasH2 mice were injected with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH) for 20 weeks. Three weeks after the last injection of DMH, rasH2 mice were necropsied to determine the number and the size of colorectal tumors. Yogurt supplementation in diet significantly reduced the number of ACF and aberrant crypts (ACs) in rats fed control diet (P<0.01), but not in rats fed non-fermented milk diet. On the other hand, rasH2 mice receiving the yogurt-supplemented diet had significantly reduced numbers of tumors induced by DMH compared with those fed the non-fermented milk-supplemented diet (P<0.05). These results demonstrate that the yogurt used in this study appears to have tumor-suppressing properties, and rasH2 mice are a useful model for the evaluation of antitumor activities of foods.
TI  - A novel pheromone quorum-sensing system controls the development of natural competence in Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - In streptococcal species, the key step of competence development is the transcriptional induction of comX, which encodes the alternative sigma factor sigma(X), which positively regulates genes necessary for DNA transformation. In Streptococcus species belonging to the mitis and mutans groups, induction of comX relies on the activation of a three-component system consisting of a secreted pheromone, a histidine kinase, and a response regulator. In Streptococcus thermophilus, a species belonging to the salivarius group, the oligopeptide transporter Ami is essential for comX expression under competence-inducing conditions. This suggests a different regulation pathway of competence based on the production and reimportation of a signal peptide. The objective of our work was to identify the main actors involved in the early steps of comX induction in S. thermophilus LMD-9. Using a transcriptomic approach, four highly induced early competence operons were identified. Among them, we found a Rgg-like regulator (Ster_0316) associated with a nonannotated gene encoding a 24-amino-acid hydrophobic peptide (Shp0316). Through genetic deletions, we showed that these two genes are essential for comX induction. Moreover, addition to the medium of synthetic peptides derived from the C-terminal part of Shp0316 restored comX induction and transformation of a Shp0316-deficient strain. These peptides also induced competence in S. thermophilus and Streptococcus salivarius strains that are poorly transformable or not transformable. Altogether, our results show that Ster_0316 and Shp0316, renamed ComRS, are the two members of a novel quorum-sensing system responsible for comX induction in species from the salivarius group, which differs from the classical phosphorelay three-component system identified previously in streptococci.
TI  - Emergence of a cell wall protease in the Streptococcus thermophilus population.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is perceived as a recently emerged food bacterium that evolved from a commensal ancestor by loss and gain of functions. Here, we provide data allowing a better understanding of this evolutionary scheme. A multilocus sequence typing approach that we developed showed that S. thermophilus diverges significantly from its potential ancestors of the salivarius group and displays a low level of allelic variability, confirming its likely recent emergence. An analysis of the origin and dissemination of the prtS gene was carried out within this evolutionary scheme. This gene encodes a protease that allows better growth in milk by facilitating casein breakdown to supply amino acids. The S. thermophilus protease exhibits 95% identity to the animal Streptococcus suis protein PrtS. Genomic analysis showed that prtS is part of an island flanked by two tandem insertion sequence elements and containing three other genes which present the best identities and synteny with the S. suis genome. These data indicate a potential origin for this "ecological" island in a species closely related to S. suis. The analysis of the distribution of the prtS gene in S. thermophilus showed that the gene is infrequent in historical collections but frequent in recent industrial ones. Moreover, this "ecological" island conferring an important metabolic trait for milk adaptation appears to have disseminated by lateral transfer in the S. thermophilus population. Taken together, these data support an evolutionary scheme of S. thermophilus where gene acquisition and selection by food producers are determining factors. The source and impact of genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer on the physiology and safety of strains should be addressed.
TI  - Evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16S rRNA-encoding, recA, secA, and secY gene sequences.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. Two of these species, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, Streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. Given that S. salivarius and S. vestibularis share several physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to S. thermophilus. However, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that S. vestibularis is more closely related to S. thermophilus. To determine whether this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from secA and secY, the general secretion housekeeping genes, recA, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16S rRNA-encoding gene sequences using other streptococcal species as outgroups. RESULTS: The maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) phylogenetic inferences derived from the secA and recA gene sequences provided strong support for the S. vestibularis/S. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16S rRNA-encoding and secY-based analyses could not discriminate between alternate topologies. Phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus. CONCLUSION: Our results corroborated the sister-relationship between S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of S. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.
TI  - Enumeration of starter cultures during yogurt production using Petrifilm AC plates associated with acidified MRS and M17 broths.
AB  - The efficiency of Petrifilm AC (3M Microbiology, St. Paul, MN, USA) associated with the broths M17 and de Mann-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) at pH 5.4 was evaluated to enumerate Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus during the yogurt production. Commercial and reference strains of these microorganisms were experimentally inoculated in nonfat milk and incubated at 42 degrees C for 4 h for yogurt production. At the moment of inoculation and after incubation, aliquots were collected, submitted to dilution using the broths M17 and MRS at pH 5.4, and plated for Strep. salivarius and Lb. bulgaricus enumeration according ISO 9232 and at Petrifilm AC plates, respectively. M17 plates were incubated at 42 degrees C, and MRS plates were incubated at 35 degrees C under anaerobiosis. After 48 h, the formed colonies were enumerated and the counts were compared by correlation and analysis of variance (P<0.05). In addition, colonies were randomly selected from all plates and characterized according to Gram staining and morphology. The obtained results indicated that Petrifilm AC plates associated to M17 and MRS at pH 5.4 can be considered as a suitable alternative for Strep. salivarius and Lb. bulgaricus enumeration during yogurt production, with slight interferences due to the acidity of MRS at the moment of inoculation, and due to the acidity of yogurt at the end of fermentation process. It was also observed that the MRS at pH 5.4 was not sufficiently selective for Lb. delbrueckii enumeration, despite it is indicated by the official protocol from ISO 9232.
TI  - Diversity of stress responses in dairy thermophilic streptococci.
AB  - Exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy Streptococcus species S. thermophilus, S. macedonicus and S. salivarius, were exposed to acid, osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. Three strains of dairy related streptococci, Lactococcus lactis ATCC11454, Enterococcus faecium DSM20477 and Enterococcus faecalis DSM20478, were included for comparison purposes. Acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. Cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrilamide Gel Electrophoresis, respectively. All strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. With a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. For some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses. Matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. Significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. Adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. Adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (DnaK, GprE, GroEL, and GroES) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between stress response and band intensity was evident.
TI  - Role of galK and galM in galactose metabolism by Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is unable to metabolize the galactose moiety of lactose. In this paper, we show that a transformant of S. thermophilus SMQ-301 expressing Streptococcus salivarius galK and galM was able to grow on galactose and expelled at least twofold less galactose into the medium during growth on lactose.
TI  - Galactose metabolism and capsule formation in a recombinant strain of Streptococcus thermophilus with a galactose-fermenting phenotype.
AB  - The capsule-producing, galactose-negative Streptococcus thermophilus MR-1C strain was first transformed with a low-copy plasmid containing a functional galK gene from Streptococcus salivarius to generate a recombinant galactose-fermenting Strep. thermophilus strain named MR-AAC. Then, we compared the functional properties of Strep. thermophilus MR-AAC with those of the parent MR-1C strain when used as starter for fermented products and cheese. In lactose-supplemented laboratory medium, MR-AAC metabolized galactose, but only when the amount of lactose was less than 0.1% (wt/vol). After 7 h of fermentation, the medium was almost depleted of galactose. The parent strain, MR-1C, showed the same pattern, except that the concentration of galactose decreased by only 25% during the same period. It was found that, during milk fermentation and Mozzarella cheese production, the galactose-fermenting phenotype was not expressed by MR-AAC and this strain expelled galactose into the medium at a level similar to the parent MR-1C strain. In milk and in lactose-supplemented medium, capsular exopolysaccharide production occurred mainly during the late exponential phase and the stationary growth phase with similar kinetics between MR-1C and MR-AAC.
TI  - Production of gamma-aminobutyric acid by Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus Y2 under submerged fermentation.
AB  - Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, has several well-known physiological functions and has been applied to the production of many drugs and functional foods. The technology of GABA production via submerged fermentation by Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus Y2 was investigated in this paper. It indicated that the GABA production was related to the biochemical characteristics of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) of S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus Y2. After 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C, which is the suitable culture conditions for GAD-production, then the culture condition were adjusted to the optimal temperature (40 degrees C) and pH (4.5) for the GAD reaction activity in biotransformation of cells and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (0.02 mmol/l) were added to the broth at the 48 h, the GABA production was increased up to 1.76-fold, reaching 7984.75 +/- 293.33 mg/l. The strain shows great potential use as a starter for GABA-containing yoghurt, cheese and other functional fermented food productions.
TI  - [Effect of probiotic lactic acid bacteria strains on virus infection].
AB  - The effect of probiotic lactic acid bacteria strains on viral infection was studied in experiments in vivo. It was shown that in investigations microbial substance based on living cells of L. plantarum and S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus strains manifested antiinfluenzal activity under administration of 0.3 ml of cultural medium per os at a dose of 3 x 10(8)/CFU mouse and antiherpetic activity at a dose of 0.3 x 10(9)/CFU mouse. The probiotic effectiveness was shown on the model of genital herpes of guinea-pigs at concentration of 1 x 10(9) cells/g.p. It was statistically established, that the lactic acid bacteria inhibited reproduction of HIV at a dose of cells of 0.1 x 10(9)/CFU ml.
TI  - [Adhesion of various species of lactic acid bacteria depending on the AB0 system  blood group].
AB  - The influence of the AB0 blood groups on adhesion of different lactic acid bacteria species was studied. From twelve investigated strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus species, difference between adhesion average index on erythrocytes of various blood groups was found in two strains. The average adhesion index of the strain E. faecium K-50 in A (II) blood group erythrocytes was higher (AAI = 4.91 +/- 0.26) than in B (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.17 +/- 0.33). The strain L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 4n has displayed a higher adhesive activity in A (II) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.36 +/- 0.13) in comparison with AB (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 3.61 +/- 0.75).
TI  - Spotlight on VSL#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, and B. infantis), and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - [Reversion of antibiotic-sensitivity of lactic acid bacteria in grafted cultures  of lymphoblastoid human cells].
AB  - The reversion of the antibiotic sensitivity of lactic acid bacteria: Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum have been studied. The phenomenon of the reversion has been fists studied in lactic acid bacteria of different taxonomic groups at their interactions with lymphoblastoid human cells. It is shown that resistance of lactobacteria to antibiotics can change depending on the terms of cultivation, genus and strain specificity. Most often the reversion of antibiotic sensitivity was observed with respect to fuzidin (26%) and cefepim (23%), most rarely--with respect to cephazolin, erithromicin, cefamandol, tobramicin and oxacillin.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the one humped camel milk  produced in Morocco.
AB  - One hundred and twenty (120) strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were enumerated and isolated from raw dromedary milk in Morocco using various cultured media. Strains isolated were characterized by phenotypic, physiological and biochemical properties. Results showed that high counts of LAB were found. Presumptive lactobacilli counts ranged from 2.5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive lactococci levels varied from 5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive streptococci counts varied from 4.2x10(2) to 8x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive leuconostoc levels ranged from 5.4x10(2) to 5.4x10(7)cfu/ml. Results showed also that Lactobacillus and Lactococcus were the predominant genera with 37.5% and 25.8%, respectively. The dominated species found were Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (17.5%), Lactobacillus helveticus (10%), Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (9.20%), Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei (5.80%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (5%). This is the first report on the characterization of LAB strains isolated from the one humped camel milk produced in Morocco.
TI  - VSL#3 probiotic mixture: a review of its use in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve and B. infantis) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.

TI  - [Study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  - A comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. At physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms. Lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) CFU/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) CFU/1 g in the intestine content. The spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. Quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. Quantity of E. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) CFU/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) CFU/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) CFU/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. Lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--L. plantarum and L. fermentum. All the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. Twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. The degree of adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. The highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in Enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. The screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. The strain of Lactobacillus plantarum 200D proved to be the most active one. A complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. The biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.
TI  - Conjugated linoleic acid content and organoleptic attributes of fermented milk products produced with probiotic bacteria.
AB  - The effect of probiotic bacteria on the formation of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), microbial growth, and organoleptic attributes (acidity, texture, and flavor) of fermented milk products was determined. Four probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 56, P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 51, and P. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii 23, were evaluated individually or in coculture with traditional yogurt cultures (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). The lipid source was hydrolyzed soy oil. L. rhamnosus, in coculture with yogurt culture, resulted in the highest content of CLA. Growth and CLA formation of propionibacteria were enhanced in the presence of yogurt cultures. Texture and flavor attributes of fermented milks produced with propionibacteria were significantly different than the fermented milks processed with yogurt cultures. The fermented milks processed with probiotic bacteria in coculture with yogurt cultures demonstrated similar acidity, texture, and flavor as the fermented milk produced with yogurt cultures.
TI  - Urease biogenesis in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Urease biogenesis was monitored in the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus during the growth cycle using in-gel detection and a phenol-hypochloride assay. Zymogram analysis, performed in a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, enabled visualization of a complex profile of bands whose number and intensity were dependent on the growth phase and culture conditions. The monitoring of urease biogenesis in batch fermentations revealed the onset of enzyme synthesis starting from the mid-exponential growth phase, with a maximum reached during the late exponential phase. Urease activity strongly increased at acidic pH but to a lesser extent when urea and nickel ions were added to the culture medium. When S. thermophilus cells were cultured with pH maintained at a neutral value, urease activity was detectable only in gel with extremely low signals. Evaluation of beta-glucuronidase activity in strain DSM 20617(T) harboring a transcriptional fusion between a DNA fragment containing the putative urease promoter and the gusA reporter evidenced significant expression at neutral pH that strongly increased in an acidic environment. Further experiments carried out on p(ureI)-gusA recombinant strain revealed that expression of ure genes was not affected by carbohydrates, nickel or urea availability. The presence of consistent expression of ure genes at neutral pH and the absence of induction of expression by carbohydrate availability demonstrated that the transcription of ure genes in S. thermophilus is regulated differently compared with that of the closely related S. salivarius. These differences are discussed taking into consideration the different habitats colonized by the two bacterial species.
TI  - The doubly phosphorylated form of HPr, HPr(Ser~P)(His-P), is abundant in exponentially growing cells of Streptococcus thermophilus and phosphorylates the lactose transporter LacS as efficiently as HPr(His~P).
AB  - In Streptococcus thermophilus, lactose is taken up by LacS, a transporter that comprises a membrane translocator domain and a hydrophilic regulatory domain homologous to the IIA proteins and protein domains of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). The IIA domain of LacS (IIALacS) possesses a histidine residue that can be phosphorylated by HPr(His~P), a protein component of the PTS. However, determination of the cellular levels of the different forms of HPr, namely, HPr, HPr(His~P), HPr(Ser-P), and HPr(Ser-P)(His~P), in exponentially lactose-growing cells revealed that the doubly phosphorylated form of HPr represented 75% and 25% of the total HPr in S. thermophilus ATCC 19258 and S. thermophilus SMQ-301, respectively. Experiments conducted with [32P]PEP and purified recombinant S. thermophilus ATCC 19258 proteins (EI, HPr, and IIALacS) showed that IIALacS was reversibly phosphorylated by HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) at a rate similar to that measured with HPr(His~P). Sequence analysis of the IIALacS protein domains from several S. thermophilus strains indicated that they can be divided into two groups on the basis of their amino acid sequences. The amino acid sequence of IIALacS from group I, to which strain 19258 belongs, differed from that of group II at 11 to 12 positions. To ascertain whether IIALacS from group II could also be phosphorylated by HPr(His~P) and HPr(Ser-P)(His~P), in vitro phosphorylation experiments were conducted with purified proteins from Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975, which possesses a IIALacS very similar to group II S. thermophilus IIALacS. The results indicated that S. salivarius IIALacS was phosphorylated by HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) at a higher rate than that observed with HPr(His~P). Our results suggest that the reversible phosphorylation of IIALacS in S. thermophilus is accomplished by HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) as well as by HPr(His~P).
TI  - Characterization of a galactokinase-positive recombinant strain of Streptococcus  thermophilus.
AB  - The lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus is widely used by the dairy  industry for its ability to transform lactose, the primary sugar found in milk, into lactic acid. Unlike the phylogenetically related species Streptococcus salivarius, S. thermophilus is unable to metabolize and grow on galactose and thus releases substantial amounts of this hexose into the external medium during growth on lactose. This metabolic property may result from the inability of S. thermophilus to synthesize galactokinase, an enzyme of the Leloir pathway that phosphorylates intracellular galactose to generate galactose-1-phosphate. In this work, we report the complementation of Gal(-) strain S. thermophilus SMQ-301 with S. salivarius galK, the gene that codes for galactokinase, and the characterization of recombinant strain SMQ-301K01. The recombinant strain, which was obtained by transformation of strain SMQ-301 with pTRKL2TK, a plasmid bearing S. salivarius galK, grew on galactose with a generation time of 55 min, which was almost double the generation time on lactose. Data confirmed that (i) the ability of SMQ-301K01 to grow on galactose resulted from the expression of S. salivarius galK and (ii) transcription of the plasmid-borne galK gene did not require GalR, a transcriptional regulator of the gal and lac operons, and did not interfere with the transcription of these operons. Unexpectedly, recombinant strain SMQ-301K01 still expelled galactose during growth on lactose, but only when the amount of the disaccharide in the medium exceeded 0.05%. Thus, unlike S. salivarius, the ability to metabolize galactose was not sufficient for S. thermophilus to simultaneously metabolize the glucose and galactose moieties of lactose. Nevertheless, during growth in milk and under time-temperature conditions that simulated those used to produce mozzarella cheese, the recombinant Gal(+) strain grew and produced acid more rapidly than the Gal(-) wild-type strain.
TI  - Survey of bacterial proteins released in cheese: a proteomic approach.
AB  - During the ripening of Emmental cheese, the bacterial ecosystem confers its organoleptic characteristics to the evolving curd both by the action of the living cells, and through the release of numerous proteins, including various types of enzymes into the cheese when the cells lyse. In Emmental cheese these proteins can be released from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters like Lactobacillus helveticus, Lb delbruecki subsp. lactis and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and ripening bacteria such as Propionibacterium freudenreichii. The aim of this study was to obtain a proteomic view of the different groups of proteins within the cheese using proteomic tools to create a reference map. A methodology was therefore developed to reduce the complexity of cheese matrix prior to 2D-PAGE analysis. The aqueous phase of cheese was prefractionated by size exclusion chromatography, bacterial and milk proteins were separated and subsequently characterised by mass spectrometry, prior to peptide mass fingerprint and sequence homology database search. Five functional groups of proteins were identified involved in: (i) proteolysis, (ii) glycolysis, (iii) stress response, (iv) DNA and RNA repair and (v) oxidoreduction. The results revealed stress responses triggered by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria and Propionibacterium strains at the end of ripening. Information was also obtained regarding the origin and nature of the peptidases released into the cheese, thus providing a greater understanding of casein degradation mechanisms during ripening. Different peptidases arose from St thermophilus and Lb helveticus, suggesting that streptococci are involved in peptide degradation in addition to the proteolytic activity of lactobacilli.
TI  - Changes in galactose and lactic acid content of sweet whey during storage.
AB  - Whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. During this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. This study surveyed industry samples of Cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees C) and abuse (37.8 degrees C) temperatures. Samples stored at 4 degrees C did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. Mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees C. Whey samples derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. Starter cultures evaluated included Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. Whey derived from L. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees C as compared with the other cultures. Galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from L. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees C in comparison with the other cultures. Results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees C) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees C varies depending on the culture(s) used in cheese production.
TI  - Two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy FA from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy FA. Two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. Two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of Pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(S)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(S)-OH 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10,13-OH 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including L. casei subsp. casei, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-OH 18:1). Seven strains of L. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-OH 18:0) through 10-OH 18:1. Linoleic acid at 2 g/L was converted by L. acidophilus IFO13951T to 1.3 g of 13(S)-OH 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-OH 18:0 in 7 d. Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei JCM 1111 produced 10-OH 18:1 in 91% yield, and L. plantarum JCM 8341, 10-OH 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/L) under optimal conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of 13(S)-OH 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria, and of 10,13-OH 18:0 by any bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of urease genes cluster of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - AIMS: The milk acidification rate of Streptococcus thermophilus strains can be affected by several factors, one of which is the hydrolysis of urea by the urease complex. To evaluate the technological suitability of S. thermophilus strains deprived of urease activity in milk fermentation, the genetic cluster related to urease enzymatic activity has been characterized in the type strain DSM 20167T. METHODS AND RESULTS: Amplification of the urease genes of S. thermophilus DSM 20167T was developed on the basis of the urease gene cluster of the phylogenetically related S. salivarius. Nucleotide sequencing revealed the presence of eight open reading frames, which were most homologous to ureABC (structural genes) and ureI, ureEFGD (accessory genes) of S. salivarius and other ureolytic bacteria. Reverse transcriptase PCR experiments were in agreement with an operon organization for the eight genes (ureIABCEFGD). A food grade mutant A16 (DeltaureC3) with a 693 bp in-frame deletion in ureC gene exhibited a urease negative (Ure-) phenotype. Unlike the wild-type strain, the acidification rate of the mutant in reconstituted skimmed milk was not affected by the presence of urea or nickel ions. A small-scale yoghurt fermentation trials were carried out using the wild-type or the Ure- mutant A16 (DeltaureC3) in co-culture with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 in presence of urea. The result obtained underlines that when the Ure- mutant was used as a co-starter the acidification rate was higher than that obtained using the wild-type strain. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides the first genetic characterization and the technological implication of S. thermophilus DSM 20617T urease activity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The detrimental effect of ureolytic activity on the rate of milk acidification was evaluated and superseded using a food-grade Ure- recombinant strain. Small-scale yoghurt production trials highlighted the positive role of a Ure-S. thermophilus mutant as a co-starter in milk fermentations. Moreover, the vector pMI108 developed for the construction of the Ure- strain, should be considered as a potential tool for the generation of Ure- dairy S. thermophilus strains selected for other relevant technological properties but characterized by the undesirable ureolytic phenotype.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the nickel uptake system for urease biogenesis in Streptococcus salivarius 57.I.
AB  - Ureases are multisubunit enzymes requiring Ni(2+) for activity. The low pH-inducible urease gene cluster in Streptococcus salivarius 57.I is organized as an operon, beginning with ureI, followed by ureABC (structural genes), and ureEFGD (accessory genes). Urease biogenesis also requires a high-affinity Ni(2+) uptake system. By searching the partial genome sequence of a closely related organism, Streptococcus thermophilus LMG18311, three open reading frame (ORFs) homologous to those encoding proteins involved in cobalamin biosynthesis and cobalt transport (cbiMQO) were identified immediately 3' to the ure operon. To determine whether these genes were involved in urease biogenesis by catalyzing Ni(2+) uptake in S. salivarius, regions 3' to ureD were amplified by PCRs from S. salivarius by using primers identical to the S. thermophilus sequences. Sequence analysis of the products revealed three ORFs. Reverse transcriptase PCR was used to demonstrate that the ORFs are transcribed as part of the ure operon. Insertional inactivation of ORF1 with a polar kanamycin marker completely abolished urease activity and the ability to accumulate (63)Ni(2+) during growth. Supplementation of the growth medium with NiCl(2) at concentrations as low as 2.5 micro M partially restored urease activity in the mutant. Both wild-type and mutant strains showed enhanced urease activity when exogenous Ni(2+) was provided at neutral pH. Enhancement of urease activity by adding nickel was regulated at the posttranslational level. Thus, ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3 are part of the ure operon, and these genes, designated ureM, ureQ, and ureO, respectively, likely encode a Ni(2+)-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter.
TI  - Phosphorylation of Streptococcus salivarius lactose permease (LacS) by HPr(His ~  P) and HPr(Ser-P)(His ~ P) and effects on growth.
AB  - The oral bacterium Streptococcus salivarius takes up lactose via a transporter called LacS that shares 95% identity with the LacS from Streptococcus thermophilus, a phylogenetically closely related organism. S. thermophilus releases galactose into the medium during growth on lactose. Expulsion of galactose is mediated via LacS and stimulated by phosphorylation of the transporter by HPr(His approximately P), a phosphocarrier of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (PTS). Unlike S. thermophilus, S. salivarius grew on lactose without expelling galactose and took up galactose and lactose concomitantly when it is grown in a medium containing both sugars. Analysis of the C-terminal end of S. salivarius LacS revealed a IIA-like domain (IIA(LacS)) almost identical to the IIA domain of S. thermophilus LacS. Experiments performed with purified proteins showed that S. salivarius IIA(LacS) was reversibly phosphorylated on a histidine residue at position 552 not only by HPr(His approximately P) but also by HPr(Ser-P)(His approximately P), a doubly phosphorylated form of HPr present in large amounts in rapidly growing S. salivarius cells. Two other major S. salivarius PTS proteins, IIAB(L)(Man) and IIAB(H)(Man), were unable to phosphorylate IIA(LacS). The effect of LacS phosphorylation on growth was studied with strain G71, an S. salivarius enzyme I-negative mutant that cannot synthesize HPr(His approximately P) or HPr(Ser-P)(His approximately P). These results indicated that (i) the wild-type and mutant strains had identical generation times on lactose, (ii) neither strain expelled galactose during growth on lactose, (iii) both strains metabolized lactose and galactose concomitantly when grown in a medium containing both sugars, and (iv) the growth of the mutant was slightly reduced on galactose.
TI  - [Design of primers to DNA of lactic acid bacteria].
AB  - Primers LP1-LP2 to the gene 16S rRNA have been developed, which permit to differentiate lactic acid bacteria: Lactobacillus plantarum, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. The strain-specific and species-specific differentiations are possible under different annealing temperature. Additional fragments, which are synthesized outside the framework of gene 16S rRNA reading, provide for the strain-specific type of differentiation, and the fragment F864 read in the gene 16S rRNA permits identifying L. plantarum.
TI  - The effect of temperature and pH on the growth of lactic acid bacteria: a pH-auxostat study.
AB  - The growth of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a pH-auxostat. The computer-controlled smooth change of pH or temperature was used to study the effect of pH and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield Y(ATP) and specific lactate production rate Q(ATP)). The behaviour of mu and Q(ATP) with an increase of temperature suggested that ATP production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The decrease of Y(ATP) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while Q(ATP) remained constant or even increased. With the decrease of pH, decrease of both Y(ATP) and Q(ATP) was observed. S. thermophilus St20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees C was the most acid sensitive strain. The L. paracasei E1H3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to pH change. The behaviour of mixed culture of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus in milk in a pH-auxostat with pH-decrease was in agreement with the pure culture experiments of the same species. The study showed that pH-auxostat with smooth controlled change of pH and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of LAB.
TI  - Influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  - Intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. The stimulus of the mucosal immunity is not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. In previous works we have demonstrated that some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. Taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis on the IgA secreting cells associated to bronchus. As shown before, oral immunostimulation with LAB induced an increase of the IgA* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. In this study it is also showed that the LAB assayed, with exception of L. acidophilus, were able to enhance IgA+ cells at bronchial level, being also this effect dose dependent. The increment induced by some LAB in the number of IgA+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be very important to prevent bronchus diseases.
TI  - 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region sequence variation in Streptococcus thermophilus and related dairy streptococci and development of a multiplex ITS-SSCP analysis for their identification.
AB  - The 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of several Streptococcus thermophilus strains and some related dairy streptococci, S. macedonicus, S. salivarius and S. bovis, was analysed by sequence analysis. All the Streptococcus species were easily discriminated on the basis of sequence variations principally located upstream and downstream of the region encompassing the double-stranded processing sites and the tRNA(Ala) gene. Comparison between tRNA(Ala) gene sequences highlighted a high level of sequence conservation among the Streptococcus species investigated despite their belonging to separated phylogenetic clusters, i.e. the S. salivarius and S. bovis rRNA groups. A low but significant degree of variability was detected among the S. thermophilus strains, allowing the identification of four different ITS sequences. Similarity analysis of the ITS sequences showed that the Streptococcus species were clustered in two main branches, one containing S. macedonicus and S. bovis strains, and one containing S. thermophilus and S. salivarius strains. With the aim of developing a rapid tool for the identification of the dairy streptococci species a multiplex ITS-SSCP analysis of two discrete regions within the ITS locus was carried out.
TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in traditional African yoghurt fermentation.
AB  - Growth and survival of a nontoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ATCC 43888) was determined in traditionally fermented pasteurized milk. Preheated milk was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of a mixed culture of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (NCIMB 11778) and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (NCIMB 110368) and incubated at 25, 30, 37 or 43 degrees C for 24 h. E. coli O157:H7 (10(5) CFU/ml) were introduced into the milk pre- and post-fermentation. Fermented milk samples were subsequently stored at either 4 degrees C (refrigerator temperature) or 25 degrees C (to mimic African ambient temperature) for 5 days. After 24 h of fermentation, the pH of the samples fermented at the higher temperatures of 37-43 degrees C decreased from 6.8 to 4.4-4.0 ( +/- 0.2) whereas at the lower temperature of 25 degrees C, the pH decreased to pH 5.0 +/- 0.1. During this period, viable counts for E. coli O157:H7 increased from 10(5) to 10(8) - 10(9) CFU/ml except in milk fermented at 43 degrees C wherein viability declined to 10(4) CFU/ml. In fermented (25-30 degrees C) milk stored at 4 degrees C for 5 days, E. coli O157:H7 viability decreased from 10(8-9) to 10(6-7) CFU/ml whereas milk fermented at 43 degrees C resulted in loss of detectable cells. In contrast, storage of fermented milk samples at 25 degrees C for 5 days eventually resulted in complete loss of viability irrespective of fermentation temperature. Stationary phase E. coli O157:H7 inoculated post-fermentation (25 and 43 degrees C) survived during 4 degrees C storage, but not 25 degrees C storage. Fermentation temperature and subsequent storage temperature are critical to the growth and survival of E. coli O157:H7 in traditional fermented products involving yoghurt starter cultures.
TI  - Behavior of Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus in yogurt fermented  with a bacteriocin-producing thermophilic starter.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus B producing a bacteriocin active against Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 7644 and Staphylococcus aureus SAD 30 was isolated from bakery yeast. The bacteriocin was partially purified by an adsorption/desorption technique, and its spectrum of action was compared to that of a neutralized cell-free supernatant (CFS). Although the CFS inhibited a number of gram-positive and -negative bacteria of health and spoilage significance, the spectrum of action of the partially purified bacteriocin was limited to gram-positive bacteria. L. monocytogenes was the most sensitive to both preparations. The bacteriocin-producing streptococcal strain was used in combination with a Bac- Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CY strain isolated from commercial yogurt to assess the effectiveness of the resulting thermophilic starter in controlling L. monocytogenes and S. aureus in yogurt during fermentation and storage at refrigeration (ca. 7 degrees C) or abuse (ca. 22 degrees C) temperature. Yogurt samples were contaminated with L. monocytogenes or S. aureus to the approximate levels of 10(3) and 10(6) CFU/ml of milk, respectively. The results showed that in situ bacteriocin production was more active against L. monocytogenes than against S. aureus in vitro and in contaminated samples. While L. monocytogenes leveled off below the detectable limit in a 1-ml sample of yogurt within 24 h of processing, S. aureus survived in Bac+ and Bac- samples during 10 days of storage at room temperature (ca. 22 degrees C). Use of a Bac+ starter resulted in a 5-day extension of the shelf life.
TI  - Simulation modelling of bacterial growth in yoghurt.
AB  - INDISIM, an individual-based simulator, was used to specifically study the influence of the shape and size of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in yoghurt processing. To this effect, two different sets of simulations were carried out. In the first set of simulations, it was assumed that the initial acidity of the medium has the same value as the acidity of the cytoplasm of the microorganisms. Hence, the differences in bacterial growth by the two species are only attributable to differences in their geometry. It was found that, in an optimum culture, the growth in biomass of S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus is larger than that of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. An important factor for understanding this difference might be the larger mass-to-surface ratio of the former. In the second set of simulations, a simplified model of yoghurt, the parametrisation differs both in the geometry and the metabolism of the two species. The results of these simulations are in very good qualitative agreement with the experimental data of [Lait 69 (1989) 519]. Finally, by inhibiting the uptake of amino acids by S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, the large relative importance of lactic acid in yoghurt processing was highlighted.
TI  - Galactose and lactose genes from the galactose-positive bacterium Streptococcus salivarius and the phylogenetically related galactose-negative bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus: organization, sequence, transcription, and activity of the gal gene products.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius is a lactose- and galactose-positive bacterium that is phylogenetically closely related to Streptococcus thermophilus, a bacterium that metabolizes lactose but not galactose. In this paper, we report a comparative characterization of the S. salivarius and S. thermophilus gal-lac gene clusters. The clusters have the same organization with the order galR (codes for a transcriptional regulator and is transcribed in the opposite direction), galK (galactokinase), galT (galactose-1-P uridylyltransferase), galE (UDP-glucose 4-epimerase), galM (galactose mutarotase), lacS (lactose transporter), and lacZ (beta-galactosidase). An analysis of the nucleotide sequence as well as Northern blotting and primer extension experiments revealed the presence of four promoters located upstream from galR, the gal operon, galM, and the lac operon of S. salivarius. Putative promoters with virtually identical nucleotide sequences were found at the same positions in the S. thermophilus gal-lac gene cluster. An additional putative internal promoter at the 3' end of galT was found in S. thermophilus but not in S. salivarius. The results clearly indicated that the gal-lac gene cluster was efficiently transcribed in both species. The Shine-Dalgarno sequences of galT and galE were identical in both species, whereas the ribosome binding site of S. thermophilus galK differed from that of S. salivarius by two nucleotides, suggesting that the S. thermophilus galK gene might be poorly translated. This was confirmed by measurements of enzyme activities.
TI  - Prediction of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus populations in yoghurt by Curie point pyrolysis-mass spectrometry.
AB  - We evaluated the potential of pyrolysis-mass spectrometry (PyMS) for quantifying  the binary mixed population of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in yoghurt. For this purpose, a new analytical approach was developed. The yoghurt was transparised and its total bacterial population was recovered by centrifugation and estimated by turbidimetric measurement. The quantity of each population (L. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus) was then estimated in the pellet by PyMS, and the data were analysed by artificial neural networks (ANNs). In parallel, streptococci and lactobacilli were numerated on SYL agar and these data were used as reference values to predict the bacterial counts of each population by PyMS. A close correlation was established between the streptococci and the lactobacilli counts on SYL agar and PyMS measurements (r(2)=0.98 for S. thermophilus and r(2)=0.96 for L. bulgaricus). Combined turbidimetric measurement and PyMS/ANNs seemed to be a powerful method for obtaining rapid counts of binary mixtures of bacteria in yoghurt.
TI  - [Viability and activity of the lactic bacteria (Streptococcus salivarius ssp thermophilus y Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus) del yogurt en Venezuela].
AB  - National and international legislations have agreed that the population of lactic bacteria in yogurt must be viable and not less than 10(6) ufc/g. In Venezuela, during last years, observations indicate that the number of viable cells in some commercial samples show high variations, as low levels. This research attempted to find the origin of this problem in the local industry. For this purpose 105 commercial samples were analyzed during their shelf life and 32 samples of yogurt prepared in the laboratory following the flow diagram of the local industry. The different conditions of freeze dried lactic culture, were also analyzed. These samples were evaluated for viable cell count of lactic bacteria and possible variations of pH and acidity. The absence or low number of lactic bacteria detected in some commercial samples is due to the use of inadequate working cultures that show imbalanced proportions of the two microorganisms, besides a low count below 106 ufc/g. The succesive propagation and storage time of mother culture, and the overacidification of the product, produce subletal injury to the microbial cells of the yogurt starter culture. The data indicate that manufacturing practices significantly affect the survival of the lactic flora.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Streptococcus thermophilus plasmid closely related to the pMV158 family.
AB  - Twenty-two Streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. Fifteen S. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using DNA homology. Ten plasmids were classified within group A and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced S. thermophilus plasmids. Three plasmids (group B) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups C and D). Single-stranded DNA was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups A, C, and D, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. The only plasmid of group C, named pSMQ172, was further characterized. This 4230-bp plasmid replicates in Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. Comparisons with databases showed that pSMQ172 was related to pMV158 of Streptococcus agalactiae and to pSSU1 of Streptococcus suis. These results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Production and monomer composition of exopolysaccharides by yogurt starter cultures.
AB  - As components of starter cultures for Bulgarian yogurt, Streptococcus salivarius  subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus revealed extensive exopolysaccharide (EPS) production activity when cultivated in whole cow's milk. The polymer-forming activity of thermophilic streptococci was lower (230-270 mg EPS/L) than that of the lactobacilli (400-540 mg EPS/L). Mixed cultures stimulated EPS production in yogurt manufacture, and a maximum concentration of 720-860 mg EPS/L was recorded after full coagulation of milk. The monomer structure of the exopolysaccharides formed by the yogurt starter cultures principally consists of galactose and glucose (1:1), with small amounts of xylose, arabinose, and/or mannose.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the Bifidobacterium longum MB 219 lacZ gene.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of Escherichia coli from Bifidobacterium longum MB219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten Bifidobacterium strains tested of the species B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, B. indicum, B. animalis and B. cuniculi. The nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to E. coli revealed the presence of a lacZ-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site. A sequence showing 72% identity with the proline tRNA of Bacillus subtilis and a gene probably encoding the DNA-3-methyladenine glycosydase I were located downstream from the lacZ gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. By primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacZ gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the -10 region of the putative promoter. The nucleotide sequence of lacZ and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes and enzymes from other microorganisms. High similarity was demonstrated between the B. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Leuconostoc lactis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the LacZ family. The B. longum MB219 lacZ gene was cloned in Bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. The expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.
TI  - Behavior of enterotoxigenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus in milk fermented with a yogurt starter culture.
AB  - The ability of a yogurt starter culture formed by Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus to inhibit the growth of four enterotoxin type A and B producers Staphylococcus aureus strains (ATCC 6538, S6, FRI-100 and a strain isolated from milk) during fermentation of milk and subsequent storage was investigated. Sterile skim milk was inoculated with about 10(6) CFU/ml of S. aureus and with about 10(6) CFU of starter culture, and incubated at 42 degrees C during 8 h, followed by refrigeration at 4 degrees C. Samples were taken every 2 h during fermentation and every 2 days during storage. Viable count of lactic acid bacteria and S. aureus as well as pH, acidity, thermostable deoxyribonuclease (TNase) and staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) production were evaluated. Behavior of four strains was similar; S. aureus survived the 8 h fermentation with LAB, and its population began to decrease from the first day of storage, being completely inhibited at 9-10 days. TNase and SEA production were positive in all samples taken along the study. It was demonstrated that enterotoxigenic strains of S. aureus were able to survive the fermentation of milk with a yogurt starter culture and they were inhibited after several days during storage of the fermented product, contrary to the general belief which considered it very difficult due to the low pH. Even though S. aureus was inhibited, TNase and SEA were demonstrable along the storage. Therefore, fermented milks may play an important role in the transmission of this organism.
TI  - Oral bacteriotherapy as maintenance treatment in patients with chronic pouchitis: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pouchitis is the major long-term complication after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. Most patients have relapsing disease, and no maintenance treatment study has been performed. We evaluated the efficacy of a probiotic preparation (VSL#3) containing 5 x 10(11) per gram of viable lyophilized bacteria of 4 strains of lactobacilli, 3 strains of bifidobacteria, and 1 strain of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus compared with placebo in maintenance of remission of chronic pouchitis. METHODS: Forty patients in clinical and endoscopic remission were randomized to receive either VSL#3, 6 g/day, or an identical placebo for 9 months. Patients were assessed clinically every month and endoscopically and histologically every 2 months or in the case of a relapse. Fecal samples were collected for stool culture before and after antibiotic treatment and each month during maintenance treatment. RESULTS: Three patients (15%) in the VSL#3 group had relapses within the 9-month follow-up period, compared with 20 (100%) in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Fecal concentration of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and S. thermophilus increased significantly from baseline levels only in the VSL#3-treated group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that oral administration of this new probiotic preparation is effective in preventing flare-ups of chronic pouchitis.
TI  - Probiotic culture survival and implications in fermented frozen yogurt characteristics.
AB  - Low-fat ice cream mix was fermented with probiotic-supplemented and traditional starter culture systems and evaluated for culture survival, composition, and sensory characteristics of frozen product. Fermentations were stopped when the titratable acidity reached 0.15% greater than the initial titratable acidity (end point 1) or when the pH reached 5.6 (end point 2). Mix was frozen and stored for 11 wk at -20 degrees C. The traditional yogurt culture system contained the strains Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. The probiotic-supplemented system contained the traditional cultures as well as Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus. We compared recovery of Bifodobacterium by three methods, a repair-detection system with roll-tubes and plates on modified bifid glucose medium and plates with maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial medium. Culture bacteria in both systems did not decrease in the yogurt during frozen storage. The roll-tube method with modified bifid glucose agar and repair detection system provided at least one-half log10 cfu/ml higher recovery of B. longum compared with recoveries using modified bifid glucose agar or maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial agar on petri plates. No change in concentrations of lactose or protein for products fermented with either culture system occurred during storage. Acid flavor was more intense when product was fermented to pH 5.6, but yogurt flavor was not intensified. The presence of probiotic bacteria in the supplemented system seemed to cause no differences in protein and lactose concentration and sensory characteristics.
TI  - Quantification of micro-organisms in binary mixed populations by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy.
AB  - Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used for the first time to determine the ratios of different microorganisms in mixtures. Exemplarily, systems composed of two food-associated yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae/Hanseniaspora uvarum) and two yoghurt lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus/Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) were investigated. Determination of the cell number ratio in the lactic acid bacteria system was possible with a minimal prediction accuracy of +/- 16 ratio percentage points while the minimum accuracy of prediction in the yeast two-component system was +/- 4% (both at a 95% confidence level). These results show that FT-IR spectroscopy is potentially a rapid method for the quantification of cell ratios in mixtures of two different microorganisms, provided that the cell ratio does not drop below a certain, system-specific threshold.
TI  - Impact on the composition of the faecal flora by a new probiotic preparation: preliminary data on maintenance treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) oral compounds are the standard maintenance treatment for ulcerative colitis in remission, some patients cannot use them because of side-effects. Clinical and experimental observations have suggested the potential role of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease therapy. AIM: To evaluate the effects on intestinal microflora and the clinical efficacy of a new probiotic preparation in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with ulcerative colitis, intolerant or allergic to 5-ASA, have been treated with a new probiotic preparation (VSL#3, CSL, Milan, Italy) containing 5x10(11) cells/g of 3 strains of bifidobacteria, 4 strains of lactobacilli and 1 strain of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Two doses of 3 g were administered o.d. for 12 months. Faecal samples for stool culture were obtained from the patients at the beginning of the trial and after 10, 20, 40, 60, 75, 90 days, 12 months and at 15 days after the end of the treatment. The following bacterial groups have been evaluated in the faeces: total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, enterococci, Streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms. Patients were assessed clinically every two months, and assessed endoscopically at 6 and 12 months or in relapse. RESULTS: Faecal concentrations of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increased significantly in all patients, compared to their basal level, from the 20th day of treatment (P<0.05) and remained stable throughout the study. Concentrations of Bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms, total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria did not change significantly during treatment (P = N.S.). Fifteen of 20 treated patients remained in remission during the study, one patient was lost to follow up, while the remaining relapsed. No significant side-effects have been reported. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that this probiotic preparation is able to colonize the intestine, and suggest that it may be useful in maintaining the remission in ulcerative colitis patients intolerant or allergic to 5-ASA. Controlled trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary results.
TI  - Starter culture activity in refrigerated fermented soymilk.
AB  - The refrigerated shelf life of soymilk fermented with single cultures of Lactobacillus fermentum, L. casei, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, and Bifidobacterium longum was evaluated. During storage at 4 degrees C for 28 days, the stability of the microflora differed markedly among the starter cultures. After 28 days, the average numbers of S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus decreased by two log cycles to 6.0 x 10(7) CFU/ml, whereas those of L. casei increased gradually by more than two log cycles to 4.6 x 10(9) CFU/ml. Numbers of B. longum and L. fermentum remained moderately high (8.7 x 10(8) CFU/ml and 3.7 x 10(8) CFU/ml, respectively) even after 28 days of storage. S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and L. casei continued to metabolize sucrose during the storage period, but the pattern of consumption was different among the strains. The other starter cultures did not seem to have significant activity (P > 0.05) on the residual sugars. In most cases, L(+)-lactate predominated.
TI  - Study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. Antigens administered orally can interact with M cells of Peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. We have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance the gut inflammatory immune response. The aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. We studied IgA+ and IgM+ B cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and CD4+ T cells and IgA anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by oral administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. plantarum, Lb. rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. The increase in the IgA+ B cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the IgA cycle by interaction with M cells from Peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. The IgM+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from IgM+ to IgA+. The increase in the CD4+ cells suggests interaction of Peyer's patches and enhancement of the B- and T-cell migration. The anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. We demonstrated that Lb. casei and Lb. plantarum were able to interact with Peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in IgA-, CD4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. Lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. Although Lb. rhamnosus and Strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. Lactococcus lactis and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of IgA+ cells entering the IgA cycle but not CD4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated B lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. We did not determine specific antibodies against Lc. lactis or Lb. bulgaricus.
TI  - Note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of Bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  - Pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis and Bif. bifidum), Lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. The appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. Of the selective media, AMC, RMS, NPNL and BL-OG performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lact. acidophilus. However, of these four media, AMC was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. The AMC agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.
TI  - CtsR, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - clpP and clpC of Bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the Clp ATP-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. They play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the so-called class III group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. The product of ctsR, the first gene of the clpC operon, has now been shown to act as a repressor of both clpP and clpC, as well as clpE, which encodes a novel member of the Hsp100 Clp ATPase family. The CtsR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. Random mutagenesis, DNasel footprinting and DNA sequence deletions and comparisons were used to define a consensus CtsR recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. This target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc oenos, Lactobacillus sake, Lactococcus lactis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. CtsR homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by CtsR is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Bacteria used for the production of yogurt inactivate carcinogens and prevent DNA damage in the colon of rats.
AB  - Lactic acid-producing bacteria prevent carcinogen-induced preneoplastic lesions and tumors in rat colon. Because the mechanisms responsible for these protective effects are unknown, two strains of lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CH3, that are used to produce yogurt, were investigated in vitro and in vivo to elucidate their potential to deactivate carcinogens. Using the "Comet assay" to detect genetic damage, we found that L. bulgaricus 191R applied orally to rats could prevent 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced DNA breaks in the colon in vivo, whereas St. thermophilus CH3 were not effective. However, in vitro, both strains prevented DNA damage induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in isolated primary rat colon cells. Extracts prepared from milk fermented with St. thermophilus CH3 were as efficient in deactivating MNNG as was L-cysteine. Isolated metabolites arising from bacteria during fermentation in the colon or in milk [L(+) lactate, D(-) lactate, palmitic acid and isopalmitic acid] were not effective. We postulate that thiol-containing breakdown products of proteins, via catalysis by bacterial proteases, could be one mechanism by which MNNG or other carcinogens are deactivated in the gut lumen resulting in reduced damage to colonic mucosal cells.
TI  - Random amplified polymorphic DNA and amplified ribosomal DNA spacer polymorphism: powerful methods to differentiate Streptococcus thermophilus strains.
AB  - Streptococci from different collections and dairy materials were characterized by conventional and molecular methods. After amplification of the 16S-23S rDNA spacer region, all the strains referable to the genus Streptococcus exhibited a single polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product, allowing their differentiation from enterococci. Cleaving this PCR product with Hae III, two different restriction patterns could be observed, allowing Streptococcus salivarius DSM 20560T, Strep. thermophilus NCDO 822 and two strains of Streptococcus spp. to be gathered in one group and all the other strains in another. In order to achieve strain typing, all the cultures were investigated by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis employing two selected primers. The results were treated by cluster analysis, appearing significantly consistent with both the taxonomic position and the origin of the strains. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of Sma I digests of the genomic DNA from 11 representative strains with decreasing levels of RAPD similarity allowed their diversity to be confirmed, even though RAPD-PCR proved to be less discriminating than PFGE analysis. The results are discussed with reference to the capability of the analytical procedures used to aid both identification and strain typing of streptococci, as well as the taxonomic structure of the species Strep. thermophilus.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Cell wall anchoring of the Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The M6 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. Based on the observation that the C-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the M6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several Lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing Lactobacillus fermentum strain, Lactobacillus sake, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. The M6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. In lactobacilli, essentially all detectable M6 protein was cell wall associated. These results suggest the feasibility of using the C-terminal anchor moiety of M6 for protein surface display in LAB.
TI  - Natural milk cultures for the production of Argentinian cheeses.
AB  - Samples (32) of natural milk cultures used in the Santa Fe, Argentina, area for soft and semihard cheese production were examined. The microbial composition (including lactic acid microflora characterization) and technological parameters (acidifying and proteolytic activities) were evaluated. The cultures contained mainly thermophilic lactic acid bacteria, identified as Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (96.8% of the total strains) and Enterococcus spp. The strains showed a low proteolytic activity. The isolates of S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus exhibited a widespread phage resistance. The nonlactic microflora comprised coliforms, yeasts, spore-forming bacteria and lactate fermentative bacteria. The samples showed an acidity level from 0.38 to 0.69% lactic acid (pH from 4.25 to 5.75). The acidifying activity was optimal at 45 degrees C. The advantages and disadvantages of the employment of natural milk starters are discussed.
TI  - The cpsABCDE genes involved in polysaccharide production in Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus strain NCBF 2393.
AB  - A 4074-bp EcoRI fragment of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (S. thermophilus) chromosomal DNA containing genes involved in exocellular polysaccharide (EPS) was identified and cloned. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment was determined and found to contain one partial and four complete open reading frames. These were designated cpsA, cpsB, cpsC, cpsD and cpsE and encoded proteins of > 130, 243, 230, 246 and 455 amino acids, respectively, that showed homology with the genes of the cps cluster, involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis, in Streptococcus pneumoniae Type 19F. The cpsA gene is predicted to encode a transcriptional regulator, while cpsC and cpsD are predicted to encode proteins involved in polysaccharide polymerization and export. The cpsE gene is likely to encode the phosphate-prenyl glycosyl-1-phosphate transferase catalyzing the first step in polysaccharide biosynthesis in S. thermophilus. Southern blot analysis revealed that cpsE is found only in polysaccharide producing strains of S. thermophilus.
TI  - Selection of an adhesive phenotype of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus for use in fixed-bed reactors.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus was cultivated in a chemostat in order to obtain an adhesive phenotype of this strain. When the system was operated at low dilution rates (D < 0.2 h-1) for about 4 weeks, the strain formed a visible film on the surface of the culture vessel. The biofilm cells were not washed out even when dilution rates were increased (D = 6.9 h-1), and this resulted in a high biomass productivity (P = 4.1 g1(-1) h-1). On the other hand, when the culture was grown at dilution rates faster than 0.2 h-1, only the free suspended cells were present in the culture broth, and were washed out at velocities of about 1.0 h-1. The biomass productivity was consequently lower (P = 1.33 g1(-1) h-1) than in the previous case. The selected adhesive phenotype was grown on different glass beads and the possibility of lactate fermentation in a continuous and semicontinuous mode was demonstrated.
TI  - Antimutagenicity of yogurt.
AB  - Yogurt is milk fermented by a mixture of two bacteria: Lactobacillus delbrueckii  ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Epidemiological studies have correlated a reduced risk of colon cancer with yogurt consumption. Independent studies have established that yogurt and extracts thereof are antimutagenic. Although multiple explanations can account for yogurt's putative anticarcinogenicity, we are interested in testing the hypothesis that antimutagenic compounds produced during fermentation are responsible. We recently reported on the antimutagenicity of an acetone extract of yogurt against the experimental carcinogens N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and 3.2'dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) (Mutation Res. (1995) 334, 213-224). We are now aware that palmitic acid is an active ingredient against MNNG.
TI  - Lowering of ochratoxin A level in milk by yoghurt bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - A decrease in the content of ochratoxin A (OA) was observed in milk samples fermented by yoghurt bacteria and bifidobacteria. OA was added to the milk before fermentation at a rate of 0.05-1.5 mg/L. No residues of OA were found in samples containing 0.05 and 0.1 mg/L of OA, fermented by S. Salivarius subsp. thermophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and B. bifidum. Yoghurt bacteria (S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) were the most effective since no residues were detected even in fermented samples containing originally 0.5 mg/L OA.
TI  - 16S-23S and 23S-5S intergenic spacer regions of Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus salivarius, primary and secondary structure.
AB  - The 16S-23S intergenic spacer region (spacer region 1) of Streptococcus salivarius, S. thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and the 23S-5S intergenic spacer region (spacer region 2) of S. salivarius and L. lactis subsp. cremoris were sequenced and compared with the spacer regions 1 and 2 of other streptococci. A high degree of intraspecific conservation was observed for S. thermophilus and L. lactis, and very similar sequences were found for S. salivarius and S. thermophilus. Whereas spacer region 1 is highly conserved in the genus Streptococcus sensu-stricto, only the tRNA gene and the rRNA processing stems are highly conserved in the three genera: Streptococcus sensu-stricto, Lactococcus, and Enterococcus. The presence of a unique tRNA(Ala) gene without the 3' terminal CCA sequence seems to be a general feature of the streptococci spacer region 1. A secondary structure model was built to show the interaction between the spacer regions 1 and 2 of S. thermophilus and S. salivarius. The rapid evolution of spacer region 1 in streptococci is in part due to insertions and deletions of small RNA stem/loop structures.
TI  - [Comparison of methods for the detection and enumeration of lactic acid bacteria  in yogurt].
AB  - It is generally agreed that the population of lactic acid bacteria in yogurt must be not less than 10(6) ufc/g. Viability of the lactic flora until the end of shelf-life is affected for many factors, which has incidence in the recuperability of this microflora. MRS and LEE agar were selected for the total count of lactic bacteria, the M17 was used for the S salivarius ssp thermophilus and the RCA for L. delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus. Different methodologies were used for detection and enumeration of this bacteria: direct plate count; thermal treatment and recuperation of the injured cells in Soy Tripticase broth. The enumeration was done at time zero and 3 hours after the start of the fermentative process and during storage at 4, 12 and 21 days. The results shown an excellent recuperability of the lactic flora in the selected media and methods that were used: however the enumeration was significatively lower in the RCA agar. The counts in the LEE agar shown a better recuperability. The thermal treatment affected negatively the counts of lactic flora and the repair method shown better results in the yogurt sample during storage. pH and acidity were determined at the beginning and during the storage period. It was observed a pH decrease because of the lactic acid production at the end of shelf-life.
TI  - Amino acid requirements and peptidase activities of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the relationship between amino acid requirements and peptidase enzyme systems in three Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strains. A synthetic medium without nitrogen components and a milk (RD milk) without its non-protein nitrogen fraction were prepared with different mixtures of amino acids. The strains showed different amino acid requirements. Some amino acids proved to be essential, some were required, while others did not affect growth. In the synthetic medium, only leucine and glutamic acid were essential for growth. In RD milk, the amino acid requirements were found to be lower, with only the absence of glutamic acid causing complete inhibition of growth. Relationships between aminopeptidase activities of the strains and their amino acid requirements were observed. Strains with higher amino acid requirements were also found to express a wider range of peptidases.
TI  - Influence of bile on beta-galactosidase activity of component species of yogurt starter cultures.
AB  - The influence of bile on beta-galactosidase activity and the cellular integrity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus were tested. Two strains (OS 1 and OS 2) of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and three strains (HC 15, 17, and 18) of S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus were studied. In the presence of .15% oxgall, beta-galactosidase activity of whole cells of both species was significantly increased. However, at a higher concentration (.3% oxgall), the beta-galactosidase activity was significantly less than in the presence of .15% oxgall. The presence of oxgall did not promote the cell lysis of any of the strains of either species. Additionally, the presence of oxgall did not cause the leakage of the enzyme from the cells. Thus, the presence of oxgall increased the cellular permeability to allow more substrate to enter the cells, thereby increasing beta-galactosidase activity, and, at higher concentrations, was inhibitory to beta-galactosidase activity of both species.
TI  - On-line estimation of biological variables during pH controlled lactic acid fermentations.
AB  - Indirect measurement of lactose, galactose, lactic acid, and biomass concentration from on-line sodium hydroxide weight measurements have been obtained for pure and mixed batch cultures of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus 404 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 398 conducted at controlled pH and temperature. Linear correlations were established between the equivalent sodium hydroxide concentration and the lactose (substrate), galactose and lactic acid (products) concentrations while nonlinear relationships were developed between biomass and lactic acid concentrations. These nonlinear relationships took into account the inhibitory effect of lactic acid on growth and acidification. The indirect measurements of biomass concentration were introduced into a nonlinear estimator of the state variables and of the specific growth and lactic acid production rates. Good agreement was found between estimated and measured biomass concentrations (error index ranging from 10.8% to 12.6%). The results showed the feasibility of on-line estimation of biomass concentration and of the specific kinetics from NaOH addition weight measurements and its applicability for monitoring lactic acid fermentations. Using off-line measurements of L(+) and D(-) lactic acid concentrations, the evolution of the concentration of each strain in mixed cultures was obtained from the relationships proposed for the mixed cultures.

TI  - Antimutagenicity of fermented milk.
AB  - Reconstituted nonfat dry milk was fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus CH65, Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4, Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CH3, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R, and by a mixture of the latter two organisms. The fermented milks were then freeze-dried, extracted in acetone, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, and assayed for antimutagenicity in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA 100) against N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitroso-guanidine, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl. Dose-dependent activity was significant against both mutagens in all extracts. Maximal inhibitory activity against 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl and N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitroso-guanidine was 2- and 2.7-fold greater, respectively, than that exhibited by extracts of unfermented milk. Extracts of milk fermented by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R were examined further. Compounds that were responsible for activity against both mutagens were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in dimethylsulfoxide. Adjustment of milk fermented by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R to pH 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the activity specific for 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl. In contrast, compounds with activity specific for N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitrosoguanidine were less extractable at pH 7.6. The weak antimutagenicity of unfermented milk was not increased by addition of 2% L-lactic acid.
TI  - Absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.
AB  - To investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. The production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by HPLC analysis in growing cultures. Resting whole cells from a positive control strain, Eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of .2 mM cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at pH 7.3. However, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. In growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by E. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. None of the test strains showed production of either deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a general aminopeptidase (St-PepN) from Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CNRZ 302.
AB  - A general aminopeptidase (St-PepN) was purified from an intracellular extract of  Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CNRZ 302 by ion-exchange chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme in denaturing or nondenaturating conditions showed a single protein band. The enzyme is a monomer with a molecular mass of 97 kDa. Its activity is maximal at pH 7 and 36 degrees C and is completely abolished by CuCl2 and ZnCl2. The enzyme is strongly inhibited by metal-chelating reagents, such as EDTA and o-phenanthroline, which suggests that St-PepN is a metalloenzyme. The enzyme showed activity toward p-nitroanilide derivatives or dipeptides and tripeptides and showed a preference for hydrophobic or basic amino acids at the N-terminal position. Longer peptide chains, such as the B-chain of insulin, glucagon, or peptides generated by the hydrolysis of caseins, were degraded, too. The sequence of the first 21 residues of the mature enzyme was determined and showed high homology with that of the aminopeptidase PepN isolated from Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2. The properties of the enzyme are compared with those of corresponding enzymes of other species of lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Aminopeptidase N from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus NCDO 573: purification and properties.
AB  - A 96 kDa aminopeptidase was purified from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus NCDO 573. The enzyme had similar properties to aminopeptidases isolated from lactococci and lactobacilli and showed a high degree of N-terminal amino acid sequence homology to aminopeptidase N from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. It catalysed the hydrolysis of a range of aminoacyl 4-nitroanilides and 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin derivatives, dipeptides, tripeptides and oligopeptides. In common with aminopeptidases from other lactic acid bacteria, the enzyme from Strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus showed highest activity with lysyl derivatives but was also very active with arginyl and leucyl derivatives. Relative activity with alanyl, phenylalanyl, tyrosyl, seryl and valyl derivatives was considerably lower and with glycyl, glutamyl and prolyl derivatives almost negligible. The aminopeptidase also catalysed the hydrolysis of dipeptides and tripeptides but mostly at rates much less than that with L-lysyl-4-nitroanilide and oligopeptides. The enzyme catalysed the successive hydrolysis of various amino acid residues from the N-terminus of several oligopeptides but it was unable to cleave peptide bonds on the N-terminal side of a proline residue.
TI  - Direct screening of recombinants in gram-positive bacteria using the secreted staphylococcal nuclease as a reporter.
AB  - A system for direct screening of recombinant clones in Lactococcus lactis, based  on secretion of the staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) in the organism, was developed. The nuc gene (encoding SNase) was cloned on both rolling-circle and theta-replicating plasmids. L. lactis strains containing these nuc+ plasmids secrete SNase and are readily detectable by a simple plate test. A multicloning site (MCS) was introduced just after the cleavage site between leader peptide and the mature SNase, without affecting nuclease activity. Cloning foreign DNA fragments into any site of the MCS interrupts nuc and thus results in nuc mutant clones which are easily distinguished fron nuc+ clones on plates. The utility of this system for L. lactis was demonstrated by cloning an antibiotic resistance marker and Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA fragments into the MCS of the nucMCS cassette. Both cloning vectors containing the nucMCS cassette were also introduced into Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, in which direct screening of nuc mutant recombinant clones was also achieved. The potential uses of nuc as a secretion reporter system are discussed.
TI  - Antilisterial activity by enterococci in a model predicting the temperature evolution of Taleggio, an Italian soft cheese.
AB  - Enterococcus ssp. produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins, which were active against Listeria innocua and Listeria monocytogenes. Inhibition of L. innocua in milk by different starter cultures was evaluated. Milk was inoculated with a conventional starter (Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus mixed cultures) as a sole starter or in combination with inhibitory starter cultures (Enterococcus ssp., bacteriocin-producing strains). Tests were performed under a temperature gradient that reproduced the first 55 h of Taleggio cheese manufacturing and in the presence of rennet. Results indicated that satisfactory inhibition of L. innocua was linked to the combined synergistic antimicrobial effect of pH decrease and bacteriocin production. Overall, data suggested that a potential existed for use of the antagonistic activity from enterococci for protection of Taleggio cheese during ripening, when L. monocytogenes may often reach dangerous concentrations.
TI  - Microbiological quality of French yogurts commercialized in Spain.
AB  - The microbiological quality has been evaluated in 6 batches of yogurt (plain, flavoured and fruit-added) produced commercially in France and purchased in Spain. The essential microflora: Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and contaminants (coliform bacteria, yeasts and molds) were checked. The pH was also measured. The totality of the samples tested fulfilled French and Spanish regulation with respect to the presence of viable yogurt organisms. Likewise, in 100% of the yogurts, counts of contaminants were under 10 cfu/g. The pH ranged between 3.92 and 4.19.
TI  - Different bacteriophage resistance mechanisms in Streptococcus salivarius subsp.  thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strain NST5 exhibited a temperature-dependent defence mechanism against the virulent bacteriophages phi B1.2 and phi A1.1. It was active at 42 degrees C but not at 30 degrees C as demonstrated by a significant increase of both plaque size and efficiency of plaquing. This defence mechanism did not affect host-dependent phage replication and did not interfere with phage adsorption to NST5. These results suggest that it interfered with phage development. The phages phi T33, phi T58, phi D1, phi T21 and phi T9, belonging to the same phage type as phi B1.2, were examined for their ability to infect NST3 and NST5. Restriction modification systems of different specificity were detected in NST3 and NST5; host-dependent phage replication was detected at 30 and 42 degrees C; an abortive defence mechanism was detected in NST5 which was active at 42 degrees C, but not 30 degrees C, and was independent of restriction modification action or interference with phage adsorption. Our investigations of phage-host interactions showed that the two Str. salivarius subsp. thermophilus strains studied avoided attack by related bacteriophages by evolving at least three different resistance systems.
TI  - The 23S-5S spacer of two rRNA loci of Streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus includes a promoter.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the 3' part of a ribosomal and transfer RNA locus from Streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus NST1403 was determined. The sequenced DNA fragment includes the 3' end of a 23S rRNA gene, a 5S rRNA gene, a tRNA(asn) gene and a potential transcriptional terminator. The tRNA gene does not encode for the CCA 3'terminus of mature tRNA. We compared this sequence to a promoter-carrying DNA fragment sequence (P20) of Streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus A054 [1]. We found that the P20 sequence included the 3' end of a 23S rRNA gene, a 5S rRNA gene and the 5' part of a tRNA(val) gene. The two 23S-5S spacer sequences are identical and contain a promoter and a potential 23S rRNA processing site. Therefore, 5S rRNA and tRNA genes could be transcribed from a promoter located within the 23S-5S spacer of at least two of the six rRNA loci.
TI  - Lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in  fermented dairy products.
AB  - Lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar has been developed for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fermented dairy products. The medium contains lithium chloride and sodium propionate to inhibit the growth of other lactic acid bacteria. Pure cultures of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and streptococci were tested for growth in this medium. With one exception, all bifidobacteria were able to grow in this medium and in a nonselective agar with a difference not exceeding .4 log units. However, none of the lactobacilli tested and only one strain each of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris grew in lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar. In those cases, the numbers of colonies were lower in lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar by 1.26 and 2.51 log units, respectively, compared with a nonselective agar. Bifidobacteria were also selectively isolated from all fermented milks and cheeses analyzed.
TI  - Purification and partial characterization of an intracellular aminopeptidase from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strain ACA-DC 114.
AB  - An intracellular aminopeptidase from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strain ACA-DC 114, isolated from traditional Greek yoghurt, was purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-100. The enzyme had a molecular weight of 89,000. It was active over a pH range 4.5-9.5 and had optimum activity on L-lysyl-4-nitroanilide at pH 6.5 and 35 degrees C with Km = 1.80 mmol/l; above 55 degrees C the enzyme activity declined rapidly. The aminopeptidase was capable of degrading substrates by hydrolysis of the N-terminal amino acid; it had very low endopeptidase and no carboxypeptidase activity. The enzyme was strongly inactivated by EDTA. Serine and sulphydryl group reagents had no effect on enzyme activity.
TI  - Evidence and characterization of temperate bacteriophage in Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus St18.
AB  - Lysogenic strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were studied using induction with mitomycin C (MC). The induction and presence of temperate phage were investigated carrying out tests on sensitive strains, electron microscopy and phage DNA analysis. Forty-five Str. salivarius subsp. thermophilus strains were subjected to induction with MC and growth of the various cultures was evaluated. Only one strain of those tested showed lysis after adding MC, thus indicating a possible lysogenic state, 0.5 micrograms MC/ml being the optimal dose. Two phi 18 phage-sensitive strains out of 45 were isolated in which this phage behaved as virulent, causing lysis of the culture in broth, but no lysis plaques on agar medium were detected. The St18 strain was cured by u.v. irradiation but no mutants sensitive to the phi 18 phage were found among the clones non-inducible by MC. The presence of phages having a hexagonal isometric head and a long non-contractile tail in the lysate obtained after inducing the St18 strain was confirmed by examination under the electron microscope. Study of the phage DNA showed a genome size of 40.9 +/- 0.5 kb without cohesive end fragments. In addition, the restriction map of the phage genome was constructed. This study has demonstrated lysogeny in Str. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and also that several phage infections of Str. salivarius subsp. thermophilus starters may have an 'endogenous' origin.
TI  - Detection of propionic acid bacteria in cheese.
AB  - Mesophilic lactic starters and thermophilic lactobacilli but not Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus grew on the sodium lactate agar (SLA) used for estimating the numbers of propionic acid bacteria (PAB) in cheese. The addition of cloxacillin (4 micrograms/ml) to SLA inhibited the starter bacteria but had no effect on the PAB. It was possible to count low numbers of PAB in the presence of high numbers of starter bacteria. A correlation coefficient of 0.9 was obtained between the level of propionic acid and the counts of PAB in cheese (n = 40). A disadvantage of the medium is that other bacteria found in cheese (mesophilic lactobacilli, enterococci, Clostridium tyrobutyricum) also grow on it; however, these bacteria are easily distinguishable from PAB on the basis of size, colour and absence of catalase.
TI  - Detection of intraspecific DNA polymorphism in Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus by a homologous rDNA probe.
AB  - Three ribosomal probes from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were cloned. Sequence data demonstrate that their juxtaposition corresponds to an entire operon. They were used in order to study ribosomal operon number and organization. rRNA genes were shown to be clustered in the order 5'-16S-23S-5S-3' and the number of rrn loci to vary within the subspecies. The smallest of the 3 probes was used for strain characterization. Substantial variability in hybridization patterns was observed among strains, resulting not only from, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) but also from the variability of ribosomal operon number.
TI  - Strains and species of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milks (yogurts): effect  on in vivo lactose digestion.
AB  - Lactose in yogurt with live bacteria is better tolerated than lactose in other dairy foods, partly because of the activity of microbial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), which digests lactose in vivo. To evaluate the ability of different strains and species of lactic acid bacteria to digest lactose in vivo, yogurts (containing mixtures of strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus) and fermented milks (containing individual species of S thermophilus, L bulgaricus, L acidophilus, or Bifidobacterium bifidus) that varied in microbial beta-gal activity were produced. Selected products were fed to healthy people who cannot digest lactose, and breath hydrogen production was monitored. All yogurts dramatically and similarly improved lactose digestion, regardless of their total or specific beta-gal activity. The response to fermented milks varied from marginal improvement with B bifidus milk to nearly complete lactose digestion with L bulgaricus milk. The results suggest that total beta-gal was not the limiting factor in promoting lactose digestion, perhaps because of a limited rate of intracellular substrate transport.
TI  - Purification, properties, and sequence specificity of SslI, a new type II restriction endonuclease from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  - SslI, a type II restriction endonuclease, was purified from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strain BSN 45. SslI is an isoschizomer of BstNI. SslI activity was maximum at pH 8.8, 0 to 50 mM NaCl, 2 to 8 mM Mg2+, and 42 degrees C. Activity against phage DNA in vitro was demonstrated.
TI  - Purification and characterization of an endopeptidase from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Wg2.
AB  - An endopeptidase has been purified to homogeneity from a crude cell extract of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Wg2 by a procedure that includes diethyl-aminoethane-Sephacel chromatography, phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and fast protein liquid chromatography over an anion-exchange column and a hydrophobic-interaction column. Gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated a molecular mass of the purified enzyme of 70,000 Da. The endopeptidase can degrade several oligopeptides into various tetra-, tri-, and dipeptides. The endopeptidase has no aminopeptidase, carboxypeptidase, dipeptidase, or tripeptidase activity. It is optimally active at pH 6.0 to 6.5 and in the temperature range of 30 to 38 degrees C. The enzyme is inactivated by the chemical agents 1,10-phenanthroline, ethylenedinitrilotetraacetate, beta-mercaptoethanol, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and is inhibited by Cu2+ and Zn2+. The ethylenedinitrilotetraacetate- or 1,10-phenanthroline-treated enzyme can be reactivated by Co2+. Immunoblotting with specific antibodies raised against the purified endopeptidase indicated that the enzyme is also present in other Lactococcus spp., as well as in Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
TI  - Diffusion of lactose in kappa-carrageenan/locust bean gum gel beads with or without entrapped growing lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Effective diffusion coefficients (De) of lactose in kappa-carrageenan (2.75% wt/wt)/locust bean gum (0.25% wt/wt) (LBG) gel beads (1.5-2.0-mm diameter)with or without entrapped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were determined at 40 degrees C. The effects of lactose concentration, bacteria strain (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei) and cell content at various steps of the fermentation process (after immobilization, pre-incubation of the beads and successive fermentations) were measured on De as a first step for process modelling. Results were obtained from transiend concentration changes n well-stirred lactose solutions in which the beads were suspended. A mathematical model of unsteady-state diffusion in a sphere was used, and De was obtained from the best fit of the experimental data. Diffusivity of lactose in cell-tree beads was significantly lower than in pure water mainly because of the obstruction effect of the polymer chains and the hydration region. Furthermore, effective diffusivity and equilibrium partition factor were independent of lactose concentration in the range from 12.5 to 50 g/L. No significant difference was found for De (effective diffusivity) and Kp (partition) coefficients between beads entrapping S. thermophilus (approximately 5 x 10(9) CFU/mL) and cell-free beads. On the other hand higher cell counts obtained with L. casei (close to 1.8 x 10(11) CFU/mL) increased mass transfer resistance resulting in lower effective diffusivities and Kp. Finally, the effects of the type of bacteria and their distribution in the beads on the diffusivity were also discussed.
TI  - Changes in chemical composition and sensory qualities of peanut milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The effects of fermentation of aqueous extracts of peanuts (peanut milk) with Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, separately and in combination, on selected chemical and sensory qualities were investigated. Changes in pH, titratable acidity and viable cell populations indicated that there was a synergistic interaction between L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus during fermentation. Analysis of headspace volatiles revealed that hexanal, which is one of the compounds responsible for undesirable green/beany flavor in peanut milk, completely disappeared as a result of fermentation. S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus was more effective than L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus in reducing the hexanal content. The acetaldehyde content of peanut milk increased during fermentation. Changes in concentrations of these volatile compounds were correlated with sensory evaluation scores which showed that a significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) decrease in green/beany flavor and a significant increase in creamy flavor occurred as a result of fermentation.
TI  - A species-specific DNA probe obtained from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus detects strain restriction polymorphism.
AB  - Genomic polymorphism in Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus was revealed by DNA restriction pattern analysis. A 4.2-kb variable DNA fragment was cloned from strain NST7 and hybridised with the DNA of 25 strains allowing an easy detection of intraspecific RFLP. Strong and weak hybridisation signals were observed and the latter were specifically revealed by a 2.1-kb fragment of the probe. Probe specificity was demonstrated by the absence of homology with DNA of strains belonging to 10 other species, with the exception of S. salivarius subsp. salivarius, confirming a close relationship between S. salivarius and S. thermophilus.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of chromosomal promoters of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  - A promoter probe vector, pTG244, was constructed with the aim of isolating transcription initiation signals from Streptococcus thermophilus (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). pTG244 is based on the Escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle vector pTG222, into which the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of Bacillus pumilus (cat-86) was cloned. Random Sau3A fragments from the S. thermophilus A054 chromosomal DNA were cloned upstream of the cat-86 gene by using E. coli as the host. The pool of recombinant plasmids were introduced into S. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in order to search for promoter activity in these hosts. For S. thermophilus, it was necessary to first select erythromycin-resistant transformants and then to screen for chloramphenicol resistance among these. Direct selection of chloramphenicol-resistant clones was, however, possible in L. lactis subsp. lactis. Six fragments exhibiting promoter activity were characterized in S. thermophilus by measuring the levels of cat-86 transcription and/or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase specific activity. Three of the promoter-carrying fragments were sequenced. The 5' ends of their corresponding mRNAs were determined by S1 mapping and shown to correspond to a purine residue in all cases. Upstream from these potential transcription start points, sequences homologous to the E. coli sigma 70 and the Bacillus subtilis vegetative sigma 43 (or sigma A) consensus promoters were identified.
TI  - The presence of two forms of the phosphocarrier protein HPr of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in streptococci.
AB  - The protein, HPr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS) in bacteria, was purified from Streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. The purified preparation gave only one band when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pI = 4.85). However, electrophoresis in Tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by PEP in the presence of enzyme I of the PTS or by ATP with the HPr kinase. Homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained by preparative electrophoresis. Each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. The electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees C for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees C for several months. Both HPr proteins catalyzed in vitro the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with a preparation of HPr containing both forms of the protein. Both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from PEP to the other specific PTS proteins known in S salivarius. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. The presence of the 2 forms of HPr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of S salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. A doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (S mutans, S sobrinus, S sanguis, S thermophilus, S bovis, S rattus) and also in L lactis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Molecular genetics of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The metabolism and genetics of Streptococcus thermophilus (presently Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) have only been investigated recently despite its widespread use in milk fermentation processes. The development of recombinant DNA technology has allowed impressive progress to be made in the knowledge of thermophilic dairy streptococci. In particular, it has permitted a careful analysis of phenotypically altered variants which were derived from a mother strain by plasmid or chromosomal DNA reorganization. While natural phage defense mechanisms of S. thermophilus remain poorly documented, information on the bacteriophages responsible for fermentation failures has accumulated. The lysogenic state of two S. thermophilus strains has also been demonstrated for the first time. Gene transfer techniques for this species have been established and improved to the point that targeted manipulation of their chromosomal determinants is now feasible. Cloning and expression vectors have been constructed, and a few heterologous genes were successfully expressed in S. thermophilus. The first homologous genes, involved in carbohydrate utilization, have been cloned and sequenced, shedding some light on the molecular organization of key metabolic steps.
TI  - Serological identification of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (Str. thermophilus) has no group-specific antigen. HCl extracts of 551 strains of streptococci isolated from cheese or yogurt (123 Str. thermophilus and 428 Enterococcus faecalis - Ent. faecium spp.) were examined with three type-specific antisera prepared against representatives of Str. thermophilus and also with Lancefield group D antisera. All typical (80) or atypical (43) strains of Str. thermophilus reacted with at least one type-specific antiserum and none of the enterococci reacted. Only two strains reacted with both type-specific and group antisera.
TI  - Genome comparison of Lactococcus strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The two restriction enzymes SmaI and ApaI were found to produce distributions of  DNA fragments useful for genome analysis of some lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus) by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The genome size was estimated to be 1750 to 2500 kb depending on the species. Each strain displayed unique restriction patterns; nevertheless, the percentage of the comigrating fragments of two isogenic or closely related strains was about 80% and fell to 20-40% when the patterns of two non-related strains of the same species or two strains belonging to different species were compared.
TI  - Uptake of glutamic acid by Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus CNRZ 302.
AB  - Glutamic acid uptake in Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus was energy dependent, the source of energy and adaptation to sugar being important to efficiency of uptake. The disaccharides, lactose and sucrose, stimulated uptake, but cells grown in glucose were more active. Optimum temperature was approximately 40 degrees C and pH approximately 7.0. NaCl was strongly inhibitory to the uptake of glutamic acid although not to that of isoleucine. High specificity existed because only L-aspartic acid was inhibitory.
TI  - Purification and thermostability of beta-galactosidase (lactase) from an autolytic strain of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  - beta-Galactosidase from an autolytic strain of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus was purified 109-fold to near homogeneity. The yield of purified enzyme was 41% and the specific activity was 592 o-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside U/mg at 37 degrees C. Two isozymes were present, but only one subunit was detected, having a mol. wt of 116,000. Enzyme stability was 37-83 times greater in milk than in buffer in the range 60-65 degrees C. At 60 degrees C the half-life in milk was 146 min. Denaturation in buffer was first-order, but in milk the overall reaction order with respect to enzyme concentration was approximately 0.5. The activation energy for denaturation was 453 kJ/mol in milk and 372 kJ/mol in buffer. In milk the activation energy for lactose hydrolysis was 35.1 kJ/mol.
TI  - Sugar Utilization and Acid Production by Free and Entrapped Cells of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in a Whey Permeate Medium.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis entrapped in k-carrageenan-locust bean gum gel performed similarly to free cells in the conversion of lactose to lactic acid. Bead diameter influenced the fermentation rate. Cells entrapped in smaller beads (0.5 to 1.0 mm) showed higher release rates, higher lactose, glucose, and formic acid utilization, higher galactose accumulation, and higher lactic acid production than did cells entrapped in larger beads (1.0 to 2.0 mm). Values for smaller beads were comparable with those for free cells. Immobilization affected the fermentation rate of lactic acid bacteria, especially Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Entrapped cells of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus demonstrated a lower lactic acid production than did free cells in batch fermentation. The kinetics of the production of formic and pyruvic acids by L. lactis subsp. lactis and S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus are presented.
TI  - The effect of yoghurt on some components of the gut microflora and on the metabolism of lactose in the rat.
AB  - Feeding yoghurt or base milk (from which the yoghurt was prepared by fermentation) to rats increased the counts of coliforms in the gut whereas the counts of lactobacilli were reduced by yoghurt but not by the base milk. Lactobacillus bulgaricus survived in the guts of gnotobiotic and conventional rats when yoghurt was fed continuously. Streptococcus thermophilus also survived in gnotobiotic rats but its ability to survive in conventional rats could not be examined. Both organisms failed to colonise the gut when a small inoculum of yoghurt was administered orally to germfree rats maintained on the stock diet. Streptococcus thermophilus but not Lact. bulgaricus grew in the rat diet when tested in vitro. Two enzyme systems (beta-galactosidase and lactase) were studied using, respectively, o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) and lactose as the test substrates. Enzyme levels estimated with both substrates increased in the gut contents when rats were fed yoghurt but an increase was only found with ONPG in the intestinal mucosa fraction. The bacterial origin of all this increased activity is discussed. The other lactose-containing diets did not affect enzyme activity to the same degree. Feeding yoghurt changed the lactobacillus flora from one which was predominantly heterofermentative (Lact. reuteri ) to one which was predominantly homofermentative (Lact. salivarius).
TI  - DNA base composition, DNA-DNA homology and long-chain fatty acid studies on streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - DNA base composition, DNA-DNA homology and long-chain fatty acid studies were performed on Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus salivarius. These species possess similar mol % G + C values (about 37 to 41), long-chain fatty acid profiles and belong to a single DNA homology group. On the basis of the present and earlier studies it is proposed that Streptococcus thermophilus (Orla-Jensen) be reclassified as Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus comb. nov.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - Arthritogenicity in rats of cell walls from several streptococci staphylococci and two other bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial cell walls from Str. bovis, Str. lactis, Str. mutans, Str. thermophilus, Str. salivarius, and Str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but Str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. S. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. It was also shown that cell walls from S. epidermidis, B. megaterium, and M. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. A close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the PPD hypersensitivity. It was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.
