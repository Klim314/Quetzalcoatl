a small library of benzimidazole functionalized chiral thioureas was prepared starting from natural amino acids (s)-alanine, (s)-phenylalanine, (s)-valine and (s)-leucine and also their (r)-isomers and studied their antimicrobial activity against a various gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. in this study, compounds 5g and 5j were found to exhibit good antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains such as staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, klebsiella planticola, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in the cytotoxicity study, thioureas derived from non-natural amino acids 5a-l showed good activity against human cancer cell lines a549, mcf7, du145, hela, and no cytotoxicity was observed with their antipodes 6a-l.
amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides: membrane active peptidomimetics and their potential as antimicrobial agents.
we introduce a novel class of membrane active peptidomimetics, the amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides, and evaluate their potential as antimicrobial agents. the design criteria, the building block and oligomer synthesis as well as a detailed structure-activity relationship (sar) study are reported. specifically, infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (irras) was employed to investigate structural features of amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptide sequences at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic air/liquid interface. furthermore, langmuir monolayers of anionic and zwitterionic phospholipids have been used to model the interactions of amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides with prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular membranes in order to predict their membrane selectivity and elucidate their mechanism of action. lastly, antimicrobial activity was tested against gram-positive m. luteus and s. aureus as well as against gram-negative e. coli and p. aeruginosa bacteria along with testing hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity. we found that amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptide sequences combine high and selective antimicrobial activity with exceptionally low cytotoxicity in comparison to values reported in the literature. overall, this study provides further insights into the sar of antimicrobial peptides and peptidomimetics and indicates that amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides are strong candidates for further development as antimicrobial agents with high therapeutic index.
structure-activity study of macropin, a novel antimicrobial peptide from the venom of solitary bee macropis fulvipes (hymenoptera: melittidae).
a novel antimicrobial peptide, designated macropin (mac-1) with sequence gly-phe-gly-met-ala-leu-lys-leu-leu-lys-lys-val-leu-nh2 , was isolated from the venom of the solitary bee macropis fulvipes. mac-1 exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, antifungal activity, and moderate hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. a series of macropin analogs were prepared to further evaluate the effect of structural alterations on antimicrobial and hemolytic activities and stability in human serum. the antimicrobial activities of several analogs against pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa were significantly increased while their toxicity against human red blood cells was decreased. the activity enhancement is related to the introduction of either l- or d-lysine in selected positions. furthermore, all-d analog and analogs with d-amino acid residues introduced at the n-terminal part of the peptide chain exhibited better serum stability than did natural macropin. data obtained by cd spectroscopy suggest a propensity of the peptide to adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical secondary structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol or membrane-mimicking sodium dodecyl sulfate. in addition, the study elucidates the structure-activity relationship for the effect of d-amino acid substitutions in mac-1 using nmr spectroscopy.
aromatase and glycosyl transferase inhibiting acridone alkaloids from fruits of cameroonian zanthoxylum species.
background: zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides and z. leprieurii fruits are commonly used in traditional system of medicine for diarrhea, pain, wound healing, etc. in cameroon, africa. z. leprieurii fruits have been chemically studied for its bioactive compounds whereas the investigation on z. zanthoxyloides fruits is lacking. results: after a detailed chemical analysis of the fruits of z. leprieurii and z. zanthoxyloides, a series of new acridone alkaloids, namely, 3-hydroxy-1,5,6-trimethoxy-9-acridone (1), 1,6-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-9-acridone (2), 3,4,5,7-tetrahydroxy-1-methoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (3), 4-methoxyzanthacridone (8), 4-hydroxyzanthacridone (9), 4-hydroxyzanthacridone oxide (2,4') (10) have been isolated. the known acridones which have been characterized are, helebelicine a (4), 1-hydroxy-3-methoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (5), 1,3-dihydroxy-4-methoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (6) and tegerrardin a (7). the in vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic screening of these acridones reveal that compound 3 has a moderate antibacterial activity (mic 125 mug/ml) against micrococcus luteus and pseudomonas aeruginosa while compound 1 shows a moderate cytotoxic effect (ic50 of 86 mum) against wrl-68 (liver cancer cell line). furthermore, the molecular modeling of these acridones predicted the structural basis for their mode of action and binding affinity for aromatase, quinone reductase and waag, a glycosyltransferase involved in bacterial lipopolysaccharide synthesis. computational approaches, quantitative sar and modeling studies predicted that acridones 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 and 10 were the inhibitors of glycosyltransferase while 1, 8, 9 and 10, the inhibitors of aromatase. conclusions: a total of 10 acridones have been isolated out of which 6 are new (1, 2, 3, 8, 9 and 10). alkaloids 8, 9 and 10, having novel tetracyclic acridone structure with new carbon skeleton, have now been named as zanthacridone. the quantitative sar and molecular modeling studies suggested that the compounds 1, 9 and 10 are inhibitors of both aromatase and glycosyltransferase.
effective inhibition of bacterial respiration and growth by cuo microspheres composed of thin nanosheets.
this study describes the synthesis, characterization and biocidal potential of copper oxide micro-spheres composed of thin sheets (cuomss-ths). microscopic observations of synthesized cuomss-ths revealed the clusters of thin sheets arranged in small flower like micro-spheres. diameter of each micro-sphere was determined in the range of 2-3 mum, whereas the size of each sheet was approximately 80 nm. these micro-flowers like nanostructures were synthesized using copper nitrate hexahydrate and sodium hydroxide via solution process. the cuomss-ths exhibited a broad-spectrum anti-bacterial activity involving significant growth inhibition of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus. the ic50 values of these engineered nps against e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and m. luteus were determined to be 195, 200, 131 and 184 mug/ml, respectively. also, the respiration of gram+ ve organisms (m. luteus and s. aureus) was inhibited significantly (p value < 0.005) at relatively lower concentrations of 12.5 and 50 mug/ml, respectively, as compared to the gram- ve bacteria (e. coli and p. aeruginosa), where the growth inhibition occurred at a much greater concentration of 100 mug/ml. the results explicitly demonstrated anti-microbial activity of cuomss-ths with a higher level of toxicity against the gram+ ve vis-a-vis gram- ve bacteria.

crustins from eyestalk cdna library of swimming crab portunus trituberculatus: molecular characterization, genomic organization and expression analysis.
crustins are cationic, cysteine-rich antimicrobial proteins, containing a single  whey acidic protein (wap) domain in the c-terminal end. different from the reported ptcrustin in the hemocytes, two novel crustin genes (ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3) were cloned completely from the eyestalk cdna library of portunus trituberculatus in this study. all ptcrustins share the consensus cysteine motif and are considered as type i crustins. four exons and three introns are identified in genomic dna sequence of ptcrustin3 while three exons and two introns in ptcrustin2. the mrna transcripts of ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3 are mainly detected in eyestalk and gills, but not in hemocytes. although both ptcrutins are up-regulated after challenge of three microorganisms, ptcrustin3 seems to respond more quickly to microbial challenge than ptcrustin2. unlike most crustins, both recombinant ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3 exhibit antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria micrococcus luteus and staphyloccocus aureus and gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, rptcrustin2 is moderately active against yeast pichia pastoris and rptcrustin3 show significant activity against gram-negative bacterium vibrio alginolyticus. these results indicate that ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3 are two novel crustins and play different roles in immune response of p. trituberculatus against microbial challenge.
biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using latex from few euphorbian plants and their antimicrobial potential.
the synthesis of well-dispersed and ultrafine metal nanoparticles has great interest due to their distinctive physicochemical properties and biomedical applications. this study is the first report of one-step solvent-free synthesis of agnps using euphorbiaceae plant latex. among evaluated eight latex-producing plants, four (jatropha curcas, jatropha gossypifolia, pedilanthus tithymaloides, and euphorbia milii) showed high potential to produce physicochemically distinct, small-sized and bactericidal agnps. phytochemical screening showed presence of rich amount of biochemicals in these plants. j. gossypifolia showed uniformly dispersed comparatively small-sized agnps. dose-dependent growth inhibition of bacterial pathogens escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermis, and micrococcus luteus was observed for j. gossypifolia latex-synthesized agnps with minimum inhibitory concentration values 30, 40, 70, 60, and 60 ppm, respectively, after 24 h. possible mode of action of agnps against pathogens was confirmed by analyzing enzymes and cell leakage.

novel 1,1'-(5,5'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(3-aryl-1h-pyrazole-5,1-(4h,5h)-diyl))diethanones 7-12 were tested for their antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion and twofold serial dilution method against the tested bacterial and fungal strains. compounds 7 against micrococcus luteus, 8 against beta-heamolytic streptococcus, m. luteus, klebsiella pneumonia, microsporum gypseum, 9 against staphylococcus aureus, shigella flexneri, vibreo cholerae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aspergillus flavus, mucor indicus, 10 against salmonella typhii, s. flexneri, m. gypseum, 11 against k. pneumonia, m. gypseum, 12 against k. pneumonia, and m. gypseum show superior zone of inhibitions and exhibited excellent antibacterial and antifungal activities at a mic value of 6.25 mug/ml. moreover, all the tested compounds 7-12 revealed promising antitubercular activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv and inh-resistant m. tuberculosis. compounds 8 against m. tuberculosis and 11 against inh-resistant m. tuberculosis exhibited the percentage of reduction in rlu at 89 and 85%, respectively.
in vitro interaction of chronic wound bacteria in biofilms.
objective: to use in vitro biofilm models of wound bacterial isolates and compare the biofilms produced for different combinations of wound bacterial species. method: in vitro biofilms, generated by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus oralis and micrococcus luteus in microtitre plates and a constant depth film fermentor (cdff), were studied. the tested isolates all originated from chronic venous leg ulcers. biofilms of individual and dual combinations of these species were generated in microtitre plate wells at 37 degrees c for 24-96 hours and also in the cdff for 7 days. the extent of biofilm formation from these systems was then measured using crystal violet staining and/or total viable counts. results: all the chronic wound bacteria formed biofilms (both individually and in mixed culture) in these models. in mixed species microtitre plate biofilms, both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus appeared to antagonise biofilm formation by s. oralis and m. luteus, with p. aeruginosa completely inhibiting the growth of these organisms. similar effects were evident in the cdff model, when all four bacterial species were added simultaneously, with m. luteus being 'out-competed' by the other organisms present and occurring at numbers at the limits of detection; however, there was an apparent increase in the numbers of s. oralis compared with its single culture equivalent. conclusion: the study highlighted differences in biofilm formation ability for the tested species in both closed and open model systems. using dual species biofilms, distinct species antagonism was observed with apparent antagonism of pathogenic species over 'commensal' ones. such a finding provides insight into possible bacterial interactions during development of 'non-healing' wound biofilms.
phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of labisa pumila benth.
a local herb, kacip fatimah, is famous amongst malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of labisia pumila benth. total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. hplc analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both gram positive (micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis b145, bacillus cereus b43, staphylococcus aureus s1431) and gram negative (enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia k36, escherichia coli e256, pseudomonas aeruginosa pi96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against fusarium sp., candida sp. and mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.

novel bis cyclohexenone ester derivatives 14-19 were synthesized and characterized by their spectral data. in vitro microbiological evaluations were carried out for all the novel compounds 14-19 against clinically isolated bacterial and fungal strains. compounds 15, 16, 18 against staphylococcus aureus, 14, 15 against beta-haemolytic streptococcus, 15, 19 against micrococcus luteus, 17, 18 against salmonella typhii, 14, 17 against shigella flexneri, 15 against escherichia coli, 16 against pseudomonas aeruginosa, 15, 18, 19 against klebsiella pneumonia exhibited potent antibacterial activity at an minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 6.25 mug/ml, whereas compound 16 against aspergillus flavus, 17 against a. niger, 16, 18 against mucor indicus, 15, 17-19 against microsporum gypseum revealed excellent antifungal activity at an mic value of 6.25 mug/ml.
enhanced antimicrobial activity of engineered human lysozyme.
lysozymes contain a disproportionately large fraction of cationic residues, and are thereby attracted toward the negatively charged surface of bacterial targets. importantly, this conserved biophysical property may inhibit lysozyme antibacterial function during acute and chronic infections. a mouse model of acute pulmonary pseudomonas aeruginosa infection demonstrated that anionic biopolymers accumulate to high concentrations in the infected lung, and the presence of these species correlates with decreased endogenous lysozyme activity. to develop antibacterial enzymes designed specifically to be used as antimicrobial agents in the infected airway, the electrostatic potential of human lysozyme (hlys) was remodeled by protein engineering. a novel, high-throughput screen was implemented to functionally interrogate combinatorial libraries of charge-engineered hlys proteins, and variants with improved bactericidal activity were isolated and characterized in detail. these studies illustrate a general mechanism by which polyanions inhibit lysozyme function, and they are the first direct demonstration that decreasing hlys's net cationic character improves its antibacterial activity in the presence of disease-associated biopolymers. in addition to avoiding electrostatic sequestration, at least one charge-engineered variant also kills bacteria more rapidly in the absence of inhibitory biopolymers; this observation supports a novel hypothesis that tuning the cellular affinity of peptidoglycan hydrolases may be a general strategy for improving kinetics of bacterial killing.
essential oil from the underground parts of laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
the composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of laserpitium zernyi hayek (apiaceae) were investigated. the pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by gc and gc-ms. forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). the main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. the antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against gram (+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis), gram (-) bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (candida albicans). l. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against s. epidermidis, s. aureus and m. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.
antibacterial activities of dodonaea viscosa using contact bioautography technique.
the crude ethanolic extract and n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and aqueous fractions of dodonaea viscosa were analyzed for antibacterial potential against four gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, and three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa. preliminary screening showed inhibition against staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the thin layer chromatograms of the fractions were then subjected to contact bioautography, which showed inhibition zone at different r(f) values against bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi and pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating the presence of antibacterial components. the mic of each fraction was determined through a 96-well micro-titer plate method. the non-viability of the organisms was ascertained by determining the mbc of the fractions.
leptoglycin: a new glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin secretion of the south american frog leptodactylus pentadactylus (leptodactylidae).
antimicrobial peptides are components of innate immunity that is the first-line defense against invading pathogens for a wide range of organisms. here, we describe the isolation, biological characterization and amino acid sequencing of a novel neutral glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide from skin secretion of leptodactylus pentadactylus named leptoglycin. the amino acid sequence of the peptide purified by rp-hplc (c(18) column) was deduced by mass spectrometric de novo sequencing and confirmed by edman degradation: gllggllgpllgggggggggll. leptoglycin was able to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 8 microm, 50 microm, and 75 microm respectively, but it did not show antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and enterococcus faecalis), yeasts (candida albicans and candida tropicalis) and dermatophytes fungi (microsporum canis and trichophyton rubrum). no hemolytic activity was observed at the 2-200 microm range concentration. the amino acid sequence of leptoglycin with high level of glycine (59.1%) and leucine (36.4%) containing an unusual central proline suggests the existence of a new class of gly/leu-rich antimicrobial peptides. taken together, these results suggest that this natural antimicrobial peptide could be a tool to develop new antibiotics.

the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of a new root canal sealer containing calcium hydroxide (acroseal) and the root canal sealer based on mta (endo cpm sealer), in comparison with traditional sealers (sealapex, sealer 26 and intrafill) and white mta-angelus, against five different microorganism strains. the materials and their components were evaluated after manipulation, employing the agar diffusion method. a base layer was made using muller-hinton agar (mh) and wells were made by removing agar. the materials were placed into the wells immediately after manipulation. the microorganisms used were: micrococcus luteus (atcc9341), staphylococcus aureus (atcc6538), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc27853), candida albicans (atcc 10231), and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 10541). the plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the results showed that sealapex and its base paste, sealer 26 and its powder, endo cpm sealer and its powder, white mta and its powder all presented antimicrobial activity against all strains. intrafill and its liquid presented antimicrobial activity against all strains except p. aeruginosa and acroseal was effective only against m. luteus and s. aureus.
[the detection of bacteriogenic causes of opportunistic infections].
in order to select bacteriocin producing strains the screening of microorganisms  from clinical material was perfomed. the delayed antagonism method was used. 154 strains were screened, 93 (60%) cultures produced antagonistic substances. micrococcus luteus nctc, 2665, candida albicans atcc 885-653, escherichihia coli 168/59, pseudomonas aeruginosa 27/99, klebsiella peumoniae 1954 were used as test-cultures, pseudomonas aenruginosa and staphylococcys aureus were the most frequent species producing antibacterial substances and their products were of high potency, with a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity.
broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. after being treated with manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of pichia pastoris was slightly affected. microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and loss of cell mobility. viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed e. coli and b. subtilis cells. under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) were killed. in the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (dhi) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than l-dopa, n-acetyldopamine (nada) or n-beta-alanyldopamine (nbad) did, suggesting that dhi and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. the antifungal activity of dhi was detected using p. pastoris, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, and beauveria bassiana. these results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (dce)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.

antibacterial activity of bacillus amyloliquefaciens phage endolysin without holin conjugation.
to characterize the enzymatic activity and antibacterial activity of endolysin encoded by a bacillus amyloliquefaciens phage, the open reading frame encoding endolysin was amplified by pcr and cloned into the expression plasmid pet21d(+). the resultant plasmid was used to transform escherichia coli jm109(de3). production of endolysin in the cytosol facilitated cell lysis without coproduction of holin, which is considered to degrade or alter the cytoplasmic membrane. the phage endolysin was overexpressed and purified. although the specific activity of the purified phage endolysin towards lyophilized micrococcus luteus cells was 1/11 of the activity of chicken egg white lysozymes, the endolysin showed stronger antibacterial activity towards e. coli w3110, e. coli jm109(de3) and pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 than chicken egg white lysozymes. the antibacterial activity of the endolysin towards these three bacterial strains was marked when edta was added to the endolysin solution.

bovine lactoperoxidase (lpo) was purified with amberlite cg 50 h+ resin, cm sephadex c-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and sephadex g-100 gel filtration chromatography from skim milk. the activity of lactoperoxidase was measured by using 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (abts) as a choromogenic substrate at ph 6.0. purification degree for the purified enzyme was controlled with sds-page and rz value (a412/a280). rz value for the purified lpo was 0.8. km value at ph 6.0 at 20 degrees c for the lpo was 0.20 mm. vmax value was 7.87 micromol/ml min at ph 6.0 at 20 degrees c. bovine lpo showed high antibacterial activity in 100 mm thiocyanate--100 mm h2o2 medium for some pathogenic bacteria, such as aeromonas hydrophila atcc 7966, micrococcus luteus la 2971, mycobacterium smegmatis rut, bacillus subtilis img 22, pseudomonas pyocyanea, bacillus subtilis var. niger atcc 10, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, enterococcus faecalis atcc 15753, bacillus brevis fmc3, klebsiella pneumoniae fmc 5, corynebacterium xerosis uc 9165, bacillus cereus eu, bacillus megaterium nrs, yersinia enterocolytica, listeria monocytogenes scoot a, bacillus megaterium eu, bacillus megaterium dsm32, klebsiella oxytocica, staphylococcus aerogenes, streptococcus faecalis, mycobacterium smegmatis ccm 2067 and compared with well known antibacterial substances such as penicilline, ampicilline, amoxicillin-clavulanate and ceftriaxon. the lpo--100 mm thiocyanate--100 mm h2o2 system was purposed as an effective agent against many of the diseases causing organisms in human and animals.
enteric bacteria counteract lipopolysaccharide induction of antimicrobial peptide genes.
the humoral immunity of drosophila involves the production of antimicrobial peptides, which are induced by evolutionary conserved microbial molecules, like lps. by using drosophila mbn-2 cells, we found that live bacteria, including e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, erwinia carotovora, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, prevented lps from inducing antimicrobial peptide genes, while micrococcus luteus and streptococcus equi did not. the inhibitory effect was seen at bacterial levels from 20 per mbn-2 cell, while antimicrobial peptides were induced at lower bacterial concentrations (< or =2 bacteria per cell) also in the absence of added lps. gel shift experiment suggests that the inhibitory effect is upstream or at the level of the activation of the transcription factor relish, a member of the nf-kappab/rel family. the bacteria have to be in physical contact with the cells, but not phagocytosed, to prevent lps induction. interestingly, the inhibiting mechanism is, at least for e. coli, independent of the type iii secretion system, indicating that the inhibitory mechanism is unrelated to the one earlier described for yopj from yersinia.
antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol isolated from magnolia officinalis.
the antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol, the main constituents of magnolia officinalis was investigated. the antimicrobial activity was assayed by the agar dilution method using brain heart infusion medium and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were determined for each compound using a twofold serial dilution assay. the results showed that honokiol and magnolol have a marked antimicrobial effect (mic = 25 microg/ml) against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis, but did not show antimicrobial activity (mic > or = 100 microg/ml) for shigella flexneii, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. our results indicate that honokiol and magnolol, although less potent than tetracycline, show a significant antimicrobial activity for periodontal pathogens. hence we suggest that honokiol and magnolol might have the potential to be an adjunct in the treatment of periodontitis.
in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of sealers and pastes used in endodontics.
the antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (ah plus, sealapex, ketac endo, and fill canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (calen and calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; micrococcus luteus atcc 9341, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 10541. there was a wild strain of streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with brain heart infusion agar and muller hinton medium seeded by pour plate. calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm wells or by using absorbent paper points. the plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. after incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% ttc gel and inhibition haloes were measured. all bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. however, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by ah plus, fill canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. we conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% ttc gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.
in vitro determination of direct antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
the objective of this study was to determine in vitro the time required for calcium hydroxide in direct contact with microorganisms to express its antimicrobial effect. the microorganisms used were: micrococcus luteus (atcc-9341), staphylococcus aureus (atcc-6538), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc-25586), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc-27853), escherichia coli, and streptococcus sp. the strains were cultivated in brain heart infusion (bhi), with the exception of f. nucleatum (bhi-pras). pure and mixed suspensions of the microorganisms were prepared. paper cones immersed in these substances were covered with calcium hydroxide paste, and after 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h and 7 days they were transferred to an appropriate medium to observe the growth and multiplication of the microorganisms. incubation was conducted at 37 degrees c for 48 h, according to the requirements of oxygen of each microorganism. the antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide was shown to occur after 12 h on m. luteus and f. nucleatum, 24 h on streptococcus sp, 48 h on e. coli, and 72 h on s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. mixture ii (m. luteus + streptococcus sp + s. aureus) was sensitive to calcium hydroxide antimicrobial potential after 48 h, whereas mixture i (m. luteus + e. coli + p. aeruginosa), mixture iii (e. coli + p. aeruginosa), and mixture iv (s. aureus + p. aeruginosa) were inactivated after 72 h of exposure.
[bacteria-reducing properties of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. ii. relationship between microbiocide effect of copper-containing materials and copper ion concentration after contamination with moist and dry hands].
the bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. in first examinations (i. communication) (19) the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa). the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). the following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. in this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. the bactericide effect on micrococcus luteus and pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. this results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.
antimicrobial activity determined in strains of bacillus circulans cluster.
wild-type strains of the genus bacillus were screened for antimicrobial activity. two strains exhibited antimicrobial activity against micrococcus luteus and were identified as bacillus polymyxa mir-23 and bacillus circulans mir-13. bacillus polymyxa mir-23 was active against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and aspergillus niger, whereas bacillus circulans mir-13 did not show activity against these microorganisms. bacillus subtilis atcc 6633 and b. polymyxa atcc 10401 were used as standard antibiotic-producer strain and showed different antimicrobial profiles and yields from b. polymyxa mir-23. the different antimicrobial profile of the two selected strains could possibly be used as a taxonomic marker.
antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
the antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; d-sphingosine; d,l-sphinganine; 4-d-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; n,n-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microm]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microm]). the sphingosines were similarly active against streptococcus pyogenes, micrococcus luteus, propionibacterium acnes, brevibacterium epidermidis, and candida albicans, moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against escherichia coli and serratia marcescens. both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees c and at ph 6.5. antimicrobial activity, which was ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous antimicrobial barrier.
[antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment].
this study was carried out to understand the antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment in boiling water. the samples included the core and the outer layers of onion, the white and the green parts of green onion, garlic bulb, ginger, ginger root, sweet pepper, chili pepper, brown pepper, and mustard. the test microorganisms included escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, vibrio parahaemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium phlei, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, and micrococcus luteus. raw garlic bulb could inhibit all of the test strains. the antibacterial activities of green onion are slightly weak than that of onion. however, green onion could inhibit p. aeruginosa and m. luteus, but onion could inhibit e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. faecalis, and b. cereus. ginger and ginger root could only inhibit m. luteus. chili pepper could inhibit v. parahaemolyticus and p. vulgaris. brown pepper could also inhibit p. vulgaris. sweet pepper and mustard showed no antibacterial activity to all of the test strains. in general, antibacterial components in the spice plants were heat labile. all the spices tested lost their antibacterial activities within 20 min at 100 degrees c.
