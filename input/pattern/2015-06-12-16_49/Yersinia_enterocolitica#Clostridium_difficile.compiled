TI  - [The application and epidemiological research of xTAG GPP multiplex PCR in the diagnosis of infectious diarrhea].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the application value of xTAG ((R)) gastrointestinal pathogen panel (xTAG9((R)) GPP) multiplex PCR in the early diagnosis of infectious diarrhea, and understand the epidemiology of intestinal diarrhea pathogens. METHODS: Five hundred and ninety two specimens were collected in outpatient of Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, from 1st Oct 2013 to 30th Sep 2014, comparing the xTAG((R)) GPP multiplex PCR assay with the traditional methods (culture, rapid enzyme immunoassay chromatography, microscopic examination, Real-time PCR) and mading the statistical analysis. RESULTS: The positive rate of 592 patients with diarrhea specimens was 47.8% (283/592), the proportion of male and female was 1: 1.02, the average age was 31years. The virus detection rate was 18.1%, Rotavirus A was the most common organism detected (8.8%), concentrated in winter, popular in children.Secondly,Norovirus GI/GII (8.4%),Adenovirus 40/41 was five cases. The positive rate of bacteria was 35.5%, Enterotoxigenic E.coli (8.4%, 50/592) was most frequently detected in summer, common in young adults. The other pathogens were Campylobacter 7.7%, Salmonella 7.0%, Clostridium difficile toxinA/B 3.5%, Shigella 3.3%,E.coli O157 3.3% and Shiga toxin-producing E.coli LT/ST 1.7%.None of Yersinia enterocolitica and Vibrio cholerae was detected. There were ten samples with parasitic (1.7%), five samples were positive for Cryptosporidium, three for Entamoeba histolytica and two for Giardia. All of them did not have obvious distribution followed by season and population. Totally 242(40.8%) infected specimens with single pathogen were detected. There were 41 (6.9%) co-infections samples, including two pathogens 36 cases (6.1%), three pathogens in 5 cases (0.8%). CONCLUSIONS: xTAG((R)) GPP multiplex PCR is simple, sensitive, specific and can be used as a quick way to diagnose the infectious diarrhea. Diarrhea pathogen has significant characteristics with the season and crowd.
TI  - Multicenter evaluation of the BioFire FilmArray gastrointestinal panel for etiologic diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis.
AB  - The appropriate treatment and control of infectious gastroenteritis depend on the ability to rapidly detect the wide range of etiologic agents associated with the disease. Clinical laboratories currently utilize an array of different methodologies to test for bacterial, parasitic, and viral causes of gastroenteritis, a strategy that suffers from poor sensitivity, potentially long turnaround times, and complicated ordering practices and workflows. Additionally, there are limited or no testing methods routinely available for most diarrheagenic Escherichia coli strains, astroviruses, and sapoviruses. This study assessed the performance of the FilmArray Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel for the simultaneous detection of 22 different enteric pathogens directly from stool specimens: Campylobacter spp., Clostridium difficile (toxin A/B), Plesiomonas shigelloides, Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, enteroaggregative E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli (stx1 and stx2) (including specific detection of E. coli O157), Shigella spp./enteroinvasive E. coli, Cryptosporidium spp., Cyclospora cayetanensis, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, adenovirus F 40/41, astrovirus, norovirus GI/GII, rotavirus A, and sapovirus. Prospectively collected stool specimens (n = 1,556) were evaluated using the BioFire FilmArray GI Panel and tested with conventional stool culture and molecular methods for comparison. The FilmArray GI Panel sensitivity was 100% for 12/22 targets and >/=94.5% for an additional 7/22 targets. For the remaining three targets, sensitivity could not be calculated due to the low prevalences in this study. The FilmArray GI Panel specificity was >/=97.1% for all panel targets. The FilmArray GI Panel provides a comprehensive, rapid, and streamlined alternative to conventional methods for the etiologic diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis in the laboratory setting. The potential advantages include improved performance parameters, a more extensive menu of pathogens, and a turnaround time of as short as 1 h.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of two commercial multiplex panels for detection of gastrointestinal pathogens by use of clinical stool specimens.
AB  - The detection of pathogens associated with gastrointestinal disease may be important in certain patient populations, such as immunocompromised hosts, the critically ill, or individuals with prolonged disease that is refractory to treatment. In this study, we evaluated two commercially available multiplex panels (the FilmArray gastrointestinal [GI] panel [BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT] and the Luminex xTag gastrointestinal pathogen panel [GPP] [Luminex Corporation, Toronto, Canada]) using Cary-Blair stool samples (n = 500) submitted to our laboratory for routine GI testing (e.g., culture, antigen testing, microscopy, and individual real-time PCR). At the time of this study, the prototype (non-FDA-cleared) FilmArray GI panel targeted 23 pathogens (14 bacterial, 5 viral, and 4 parasitic), and testing of 200 mul of Cary-Blair stool was recommended. In contrast, the Luminex GPP assay was FDA cleared for the detection of 11 pathogens (7 bacterial, 2 viral, and 2 parasitic), but had the capacity to identify 4 additional pathogens using a research-use-only protocol. Importantly, the Luminex assay was FDA cleared for 100 mul raw stool; however, 100 mul Cary-Blair stool was tested by the Luminex assay in this study. Among 230 prospectively collected samples, routine testing was positive for one or more GI pathogens in 19 (8.3%) samples, compared to 76 (33.0%) by the FilmArray and 69 (30.3%) by the Luminex assay. Clostridium difficile (12.6 to 13.9% prevalence) and norovirus genogroup I (GI)/GII (5.7 to 13.9% prevalence) were two of the pathogens most commonly detected by both assays among prospective samples. Sapovirus was also commonly detected (5.7% positive rate) by the FilmArray assay. Among 270 additional previously characterized samples, both multiplex panels demonstrated high sensitivity (>90%) for the majority of targets, with the exception of several pathogens, notably Aeromonas sp. (23.8%) by FilmArray and Yersinia enterocolitica (48.1%) by the Luminex assay. Interestingly, the FilmArray and Luminex panels identified mixed infections in 21.1% and 13.0% of positive prospective samples, respectively, compared to only 8.3% by routine methods.
TI  - Comparison of MALDI-TOF MS, gene sequencing and the Vitek 2 for identification of seventy-three clinical isolates of enteropathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to evaluate the analytical and practical performance of the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) compared to the sequencing method and the Vitek 2 system for identi fi cation of enteropathogens in the clinical microbiology laboratory. METHODS: Ten type strains and 73 clinical isolates of enteropathogens representing eight genera were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. All isolates were also characterized by gene sequencing allowing interpretation of the results from MALDI-TOF MS. In addition, MALDI-TOF MS was compared with the Vitek 2 system for the identi fi cation of ten isolates of Aeromonas and six of Salmonella. RESULTS: As previously known, identification between Shigella and Escherichia coli is not possible to distinguish. MALDI-TOF MS produced the correct identifications for all other type strains and clinical isolates to the genus level. Fifteen Campylobacter jejuni, six Campylobacter coli, three Plesiomonas shigelloides, three Yersinia enterocolitica, two Clostridium difficile, one Vibrio parahaemolyticus, one Vibrio fluvialis, and one Vibrio cholera were all correctly identi fi ed to the species level. Genus and species identifications of ten Aeromonas and six Salmonella isolates by MALDI-TOF MS were consistent with those by the Vitek 2, but with much less cost and about ten times faster. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that MALDI-TOF MS is a powerful tool for fast, accurate and low-cost identi fi cation of enteropathogens in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Evaluation of a multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection of bacterial and viral enteropathogens in stool samples of paediatric patients.
AB  - We evaluated a multiplex PCR assay, the Seeplex Diarrhoea ACE detection, that simultaneously detects 15 enteric pathogens, including Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Vibrio spp., toxin B producer Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli, adenovirus, Group A rotavirus, norovirus GI and GII, and astrovirus. We compared this assay with clinical methods routinely used in our laboratory, for detecting enteropathogens in stool samples collected from 245 paediatric patients with suspected infectious gastroenteritis. We recovered 61 bacterial pathogens and 121 enteric viruses with our laboratory assays, while we detected 78 bacteria and 167 viruses with the molecular assay. We calculated specificity and sensitivity for both methods after analysis of discordant results and demonstrated greater sensitivity for multiplex PCR than for our routine methods, with the exception of Salmonella spp. and toxigenic C. difficile detection. The multiplex PCR assay proved to be a reliable tool to directly detect the most common enteropathogens in stool samples but with some limitations.
TI  - Improved detection of gastrointestinal pathogens using generalised sample processing and amplification panels.
AB  - We aimed to streamline the diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease by producing multiplexed real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panels employing universal sample processing for DNA and RNA containing pathogens. A total of 487 stored, previously characterised stool samples comprising bacterial, viral, protozoan and Clostridium difficile positive samples were tested using four multiplexed real time PCR panels. A further 81 pre-selected clinical samples from a teaching hospital were included to provide an independent validation of assay performance. Improved sensitivity was achieved using the protozoan panels and 16 more mixed infections were observed compared to tests with conventional methods. Using the C. difficile panels, 100% sensitivity was achieved when compared to the gold standard of toxigenic culture. In addition, hypervirulent strains including ribotype 027 could be identified directly from primary sample without the need for ribotyping methods. Bacterial and viral panels detecting Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, norovirus groups I and II, rotavirus A, astrovirus, sapovirus, rotavirus B, adenovirus and adenovirus 40/41 performed as well as conventional methods, whilst allowing detection in 3 hours from processing to result. Multiplex real time PCR panels with universal sample preparation allow streamlined, rapid diagnosis of gastrointestinal pathogens whilst extending the characterisation of pathogens present in stool samples from affected patients.
TI  - Added value of multiplex Luminex Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (xTAG(R) GPP) testing in the diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis.
AB  - The Luminex Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (xTAG((R)) GPP) detects in one assay  the most common gastroenteritis-causing pathogens and toxins, namely adenovirus 40/41, norovirus genogroup (NG) I/II, rotavirus A, Clostridium difficile toxin A/B, Campylobacter sp., Escherichia coli O157, Enterotoxigenic E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin/heat-stable enterotoxin, Salmonella sp., Shiga-toxin producing E. coli, Shiga-like toxin (Stx)1/2, Shigella sp., Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Cryptosporidium sp., Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia sp. In this study, we compared the results that were obtained by testing 393 faecal samples, collected during November and December 2011 at our laboratory, using the xTAG((R)) GPP assay with the results of the routine diagnostic procedure. This procedure includes culture for bacteria and real-time PCR for viruses and parasites, but only if the test was requested by the clinician. If the clinician did not request the test for an xTAG((R)) GPP-positive target, real-time PCR assays were used to confirm xTAG((R)) GPP positivity. Discrepant results were also tested with real-time PCR assays. A total of 83 targets were detected in 76 samples using xTAG((R)) GPP. The xTAG((R)) GPP assay detected 43 additional positives compared with the routine diagnostic procedure, of which 11 targets could not be confirmed by real-time PCR. The non-confirmed targets were Campylobacter (one sample), Salmonella (four samples), Shigella (one sample) and E. histolytica (five samples). The xTAG((R)) GPP was shown to be a convenient and sensitive assay for detection of 15 major gastrointestinal pathogens in a single molecular test, but for detection of E. histolytica and Salmonella, a confirmatory assay is indicated.
TI  - Occurrence of zoonotic clostridia and Yersinia in healthy cattle.
AB  - Zoonotic pathogens are a frequent cause of disease worldwide. This study was designed to determine the occurrence of Clostridium difficile, Clostridium botulinum, and Yersinia enterocolitica in cattle in southern Bavaria, Germany. The study population included 49 farms; 34 were dairy farms (30 also fattening beef cattle) and 15 were solely beef cattle farms. Fecal and dust samples were collected from summer 2011 to summer 2012 and analyzed using a combination of enrichment procedures and real-time PCR. For the detection of C. difficile, samples were screened for the presence of the tpi gene and toxin genes tcdA, tcdB, and cdtA. Samples also were screened for genes for C. botulinum toxins A through F and for the ail gene of Y. enterocolitica. Of 506 samples, C. difficile genes were found in 29 samples (5.7%): 25 samples from dairy farms and 4 samples from beef cattle farms. Toxin genes were identified in 17 samples, with toxigenic profiles of A(+)B(+)CDT(-), A(+)B(-)CDT(+), and A(+)B(+)CDT(+). C. botulinum toxin genes were not detected in fecal samples from cattle, but the gene for toxin B was detected in 1 (0.8%) of 125 dust samples. Y. enterocolitica genes were found in 6 (1.6%) of 382 fecal samples from three dairy farms and one beef cattle farm. This study revealed that C. difficile and Y. enterocolitica are rare on cattle farms in Bavaria, Germany. In contrast to results of previous studies, C. botulinum was not detected in fecal samples but was found very rarely in dust samples from the cattle environment.
TI  - Evaluation of Luminex xTAG gastrointestinal pathogen analyte-specific reagents for high-throughput, simultaneous detection of bacteria, viruses, and parasites of clinical and public health importance.
AB  - Acute diarrheal disease (ADD) can be caused by a range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Conventional diagnostic methods, such as culture, microscopy, biochemical assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), are laborious and time-consuming and lack sensitivity. Combined, the array of tests performed on a single specimen can increase the turnaround time (TAT) significantly. We validated a 19plex laboratory-developed gastrointestinal pathogen panel (GPP) using Luminex xTAG analyte-specific reagents (ASRs) to simultaneously screen directly in fecal specimens for diarrhea-causing pathogens, including bacteria (Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli [ETEC], Shiga toxin-producing E. coli [STEC], E. coli O157:H7, Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, and toxigenic Clostridium difficile), parasites (Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium spp., and Entamoeba histolytica), and viruses (norovirus GI and GII, adenovirus 40/41, and rotavirus A). Performance characteristics of GPP ASRs were determined using 48 reference isolates and 254 clinical specimens. Stool specimens from individuals with diarrhea were tested for pathogens using conventional and molecular methods. Using the predictive methods as standards, the sensitivities of the GPP ASRs were 100% for adenovirus 40/41, norovirus, rotavirus A, Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., and E. coli O157:H7; 95% for Giardia lamblia; 94% for ETEC and STEC; 93% for Shigella spp.; 92% for Salmonella spp.; 91% for C. difficile A/B toxins; and 90% for Campylobacter jejuni. The overall comparative performance of the GPP ASRs with conventional methods in clinical samples was 94.5% (range, 90% to 97%), with 99% (99.0% to 99.9%) specificity. Implementation of the GPP ASRs enables our public health laboratory to offer highly sensitive and specific screening and identification of the major ADD-causing pathogens.
TI  - Yersinia enterocolitica YopT and Clostridium difficile toxin B induce expression  of GILZ in epithelial cells.
AB  - Glucocorticoid induced-leucine zipper (GILZ) has been shown to be induced in cells by different stimuli such as glucocorticoids, IL-10 or deprivation of IL-2. GILZ has anti-inflammatory properties and may be involved in signalling modulating apoptosis. Herein we demonstrate that wildtype Yersinia enterocolitica which carry the pYV plasmid upregulated GILZ mRNA levels and protein expression in epithelial cells. Infection of HeLa cells with different Yersinia mutant strains revealed that the protease activity of YopT, which cleaves the membrane-bound form of Rho GTPases was sufficient to induce GILZ expression. Similarly, Clostridium difficile toxin B, another bacterial inhibitor of Rho GTPases induced GILZ expression. YopT and toxin B both increased transcriptional activity of the GILZ promoter in HeLa cells. GILZ expression could not be linked to the inactivation of an individual Rho GTPase by these toxins. However, forced expression of RhoA and RhoB decreased basal GILZ promoter activity. Furthermore, MAPK activation proved necessary for profound GILZ induction by toxin B. Promoter studies and gel shift analyses defined binding of upstream stimulatory factor (USF) 1 and 2 to a canonical c-Myc binding site (E-box) in the GILZ promoter as a crucial step of its trans-activation. In addition we could show that USF-1 and USF-2 are essential for basal as well as toxin B induced GILZ expression. These findings define a novel way of GILZ promoter trans-activation mediated by bacterial toxins and differentiate it from those mediated by dexamethasone or deprivation of IL-2.
TI  - The patient presenting with acute dysentery--a systematic review.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The etiologies, clinical presentations and diagnosis of acute pathogen-specific dysentery in children and adults in industrialized and developing regions is described to help develop recommendations for therapy. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature published between January 2000 and June 2011 to determine the frequency of occurrence of pathogen-specific dysentery. RESULTS: Shigella, Salmonella, and Campylobacter remain the most frequent bacterial causes of dysentery worldwide. Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is potentially important in industrialized countries. Entamoeba histolytica must be considered in the developing world, particularly in rural or periurban areas. Clinicians should use epidemiological clues and knowledge of endemicity to suspect Vibrio spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium difficile, Cytomegalovirus or Schistosoma mansoni in cases presenting with dysentery. A single fecal sample studied for etiologic agents is the customary way to make an etiologic diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: While a majority of dysenteric cases will not have an identifiable agent causing the illness, when an etiologic organism is identified, other than STEC, each has a specific recommended form of therapy, which is provided in this review.
TI  - Enteric bacterial pathogens with zoonotic potential isolated from farm-raised deer.
AB  - The raising of captive white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is a growing agricultural industry in Ohio as it is in several other areas of the United States and around the world. Pooled fecal samples were collected from 30 white-tailed deer confinement facilities. Samples were cultured for five enteric bacterial pathogens. Premise prevalence rates were as follows: Escherichia coli O157, 3.3%; Listeria monocytogenes, 3.3%; Salmonella enterica, 0%; Yersinia enterocolitica, 30%; and Clostridium difficile, 36.7%. The ail virulence gene could not be amplified from any of the Y. enterocolitica isolates recovered. Toxigenic strains of C. difficile polymerase chain reaction ribotype 078, an emerging C. difficile genotype of humans and food animals, were recovered from 4 of 11 (36.4%) C. difficile-positive deer farms. Venison from farm-raised deer might become contaminated with foodborne pathogens, deer farmers may have occupational exposure to these zoonotic agents, and farm-raised deer could be a reservoir from which the environment and other livestock may become contaminated with a number of potentially zoonotic bacteria.
TI  - Identification of candidate genes for susceptibility to reactive arthritis.
AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the gene expression profile in monocytes from three patients with reactive arthritis (ReA) in remission in order to identify candidate genes accounting for a potential susceptibility to ReA. Gene expression analyses revealed eight differentially expressed mRNA transcripts in monocytes of ReA patients. The major part of genes encoded cytokines, growth factors and chemokines. There was a remarkably high proportion of proangiogenic factors, in particular IP10, ENA-78, and IL-8 accounting for a genetically determined susceptibility to ReA at the host cell level.
TI  - Etiology of acute gastroenteritis in three sentinel general practices, Austria 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied the etiology of acute gastroenteritis in a village with a  total population of approximately 6,000. This is the first study in Austria that has investigated a broad range of pathogens recovered from an unselected population of patients who had consulted general practitioners because of gastroenteritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2007, all patients who visited one of three local general practitioners for acute gastroenteritis were invited to provide stool specimens to be tested for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) (mTSB enrichment [R-Biopharm] followed by toxin ELISA plus culture), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Yersinia, Vibrio cholerae, Clostridium difficile (toxin plus culture), rotavirus plus adenovirus (RIDA) Quick Rotavirus/Adenovirus Combi test), Giardia duodenalis plus Cryptosporidium parvum (RIDA) Quick Cryptosporidium/Giardia Combi test), astrovirus (ELISA), and norovirus (reverse-transcriptase PCR). RESULTS: Stool specimens were provided by 306 patients (161 female) with acute diarrhea. The ages of the patients ranged from 1 to 89 years (mean 37, median 36). Pathogens were detected in 71 (23.2%) patients, with incidence peaks in February and June. Norovirus accounted for 36.0% of positive results, C. difficile for 18.7%, rotavirus for 17.3%, Campylobacter for 9.3%, Salmonella for 6.6%, adenovirus for 5.4%, G. duodenalis and C. parvum for 2.7% each, and Yersinia enterocolitica for 1.3%. No cases of shigellosis or infection with EHEC, EPEC, or astrovirus were diagnosed. Viruses accounted for 58.7% of the 75 positive results, bacteria for 36.0%, and parasites for 5.3%. CONCLUSION: Our study underlines a dominant role of norovirus and toxigenic C. difficile as etiologic agents of acute gastroenteritis among the patients of general practitioners.
TI  - Computer-aided identification of polymorphism sets diagnostic for groups of bacterial and viral genetic variants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes that exhibit presence/absence variation have provided informative marker sets for bacterial and viral genotyping. Identification of marker sets optimised for these purposes has been based on maximal generalized discriminatory power as measured by Simpson's Index of Diversity, or on the ability to identify specific variants. Here we describe the Not-N algorithm, which is designed to identify small sets of genetic markers diagnostic for user-specified subsets of known genetic variants. The algorithm does not treat the user-specified subset and the remaining genetic variants equally. Rather Not-N analysis is designed to underpin assays that provide 0% false negatives, which is very important for e.g. diagnostic procedures for clinically significant subgroups within microbial species. RESULTS: The Not-N algorithm has been incorporated into the "Minimum SNPs" computer program and used to derive genetic markers diagnostic for multilocus sequence typing-defined clonal complexes, hepatitis C virus (HCV) subtypes, and phylogenetic clades defined by comparative genome hybridization (CGH) data for Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica and Clostridium difficile. CONCLUSION: Not-N analysis is effective for identifying small sets of genetic markers diagnostic for microbial sub-groups. The best results to date have been obtained with CGH data from several bacterial species, and HCV sequence data.
TI  - Diarrhea etiology in a Children's Hospital Emergency Department: a prospective cohort study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the frequency of recovery of pathogens from children with diarrhea who presented to a pediatric emergency department and characterized the associated illnesses, to develop guidelines for performing a bacterial enteric culture. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of all patients with diarrhea who presented to a large regional pediatric emergency department during the period from November 1998 through October 2001. A thorough microbiologic evaluation was performed on stool specimens, and the findings were correlated with case, physician, and laboratory data. RESULTS: A total of 1626 stool specimens were studied to detect diarrheagenic bacteria and, if there was a sufficient amount of stool, Clostridium difficile toxin (688 specimens), parasites (656 specimens), and viruses (417 specimens). One hundred seventy-six (47%) of 372 specimens that underwent complete testing yielded a bacterial pathogen (Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, 39 specimens [of which 28 were serotype O157:H7]; Salmonella species, 39; Campylobacter species, 25; Shigella species, 14; and Yersinia enterocolitica, 2), a viral pathogen (rotavirus, 85 specimens; astrovirus, 27; adenovirus, 18; or rotavirus and astrovirus, 8), a diarrheagenic parasite (5 specimens); or C. difficile toxin (46 specimens). Samples from 2 patients yielded both bacterial and viral pathogens. A model to identify predictors of bacterial infection found that international travel, fever, and the passing of >10 stools in the prior 24 h were associated with the presence of a bacterial pathogen. Physician judgment regarding the need to perform a stool culture was almost as accurate as the model in predicting bacterial pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one-half of the patients who presented to the emergency department with diarrhea had a definite or plausible pathogen in their stool specimens. We were unable to develop a model that was substantially better than physician judgment in identifying patients for whom bacterial culture would yield positive results. The unexpectedly high rate of C. difficile toxin warrants further examination.
TI  - Etiology of diarrhea in pediatric outpatient settings.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency with which bacteria cause diarrhea evaluated in ambulatory settings is often unknown. We attempted to determine the microbiologic etiology of diarrhea in a private pediatric practice (site A) and a clinic serving largely immigrant children (site B) and to establish guidelines for bacterial culture. METHODS: Children with diarrhea were prospectively enrolled, and their stools were examined for diarrheagenic bacteria, viruses and parasites. RESULTS: A total of 123 and 103 children were enrolled at sites A and B, respectively. Stools from all (100%), 126 (55.8%), 104 (46.0%) and 75 (33.2%) were tested for bacterial enteric pathogens, parasites, Clostridium difficile toxin and viruses, respectively. Of the 75 patients whose stool underwent complete testing, 36 (48%) contained at least 1 definitive or plausible pathogen. Twelve stools (5.3%) tested positive for bacteria [Campylobacter jejuni (n = 7), Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella serogroup D and Salmonella Braenderup (n = 1 each)]. One contained Blastocystis hominis, 8 contained C. difficile toxin and 16 contained viruses (9 rotavirus, 5 adenovirus and 2 astrovirus). Visible fecal blood (P = 0.029), increased stool frequency (P = 0.035), abdominal tenderness (P = 0.011) and fecal white (P < 0.001) or red blood cells (P = 0.002) were associated with bacterial infection. All children with stool yielding diarrheagenic bacteria or C. difficile toxin had at least 1 of these factors, but so did 75% of children without these agents (positive predictive value, 11%; negative predictive value, 100%; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 25%). CONCLUSIONS: The bacterial diarrhea prevalence is similar to that in other ambulatory studies, although the spectrum differs. Exclusion criteria for stool testing in diarrhea remain elusive. Studies to determine the etiology of unexplained diarrhea and cost-effective algorithms for diarrhea diagnosis, are needed.
TI  - Activation of NF-kappaB and IL-8 by Yersinia enterocolitica invasin protein is conferred by engagement of Rac1 and MAP kinase cascades.
AB  - Yersinia enterocolitica triggers activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and production of the proinflammatory chemokine interleukin (IL)-8 in intestinal epithelial cells. This activation is due to adhesion of the bacteria via their outer membrane protein invasin to the host cells. Using Clostridium difficile toxins that specifically inactivate small GTPases, and transfection of inhibitory proteins of the Rho-GTPases, we demonstrate that Rac1, but not Cdc42 or Rho, is required for activation of NF-kappaB by invasin. Invasin activated the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) p38 and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) but not extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK). The functional relevance of these pathways for invasin-mediated IL-8 expression was assessed by protein kinase inhibitors and dominant-negative kinase mutants. While NF-kappaB and JNK contribute to IL-8 transcription, p38 MAPK also acts through stabilization of IL-8 mRNA, as confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Transfection experiments with I-kappaB kinase (IKK)1 and IKK2 mutants indicate that the release of NF-kappaB from its cytoplasmic inhibitor I-kappaB and its translocation into the nucleus is mediated by these kinases. Our data identify Rac1 as a key intermediate in invasin-triggered IL-8 synthesis and demonstrate that maximum IL-8 induction involves several MAP kinase cascades.
TI  - A 5-year study of the bacterial pathogens associated with acute diarrhoea on the  island of Crete, Greece, and their resistance to antibiotics.
AB  - During a 5-year period (1995-1999) a total of 7090 stool samples obtained from patients with acute diarrhoea, mostly community-acquired, were examined for bacterial pathogens, in the Greek island of Crete. One or more enteric pathogens were isolated from 987 patients (14%). Salmonella enterica were the most commonly isolated bacteria (6%), followed by Campylobacter spp. (4.2%), and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (1.8%). Yersinia enterocolitica (0.6%), Shigella spp. (0.3%), and Aeromonas hydrophila (0.04%), were less frequently isolated. Clostridium difficile was isolated from 65 out of 451 diarrhoeal specimens examined (14.4%). Toxin B was detected in all cases. No verotoxigenic E. coli strains were identified. Resistance to ampicillin was observed in 31.5% of the Salmonella, 58.3% of the Shigella and 31.5% of the EPEC isolates. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was observed in 4.4% of the Salmonella, 30.5% of the Shigella, and 18.5% of the EPEC isolates. High percentages of resistance to quinolones (44.5% to norfloxacin, and 40.5% to ciprofloxacin), were found among Campylobacter isolates, while resistance to erythromycin was observed in 14.9% of them. With the present study we continue the surveillance of bacterial pathogens associated with diarrhoeal disease on the island of Crete.
TI  - IgG antibodies against microorganisms and atopic disease in Danish adults: the Copenhagen Allergy Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seropositivity to food-borne and orofecal microorganisms (hepatitis A virus, Helicobacter pylori, and Toxoplasma gondii ), which are considered to be markers of poor hygiene, has been reported to be associated with a lower prevalence of atopy. In contrast, colonization of the gut with Clostridium difficile, a potential intestinal bacterial pathogen, in early childhood may be associated with a higher prevalence of atopy. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between atopy and exposure to 2 groups of food-borne and orofecal microorganisms: (1) markers of a poor hygiene and (2) intestinal bacterial pathogens. METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based study of 15- to 69-year-olds living in Copenhagen, Denmark, was carried out in 1990 to 1991. Atopy was defined as a positive test result for specific IgE to at least 1 of 6 inhalant allergens. Exposure to microorganisms was assessed as IgG seropositivity to microorganisms. RESULTS: Seropositivity to 2 or 3 markers of poor hygiene (hepatitis A virus, H pylori, and T gondii ) was associated with a lower prevalence of atopy (adjusted odds ratio, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.8). In contrast, seropositivity to 2 or 3 intestinal bacterial pathogens (C difficile, Campylobacter jejuni, and Yersinia enterocolitica ) was associated with a higher prevalence of atopy (adjusted odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.6). CONCLUSION: Exposure to markers of poor hygiene was associated with a lower prevalence of atopy, whereas exposure to intestinal bacterial pathogens was associated with a higher prevalence of atopy. These findings raise the hypothesis that different groups of food-borne and orofecal microorganisms may have different effects on the risk of atopy.

TI  - Infectious diarrhoea--an update.
AB  - Infectious diarrhoea is one of the most common illness affecting mankind. Recent  advancement have led to detailed understanding of causative agents and the pathogenesis of the infections. Fluid and electrolyte replacement remains the most important aspect of treatment. The role of antimicrobial agents is discussed.
TI  - Two-year study of endemic enteric pathogens associated with acute diarrhea in New Caledonia.
AB  - A longitudinal study of diarrheal disease among patients of all ages with acute diarrhea was carried out in New Caledonia from January 1990 to December 1991. Stool samples from 2,088 diarrheal patients were examined for parasites, rotavirus, and bacterial pathogens. Potential sources of contamination (drinking water, seawater and bovine and porcine feces) were investigated. One or more enteric pathogens were identified in 41.8 and 40.6% of the persons with diarrhea, in 1990 and 1991, respectively. Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., HEp-2 cell adherent Escherichia coli (diffuse adherent and enteroaggregative), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (EPEC adherence factor-positive strains belonging to classical serotypes), localized adherent E. coli (non-EPEC), and enterotoxigenic E. coli were the frequently identified enteropathogenic bacteria. Other major enteropathogens were Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia. Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Yersinia enterocolitica, and rotavirus were isolated from only a few patients. No Vibrio spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Shiga-like-toxin-producing E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, or enteroinvasive E. coli were identified. Shiga-like toxin I-producing E. coli were present in adult bovines and calves, and heat-stable enterotoxin II-producing enterotoxigenic E. coli were found in pigs.
TI  - Enterotoxigenic bacteria in the sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  - Faecal samples from 123 infants who died with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and from a comparative group of 52 age-matched babies were analysed for toxigenic bacteria and their toxins. Serum samples from the SIDS infants were also analysed for these toxins. A significantly higher proportion of toxigenic bacteria and their toxins were found in faecal samples of SIDS babies than in samples from the comparative group. These toxins were also found in serum from the SIDS babies. Clostridium perfringens was found in 54 (45.4%) of 119 SIDS cases compared with 10 (19.6%) of 51 healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.1, p < 0.01); C. difficile in 33 (27.7%) of 119 SIDS cases compared with 8 (14.8%) of 54 healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.43ns, p < 0.1); Staphylococcus aureus in 12 (27.3%; 66.7% enterotoxigenic) of 44 SIDS cases compared with 12 (85.7%; non-enterotoxigenic) of 14 healthy babies (chi 2 = 14.9, p < 0.001); C. botulinum in 6 (5.0%) of 120 SIDS cases compared with 0 of 53 healthy babies (chi 2 = 2.74, p < 0.1). Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonellae and Bacillus cereus were not detected. Heat-labile toxin, lethal to mice (HLML) was found in 32 (27.1%) of 118 SIDS faecal samples compared with 5 (10.6%) of 47 healthy babies (chi 2 = 5.24, p < 0.05); cytotoxins in 38 (30.9%) of 123 SIDS faecal samples compared with 0 of 21 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 8.8, p < 0.01) and 24 (27.6%) of 87 SIDS serum samples. C. perfringens enterotoxin was detected in 33 (34.4%) of 96 SIDS faecal extracts compared with 0 of 23 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.94, p < 0.001), and in 27 (24.5%) of 110 SIDS serum samples. C. perfringens alpha-toxin (presumptive) was detected in 14 (17.5%) of 80 SIDS faecal extracts compared with 0 of 17 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.5ns, p congruent to 0.05) and in 2 (2.3%) of 87 SIDS serum samples. C. difficile toxin was detected in four SIDS faecal samples and two serum samples. C. botulinum toxin was detected in only one of 120 SIDS faecal samples compared with none of 49 from healthy babies. Staphylococcal enterotoxins were detected in 8 (19.5%) of 41 SIDS faecal samples compared with 0 of 19 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 4.278, p < 0.05), and in 4 (10.8%) of 37 SIDS serum samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Travelers' diarrhea among United States military personnel during joint American-Egyptian armed forces exercises in Cairo, Egypt.
AB  - A study was conducted of travelers' diarrhea in a United States military population on deployment in Cairo, Egypt, during July and August 1987. Acute diarrhea requiring medical attention developed in 183 (4%) of 4,500 troops. A possible etiologic agent was identified in 49% of all diarrhea cases. Enteric pathogens associated with cases of diarrhea included: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (17% ST-producers, 13% LT-producers, and 3% LT/ST-producers); Shigella (9%); Campylobacter spp. (2%); Salmonella (2%); and Vibrio cholerae non-01 serogroup (2%). Other enteric pathogens isolated from one episode each of diarrhea included Aeromonas hydrophila group, Plesiomonas shigelloides, and Bacillus cereus. Yersinia enterocolitica, enteroinvasive E. coli, intoxications by Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile, and pathogenic enteric parasites were not found in any of the 183 patients with diarrhea. A survey of military personnel not requesting medical care indicated that up to 40% of troops may have had diarrhea during this deployment. Acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in U.S. military personnel deployed to Egypt.
TI  - [Value of microbiologic studies for diagnosis of post-enteritis reactive arthritis].
AB  - Reactive arthritis may develop within a period of some days until upto 3 weeks after infections with Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni/coli, Shigella and Salmonella. Intestinal infections with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Cryptosporidium, Strongyloides stercoralis, Taenia saginata and Schistosoma mansoni are, in some cases, considered to be responsible for reactive arthritis. Detection of pathogenic bacteria in feces is generally most successful in the early stage of the infection. A large spectrum of special tests is required in order to detect all the causative agents and to ensure reliable results. It is therefore necessary that the laboratory is provided with information about the diagnostic object and the tentative diagnosis. The detection of serum antibodies to Y. enterocolitica, Y. pseudotuberculosis, C. jejuni/coli, and Schistosoma may suggest connections between infection and reactive arthritis.
TI  - Diagnosis of infectious diarrheal diseases.
AB  - For many years, microbiologic examination of feces was focused on the isolation of two members of the family Enterobacteriaceae--Salmonellae and Shigellae. Over the past two decades, other enteric pathogens such as the various classes of diarrheagenic E. coli, Campylobacter, Vibrio spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Clostridium difficile have gained prominence. A newly recognized protozoan parasite, Cryptosporidium is now known to infect both immunocompetent and immunodeficient individuals. Added to these is the growing list of viruses incriminated in diarrheal diseases and gastritis. This article provides some of the basic information needed to allow for the isolation and identification of many of the currently recognized enteric pathogens. It also provides information on some of the currently available rapid test procedures that will speed up stool specimen testing and allow for more timely reporting to the physician.
TI  - Acute diarrhoea in adults: aetiology, clinical appearance and therapeutic aspects.
AB  - A prospective study of acute diarrhoea was performed during 15 months 1981/1982 and included 731 patients and 240 controls. 43% had been infected abroad. A cluster of travellers with bacterial pathogens was diagnosed in July-August. The following pathogens were found: Campylobacter (18%), enterotoxigenic E. coli (6%), Salmonella spp. (5%), rotavirus (4%), Yersinia enterocolitica (3%), Giardia lamblia (3%), Shigella spp. (2%), Clostridium difficile (2%), enteroviruses (2%) and Entamoeba histolytica (less than 1%). More than 90% of the bacterial or parasitic enteropathogens were detected in the first stool sample. Only 10% of the patients needed hospital treatment and for 97% oral fluids were sufficient. The median duration of diarrhoea was 9 days. No fatal cases occurred and only 2 cases of chronic bowel disease were detected.
TI  - In vitro activity of azithromycin (CP-62,993), a novel macrolide, against enteric pathogens.
AB  - Azithromycin (CP-62,993 [9-deoxy-9A-methyl-9A-aza-9A-homoerythromycin]) is a novel macrolide antimicrobial. In this study the in vitro activity of CP-62,993 has been determined against selected enteropathogens, including Clostridium difficile, and compared with that of erythromycin. MICs were determined using an agar incorporation technique in Mueller-Hinton medium, containing saponin-lysed horse blood at a final concentration of 10% v/v, with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu. CP-62,993 was considerably more active than erythromycin against Salmonella typhi (MIC90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l, respectively), S. enteritidis (MIC90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), Shigella flexneri (MIC90 2 and 32 mg/l), Sh. dysenteriae (MIC90 2 and 32 mg/l), Sh. sonnei (MIC90 4 and 32 mg/l), Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90 0.12 and 1 mg/l), Vibrio cholerae (MIC90 0.25 and 8 mg/l), V. parahaemolyticus (MIC90 0.5 and 8 mg/l), Yersinia enterocolitica (MIC90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), Escherichia coli-ETEC (MIC90 4 and 32 mg/l), E. coli-EIEC (MIC90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), Plesiomonas shigelloides (MIC90 1 and 8 mg/l) and Aeromonas hydrophila (MIC90 4 and 32 mg/l). CP-62,993 (MIC90 2 mg/l) was slightly less active than erythromycin (MIC90 1 mg/l) against isolates of C. difficile. The results suggest a potential clinical role for CP-62,993 in the treatment of enteric infections where antimicrobial therapy is indicated.
TI  - Acute gastroenteritis in children attending day-care centres with special reference to rotavirus infections. I. Aetiology and epidemiologic aspects.
AB  - Acute gastroenteritis (GE) among 214 children (aged 6 months-7 years) attending day-care centres (DDCs) in the Copenhagen County was studied during a 12-month period. A total of 197 cases of GE was observed in 109 children (i.e. 51% of the participants). The aetiology was as follows: rotavirus (n = 48) (24%), pathogenic bacteria (n = 11) (6%), Giardia lamblia (n = 3) (2%), while the aetiology of 68% remains unknown. The pathogenic bacteria included Yersinia enterocolitica, thermophilic Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile (+/- toxin) and enteropathogenic E. coli. In 4% of the GE the infections were multiple and Cryptosporidium was seen in one of these cases. The rate of GE declined with age from 1.35 GE per child per year (age group 1.0- less than 2.0 years) to 0.36 (6.0- less than 8.0 years). Serum sampled at the start of the study period showed that the frequency of detectable rotavirus IgG increased with age from 48% in the 6 months- less than 1.0 year group to 96% in the 4.0- less than 7.0 year group. The highest rates of rotavirus GE occurred from January to April (i.e. the rotavirus season). Moreover, rotavirus GE was almost absent after the age of 4. Hence, the rates of rotavirus GE per rotavirus season per child were 0.80 (age group 6 months-less than 1.0 year), 0.32 (1.0-less than 2.0), 0.14 (2.0-less than 3.0), 0.16 (3.0-less than 4.0), 0.06 (4.0-less than 5.0) and 0.04 (5.0-less than 6.0). Only 2 out of the 48 rotavirus GE were reinfections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Pediatric gastroenteritis in primary care and in hospitalized patients.
AB  - One-hundred and fifty-seven consecutive children below seven years of age (primary care n = 48, hospitalized patients n = 109) with acute gastroenteritis of assumed infectious origin were studied. Rotavirus was demonstrated by electron microscopy of faeces in 44% of all patients. The occurrence of rotavirus among patients in primary care, 15%, was significantly lower than among hospitalized patients, 57% (p less than 0.01). Adenovirus was isolated in six per cent and enterovirus in two per cent of the patients with no differences between the two groups. Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter jejuni were demonstrated in each three per cent. Salmonella and Shigella spp. or Giardia lamblia were not found in any cases. Thus the cause of gastroenteritis was established in 58% of the patients. This figure was lower among patients in primary care (27%) than among hospitalized patients (72%), a difference mainly due to the high occurrence of rotavirus in the latter group. Clostridium difficile was recovered in 20 cases (12%), eight of which harboured one more enteropathogenic agent. Cultures from the nose and throat revealed Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis or group A, C and G streptococci in 58% of the patients with no differences regarding the occurrence of rotavirus in faeces. Neither Clostridium difficile nor respiratory tract pathogens were found to play a role in causation of gastroenteritis in the children investigated.
TI  - Gastrointestinal features of culture-positive Yersinia enterocolitica infection.
AB  - Yersinia enterocolitica was cultured from feces of 122 symptomatic adults in a single facility using selective culture media; all isolates were confirmed in an independent reference laboratory. Of 128 isolates, multiple serotypes were defined and all were biochemically typical for Yersinia enterocolitica. Other agents were seen in 20 patients; of these, seven were Yersinia fredriksenii and six were Clostridium difficile. Diarrhea (80%) and abdominal pain (64%) were common, whereas other features such as fever (9%) and bloody stools (8%) were unusual. Use of antibiotics (24%) or opiates (28%) in the month before culture was common. The terminal ileum was seen radiographically in 20 patients, but only two barium studies showed abnormalities. Fiberoptic endoscopy and biopsy studies, done in greater than 50% of the cases, showed minimal or no changes in most patients. However, 3 patients had pseudomembranous colitis with concomitant Clostridium difficile cytotoxin and 7 had diffuse severe colitis. New culture techniques, and possibly geographic differences, have contributed to the high isolation rates of this organism. Yersinia enterocolitica occurs sporadically, involves a variety of serotypes, and is associated with a broader clinical spectrum than was formerly appreciated.
TI  - Aetiology and epidemiology of acute gastro-enteritis in Swedish children.
AB  - In a prospective 1-year study, 144 children attending or admitted to hospital and 272 children outside hospital with acute gastro-enteritis and 200 controls were investigated by a broad panel of diagnostic methods for enteropathogenic agents in the faeces and for related antibody responses. Enteropathogens were identified in 77% of the inpatients, 63% of the outpatients and 8% of the controls. Rotavirus and Yersinia enterocolitica were detected significantly more often among inpatients. Altogether, viral, bacterial and parasitic agents were found in 58%, 14% and 1% of diarrhoeal patients, respectively. The isolation of more than one pathogenic agent was uncommon (6.5%). Rotavirus (45%) and enteric adenoviruses 40 and 41 (7.9%) predominated among the viruses, while Campylobacter jejuni (4.8%) was most common among the bacteria. Clostridium difficile and/or its cytotoxin, which were found in 14% of the children with gastroenteritis and in 15% of the controls, were significantly associated with antibiotic therapy but not with gastro-intestinal illness. Diarrhoeal infections of unknown aetiology exhibited a seasonal peak in the autumn. The duration of excretion of enteropathogens was investigated. Rotavirus particles were detectable by solid-phase immune electron microscopy for 14-25 days after the diarrhoea had ceased. Transmission of rotavirus and bacterial pathogens within families was studied also.
TI  - Yersinia colitis masquerading as pseudomembranous colitis.
AB  - We describe a 15-month-old male who presented with fever and diarrhea 24 hr after receiving antibiotics for otitis media. A flexible sigmoidoscopy was initially interpreted endoscopically as antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis, and the patient was treated with vancomycin. The diagnosis of antibiotic-associated colitis was excluded in our patient by the negative stool examination for Clostridium difficile toxin, the failure to obtain supportive features on rectal biopsy, and the failure to demonstrate sigmoidoscopic improvement with vancomycin therapy. Thirteen days later, Y. enterocolitica was cultured from the initial stool specimens. In this case, the raised central whitish area on an erythematous base was misinterpreted as pseudomembranous colitis.
TI  - Bacterial diarrhoea.
AB  - Bacterial infections are important causes of diarrhoea in infants and children, particularly in developing countries and in other settings where standards of personal and community hygiene are low. Knowledge of bacterial diarrhoeas has been significantly expanded in recent years by the finding that many episodes of acute diarrhoea are due to infections with bacteria which produce enterotoxins that interfere with intestinal fluid and electrolyte transport (the 'enterotoxigenic' diarrhoeas). Several 'newer' bacterial agents have also been identified which would not have been detected in earlier studies of the epidemiology of infective diarrhoeas; these include Aeromonas, Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile and Yersinia. Another important advance has been new knowledge about mechanisms by which bacteria cause diarrhoea; this has led to the widespread successful application of oral rehydration therapy in treatment of acute watery diarrhoeas.
TI  - [Epidemiology, etiology and laboratory diagnosis of infectious diarrhea diseases  in the tropics].
AB  - Diarrhoeal diseases belong to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical countries, especially in infants and small children. About one billion episodes are estimated for this group of age with 4.6 million fatalities. Many causes are discussed to explain the high incidence: bottle feeding of infants, protein malnutrition, unsafe drinking water and unsafe disposal of excrements and sewage, unsufficient consciousness of personal and domestic hygiene, lack of knowledge on the origin of disease, and inadequate food hygiene. Among the viral infectious agents rotavirus is isolated from 30-40% of enteritis cases in infants and small children; Norwalk virus, adenovirus and human calicivirus, too, appear to occur worldwide. Enteropathogenic (EPEC) and, especially, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are of primary importance as bacterial pathogens. Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli primarily cause disease in infants and small children. Shigellae are important whereas salmonellae are less frequently identified as a cause for diarrhoeal illness. Yersinia enterocolitica is rare in tropical countries. Cholera and infections with other vibrionaceae (V. cholerae non-01, V. mimicus, V. parahaemolyticus, aeromonas, Plesiomonas shigelloides) mainly occur in coastal areas. Clostridium perfringens type C is the causal agent of Enteritis necroticans in several countries, especially New Guinea. C. difficile appears to be of minor importance. Among the parasites Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica are the most important organisms causing diarrhoeal disease. Macroscopic (visible blood) and microscopic stool examination (faecal leukocytes) may be helpful in dysenteric disease to distinguish between shigella and E. histolytica infections; it is, however, of limited usefulness to discriminate between organisms causing watery diarrhoea.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141, a new semisynthetic cephamycin, compared with those of five cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. The MICs of MT-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the MICs of MT-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. In contrast, the bactericidal activity of MT-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive Proteus species, Serratia marcescens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Clostridium perfringens. In the treatment of systemic infections in mice, MT-141 was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. It was found that the 50% effective doses of the six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the MBCs than with the MICs. As the serum levels of MT-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity of MT-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.
TI  - Comparative study of the nature and biological activities of bacterial enterotoxins.
AB  - It is apparent that there are considerable similarities between many of the enterotoxins produced by enteric pathogens. Although the effect of most of these toxins is restricted to the intestine in vivo, many cells are also sensitive to intoxication in vitro. The resultant in-vitro biochemical changes may have no pathological significance but serve to underline the central role of cyclic nucleotides in cellular fluid regulation. The biological activity of these enterotoxins is the result of interaction with membrane-bound adenylate cyclase, leading to persistent elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurs consistently after a characteristic lag phase which varies somewhat between toxins. The duration and degree of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the various toxins may point to possible differences in affinity, dissociation and mechanism of activation of the cyclase molecule. Subtle events at, or within, the cell membrane must occur during intoxication and may include complex associations of toxin with membrane lipid and protein components. The heat-labile toxins of V. cholerae, E. coli, Salmonella spp., A. hydrophila and Y. enterocolitica have much in common in their structures, membrane receptors and biochemical modes of action. Similarly the heat-stable toxins of E. coli and Y. enterocolitica, match each other in their biological activities. Classified along with the enterotoxin of C. perfringens, the enterotoxin produced by Sh. dysenteriae (and possibly some strains of E. coli) appears to differ from the other enterotoxins by acting on protein biosynthesis primarily and not on the nucleotide cyclase activation systems. In another category must be placed the various enterotoxins produced by Staph. aureus until more is known. Surprisingly little research has been directed towards the elucidation of their mode of action, although much is known of their serological and structural differences. Evidence to date suggests that staphylococcal enterotoxins differ from the other diarrhoeagenic agents discussed in this review. The structural and immunological similarities between the various heat-labile enterotoxins suggest a common genetic origin with gene transfer between the different bacterial species being responsible for the spread of enterotoxigenicity. It is possible that many of the "newer" enterotoxins owe their origin to genetic recombination with the "older" enteropathogens like V. cholerae.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin against Campylobacter spp. and other bacterial enteric pathogens.
AB  - A comparison was made of the in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin (Bay o 9867) with nine other antibiotics against isolates of Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium difficile, Vibrio spp., and Escherichia coli. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin were the lowest of any compound tested for all organisms except C. difficile.
TI  - Recent advances in management of bacterial diarrhea.
AB  - The number of recognized infectious causes of diarrhea potentially treatable with specific antibiotics has markedly increased within the past ten years. Laboratories are developing and expanding their abilities to deal with these new pathogens. Neither prophylaxis nor specific treatment of diarrhea in travelers is simple, practical, and safe. Although enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli is the most important cause of diarrhea in U.S. travelers to tropical areas, Campylobacter jejuni causes acute diarrhea in persons in the United States about as often as do Salmonella and Shigella. Vibrio parahemolyticus is an important cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis following ingestion of improperly cooked shellfish; Bacillus cereus is important in outbreaks of diarrhea after ingestion of improperly cooked and stored rice in Chinese restaurants. Although Yersinia enterocolitica is probably an important cause of severe enteritis in the United States, imperfect techniques for its isolation and lack of good serologic tests have hampered recognition of its importance. Practical means for diagnosing antibiotic-associated colitis and the role of Clostridium difficile toxins in this disease are now available. Vancomycin, metronidazole, bacitracin, and cholestyramine are useful in treatment of antibiotic-associated colitis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin (MK-0366, AM-715) and other agents against gastrointestinal tract pathogens.
AB  - A comparison was made of the in vitro activities of norfloxacin and of nine other orally administered antibacterial agents against 180 clinical isolates representing the bacterial species most frequently implicated in infections of the gastrointestinal tract in humans. The 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations showed norfloxacin to be 4, 15, 4, 17, 17, 17, and 33 times more active than the next best compound tested against Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Yersinia enterocolitica, respectively, with an overall 90% minimal inhibitory concentration of less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Norfloxacin was least active against Clostridium difficile (90% minimal inhibitory concentration, 128 micrograms/ml). These results should encourage further evaluation of norfloxacin as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of enteric bacterial infections for which antibiotic therapy is indicated.
TI  - Intestinal occurrence of Campylobacter fetus subspecies jejuni and Clostridium difficile in children in Sweden.
AB  - Stool samples were cultured from 356 children in different states of health and in different age groups between birth and six years of age in order to investigate the occurrence of Campylobacter jejuni and Clostridium difficile. Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from two of 56 children with diarrhoea but was not isolated from any of 300 healthy children or children recently treated with antibiotics. Campylobacter jejuni does not seem to be a common cause of diarrhoea in children in Sweden and is definitely not a member of the normal fecal flora. Clostridium difficile was isolated from 17 of 100 healthy children one week to one year old, and from one of 100 perinatal children. About the same isolation frequency was found in children with diarrhoea and in children recently treated with antibiotics. A total of 34 isolates of Clostridium difficile were obtained, 29 of which were from children less than one year old. The isolation of Clostridium difficile in stools of children should in most cases be considered a normal finding.
