TI  - Draft Genome Sequence of Clostridium butyricum Strain NOR 33234, Isolated from an Elderly Patient with Diarrhea.
AB  - Clostridium butyricum is one of the species frequently present in patients' stool samples. However, the identification of this species is sometimes difficult. Here, we present the draft genome of Clostridium butyricum NOR 33234, which was isolated from a patient with suspected Clostridium difficile infection-associated diarrhea and resembles Clostridium clostridioforme in biochemical tests.
TI  - Growth-Inhibiting and morphostructural effects of constituents identified in Asarum heterotropoides root on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in Asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. METHOD: A microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the test materials against the organisms. RESULTS: delta-3-Carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria (Clostridium difficile ATCC 9689, Clostridium paraputrificum ATCC 25780, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 and Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), 0.18-0.70 mg/mL) except for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 13311 (MIC, 2.94 mg/mL). The MIC of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/mL against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against C. difficile (0.70 mg/mL); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/mL) and 4 (5.80 mg/mL) against C. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/mL), 4 (12.0 mg/mL), and 7 (0.70 mg/mL) against C. perfringens); compound 1 against E. coli (7.20 mg/mL) and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (12.0 mg/mL). Overall, all of the constituents were less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (MIC, 0.063-0.25 mg/ mL). The lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium Clostridium butyricum ATCC 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (B. fragilis and E. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. Beneficial Gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful Gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria was not observed. Scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. CONCLUSION: A. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.
TI  - Clostridium difficile infection associated with antituberculous agents in a patient with tuberculous pericarditis.
AB  - Clostridium difficile can cause pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). Antimicrobial agent exposure is a risk factor for Clostridium difficile-associated disease, whereas the use of antituberculous (anti-TB) agents is not. We herein report a case of PMC-associated with antituberculous therapy. A 63-year-old woman with tuberculous pericarditis treated with anti-TB agents was admitted for abdominal pain and diarrhea. On colonoscopy, mucoid exudate and yellowish plaque lesions were observed. The anti-TB agents were discontinued, and the patient was treated with metronidazole and clostridium butyricum. Her symptoms were relieved and did not recur when the anti-TB agents were restarted. In this report, we review the literature and discuss the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of this case.
TI  - Genetic characteristics of toxigenic Clostridia and toxin gene evolution.
AB  - Clostridia comprise a heterogenous group of environmental bacteria containing 15  pathogenic species, which produce the most potent toxins. The origin of toxins is still enigmatic. It is hypothesized that toxins exhibiting an enzymatic activity have derived from hydrolytic enzymes, which are abundantly secreted by these bacteria, and that pore-forming toxins have evolved from an ancestor transmembrane protein. The presence of related toxin genes in distinct Clostridium species and the variability of some toxin genes support horizontal toxin gene transfer and subsequent independent evolution from strain to strain. Clostridium perfringens toxin genes involved in myonecrosis, mainly alpha toxin and perfringolysin genes, are chromosomally located, whereas toxin genes responsible for intestinal and food borne diseases are localized on plasmids except the enterotoxin gene which can be located either on the chromosome or plasmids. The distribution of these plasmids containing one or several toxin genes accounts for the diverse C. perfringens toxinotypes. Clostridium difficile strains show a high genetic variability. But in contrast to C. perfringens, toxin genes are clustered in pathogenicity locus located on chromosome. The presence of related toxin genes in distinct clostridial species like Clostridium sordellii, Clostridium novyi, and C. perfringens supports interspecies mobilization of this locus. The multiple C. difficile toxinotypes based on toxin gene variants possibly reflect strain adaptation to the intestinal environment. Botulinum toxin genes also show a high level of genetic variation. They have a diverse genetic localization including chromosome, plasmid or phage, and are spread in various Clostridium species (Clostridium botulinum groups, Clostridium argentinense, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium baratii). Exchange of toxin genes not only include transfers between Clostridium species but also between Clostridium and other bacterial species as well as eukaryotic cells as supported by the wide distribution of related pore-forming toxins of the aerolysin family in various clostridial and non-clostridial species, animal, mushroom and plant.
TI  - Effects of different replicons in conjugative plasmids on transformation efficiency, plasmid stability, gene expression and n-butanol biosynthesis in Clostridium tyrobutyricum.
AB  - Clostridium tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755 can produce butyric acid, acetic acid, and hydrogen as the main products from various carbon sources. In this study, C. tyrobutyricum was used as a host to produce n-butanol by expressing adhE2 gene under the control of a native thiolase promoter using four different conjugative plasmids (pMTL82151, 83151, 84151, and 85151) each with a different replicon (pBP1 from C. botulinum NCTC2916, pCB102 from C. butyricum, pCD6 from Clostridium difficile, and pIM13 from Bacillus subtilis). The effects of different replicons on transformation efficiency, plasmid stability, adhE2 expression and aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase activities, and butanol production by different mutants of C. tyrobutyricum were investigated. Among the four plasmids and replicons studied, pMTL82151 with pBP1 gave the highest transformation efficiency, plasmid stability, gene expression, and butanol biosynthesis. Butanol production from various substrates, including glucose, xylose, mannose, and mannitol were then investigated with the best mutant strain harboring adhE2 in pMTL82151. A high butanol titer of 20.5 g/L with 0.33 g/g yield and 0.32 g/L h productivity was obtained with mannitol as the substrate in batch fermentation with pH controlled at ~6.0.
TI  - Inhibition of the cytotoxic effect of Clostridium difficile in vitro by Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 strain.
AB  - In contrast to most modern pharmaceuticals, probiotics are used in many parts of  the world with little or no research data on the complex system of interactions that each strain may elicit in the human body. Research on probiotics has recently become more significant, as probiotics have begun to be prescribed by clinicians as an alternative for some gut infections, especially when antibiotics are contraindicated. This study attempted to elucidate the inhibitory interaction between the Japanese probiotic strain Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 (CBM588) and the hospital pathogen Clostridium difficile, which is responsible for a large proportion of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and colitis. CBM588 has previously shown effectiveness against C. difficile in vivo, and here it was found that the toxicity of C. difficile in in vitro co-culture with CBM588 was greatly decreased or absent. This was dependent on the inoculation ratio and was not accounted for by the small degree of growth and mRNA inhibition observed. CBM588 and its cell-free supernatant also had no effect on toxin already secreted into the culture medium, and culture of the two strains separated by a semi-permeable membrane resulted in loss of the inhibition. Therefore, it was concluded that the detoxification probably occurred by the inhibition of toxin protein production and that this required close proximity or contact between the two species. The low-pH conditions caused by organic acid secretion were also observed to have inhibitory effects on C. difficile growth, metabolism and toxicity.
TI  - Biology and genomic analysis of Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - The ability to form botulinum neurotoxin is restricted to six phylogenetically and physiologically distinct bacteria (Clostridium botulinum Groups I-IV and some strains of C. baratii and C. butyricum). The botulinum neurotoxin is the most potent toxin known, with as little as 30-100 ng potentially fatal, and is responsible for botulism, a severe neuroparalytic disease that affects humans, animals, and birds. In order to minimize the hazards presented by the botulinum neurotoxin-forming clostridia, it is necessary to extend understanding of the biology of these bacteria. Analyses of recently available genome sequences in conjunction with studies of bacterial physiology are beginning to reveal new and exciting information on the biology of these dangerous bacteria. At the whole organism level, substantial differences between the six botulinum neurotoxin-forming clostridia have been reported. For example, the genomes of proteolytic C. botulinum (C. botulinum Group I) and non-proteolytic C. botulinum (C. botulinum Group II) are highly diverged and show neither synteny nor homology. It has also emerged that the botulinum neurotoxin-forming clostridia are not overtly pathogenic (unlike C. difficile), but saprophytic bacteria that use the neurotoxin to kill a host and create a source of nutrients. One important feature that has contributed to the success of botulinum neurotoxin-forming clostridia is their ability to form highly resistant endospores. The spores, however, also present an opportunity to control these bacteria if escape from lag phase (and hence growth) can be prevented. This is dependent on extending understanding of the biology of these processes. Differences in the genetics and physiology of spore germination in proteolytic C. botulinum and non-proteolytic C. botulinum have been identified. The biological variability in lag phase and its stages has been described for individual spores, and it has been shown that various adverse treatments extend different stages of lag phase. For example, heat treatment primarily extended germination, while incubation at a chilled temperature primarily extended outgrowth. The neurotoxin gene is present within a cluster of associated genes, and can be located on the chromosome, a plasmid or a bacteriophage. Two basic types of neurotoxin cluster have been identified. Evolution of the neurotoxin gene and cluster has occurred independently of the organism, and involved a series of recombination events but is still poorly understood. Factors affecting the regulation of neurotoxin formation also remain poorly understood, and will be the focus of much future research.
TI  - Efficacy of Clostridium butyricum preparation concomitantly with Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy in relation to changes in the intestinal microbiota.
AB  - Antibiotic associated diarrhea due to human intestinal microbiota abnormalities is a side effect of H. pylori eradication therapy. We examined intestinal microbiota changes during H. pylori eradication therapy and the preventive effect of CBM588 as a probiotic agent. Nineteen patients with gastro-duodenal ulcer were randomly divided into three groups: group A (without probiotics), group B (with regular doses of CBM588) and group C (with double doses of CBM588). The incidence of diarrhea and soft stools during H. pylori eradication therapy was 43% in group A and 14% in group B, while none of the patients in group C reported diarrhea or soft stools. Both bacterial counts and detection rates of bifidobacteria and/or obligate anaerobe were decreased by eradication therapy. However, bacterial counts of obligate anaerobes in group C were significantly higher than in group A (P < 0.05). Additionally, during eradication therapy C. difficile toxin A was detected in both group A and group B but not in group C. In conclusion, these results indicate that H. pylori eradication therapy induces antibiotic associated diarrhea due to abnormalities in intestinal microbiota and/or C. difficile. However, these side effects might be prevented by probiotics.
TI  - Cytotoxicity and antimicrobial susceptibility of Clostridium difficile isolated from hospitalized children with acute diarrhea.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is an important pathogen associated with outbreaks of pseudomembranous colitis and other intestinal disorders such as diarrhea. In this study, 181 stool samples from children with and without acute diarrhea were analysed. Eighteen children with acute diarrhea were positive to C. ramosum, C. difficile, C. limosum, C. clostridioforme, C. septicum, C. butyricum, C. innocuum and Clostridium sp. Nineteen children without diarrhea harbored C. ramosum, C. septicum, C. barattii, C. butyricum, C. innocuum, C. sphenoides, C. bifermentans, C. clostridioforme and C. paraputrificum. No patient with diarrhea harbored C. barattii, C. bifermentans, C. paraputrificum and C. sphenoides. In addition, ten C. difficile strains were detected in 5 (5.5%) of the children with diarrhea. Also, no children from control group harbored C. difficile, C. limosum and Clostridium sp. Most of the tested strains were resistant to all the used antimicrobial. Nine C. difficile were toxigenic on VERO cells and by multiplex PCR, six strains showed both toxin A and B genes and three strains showed only toxin B gene. In this study, the presence of C. difficile was not significant, and it is suggested the need of more studies to evaluate the role of clostridia or C. difficile play in the childhood diarrhea and these organisms must be looked for routinely and a periodic evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility should be performed.
TI  - Evidence for clostridial implication in necrotizing enterocolitis through bacterial fermentation in a gnotobiotic quail model.
AB  - Despite extensive research, the pathogenesis of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains elusive. The aim of our work was to investigate the role of bacterial strains involved in NEC in gnotobiotic quails as experimental model. Six groups of germ-free quails that were fed a lactose diet were associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, C. paraputrificum, or C. butyricum (two strains). Implantation level, incidence of cecal lesions, production of short-chain fatty acids, and histologic lesions of the cecal wall were investigated. Whatever the strain, the implantation level was high (10(9) UFC/g). Neither K. pneumoniae nor C. difficile induced any cecal lesions. In contrast, the four other clostridial strains led to cecal NEC-like lesions with a variable occurrence: four of 12 quails for C. perfringens, eight of 12 quails for C. paraputrificum, and the same highest value, nine of 12 quails and eight of 10 quails for both C. butyricum strains. Gross aspects of the lesions may be linked to the short-chain fatty acid profiles and/or concentrations: thickening of the cecal wall (C. butyricum and C. perfringens) with high proportion of butyric acid, hemorrhages (C. paraputrificum) with high proportion of iso-butyric acid, and presence of other iso-acids. In addition, C. butyricum was characterized by pneumatosis, linked to a high gas production. Microscopic aspects confirmed the presence of edemas and intramucosa hemorrhages. Clostridia species, whose role is controversial, seem to be strongly implicated in NEC through excessive production of butyric acid as a result of colonic lactose fermentation. These results call for anaerobe detection in feces of infants who have NEC.
TI  - Development of an ELISA kit using monoclonal antibody to Clostridium difficile toxin A.
AB  - AIM: To establish an ELISA kit using monoclonal antibodies against Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin A. METHODS: An indirect sandwich ELISA was described using the purified rabbit monospecific antiserum as capturing antibody. After the polystyrene microtitre plates with 96 flat-bottomed wells were coated with rabbit antiserum, the wells were blocked with 100 g/L BSA in PBS-T. C. difficile toxin A or culture filtrates were added to each well and then monoclonal antibodies IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was added as detecting antibody, tetramethylbenzidine was used as substrate and A450 of the stopped reacting product was recorded in an automated plate reader. RESULTS: The tested specimens included culture filtrates of 2 strains of toxigenic C. difficile, 2 strains of non-toxigenic C. difficile, 26 strains of E. coli, 2 strains of S. dysenteriae, 1 strain of Bif. infantis, 5 strains of V. cholera, 2 strains of S. typhi, 7 strains of C. botulinum, 1 strain of toxigenic C. sordllii, and 1 strain of C. butyricum. A total of 47 strains of culture filtrates were all negative except for 2 strains of toxigenic C. difficile. The detective limitation of toxin A was 0.1 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: An ELISA kit with high specificity and excellent sensitivity for the rapid detection of C. difficile toxin A was established. It will be a useful tool for diagnostic test of C. difficile toxin A.
TI  - A case if infant botulism due to neurotoxigenic Clostridium butyricum type E associated with Clostridium difficile colitis.
AB  - Reported here is the sixth case of intestinal toxemia botulism caused by Clostridium butyricum type E in Italy since 1984. In this case, the patient was concomitantly affected with colitis due to Clostridium difficile toxin. A review of previously reported cases revealed that some of these patients may also have had intestinal toxemia botulism associated with Clostridium difficile colitis, based on the reported symptoms. Given that this association has been shown to exist not only in Italy but also in the USA, it is recommended that individuals with intestinal botulism and symptoms of colitis undergo testing for Clostridium difficile and its toxins in fecal samples.
TI  - Design of species-specific primers to identify 13 species of Clostridium harbored in human intestinal tracts.
AB  - The genus Clostridium is dominant in human intestinal tracts and plays an important role in human health. We designed species-specific primers to identify 13 species of Clostridium (C. perfringens, C. paraputrificum, C. bifermentans, C. difficile, C. clostridiiforme, C. nexile, C. sphenoides, C. indolis, C. ramosum, C. cocleatum, C. butyricum, C. sordellii, and C. innocuum) easily and rapidly. The PCR annealing temperature was set at a uniform 60 C for application to all strains at the same time. To confirm the specificities of these primers, 85 intestinal bacteria in total, including type strains, reference strains, and isolates were used. Ten primers (including those for C. perfringens to C. cocleatum) indicated high specificities. Although there were some cross-reactions with the other three primers, the target species were distinguishable from other bacteria by the different sizes of PCR products.
TI  - Clostridial pathogenicity in experimental necrotising enterocolitis in gnotobiotic quails and protective role of bifidobacteria.
AB  - The pathogenesis of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) remains unclear. Gnotobiotic quails fed a lactose diet have been used to investigate the role of clostridial strains originating from faecal specimens of neonates through the intestinal lesions, the changes in microflora balance and the production of bacterial metabolites, i.e., short-chain fatty acids and hydrogen. Bifidobacteria are thought to exert various beneficial effects on host health, including interaction with the colonic microflora. Therefore, it was hypothesised that a protective role could be exercised through bifidobacterial colonisation. A Clostridium butyricum strain (CB 155-3) and a whole faecal flora including three clostridial species (C. butyricum, C. perfringens, C. difficile), each from premature infants suffering from NEC, caused caecal lesions in quails similar to those observed in man, i.e., thickening of the caecal wall with gas cysts, haemorrhagic ulceration and necrotic areas. Conversely, a whole faecal flora including bifidobacteria (identified as Bifidobacterium pseudo-catenulatum) and no clostridia, isolated from a healthy premature infant, was unable to produce NEC-like lesions. When the two clostridial groups were associated with a Bifidobacterium strain (B. infantis-longum, CUETM 89-215, isolated from a healthy infant), bifidobacterial colonisation suppressed all pathological lesions. This study is the first demonstration of a protective role for bifidobacteria against NEC via the inhibition of growth of C. butyricum or the disappearance of C. perfringens. C. difficile was not found to be responsible for the aetiology of the caecal lesions in quails. The main effect of bifidobacteria on lactose fermentation was either a dramatic decrease or a disappearance of butyric acid. The protective role was not associated with changes in H2 production. Therefore, a new step between colonic colonisation and its relevance to NEC is thought to involve the fermentation of unabsorbed lactose into butyric acid at the onset of the disease.
TI  - Clostridial infection in children.
AB  - A survey of the isolation of Clostridium spp. from 1543 specimens sent to anaerobic microbiology laboratories revealed 113 isolates from 107 specimens (7.0% of all specimens) from 96 children. The isolates comprised 43 (38%) unidentified Clostridium spp., 37 (33%) C. perfringens, 13 (12%) C. ramosum, five (4%) C. innocuum, six (5%) C. botulinum, three (3%) C. difficile, two (2%) C. butyricum, and one isolate each of C. bifermentans, C. clostridiiforme, C. limosum and C. paraputrificum. Most clostridial isolates were from abscesses (38), peritonitis (26), bacteraemia (10), and chronic otitis media (7). Predisposing or underlying conditions were present in 31 (32%) cases. These were immunodeficiency (12), malignancy (9), diabetes (7), trauma (7), presence of a foreign body (6) and previous surgery (6). The clostridia were the only bacterial isolates in 14 (15%) cases; 82 (85%) cases had mixed infection. The species most commonly isolated with clostridia were anaerobic cocci (57); Bacteroides spp. (B. fragilis group) (50), Escherichia coli (22), pigmented Prevotella or Porphyromonas spp. (18) and Fusobacterium spp. (10). Most Bacteroides and Escherichia coli isolates with clostridia were from abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections adjacent to the rectal area; most pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, and head and neck sites. Antimicrobial therapy was given to all patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage in 34 (35%). Only two patients died. These data illustrate the importance of Clostridium spp. in paediatric infections.
TI  - Trypsin-dependent production of an antibacterial substance by a human Peptostreptococcus strain in gnotobiotic rats and in vitro.
AB  - An antibacterial substance appeared within 1 day in feces of gnotobiotic rats harboring a human intestinal Peptostreptococcus strain. It disappeared when the rat bile-pancreatic duct was ligatured or when the rats ingested a trypsin inhibitor. Anaerobic cultures of the Peptostreptococcus strain in a medium supplemented with trypsin also exhibited an antibacterial activity, which was also inhibited by the trypsin inhibitor. In vitro the antibacterial substance from both feces and culture medium was active against several gram-positive bacteria, including other Peptostreptococcus spp., potentially pathogenic Clostridium spp. such as C. perfringens, C. difficile, C. butyricum, C. septicum, and C. sordellii, Eubacterium spp., Bifidobacterium spp., and Bacillus spp. Whatever the order of inoculation of the strains, a sensitive strain of C. perfringens was eliminated within 1 day from the intestine of rats monoassociated with the Peptostreptococcus strain. These findings demonstrate for the first time that very potent antibacterial substances can be produced through a mechanism involving intestinal bacteria and exocrine pancreatic secretions.
TI  - [Preventive effect of Clostridium butyricum M588 against the proliferation of Clostridium difficile during antimicrobial therapy].
AB  - Fecal flora of the patients without remarkable gastrointestinal diseases were studied. All patients were treated with antimicrobial drugs with or without Miya-BM (the preparation of Clostridium butyricum M588). The stools were examined before and after (during) antimicrobial treatment. Fecal flora of 69 patients before medication was almost the same with that of healthy adults as has been reported by Mitsuoka et al. After giving antimicrobials, most bacterial genus except Enterococcus and Yeasts in the stool decreased their detection rate and their population. This floral change was not much influenced by co-administration of Miya-BM. The detection rate of Clostridium difficile and/or the toxin A from the stool were markedly increased after giving antimicrobials. When Miya-BM was co-administered with antimicrobials, however, the detection of C. difficile and/or toxin A was very rare. C. butyricum M588 was recovered from 7 cases out of 10 patients treated with antimicrobials and Miya-BM. Non-spore form of C. butyricum was dominant in the feces of 3 cases, and spore form was dominant in the other 4. This result showed that administered C. butyricum M588 germinated in intestinal tract.
TI  - Formation of amphetamine from its nitro analogue by anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  - 1. Microbial reduction of 1-phenyl-2-nitropropane 1 was carried out using 40 strains of intestinal anaerobic bacteria. Among them, 12 strains (Mitsuokella multiacidus, Clostridium perfringens, C. innocuum, C. clostiriiforme, C. difficile, C. butyricum, C. sp., Eubacterium limosum, E. aerofaciens, E. multiforme, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and P. productus) had the ability to reduce 1 to amphetamine 2 (0.1-1% yield). 2. Clostridium species were more active than another intestinal anaerobic bacteria. 3. When Clostridium perfringens was used in preparative fermentation, the yield of 2 was increased, and its absolute structure had an (S)-configuration with an optical purity of 68% in enantiomeric excess.
TI  - [Morphological changes in human embryonic lung fibroblasts caused by cytotoxins of various Clostridium species].
AB  - A total of 243 strains of 35 Clostridium species were tested for cytotoxin production in cooked meat medium or liver broth within 48-72 h at 37 degrees C, using human embryonal lung fibroblasts in tissue-culture as indicator cells. Cytotoxin could be detected in the culture-filtrates of all toxigenic strains of C. chauvoei, C. difficile, C. histolyticum, C. novyi types A and B, C. septicum and C. tetani, but not in the atoxigenic ones. The cytotoxin of C. novyi correlated with alpha-toxin in the culture filtrate. All strains of C. perfringens and C. novyi D tested were not cytotoxic for lung fibroblasts despite their pathogenicity for guinea-pigs. Further cytotoxigenic strains were found among C. hastiforme, C. limosum, C. oceanicum, C. putrificum, C. ramosum, C. sordellii, C. sporogenes, and C. subterminale. The morphological changes in lung fibroblasts caused by the culture filtrates were characteristic and species-specific and corresponded with pathogenicity for guinea-pigs and/or mice. No cytotoxin was produced by C. absonum, C. barati, C. bifermentans, C. botulinum (atoxic), C. butyricum, C. cadaveris, C. carnis, C. clostridioforme, C. cochlearium, C. glycolicum, C. innocuum, C. malenominatum, C. mangenotii, C. paraputrificum, C. putrefaciens, C. rectum, C. tertium, and C. tyrobutyricum.
TI  - Role of volatile fatty acids in colonization resistance to Clostridium difficile  in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is an agent involved in the development of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. The purpose of this work was to investigate the role of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in resistance to colonization by C. difficile by using a gnotobiotic animal model. Accordingly, germfree mice were associated with different hamster flora, and the VFAs in their cecal contents were measured by gas chromatography. The results showed that VFAs were produced mainly by the intestinal flora, especially by the strictly anaerobic bacteria. In these associated mice, the concentrations of acetic, propionic, and butyric acids were higher than those of other acids, but at pH 6.8 the MICs of these three acids in vitro for C. difficile were more than 200 mu eq/ml. In gnotobiotic mice monoassociated with C. difficile and in the isolated ceca of these mice, VFAs did not inhibit the growth of C. difficile. In gnotobiotic mice which were diassociated with C. difficile and C. butyricum and given drinking water with a lactose concentration of 20%, the cecal contents included about the same amount of butyric acid as did those of the monoassociated mice, although the population of C. difficile remained the same. Therefore, it is suggested that VFAs alone cannot inhibit intestinal colonization by C. difficile and that, consequently, other inhibitory mechanisms are also present.
TI  - Pathogenicity of Clostridium species with other bacteria in mixed infections.
AB  - The relationship of clostridial isolates with other bacteria in mixed infections  was studied by means of a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. We used 26 isolates of seven clostridial species, two Bacteroides spp., eight Gram-positive facultative or anaerobic cocci and three enteric Gram-negative aerobic rods. Abscesses were induced by all seven Clostridium perfringens and three C. butyricum isolates and by some of the others. Selective antimicrobial therapy experiments showed that enteric Gram-negative rods were of equal or greater significance in the formation of abscesses than were clostridial strains in mixed infections. Enhancement or suppression of each component of the mixed infection was studied by comparing the number of each bacterium to its number when injected alone. Enhancement was observed mainly with C. perfringens in mixed infections. By contrast, other Clostridium spp. were less able to induce enhancement. Clostridium difficile and C. sporogenes often inhibited other bacterial species. This study demonstrated the synergistic and antagonistic relationship between clostridial species and other bacteria.
TI  - [Comparison between the number and nature of fecal clostridia and other risk factors implicated in the intestinal pathology of newborn infants].
AB  - One-hundred and fifteen infants aged 1 to 31 days from two intensive-care units were grouped into 6 classes according to clinical criteria (enterocolitis with or without anatomopathological examination and pneumatosis intestinalis, "haemorrhagic colitis", acute diarrhoea or absence of intestinal disorders). The total number of viable bacteria, the number of Clostridium and, in some cases, the presence of rota- and/or coronavirus were determined in their stools. The incidence of Clostridium in the stools of infants with enterocolitis (with or without pneumatosis intestinalis) or haemorrhagic colitis was not significantly different from that of infants without intestinal disorders, whereas stools of infants with acute diarrhoea less often contained Clostridium than those of other infants. C. butyricum, C. difficile, C. perfringens, C. tertium, and C. sordellii were identified. Correspondence analysis comparing the variable, "clinical profile", with 23 other variables, suggested that the variables of gemellity, a birthweight below 1900 g, a gestational age of less than 35 weeks, respiratory distress, umbilical catheterization and a Clostridium count above 10(7)/g at the onset of clinical signs, i.e. between 8 to 12 days of age, were linked to the clinical profile of necrotizing enterocolitis with pneumatosis intestinalis. Conversely, the absence of gemellity, a high birthweight and gestational age, the absence of respiratory distress or umbilical catheterization, the onset of diarrhoea within 8 days, and the presence of rota- and/or coronavirus in the stools were linked with a clinical profile of acute diarrhoea.
TI  - [Implantation of a mutant of Escherichia coli requiring diaminopimelic acid in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice].
AB  - A DAP- auxotroph mutant of Escherichia coli DP50 requiring DAP and thymidine for  growth was used as the receptor strain in genetic engineering. It failed to be implanted in axenic mice. However, when an inoculum containing more than 10(7) bacteria/ml was used, the DAP+ reverse mutant devoid of requirement for DAP became implanted. When axenic mice were previously associated with Clostridium difficile containing DAP in the cell wall, the strain DAP- became implanted even when the inoculum was too small to permit implantation in axenic mice. Conversely, C. butyricum and C. perenne, whose cell walls also contain DAP, did not allow the establishment of a DAP- mutant. In animals associated with complex human flora without enterobacteria, neither of the 2 DAP- and DAP+ mutants became implanted.
TI  - Changes in the cell wall of Clostridium species following passage in animals.
AB  - Morphological changes in clostridial isolates after animal passage with other flora in mixed infections were studied by utilizing a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. We used 26 isolates of 7 clostridial species, and one isolate each of Bacteroides fragilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Abscesses were induced by all 7 Clostridium perfringens and 3 Clostridium butyricum isolates and by some of the other isolates. A thick granular wall prior to animal inoculation was shown only in C. perfringens, C. butyricum, and C. difficile. This structure was observed in other clostridia only following their animal passage alone or when co-inoculated with K. pneumoniae or B. fragilis.
TI  - Survey of neuraminidase production by Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium beijerinckii, and Clostridium difficile strains from clinical and nonclinical sources.
AB  - Neuraminidase production was investigated in 57 Clostridium butyricum strains, 16 Clostridium beijerinckii strains, and 25 Clostridium difficile strains. Neuraminidase activity was found only in C. butyricum strains originating from one human newborn with neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, two newborns with hemorrhagic colitis, one infected placenta, and one adult with peritonitis, It was concluded that neuraminidase was not a major virulence factor in C. butyricum strains.
TI  - Enteric colonization in sporadic neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.
AB  - Microflora of the gut was studied close to the onset of sporadic necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in neonates. Enteric flora in 25 babies with NEC differed from that in 23 matched controls. Bacteroides spp and lactobacilli were less common in babies with NEC compared with controls: 32 versus 61% (p = 0.03) and 12 versus 48% (p = 0.006), respectively. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from 40% of babies with NEC compared with 13% of controls (p = 0.03). It was present in 33% of babies with NEC aged less than 14 days but was not detected in control babies of the same age. The incidences of C. butyricum and C. difficile were similar in patients and controls. Colonization with C. perfringens in the absence of a protective barrier flora may be crucial in the pathogenesis of severe sudden onset NEC. Two potentially valuable marker factors to predict onset of this form of sporadic NEC are the use of fecal smears and estimation of fecal tryptic activity.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of clinical isolates of clostridia.
AB  - Over a 2 1/2 year period 361 clinical isolates of clostridia, representing 28 species, were tested for susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents. Penicillin resistant strains were tested for their ability to produce beta-lactamase: of the commonly isolated species only Clostridium beijerinckii/butyricum produced the enzyme. Cl. perfringens exhibited a low incidence of resistance to all of the agents tested. Cl. difficile showed a high degree of resistance to penicillin and clindamycin, whilst all strains were sensitive to vancomycin. Chloramphenicol and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid were found to be highly active against most clostridia; metronidazole was the only agent to which no resistance was demonstrable.
TI  - Development of gut colonisation in pre-term neonates.
AB  - Twenty-eight pre-term babies of low birth weight were monitored for developing microflora in throat, stomach and faeces during the first 3 weeks of life. The flora at all levels of the gastrointestinal tract differed from that of healthy breast-fed and artificially fed full-term babies. Colonisation of throat and stomach was delayed beyond 4 days of life in 87% and 60% of babies respectively. Only 10% of babies had "normal" oral flora throughout the period of study. Flora of the stomach was sparse, and resembled faecal flora. Faecal flora was established more rapidly than throat or stomach flora, and 70% of babies were colonised during the first 4 days of life. Initially Bacteroides spp. were predominant (57% babies), but Escherichia coli and other aerobic gram-negative bacilli gradually increased in frequency. Colonisation by gram-positive bacteria was slow. Clostridium spp. were present in only 10% of babies during the first 4 days of life. Most strains were transient. Colonisation with C. butyricum (30%), C. perfringens (35%) and C. difficile (25%) was maximum after the first 2 weeks of life. Lactic-acid-producing bacteria usually appeared late in the third week of life. Parenteral feeding immediately after birth was associated with delayed colonisation by a restricted number of species. Parenteral antibiotics (penicillin or gentamicin or both) restricted colonisation with normal oral flora, the lactic-acid-producing bacteria and penicillin-sensitive clostridia, but had little effect on E. coli even when the colonising strain was sensitive to the aminoglycoside in the regimen. Systemic spread of bacteria via the blood stream was not detected in any babies. The pattern of colonisation of the enteric tract in pre-term infants in the special-care nursery studied, differs from that of healthy full-term babies; this merits consideration when the results of bacteriological tests of this vulnerable group of infants are being interpreted.
TI  - Clostridia isolated from the feces of infants during the first year of life.
AB  - Clostridia isolated from the feces of ten healthy infants during the first year of life were identified. All infants excreted clostridia during the first week of life; the most common species were Clostridium butyricum, C. paraputrificum, and C. difficile. In the formula-fed infants colonization occurred consistently throughout the year, whereas in some breast-fed infants it was inhibited until weaning. The species isolated most frequently throughout the year were C. paraputrificum, C. butyricum, C. ramosum, C. sartagoformum, and C. perfringens. Of the species often found in infants, C. butyricum, C. difficile, and C. sartagoformum occur rarely in adults, reflecting differences in the environmental conditions in the gut of the two age groups. The mechanism by which environmental conditions select species of clostridia is unknown but may be important to our understanding of a variety of clostridial intestinal infections. It was demonstrated that species of clostridia which have been implicated in the etiology of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis form part of the normal infant gastrointestinal microflora.
TI  - The metabolism of pyrimidines by proteolytic clostridia.
AB  - Uracil was used by growing cultures of Clostridium sporogenes, and by proteolytic strains of C. botulinum types A and B. Uracil was not used by C. bifermentans; C. botulinum, type B (non-proteolytic); C. botulinum, type F (non-proteolytic); C. botulinum, type E; C. butyricum; C. cochlearium; C. difficile; C. histolyticum; C. oedematiens, type A; C. paraputrificum; C. scatologenes; C. specticum; C. sordellii; C. sticklandii; C. tertium; C. tetani; C. tetanomorphum; C. welchii, types A, B, C, E and 4 untyped strains. The growth of C. sporogenes was not increased by uracil; it was reduced to dihydrouracil. Experiments with washed cells of C. sporogenes showed that the uracil-reducing system was inducible. Washed cell suspensions incubated under hydrogen with uracil, thymine, iso-barbituric acid, 5-amino uracil and cytosine consumed 1 mole H2/mole pyrimidine. The reduction product of cytosine was dihydrouracil indicating that it was deaminated before reduction. The reduction products of the remaining pyrimidines were the corresponding dihydro derivatives. Extracts of C. sporogenes reduced uracil in the presence of NADPH2 but not NADH2.
