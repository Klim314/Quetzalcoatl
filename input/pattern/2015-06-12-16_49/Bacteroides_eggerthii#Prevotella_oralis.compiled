TI  - Prevotella, a new genus to include Bacteroides melaninogenicus and related species formerly classified in the genus Bacteroides.
AB  - It was recently proposed that the genus Bacteroides should be restricted to Bacteroides fragilis (the type species) and closely related organisms (viz., B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B. stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, and B. vulgatus). By contrast, the moderately saccharolytic, predominantly oral Bacteroides species, which include B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, and related species, form a phenotypically and phylogenetically coherent group of species which differ so significantly from the emended description of the genus Bacteroides that they should not be classified in the same genus. Therefore, we formally propose that these species be reclassified in a new genus, Prevotella. The type species is Prevotella melaninogenica.
TI  - The isolation and identification of Bacteroides spp. from the normal human faecal flora.
AB  - Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli of the Bacteroides group were isolated on an enriched selective medium from specimens of faeces from 20 normal healthy adults and identified by conventional bacteriological methods. A heavy growth of Bacteroides spp. was obtained from all specimens and 10 representative colonies from each subject were identified. Most isolates (84%) belonged to the B. fragilis group. The commonest species identified in this group were B vulgatus and B. thetaiotaomicron (22% each), B. distasonis (18%) and the B. eggerthii/variabilis complex (14%), and only 9% were B. fragilis. B. vulgatus was isolated from 80% of subjects, B. thetaiotaomicron and B. distasonis from 70% each and the B. eggerthii/variabilis complex from 65%, but B. fragilis was detected in only 45% of specimens. Asaccharolytic species were isolated in smaller numbers from 14 (70%) subjects, but only five strains of the B. melaninogenicus/oralis group were isolated and fusobacteria were not detected.
