TI  == the use of pcr for the identification and characterisation of bacteriocin genes from bacterial strains isolated from rumen or caecal contents of cattle and sheep.
AB  == pcr primers were designed to amplify the gene that encodes bovicin 255 from streptococcus gallolyticus lrc0255 and the bacteriocin genes from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains ar10 and or79a (bvid and bvi79a) in order to screen for their incidence in rumen and caecal b. fibrisolvens and streptococcus bovis-like  isolates from new zealand and north american ruminants. none of the b. fibrisolvens-like strains (n=34) isolated from new zealand or north america had the genes encoding for butyrivibriocins ar10 (bvid) or or79 (bvi79a). however, seven s. bovis isolates from new zealand ruminants and three from north american  animals had the bovicin 255 gene. sequence comparison of cloned bovicin 255 pcr products indicated a 92.9-95.7% similarity to that of the corresponding bovicin 255 gene sequence of s. gallolyticus. four of the new zealand bovicin 255 positive s. bovis isolates were from the caecal contents of the same sheep and had identical pfge profiles. two other s. bovis isolates sharing the same pfge profile were isolated from a separate animal from the same flock. pfge analysis of the north american strains indicated that all three were closely related as two of three had identical pfge profiles with the remaining isolate differing only by a single band position. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the 10 isolates were at least 99.8% identical to s. bovis. all 10 s. bovis isolates having the gene for bovicin 255 produced bacteriocin activity that inhibited the growth of peptostreptococcus anaerobius d1 in a deferred antagonism plating (dap) assay. certain s. bovis isolates obtained from ruminants have bacteriocin activity associated with a distinct bovicin 255 gene sequence but it appears that bacteriocin production by the rumen anaerobe b. fibrisolvens may be uncommon in strains isolated from cattle and sheep in new zealand.

TI  == phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization of ruminal tannin-tolerant bacteria.
AB  == the 16s rrna sequences and selected phenotypic characteristics were determined for six recently isolated bacteria that can tolerate high levels of hydrolyzable  and condensed tannins. bacteria were isolated from the ruminal contents of animals in different geographic locations, including sardinian sheep (ovis aries), honduran and colombian goats (capra hircus), white-tail deer (odocoileus  virginianus) from upstate new york, and rocky mountain elk (cervus elaphus nelsoni) from oregon. nearly complete sequences of the small-subunit rrna genes,  which were obtained by pcr amplification, cloning, and sequencing, were used for  phylogenetic characterization. comparisons of the 16s rrna of the six isolates showed that four of the isolates were members of the genus streptococcus and were most closely related to ruminal strains of streptococcus bovis and the recently described organism streptococcus gallolyticus. one of the other isolates, a gram-positive rod, clustered with the clostridia in the low-g+c-content group of  gram-positive bacteria. the sixth isolate, a gram-negative rod, was a member of the family enterobacteriaceae in the gamma subdivision of the class proteobacteria. none of the 16s rrna sequences of the tannin-tolerant bacteria examined was identical to the sequence of any previously described microorganism  or to the sequence of any of the other organisms examined in this study. three phylogenetically distinct groups of ruminal bacteria were isolated from four species of ruminants in europe, north america, and south america. the presence of tannin-tolerant bacteria is not restricted by climate, geography, or host animal, although attempts to isolate tannin-tolerant bacteria from cows on low-tannin diets failed.
