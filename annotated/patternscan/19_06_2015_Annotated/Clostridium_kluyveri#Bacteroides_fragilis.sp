TI  == alpha-isopropylmalate synthase as a marker for the leucine biosynthetic pathway in several clostridia and in bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == alpha-isopropylmalate synthase (ec 4.1.3.12) is present in extracts of bacteroides fragilis, clostridium thermoaceticum, clostridium formicoaceticum, clostridium pasteurianum, and clostridium kluyveri with specific activities (micromol alpha-isopropylmalate formed per min and g protein) of 8.6, 8.9, 2.4, 1.9, and 0.3, respectively. the product alpha-isopropylmalate was identified by gas chromatography combined with mass spectroscopy. the presence of 5mm leucine in the growth medium represses the synthesis of alpha-isopropylmalate synthase in c. thermoaceticum by 40 and 70%. the enzyme from c. pasteurianum was partially purified to a specific activity of 1413. all studied enzyme properties are similar to those of the enzymes from aerobic bacteria. it is suggested that in these anaerobic bacteria the alpha-isopropylmalate pathway is present in addition to the pathway via the ferrodoxin-dependent, reductive carboxylation of branched  chain fatty acids.
