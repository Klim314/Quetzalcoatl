antibacterial activity of selected standard strains of lactic acid bacteria producing bacteriocins--pilot study.
introduction: in this paper, an attempt was made to evaluate the antibacterial potential of standard strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) producing bacteriocins of various classes, thus demonstrating various mechanisms of cell membrane damages against the streptococcus agalactiae strains (group b streptococcus, gbs), depending on surface polysaccharides and surface alpha-like protein genes. materials/methods: antimicrobial property of the strains of l. plantarum c 11, l. sakei dsmz 6333, and l. lactis atcc 11454 producing bacteriocins: jk and ef plantaricins, sakacin and nisin, respectively, against the gbs strains was evaluated. the chosen to the study gbs strains were represented by serotypes ia, ib, ii, iii, v and they had bca, epsilon, rib, alp2 or alp3 alpha-like protein genes. the experiment was conducted by means of suspension culture and the bacteria count was determined using the serial dilution method. results: a great ability of l. plantarum c 11 strain was proven to inhibit the gbs growth. the strain of l. sakei dsmz 6333 did not demonstrate any ability to inhibit the growth of gbs, whereas l. lactis atcc 11454 inhibited the growth of s. agalactiae indicator strains to a minor extent. statistically significant differences were demonstrated between the gbs strains representing various serotypes against the antimicrobial activity of model lab strains. the least sensitive to the activity of bacteriocins were the strains representing serotypes ib and iii, whereas the strains representing serotype ii were the most sensitive. the sensitivity of the gbs strains to the antimicrobial activity of lab was not dependent on alpha-like protein genes. discussion: among the lab standard strains producing bacteriocins, the strongest antimicrobial property was observed in the strain of l. plantarum c 11. because of the generally known and verified strong antagonistic property of the strains of l. plantarum species against indicator bacteria, it is necessary to further pursue the research presented in this paper.
antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
the biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. the objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic lab from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.lab were isolated using mrs and m17 media. the agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (bls) producing lab using lactobacillus sakei and listeria innocua as indicator organisms. out of 138 lab isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of enterococcus faecium, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16s rrna gene sequencing. eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees c and 20 degrees c against l. innocua, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas fluorescens, erwinia carotovora, and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against penicillium expansum, botrytis cinerea and monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. the effect of selected lab strains on l. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.twenty percent of our isolates produced bls inhibiting the growth of l. innocua and/or lact. sakei. organic acids and/or h2o2 produced by lab and not the bls had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of e. coli. ent. faecium, strep. thermophilus and lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and l. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. bacteriocinogenic lab present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
the abi proteins and their involvement in bacteriocin self-immunity.
the abi protein family consists of putative membrane-bound metalloproteases. while they are involved in membrane anchoring of proteins in eukaryotes, little is known about their function in prokaryotes. in some known bacteriocin loci, abi genes have been found downstream of bacteriocin structural genes (e.g., pln locus from lactobacillus plantarum and sag locus from streptococcus pyogenes), where they probably are involved in self-immunity. by modifying the profile hidden markov model used to select abi proteins in the pfam protein family database, we show that this family is larger than presently recognized. using bacteriocin-associated abi genes as a means to search for novel bacteriocins in sequenced genomes, seven new bacteriocin-like loci were identified in gram-positive bacteria. one such locus, from lactobacillus sakei 23k, was selected for further experimental study, and it was confirmed that the bacteriocin-like genes (skkab) exhibited antimicrobial activity when expressed in a heterologous host and that the associated abi gene (skki) conferred immunity against the cognate bacteriocin. similar investigation of the abi gene plni and the abi-like gene plnl from l. plantarum also confirmed their involvement in immunity to their cognate bacteriocins (plnef and plnjk, respectively). interestingly, the immunity genes from these three systems conferred a high degree of cross-immunity against each other's bacteriocins, suggesting the recognition of a common receptor. site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the conserved motifs constituting the putative proteolytic active site of the abi proteins are essential for the immunity function of skki, and to our knowledge, this represents a new concept in self-immunity.
characterization of a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus sakei r1333 isolated  from smoked salmon.
strain r1333, isolated from commercially available smoked salmon, was identified  as lactobacillus sakei based on biochemical tests, sugar fermentation reactions (api 50 chl), pcr with species-specific primers and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. strain r1333 produces a 3811 kda class iia bacteriocin, active against streptococcus caprinus, streptococcus macedonicus, streptococcus spp., l. sakei, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, listeria innocua, listeria ivanovii subsp. ivanovii and listeria monocytogenes. the mode of activity against l. innocua 2030c and l. ivanovii subsp. ivanovii atcc 19119 was bactericidal, resulting in cell lysis and enzyme- and dna-leakage. the highest level of activity (1600 au/ml) was recorded when cells were grown at 30 degrees c in mrs broth (initial ph 6.5). only 800 au/ml was recorded when strain r1333 was grown in mrs without tween 80. lower levels of bacteriocin production were recorded when strain r1333 was grown in mrs at 20 degrees c. peptide r1333 adsorbs at low levels (200 au/ml) to producer cells. purification of bacteriocin r1333 was performed by 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by separation on a seppak c(18) column and reverse-phase hplc on a nucleosil c(18) column with a linear gradient from 0.1% tfa to 90% acetonitryl. a molecular mass of 3811 kda was determined by mass spectrometry. based on mass spectrometry and sequencing of the pcr amplified fragment targeting the sakg gene, l. sakei r1333 is a potential producer of sakacin g. this is the first report of the identification of sakacin g produced by l. sakei isolated from smoked salmon.
lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 increases lactacin b production when it senses live target bacteria.
lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 is a probiotic strain used in dairy products. production of bacteriocin by l. acidophilus la-5 was achieved when it was grown in co-cultures with the yogurt starter species streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. however, bacteriocin induction was not observed when heat-killed cells were used as inducers. this study demonstrates that l. acidophilus la-5 produces lactacin b and that the bacteriocin expression is controlled by an auto-induction mechanism involving the secreted peptide ip_1800. the transcript level of the lactacin b gene cluster expression was investigated in co-cultures between l. acidophilus la-5 and s. thermophilus sty-31 and a remarkable increase of the bacteriocin structural gene (lbab) transcription was observed. however, lbab was transcribed constitutively in uninduced l. acidophilus la-5 cells, but the levels of the secreted bacteriocin were not enough to be detected by the agar diffusion assay. a new method for bacteriocin detection was formulated based on the monitoring on real time of lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei growth in presence of the supernatant and the cell wall extracts of pure and induced l. acidophilus la-5. these results showed that part of lactacin b secreted remains adhered to cell envelope.
isolation of constitutive variants of a subfamily 10 histidine protein kinase (sppk) from lactobacillus using random mutagenesis.
the histidine protein kinase sppk is a peptide pheromone-activated kinase that regulates the production of the bacteriocin sakacin p in lactobacillus sakei. sppk belongs to subfamily 10 of histidine protein kinases (hpks), which regulate important processes in gram-positive bacteria, including virulence, competence and bacteriocin production. to obtain insight into the functional properties of this relatively unknown class of hpks, we have subjected sppk to random mutagenesis by error-prone pcr, followed by selection for mutants displaying a constitutive phenotype. most identified mutations were clustered in a predicted coiled coil-like region, which is an important part of the hpk dimer interface and which includes the autophosphorylated histidine. other mutations were located in the junctions between the dimerization domain and the membrane receptor domain or the catalytic kinase domain. interestingly, two previously identified constitutive variants of comd, an sppk homologue involved in competence regulation in streptococcus pneumoniae, contained single mutations in the same regions.
characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
a novel area of predictive modelling: describing the functionality of beneficial  microorganisms in foods.
predictive microbiology generally focuses on the potential outgrowth of spoilage  bacteria and foodborne pathogens in foods. little attention has been paid to the biokinetics of beneficial foodgrade microorganisms, such as lactic acid bacteria. the latter is commonly used in the food fermentation industry, mainly for the in situ production of the antimicrobial lactic acid to extend the shelf life of the food. furthermore, many strains show additional industrial potential as novel starter cultures since they produce functional metabolites, such as bacteriocins and exopolysaccharides. the production of these functional metabolites has been demonstrated during in vitro experiments, but in many cases these novel starter cultures seem to be less efficient when applied in a food system. a modelling approach may contribute to a better understanding of the tight relation between the food environment and bacterial functionality. primary modelling can be applied to fit the experimental data concerning cell growth, sugar metabolism, and the production of functional metabolites for a given set of environmental conditions. this led to conclusions concerning the growth-associated production of bacteriocin and exopolysaccharides, the inactivation of these molecules when cell growth levels off, and a minimum cell concentration to trigger on bacteriocin production. examples deal with the production of the bacteriocin sakacin k by the natural fermented sausage isolate lactobacillus sakei ctc 494, and the production of heteropolysaccharides by the yoghurt starter culture streptococcus thermophilus ly03. secondary modelling of biokinetic parameters quantifies the production of bacteriocin and exopolysaccharides in function of environmental factors. as an example, the specific bacteriocin production by lb. sakei ctc 494 decreases with increasing sodium chloride concentrations. furthermore, since the assessment of functionality is frequently hampered by the nature of the food system, mathematical modelling techniques may help to predict the functional behaviour of novel lactic acid bacteria starter cultures in a food matrix, and hence quantify in situ production. for example, a model may simulate cell growth and exopolysaccharide production of s. thermophilus ly03 in a milk environment, where direct measurements are difficult to perform.
