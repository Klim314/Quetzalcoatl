TI  == oropharyngeal colonization with neisseria lactamica, other nonpathogenic neisseria species and moraxella catarrhalis among young healthy children in ahvaz, iran.
AB  == background: neisseria lactamica as one of the main commensal in oropharynx during the childhood is related to the induction of a natural immunity against meningococcal meningitis. also moraxella catarrhalis in oropharynx of children is a predisposing factor for otitis media infection. objectives: the current study aimed to investigate the frequency of the n. lactamica, other nonpathogenic neisseria spp. and m. catarrhalis in the oropharynx of young healthy children in  ahvaz, iran by the two phenotypic tests and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: a total of 192 oropharyngeal swab samples of the young healthy children were studied during four months. swabs were plated onto enriched selective media and non-selective media. gram-negative and oxidase-positive diplococci were identified by several conventional biochemical tests. the pcr and sequencing were used to confirm the accuracy of laboratory diagnosis to identify  n. lactamica and m. catarrhalis. results: among 192 young healthy children with the mean age of 5.93 +/- 2.5903 years, authors identified: n. lactamica (21.9%) in the age group of one to nine years; n. mucosa (6.3%); n. sicca (7.8%); n. cinerea (1.6%); n. subflava (biovar subflava) (4.2%); n. subflava (biovar perflava) (28.1%); n. subflava (biovar flava) (7.3%) and m. catarrhalis (42.7%).  conclusions: the young healthy children screening by colonization of n. lactamica and other nonpathogenic neisseria spp. in oropharynx was the first report in ahvaz, iran. the study results demonstrated the high frequency of colonization of m. catarrhalis in the studied young healthy children other than neisseria spp.

TI  == evaluation of the versant ct/gc dna 1.0 assay (kpcr) for the detection of extra-genital chlamydia trachomatis and neisseria gonorrhoeae infections.
AB  == screening for extra-genital chlamydia trachomatis and neisseria gonorrhoeae infections is a crucial component for sexually transmitted diseases management, even if at present days no commercial methods have been approved for use on pharyngeal and rectal specimens by the us fda or have received the conformity ce  marking. here we report the analytical sensitivities of the versant ct/gc 1.0 assay (siemens healthcare diagnostics, tarrytown, ny, usa) on rectal and pharyngeal swabs, and an evaluation about the suitability for this assay with two widely used swab collection devices (e-swab and enat, copan, brescia, italy). the limits of detection for rectal and pharyngeal specimens with the versant assay were 10 copies/ml and 1.0 copies/ml, for c. trachomatis and n. gonorrhoeae, respectively. false positive results due to the presence of non-gonococcal neisseria species were excluded when clinical rectal and pharyngeal samples containing organisms identified as n. meningitidis, n. sicca, n. flavescens and n. subflava were tested. due to its sensitivity and specificity, the versant assay represents a good choice for the diagnosis of chlamydial and/or gonococcal  infections not only in genito-urinary samples, but also on rectal and pharyngeal  swabs.

TI  == polymicrobial endocarditis in intravenous heroin and fentanyl abuse.
AB  == infective endocarditis is a life threatening condition with a high mortality rate. intravenous drug abusers (ivda) are more likely to acquire endocarditis. most of the cases of infective endocarditis are caused by a single pathogen; cases of polymicrobial endocarditis are rare and they are associated with a reported mortality rate of more than 30%. only 21 cases of n. sicca endocarditis  have been described in the literature since 1918, and only 15 reported cases of endocarditis which involved actinomyces species have been reported since 1939. we are reporting a case of a 49-year-old male with intravenous heroin and fentanyl abuse, who presented with infective endocarditis caused by neisseria sicca/subflava(n. sicca), actinomyces, streptococcus mitis, and haemophilus parainfluenzae, complicated by septic emboli to the lungs and skin, ards , splenic infarct and immunocomplex mediated proliferative glomerulonephritis.

TI  == genome sequence analyses show that neisseria oralis is the same species as 'neisseria mucosa var. heidelbergensis'.
AB  == phylogenies generated from whole genome sequence (wgs) data provide definitive means of bacterial isolate characterization for typing and taxonomy. the species  status of strains recently defined with conventional taxonomic approaches as representing neisseria oralis was examined by the analysis of sequences derived from wgs data, specifically: (i) 53 neisseria ribosomal protein subunit (rps) genes (ribosomal multi-locus sequence typing, rmlst); and (ii) 246 neisseria core genes (core genome mlst, cgmlst). these data were compared with phylogenies derived from 16s and 23s rrna gene sequences, demonstrating that the n. oralis strains were monophyletic with strains described previously as representing 'neisseria mucosa var. heidelbergensis' and that this group was of equivalent taxonomic status to other well-described species of the genus neisseria. phylogenetic analyses also indicated that neisseria sicca and neisseria macacae should be considered the same species as neisseria mucosa and that neisseria flavescens should be considered the same species as neisseria subflava. analyses  using rmlst showed that some strains currently defined as belonging to the genus  neisseria were more closely related to species belonging to other genera within the family; however, whole genome analysis of a more comprehensive selection of strains from within the family neisseriaceae would be necessary to confirm this.  we suggest that strains previously identified as representing 'n. mucosa var. heidelbergensis' and deposited in culture collections should be renamed n. oralis. finally, one of the strains of n. oralis was able to ferment lactose, due to the presence of beta-galactosidase and lactose permease genes, a characteristic previously thought to be unique to neisseria lactamica, which therefore cannot be thought of as diagnostic for this species; however, the rmlst and cgmlst analyses confirm that n. oralis is most closely related to n. mucosa.

TI  == [gene detection of neisseria spp. isolated from male patients with genitourinary  tract infections].
AB  == objective: to detect the genes of neisseria spp. isolated from patients with male genitourinary tract infections, and to study the pathogenicity of non-gonococcal  strains of neisseria and the laboratory diagnosis for the infections caused by neisseria spp. methods: using polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing, we amplified and sequenced 4 genes of neisseria spp. isolated from patients with male genitourinary tract infections, including 16s rrna, orfl, cppb and nspa. results: fourteen neisseria strains were identified through analysis of the 16s rrna gene, including 3 n. mucosa strains, 3 n. cinerea strains, 2 n. gonorrhoea strains, 2 n. sicca strains, 2 n. subflava strains, 1 n. lactamica strain, and 1 n. polysaccharea strain. among them, 9 showed positive results in gonococcal fluorescence-labeled multiplex-pcr detection, 1 in cppb gene reaction, 5 in orfl gene reaction, and 3 in nspa gene reaction. the consistency rate was 85.7% between the above results from our gene detection and those from the routine bacteriological methods. conclusion: the cppb gene is absent in the non-gonococcal strains of neisseria spp. that can cause male genitourinary tract  infection. most of the strains not only lack virulence-associated orfl and nspa genes, but also show positive results in gonococcal fluorescence-labeled multiplex-pcr detection, which is one of the important reasons for the misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. the combination of routine bacteriological methods and gene detection in laboratory examinations may help improve the accuracy rates of neisseria species identification and clinical  diagnosis of the infections caused by neisseria spp.

TI  == biochemical and genomic analysis of the denitrification pathway within the genus  neisseria.
AB  == since neisseria gonorrhoeae and neisseria meningitidis are obligate human pathogens, a comparison with commensal species of the same genus could reveal differences important in pathogenesis. the recent completion of commensal neisseria genome draft assemblies allowed us to perform a comparison of the genes involved in the catalysis, assembly and regulation of the denitrification pathway, which has been implicated in the virulence of several bacteria. all species contained a highly conserved nitric oxide reductase (norb) and a nitrite  reductase (ania or nirk) that was highly conserved in the catalytic but divergent in the n-terminal lipid modification and c-terminal glycosylation domains. only neisseria mucosa contained a nitrate reductase (nar), and only neisseria lactamica, neisseria cinerea, neisseria subflava, neisseria flavescens and neisseria sicca contained a nitrous oxide reductase (nos) complex. the regulators of the denitrification genes, fnr, narqp and nsrr, were highly conserved, except  for the gaf domain of narq. biochemical examination of laboratory strains revealed that all of the neisserial species tested except n. mucosa had a two- to fourfold lower nitrite reductase activity than n. gonorrhoeae, while n. meningitidis and most of the commensal neisseria species had a two- to fourfold higher nitric oxide (no) reductase activity. for n. meningitidis and most of the  commensal neisseria, there was a greater than fourfold reduction in the no steady-state level in the presence of nitrite as compared with n. gonorrhoeae. all of the species tested generated an no steady-state level in the presence of an no donor that was similar to that of n. gonorrhoeae. the greatest difference between the neisseria species was the lack of a functional nos system in the pathogenic species n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis.

TI  == distribution of transferrin binding protein b gene (tbpb) variants among neisseria species.
AB  == background: transferrin binding protein b (tbpb), an outer membrane lipoprotein,  is required for the acquisition of iron from human transferrin. two tbpb families have been documented in neisseria meningitidis: an isotype i tbpb gene of 1.8 kb  and an isotype ii tbpb gene of 2.1 kb, the former expressed by meningococci in the disease-associated st-11 clonal complex and the latter found among meningococci belonging to the hyper-invasive clonal complexes including st-8, st-18, st-32, st-41/44 as well as n. gonorrhoeae isolates. the origin of the isotype i tbpb gene is unknown, however several features in common with non-pathogenic neisseria and the st-11 clonal complex n. meningitidis isolate fam18 have been documented leading to the hypothesis that the isotype i tbpb gene may also be shared between non-pathogenic neisseria and st-11 meningococci. as a  result, the diversity of the tbpb gene was investigated in a defined collection of neisseria species. results: two families of isotype i tbpb were identified: family a containing conserved genes belonging to st-11 meningococci, n. polysaccharea and n. lactamica isolates and family b including more diverse isotype i tbpb genes from n. sicca, n. mucosa, n. flava, n. subflava as well as n. cinerea, n. flavescens and n. polysaccharea isolates. three isotype ii tbpb families were identified with: family c containing diverse tbpb genes belonging to n. polysaccharea, n. lactamica, n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis isolates, family d including another subset of isotype ii tbpb genes from n. lactamica isolates and family e solely composed of n. gonorrhoeae tbpb genes. conclusion: this study reveals another instance of similarity between meningococci of the st-11 clonal complex and non-pathogenic neisseria with the origin of the isotype  i tbpb gene resulting from a horizontal genetic transfer event occurring between  these two populations.

TI  == variations in gene organization and dna uptake signal sequence in the folp region between commensal and pathogenic neisseria species.
AB  == background: horizontal gene transfer is an important source of genetic variation  among neisseria species and has contributed to the spread of resistance to penicillin and sulfonamide drugs in the pathogen neisseria meningitidis. sulfonamide resistance in neisseria meningitidis is mediated by altered chromosomal folp genes. at least some folp alleles conferring resistance have been horizontally acquired from other species, presumably from commensal neisseriae. in this work, the dna sequence surrounding folp in commensal neisseria species was determined and compared to corresponding regions in pathogenic neisseriae, in order to elucidate the potential for inter-species dna  transfer within this region. results: the upstream region of folp displayed differences in gene order between species, including an insertion of a complete correia element in neisseria lactamica and an inversion of a larger genomic segment in neisseria sicca, neisseria subflava and neisseria mucosa. the latter species also had dna uptake signal sequences (dus) in this region that were one base different from the dus in pathogenic neisseriae. another interesting finding was evidence of a horizontal transfer event from neisseria lactamica or neisseria cinerea that introduced a novel folp allele to the meningococcal population. conclusion: genetic recombination events immediately upstream of folp and horizontal transfer have resulted in sequence differences in the folp region between the neisseria species. this variability could be a consequence of the selective pressure on this region exerted by the use of sulfonamide drugs.

TI  == analysis of mutations within multiple genes associated with resistance in a clinical isolate of neisseria gonorrhoeae with reduced ceftriaxone susceptibility that shows a multidrug-resistant phenotype.
AB  == a neisseria gonorrhoeae strain with a reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 0.5 microg/ml) was isolated among 398 clinical isolates obtained from 2000-2001 in fukuoka city, japan. the n. gonorrhoeae strain was negative for penicillinase production but it showed multidrug resistance against penicillin (mic = 8 microg/ml), tetracycline (mic =  4 microg/ml), azithromycin (mic = 0.5 microg/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic = 16 microg/ml). the molecular mechanisms of the multidrug-resistant phenotype in this strain were analysed. polymerase chain reaction and direct dna sequencing were performed to identify mutations within the pena, pona, mtrr, penb, gyra and parc  genes of the gonococcal strain, which thus explain the multidrug-resistant phenotype. the n. gonorrhoeae strain contained a significantly different sequence of the pena gene from that of the ceftriaxone-susceptible strains. some regions of the transpeptidase domain within this pena gene were closely similar to those  found in other neisseria species such as neisseria subflava, neisseria flavescens or neisseria perflava/sicca. this strain also included a pona mutation that is associated with high-level resistance to penicillin, mtrr mutations that mediate  overexpression of the mtrcde efflux pump responsible for resistance to hydrophobic agents such as azithromycin, and penb mutations that reduce porin permeability to hydrophilic agents such as tetracycline. moreover, this strain contained gyra and parc mutations that confer high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin. these results indicate the emergence of a n. gonorrhoeae strain with reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone, which also showed a multidrug-resistant phenotype that can be explained by the presence of multiple loci mutations associated with antibiotic resistance.

TI  == neisserial pilin genes display extensive interspecies diversity.
AB  == all neisseria live in association with host cells, however, little is known about the genetic potential of nonpathogenic neisseria species to express attachment factors such as pili. in this study, we demonstrate that type iv pilin-encoding genes are present in a wide range of neisseria species. n. sicca, n. subflava, and n. elongata each contain two putative pile genes arranged in tandem, while single genes were identified in n. polysaccharea, n. mucosa, and n. denitrificans. neisserial pile genes are highly diverse and display features consistent with a history of horizontal gene transfer.

AB  == study design: a case report of neisseria sicca/subflava discitis in a healthy elderly female. objective: to report a rare case, which is usually seen exclusively in children. setting: stoke on trent, england. method: case report, a 65-year-old female with a 6 month history of back and bilateral leg pain. x-rays  showed collapse of l4/5 disc. no neurological deficit. magnetic resonance imaging supported the clinical suspicion of discitis. percutaneous biopsy followed 2 weeks later by open biopsy with bilateral root decompression was performed. culture of l4/5 disc tissue produced neisseria sicca/subflava. the patient was treated with a 4-week course of intravenous amoxycillin. follow-up at 3 months confirmed clinical resolution of original symptoms. conclusion: any organism cultured from biopsy needs to be interpreted within the context of the clinical case. if clinical suspicion is high, further weight must be added to the finding  of unusual or environmental organisms and culture of a repeat aspirate or biopsy  may clarify the significance.

TI  == the integration site of the iga gene in commensal neisseria sp.
AB  == an iga1 protease is produced by the human pathogens neisseria gonorrhoeae and n.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, neisseria species. in  this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the n. gonorrhoeae strain ms11 and compared to corresponding loci in n. meningitidis and commensal neisseria species. in n. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpb and ksga were found immediately downstream of iga. in addition to coml and coma, a homolog of the escherichia coli yfii gene was identified upstream of iga. each gene in the iga region (yfii and coml, coma and iga, and trpb and ksga) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. the coml/ coma and iga/ trpb pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. these terminators contain the common gonococcal dna uptake sequence (dus). a highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in  n. gonorrhoeae was also found in n. meningitidis. in southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal dnas of the commensal species n. mucosa, n. lactamica, n. flavescens, n. cinerea, n. subflava, n. flava, n. sicca or n. elongata. when n. gonorrhoeae coml and trpb were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. this indicated that commensal neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between coma and trpb. the region between coma and trpb was therefore amplified by pcr. the fragment obtained from  n. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal coma and trpb, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology  to any known gonococcal sequence. our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. n. lactamica, which is more closely related to n. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.

TI  == analysis of lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis in the neisseriaceae.
AB  == neisserial lipooligosaccharide (los) contains three oligosaccharide chains, termed the alpha, beta, and gamma chains. we used southern hybridization experiments on dna isolated from various neisseria spp. to determine if strains considered to be nonpathogenic possessed dna sequences homologous with genes involved in the biosynthesis of these oligosaccharide chains. the presence or absence of specific genes was compared to the los profiles expressed by each strain, as characterized by their mobilities on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and their reactivities with various los-specific monoclonal antibodies. a great deal of heterogeneity was seen with respect to the presence of genes encoding glycosyltransferases in neisseria. all pathogenic species were found to possess dna sequences homologous  with the lgt gene cluster, a group of genes needed for the synthesis of the alpha chain. some of these genes were also found to be present in strains considered to be nonpathogenic, such as neisseria lactamica, n. subflava, and n. sicca. some nonpathogenic neisseria spp. were able to express high-molecular-mass los structures, even though they lacked the dna sequences homologous with rfaf, a gene whose product must act before gonococcal and meningococcal los can be elongated. using a pcr amplification strategy, in combination with dna sequencing, we demonstrated that n. subflava 44 possessed lgta, lgtb, and lgte genes. the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by each of these genes suggested that they encoded functional proteins; however, structural analysis of los isolated from this strain indicated that the bulk of its los was not modified by  these gene products. this suggests the existence of an additional regulatory mechanism that is responsible for the limited expression of these genes in this strain.

TI  == neisseria gonorrhoeae : detection and typing by probe hybridization, lcr, and pcr.
AB  == neisseria gonorrhoeae, first described by neisser in 1879, is a gram-negative, nonmotile, nonspore-forming diplococcus, belonging to the family neisseriaceae. it is the etiologic agent of gonorrhea. the other pathogenic species is neisseria meningitidis, to which n. gonorrhoeae is genetically closely related. although n. meningitidis is not usually considered to be a sexually transmitted disease, it may infect the mucous membranes of the anogenital area of homosexual men (1). the other members of the genus, which include neisseria lactamic a, neisseriapolysaccharea, neisseria cinerea, and neisseria flavescens, which are related to neisseria gonorrhoeae, and saccharolytic strains, such as neisseria subflava, neisseria sicca, and neisseria mucosa, which are less genetically related to the aforementioned, are considered to be nonpathogenic, being normal flora of the nasopharyngeal mucous membranes (2).

TI  == identification and characterization of specific sequences encoding pathogenicity  associated proteins in the genome of commensal neisseria species.
AB  == the distribution of distinct sequences in pathogenic and commensal neisseria species was investigated systematically by dot blot analysis. probes representing the genes of rmp, pilin and iga1 protease were found to hybridize exclusively to  the chromosomal dna of the pathogenic species, neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or neisseria meningitidis. in contrast, specific sequences for the genes of the porin protein por and the opacity protein (opa) were also detected in a panel of  commensal neisseria species such as n. lactamica, n. subflava, n. flava, n. mucosa and n. sicca. using opa-specific oligonucleotides as probes in chromosomal blots, the genomes of the commensal neisseria species show a totally reduced repertoire of cross-hybridizing loci compared to the complex opa gene family of n. gonorrhoeae. dna sequence analysis of one opa-related gene derived from n. flava and n. sicca, respectively, revealed a large degree of homology with previously described gonococcal and meningococcal genes, e.g., a typical repetitive sequence in the leader peptide and the distribution of the hypervariable and conserved regions. this observation, together with the finding, that the gene is constitutively transcribed, leads to the assumption that some of the commensal neisseria species may have the potential for the expression of a protein harboring similar functions as the opa proteins in pathogenic neisseriae.

AB  == a numerical phenotypic taxonomic study of 315 strains of neisseria and some allied bacteria examined for 155 phenotypic tests showed 31 groups, most of which were reasonably distinct. these fell into four major areas. areas a, b and c contained species of neisseria, whereas area d contained the organisms known as 'false neisserias' together with branhamella, moraxella and kingella species. area a contained n. gonorrhoeae (which showed two subgroups), n. meningitidis (with two subgroups, and n. cinerea closely associated), n. polysaccharea, n. elongata subsp, glycolytica and n. lactamica. area b contained mainly organisms from the human nasopharynx, and the nine groups were not very distinct: only three, n. mucosa, n. perflava and n. sicca could be recognized by the presence of type strains, and there was little relationship between taxonomic position and species epithets. area c contained several groups from animals, n. animalis, n. canis and two phenons that may be justified as new species of neisseria, one from lizards and the other from dental plaque of herbivores. area c also contained n.  elongata, n. subflava (with n. flavescens), type strain of morococcus cerebrosis  and the cdc groups m-5 (n. weaveri) and ef-4. area d contained branhamella catarrhalis, a combined group which consists of strains of the 'false neisserias' n. caviae and n. cuniculi, the 'false neisseria' n. ovis, and a group of moraxella strains. a small group representing kingella kingae is included in area d. mean test error was 1.7%.

TI  == genetic diversity of the iron-binding protein (fbp) gene of the pathogenic and commensal neisseria.
AB  == the pathogenic neisseria and most commensal neisseria species produce an iron-binding protein (fbp) when grown under iron-limited conditions. in the current study, we confirmed the presence of fbp, as well as dna sequences homologous to the gonococcal fbp, in strains of n. gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis,  n. cinerea, n. lactamica, n. subflava, n. kochii and n. polysaccharea. the fbp genes from these strains were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, digested with stui or rsai, and the restriction patterns examined. the patterns for the gonococcal and meningococcal fbp were virtually identical; however, variations were observed in the fbp sequences of the commensal neisseria species. n. flavescens, n. mucosa, n. sicca, n. ovis and branhamella catarrhalis, did not  produce fbp as detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reactivity with an fbp specific monoclonal antibody, nor did  they hybridize to an fbp-specific dna probe.

TI  == distribution of a protein antigenically related to the major anaerobically induced gonococcal outer membrane protein among other neisseria species.
AB  == the pan 1 protein of neisseria gonorrhoeae is a novel 54-kda outer membrane protein expressed only when gonococci are grown in the absence of oxygen. it is a major antigen recognized by sera from patients with gonococcal infection. we raised mouse monospecific polyclonal antiserum to gel-purified pan 1 from gonococcal strain f62. the antiserum was broadly cross-reactive among gonococcal  strains; all strains tested reacted in immunoblot analysis proportionate to the amount of pan 1 visible in silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gels. in immunoblot experiments, n. lactamica and n. cinerea reacted very strongly to the anti-pan 1 antiserum, whereas n. sicca, n. flava, and n. mucosa did not react at all. the other commensals tested, n. subflava and  n. perflava, exhibited only a minor reaction. these results correlated with the apparent amount of pan 1 seen on sds-polyacrylamide gels of outer membranes. sds-polyacrylamide gel analysis of six meningococcal strains revealed no visible  anaerobically induced outer membrane proteins, and the subsequent immunoblots showed only slight or no reaction to the anti-pan 1 antibody. in the four meningococcal strains that did react slightly with the antiserum, a pan 1-like protein was seen only in anaerobically grown cells. thus, meningococci did not express pan 1 at levels comparable to that found in gonococci; however, when pan  1 was expressed in meningococcal strains, it was oxygen regulated. this is the first example of a protein found in the gonococcal outer membrane that, under identical growth conditions, is not expressed at similar levels in the meningococcus.

TI  == conjugation of plasmids of neisseria gonorrhoeae to other neisseria species: potential reservoirs for the beta-lactamase plasmid.
AB  == the discovery that penicillinase production in neisseria gonorrhoeae was plasmid  mediated and the spread of the beta-lactamase encoding plasmids in gonococcal isolates since 1976, raise the possibility that a nonpathogenic indigenous bacterium could serve as a reservoir for these plasmids. we initiated studies to  define the ability of commensal neisseria species and branhamella catarrhalis strains, as well as strains of the pathogen neisseria meningitidis, to serve as recipients in conjugation with neisseria gonorrhoeae. we found that with n. gonorrhoeae as the donor, 3 of 5 neisseria cinerea, 2 of 5 neisseria flava, 0 of  1 neisseria flavescens, 1 of 3 neisseria subflava, 0 of 6 b. catarrhalis, 0 of 7  neisseria lactamica, 1 of 5 neisseria mucosa, 1 of 7 neisseria perflava/sicca, and 0 of 13 n. meningitidis strains gave detectable conjugation frequencies (greater than 10(-8). n. cinerea was the only species found to maintain the gonococcal conjugal plasmid (ple2451). a n. cinerea transconjugant containing ple2451 was observed to transfer both the beta-lactamase plasmid and ple2451 to n. gonorrhoeae at high frequency.

TI  == diagnostic value of interactions between members of the family neisseriaceae and  lectins.
AB  == the lectin slide agglutination test for neisseria gonorrhoeae has been modified and improved. results show that wheat germ agglutinin and soybean lectin agglutinate 100% (193 of 193 tested) of clinical isolates of n. gonorrhoeae. lectin-reactive meningococci can be readily identified by the hydrolysis of gamma-glutamyl-beta-naphthylamide. branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria lactamica,  neisseria sicca, neisseria subflava, neisseria perflava, and meningococcal serogroups a, b, c, x, y, and z do not interfere with the positive identification of n. gonorrhoeae. the frequently encountered problem of autoagglutination of members of the family neisseriaceae may be circumvented by a short treatment of cellular suspensions with dnase. based on agglutination assays, the enzyme treatment did not result in a loss of wheat germ agglutinin receptors from the bacteria. the lectin agglutination test, coupled with the gamma-glutamyl aminopeptidase assay, is proposed as a rapid and accurate means of identifying clinical isolates of gonococci.

TI  == the significance of nongonococcal, nonmeningococcal neisseria isolates from blood cultures.
AB  == nongonococcal, nonmeningococcal neisseriae are part of the normal respiratory flora and infrequently cause disease. these organisms include neisseria lactamica, neisseria mucosa, neisseria sicca, neisseria flavescens, neisseria subflava , neisseria perflava , neisseria flava , and branhamella catarrhalis (previously classified as neisseria catarrhalis). blood cultures positive for these bacteria have been associated with serious infections, including endocarditis, septicemia, and meningitis. in a retrospective survey of a 10-year  period, 1970-1980, eight patients were identified at hartford hospital (hartford, conn.) whose blood cultures were positive for nongonococcal, nonmeningococcal neisseriae. in four patients, the neisseria blood isolates were associated with serious infections: two with endocarditis, one with sepsis, and one with meningitis. in four other patients, the neisseria blood isolates were contaminants.

TI  == is there a specific stimulus of infectious-allergic bronchial asthma?
AB  == 1. pigmented neisseria species (neisseria perflava, flava, subflava, sicca) are constant inhabitants of patients with infectious asthma. 2. of all the diverse bronchial microflora of patients with infectious-allergic bronchial asthma, the pigmented neisseria species (neisseria perflava, flava, subflava, sicca), staphylococci (staphylococcus aureus, epidermidis), klebsiella (klebsiella pneumoniae) are active sensitizers of the human broncho-pulmonary tract. 3. neisseria strains, possessing similar antigenic determinants to human lung tissues, possess the highest allergenic activity. this raises the question of a new criterion for evaluating the allergenicity of cultures according to their antigenic characteristics. 4. in patients with infectious asthma allergy might develop to some of the structures of microbial cells, in which antigenic determinants, similar to human lung tissues are localized.

TI  == occurence of veillonella and neisseria in the niches of the human oral cavity.
AB  == samples collected from the dental surface, gingival sulcus, dorsum of the tongue  and from the cheek of ten adults (18 to 32 years) were investigated to identify the veillonella and neisseria species present by applying the taxonomic criteria  suggested in the latest edition of bergey's manual. the various niches contain both v. parvula and v. alcalescens, but with the predominance of strains which do not fit precisely the described catalase and putrescine requirements. eighty-nine out of 100 isolated strains of gram negative oxidase positive cocci could be identified as n. sicca and n. subflava; about 11 unidentified strains exhibited characteristics of n. flavescens species.

TI  == neisseria in early stage of dental plaque.
AB  == neisseria in the early stage of dental plaque was studied. two hundred seventeen  strains of neisseria were isolated from the 12-hour plaque of 9 subjects by using lactose-agar. the isolated strains were divided into 6 major groups with biological characteristics. one hundred twenty-one strains (56%) produced glycogen-like polysaccharide from sucrose. they were divided into 3 groups. groups 1 and 2 were identified as n. mucosa and n. sicca, respectively. there were 106 strains of n. sica, being the most predominant of the species. the number of strains not producing polysaccharide was 96 (44%). groups 4 and 5 were  branhamella and n. subflava. the absorption spectra of the ethanol extracts of the pigment in each group were similar and this result supported propriety of the classification by biological characteristics. the adhesiveness of neisseria to the glass plate was examined. approximately one-half of n. sica showed an adhesion capacity.

TI  == selective isolation of neisseria sicca from the human oral cavity on eosin methylene blue agar.
AB  == strains of neisseria sicca and n. mucosa, but not n. perflava, n. subflava, n. flava, or n. flavescens were found to grow on eosin methylene blue agar. the distribution of n. sicca on the tongue dorsum, the gingival crevice area, and the coronal surfaces of teeth of humans was determined using this medium. n. sicca averaged about 5% of the total cultivable organisms of the tongues of 14 subjects examined, but it was present in only trace quantities in dental plaque on the coronal surfaces of teeth or in the gingival crevice area.

TI  == [isolation and identification of neisseria in bronchial asthma].
AB  == a study was made of 29 strains of neisseria isolated from the mucosa of the pharynx and the bronchi of patients suffering from infectious-allergic bronchial  asthma of different severity. comparison of the strains by 22 tests (including the assessment of the morphological, biochemical and other signs) permitted to establish the species of neisseria with some probability. the species reference was determined in 23 cultures. n. perflava was isolated in 10 cases, n. subflava--in 6, n. flava--in 3 cases and n. sicca--in 4 cases, 2 strains corresponded to apigmentary n. cinerea. the species was not established in 4 cultures. there was found no connection between a definite microbial association  and the species of neisseria and the severity of the disease. pigment species of  neisseria should be tested as diagnostic allergens.

TI  == fatty acid composition of neisseria species as determined by gas chromatography.
AB  == duplicate cultures of 53 strains representing 9 species of neisseria were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography for cellular fatty acids. n. sicca, n. mucosa, n. flava, n. flavescens, n. perflava, n. subflava, and the several serotypes of n. meningitidis examined were found to comprise a fairly homogeneous group on the basis of the percentages of individual fatty acids present. lactose-fermenting neisseria also were in this group. n. catarrhalis, however, contained decanoic acid in addition to the acids occurring in the other species.  moreover, the 18 c-saturated and monoenoic acids together constituted 36% of the  total fatty acid composition for n. catarrhalis, while the comparable mean value  for the other species was less than 13%.

TI  == deoxyribonucleic acid homologies among species of the genus neisseria.
AB  == eleven aerobic species of neisseria, a mima sp., and a herellea sp. were tested for deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) homology in direct hybridization experiments. dna labeled with either (14)c or (32)p was prepared from five species of neisseria. unlabeled dna from the various microorganisms was immobilized on membrane filters, which, after pretreatment, were incubated with labeled dna (4,000 counts per min per filter) for 14 hr at 67 c. the measure of relatedness was expressed as the relative percentage of direct binding compared to that obtained with homologous dna. all serological types of n. meningitidis, including the newly proposed types, were homologous to the standard strain of n. meningitidis with one possible exception, type z. the genus neisseria is heterogeneous in nature, forming at least three distinct groups: first, n. meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae; second, n. perflava, n. subflava, n. sicca, n. flavescens, and n. flava; third, n. catarrhalis and n. caviae. mima and herellea species show no significant homology with the neisseria.
