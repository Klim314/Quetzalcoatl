TI  - Microflora associated with successful and failed orthodontic mini-implants.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mini-implants are used for orthodontic bone anchorage. The reasons for a potential instability or loss of the mini-implants during treatment are multiple. Among other factors, colonization of implants with pathogenic bacteria is discussed. Therefore, the microflora associated with successful and failed mini-implants has been screened. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 76 mini-implants collected from 25 patients were observed during regular orthodontic treatment. Bacterial samples of eight failed and - exemplarily - four successful (control) cases were subjected to a universal Bacteria-directed real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction for quantification in combination with a microarray-based identification of 20 selected species. RESULTS: The failure rate in the present investigation was 10.5%. The bacterial analysis did not reveal any major difference in the total amount or species composition between control and failed mini-implants. However, Actinomyces viscosus was found in four (100%) and Campylobacter gracilis in three (75%) stable controls, whereas both species were rarely found (12.5%) in failed implants. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the peri-implant sulcus surrounding failed orthodontic mini-implants did not show a specific aggressive bacterial flora.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to compare the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. The study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. Thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. Smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (PD >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared to non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. Samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. The samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. Smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. Analysis of bacterial counts using the ANOVA (Mann-Whitney U-test) showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter concisus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, C. gracilis, C. rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while Streptococcus intermedius, A. naeslundii, A. israelii and Eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as E. coli, C. albicans, A. fumigatus and S. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - Subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that of non-smokers. The study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. The differences in bacterial counts using the Mann Whitney U test were statistically significant for Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, Bacteroides gracilis, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena and Candida albicans in smokers. Statistically significant differences for Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces naeslundii, Eubacterium lentum and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like E. coli, C. albicans and S. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - The development of an altered gingival crevicular microflora in the alloxan-diabetic rat.
AB  - The microflora of the rat gingival crevice were examined at various time intervals after inducing experimental diabetes. A variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative cocci and short rods were isolated from the normal rat crevice. Within a week after alloxan administration, Leptotrichia buccalis was detected for the first time. Other features in the diabetic animals included an increased frequency of isolation of Proteus spp., Lactobacillus spp. and decrease of Escherichia coli. Occasionally, a decrease was also observed in Bacteroides spp. and Streptococcus spp. No difference was observed between diabetic and non-diabetic animals in the isolation of Selonomonas, Campylobacter, Bifidobacterium and Actinomyces. Plaque accumulation was markedly increased in the diabetic rats. It was concluded that the change in gingival microflora resulted from diabetes-induced alterations in the sulcular environment (such as increased substrate levels, e.g. glucose and urea, and decreased oxygen) and that the microbiological changes preceded the depending of the periodontal pocket.
