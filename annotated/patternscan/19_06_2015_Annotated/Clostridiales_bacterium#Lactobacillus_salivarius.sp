TI  == effects of lactobacillus salivarius ren on cancer prevention and intestinal microbiota in 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced rat model.
AB  == probiotics have been suggested as a prophylactic measure in colon cancer. the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of lactobacillus salivarius ren (ren) in modulating colonic microbiota structure and colon cancer incidence in a rat model after injection with 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine (dmh). the results indicated that oral administration of ren could effectively suppress dmh-induced colonic carcinogenesis. a significant decrease in cancer incidence (87.5% to 25%) was detected in rats fed with a dose of 5 x 1010 cfu/kg bodyweight per day. using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time pcr combined with multivariate statistical methods, we demonstrated that injection with dmh significantly altered the rat gut microbiota, while ren counteracted these dmh-induced adverse effects and promoted reversion of the gut microbiota close to the healthy state. tvalue biplots followed by band sequencing identified 21 bacterial strains as critical variables affected by dmh and ren. injection of dmh significantly increased the amount of ruminococcus species (sp.) and clostridiales bacteria, as well as decreasing the prevotella sp. administration of ren reduced the amount of ruminococcus sp., clostridiales bacteria, and bacteroides dorei, and increased the amount of prevotella. real-time pcr results  were consistent with the results derived by t-value biplots. these findings suggested that ren is a potential agent for colon cancer prevention. in conclusion, the results in the present study suggest a potential therapeutic approach based on the modulation of intestinal microflora by probiotics may be beneficial in the prevention of colorectal carcinogenesis.

TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.
