TI  == the cultivable human oral gluten-degrading microbiome and its potential implications in coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.
AB  == coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the western diet. mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. we found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin  degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide.  for selected strains ph activity profiles were determined. the culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: rothia mucilaginosa hot-681, rothia aeria hot-188, actinomyces odontolyticus hot-701, streptococcus mitis hot-677, streptococcus sp. hot-071, neisseria mucosa hot-682 and capnocytophaga sputigena  hot-775, with rothia species being active in all four assays. cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. the approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kd (rothia spp.), ~60 kd (a. odontolyticus) and ~150 kd (streptococcus spp.). in conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. a cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.

TI  == microbiological characterization in children with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize the subgingival microbiota of african-american children with localized aggressive periodontitis (lap). fifty-one children were included. subgingival plaque samples were taken from diseased (dd) and healthy sites (dh) in lap and from healthy sites in hs and hc and analyzed by 16s rrna-based microarrays. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) was the only species found to be both more prevalent (or = 8.3, p = 0.0025)  and abundant (p < 0.01) in dd. filifactor alocis (fa) was also found to be more prevalent in dd (or 2.31, ci 1.06-5.01, p = 0.03). most prevalent species in healthy sites were selenomonas spp, veillonella spp, streptococcus spp, bergeyella sp, and kingella oralis. overall, streptococcus spp, campylobacter gracilis, capnocytophaga granulosa, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and lautropia mirabilis were most abundant in healthy children, while aa, fa, tannerella sp, solobacterium moorei, parvimonas micra, and capnocytophaga sp were most abundant  in lap. based on a comprehensive analysis with 16s rrna-based microarrays, aa was strongly associated and site-specific in lap. in contrast, other species were found to be associated with healthy sites and individuals (clinicaltrials.gov number ct01330719). abbreviations: healthy site in healthy sibling (hs); healthy  site in healthy control child (hc).

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface: culture and dna checkerboard hybridization analyses.
AB  == objective: bacterial species have been found harboring the internal surface of dental implants as consequence of their failed connections. the aim of the present study was to compare the detection frequency of bacterial leakage from human saliva through the implant-abutment interface, under non-loading conditions, using either dna checkerboard or culture method. materials and methods: thirty dental implants with hexagonal platforms were connected to pre-machined abutments according to the manufacturers' specifications. the assemblies were individually incubated in human saliva under anaerobic conditions for 7 days at 37 degrees c. afterward, contents from the inner parts of the implants were collected and evaluated with either dna checkerboard (s = 15) or culture (n = 15). subsequently, identification and quantitation of bacterial species from saliva and implants were carried out for the group evaluated with the dna checkerboard method. results: both dna checkerboard and culture showed positive signals of bacterial leakage in 6 of the 15 evaluated samples. capnocytophaga gingivalis and streptococcus mutans were the most frequently detected species harboring the internal surface of the implants followed by veillonella parvula. conclusion: occurrence of bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface is comparably detected with both dna checkerboard hybridization and conventional culture methods.

TI  == clonal analysis of the microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  == background/aims: severe early childhood caries is a microbial infection that severely compromises the dentition of young children. the aim of this study was to characterize the microbiota of severe early childhood caries. methods: dental  plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing, and by specific pcr amplification for streptococcus mutans and bifidobacteriaceae species. results: children with severe caries (n =  39) had more dental plaque and gingival inflammation than caries-free children (n = 41). analysis of phylotypes from operational taxonomic unit analysis of 16s rrna clonal metalibraries from severe caries and caries-free children indicated that while libraries differed significantly (p < 0.0001), there was increased diversity than detected in this clonal analysis. using the human oral microbiome  database, 139 different taxa were identified. within the limits of this study, caries-associated taxa included granulicatella elegans (p < 0.01) and veillonella sp. hot-780 (p < 0.01). the species associated with caries-free children included capnocytophaga gingivalis (p < 0.01), abiotrophia defectiva (p < 0.01), lachnospiraceae sp. hot-100 (p < 0.05), streptococcus sanguinis (p < 0.05) and streptococcus cristatus (p < 0.05). by specific pcr, s. mutans (p < 0.005) and bifidobacteriaceae spp. (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with severe caries. conclusion: clonal analysis of 80 children identified a diverse microbiota that differed between severe caries and caries-free children, but the  association of s. mutans with caries was from specific pcr analysis, not from clonal analysis, of samples.

TI  == bacterial 16s sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  == previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also  suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. in addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in ph homeostasis. the bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16s rrna genes. lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions.  s. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated  with caries progression in the overall model. lactobacillus or s. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of selenomonas, neisseria, and streptococcus mitis. propionibacterium fma5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. an overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the streptococcus mitis-s. pneumoniae-s. infantis group, corynebacterium matruchotii, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium ir009,  campylobacter rectus, and lachnospiraceae sp. c1. the relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16s rrna gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and  metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  == the subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. we tested the hypothesis that  the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16s sequencing. smokers demonstrated greater abundance of parvimonas, fusobacterium, campylobacter, bacteroides, and treponema and lower levels of veillonella, neisseria, and streptococcus. several uncultivated peptostreptococci, parvimonas micra, campylobacter gracilis, treponema socranskii, dialister pneumosintes, and tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while veillonella sp. oral clone b2, neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, streptococcus sanguinis, and capnocytophaga sp. clone ah015 were at lower levels. the microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. ii. microbiological results.
AB  == background: peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. we performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. materials and methods: an expanded checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in  17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. statistics included non-parametric tests and glm multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. results: at selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: fusobacterium nucleatum sp., staphylococci sp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, helicobacter pylori, and tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, and veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). no such  differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. no microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. conclusions: both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. no group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == microbiological findings in subjects with asymptomatic oral lichen planus: a cross-sectional comparative study.
AB  == background: the bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (olp) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. methods: bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed olp from the stomatology service, department of oral surgery and stomatology, school of dental medicine, university of bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. samples were taken from olp lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. the control population did not have olp and  was recruited from the student clinic. all samples were processed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. results: significantly higher bacterial counts of bacteroides ureolyticus (p = 0.001), dialister species (sp.) (p = 0.006), staphylococcus haemolyticus (p = 0.007), and streptococcus agalactiae (p = 0.006) were found in  samples taken from olp lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of olp. significantly higher bacterial counts were found for capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus crispatus, mobiluncus curtisii, neisseria mucosa, prevotella bivia, prevotella intermedia, and s. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with olp compared to sites in control subjects (p  <0.001). conclusions: microbiologic differences were found between sites with olp and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of olp. specifically, higher counts of  staphylococci and s. agalactiae were found in olp lesions.

TI  == comparative analysis of endodontic pathogens using checkerboard hybridization in  relation to culture.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of this study was to detect bacterial species and to  quantify the total number of bacteria from samples of infected root canals before (s1) and after chemo-mechanical preparation using 2% chlorhexidine (chx) gel as auxiliary chemical substance (s2) and after 7 days of intracanal dressing (s3) to compare microbial changes. method: twenty-four teeth were selected for this study. chemo-mechanical preparation was performed using 2% chx gel, then three different intracanal medicaments [m1: ca(oh)(2) paste; m2: 2% chx gel; and m3: ca(oh)(2) paste plus 2% chx gel] were used for 7 days. checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was performed to detect 40 bacterial species. aerobic and anaerobic culture techniques were used to determine the bacterial community by counting the colony-forming units (cfu). results: the species most frequently identified by checkerboard in s1 were: fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, treponema socranskii ssp. socranskii, parvimonas micra and enterococcus faecalis. in s2 and s3 a total of eight different species were identified; and only one of them was gram-positive (e. faecalis). microorganisms were not identified after use of m2 for 7 days. the quantification obtained on agar plates ranged from 4 x 10(5) to 2.6 x 10(6) cfu/ml in s1, mean cfu was reduced by 99.96% in s2, and there was no  statistical difference between the cfu in s2 and s3. conclusion: the antibacterial effect of the mechanical preparation supplemented by the use of an  antibacterial auxiliary substance greatly reduced the microorganisms in the main  root canal.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  == aim: to examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. methodology: samples were collected by means of a size 15 h-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: the species found at the highest levels and prevalence were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, porphyromonas gingivalis,  veillonella parvula, enterococcus faecalis, campylobacter gracilis and neisseria  mucosa. total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: p > 0.05). e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus, capnocytophaga sputigena and capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (mann-whitney test, p < 0.05). higher levels of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. leptotrichia buccalis (or = 1.83; ci 95%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (or = 2.15; ci 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. conclusions: primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species.  specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.

TI  == bacterial species in subgingival plaque and oral bone loss in postmenopausal women.
AB  == background: oral bacteria are widely recognized in the etiology of periodontal disease. we investigated the prevalence of subgingival bacterial infection with eight species, tested associations between infection and oral bone loss, and assessed potential confounding factors and effect modifiers of those associations in a large community-based cohort of postmenopausal women. methods: a cross-sectional study of oral health and osteoporosis in 1,256 postmenopausal women recruited from the buffalo, new york women's health initiative observational study was conducted. standardized dental radiographs were used to measure alveolar crestal height (ach). subgingival plaque samples were taken, and the presence of eight bacterial species was assessed by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy in each participant. results: the most prevalent infection was streptococcus sanguis (59.5%), followed by prevotella intermedia (43.4%), tannerella forsythensis (37.9%), capnocytophaga sp. (36.9%), eubacterium saburreum (32.7%), campylobacter rectus (17.4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (15.1%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (14.2%). infections with p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, p. intermedia, and c. rectus were associated with an increased likelihood of having oral bone loss as measured by ach, even after adjustment for age, smoking, and income. the body mass index (bmi) was a modifier of this association. overweight women with t. forsythensis infection were more likely to  have oral bone loss (or = 3.37; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 2.08 to 5.46) than  normal weight (or = 1.27; 95% ci: 0.82 to 1.98) or obese (or = 1.26, 95% ci: 0.72 to 2.20) women with t. forsythensis infection. conclusions: the prevalence of specific bacterial infections was determined for a large group of postmenopausal  women. those with infection were more likely to have oral bone loss. further studies should investigate potential modifying effects of bmi and/or inflammatory factors.

TI  == microbiologic and radiographic analysis of ligature-induced peri-implantitis with different dental implant surfaces.
AB  == purpose: the goal of this study was to evaluate microbiota and radiographic peri-implant bone loss associated with ligature-induced peri-implantitis. materials and methods: thirty-six dental implants with 4 different surfaces (9 commercially pure titanium, 9 titanium plasma-sprayed, 9 hydroxyapatite, and 9 acid-etched) were placed in the edentulous mandibles of 6 dogs. after 3 months with optimal plaque control, abutment connection was performed. on days 0, 20, 40, and 60 after placement of cotton ligatures, both microbiologic samples and periapical radiographs were obtained. the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, campylobacter spp, capnocytophaga spp, fusobacterium spp,  beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and candida spp were evaluated culturally. results: p intermedia/nigrescens was detected in 13.89% of implants at baseline and 100% of implants at other periods. p gingivalis was not detected at baseline, but after 20 and 40 days it was detected in 33.34% of implants and at 60 days it was  detected in 29.03% of dental implants. fusobacterium spp was detected in all periods. streptococci were detected in 16.67% of implants at baseline and in 83.34%, 72.22%, and 77.42% of implants at 20, 40, and 60 days, respectively. campylobacter spp and candida spp were detected in low proportions. the total viable count analysis showed no significant differences among surfaces (p = .831), although a significant difference was observed after ligature placement (p < .0014). however, there was no significant qualitative difference, in spite of the difference among the periods. the peri-implant bone loss was not significantly different between all the dental implant surfaces (p = .908). discussion and conclusions: these data suggest that with ligature-induced peri-implantitis, both time and periodontal pathogens affect all surfaces equally after 60 days.

TI  == prevalent bacterial species and novel phylotypes in advanced noma lesions.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in advanced noma lesions using culture-independent molecular methods. 16s ribosomal dna bacterial genes from dna isolated from advanced noma lesions of four nigerian children were pcr amplified with universally conserved primers and spirochetal selective primers and cloned into escherichia coli. partial 16s rrna sequences of approximately 500 bases from 212 cloned inserts were used initially to determine  species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species or phylotypes. nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for most of the potentially novel species. a total of 67 bacterial  species or phylotypes were detected, 25 of which have not yet been grown in vitro. nineteen of the species or phylotypes, including propionibacterium acnes,  staphylococcus spp., and the opportunistic pathogens stenotrophomonas maltophilia and ochrobactrum anthropi were detected in more than one subject. other known species that were detected included achromobacter spp., afipia spp., brevundimonas diminuta, capnocytophaga spp., cardiobacterium sp., eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium spp., gemella haemoylsans, and neisseria spp. phylotypes that were unique to noma infections included those in the genera eubacterium, flavobacterium, kocuria, microbacterium, and porphyromonas and the related streptococcus salivarius and genera sphingomonas and treponema: since advanced noma lesions are infections open to the environment, it was not surprising to detect species not commonly associated with the oral cavity, e.g., from soil. several species previously implicated as putative pathogens of noma, such as spirochetes and fusobacterium spp., were detected in at least one subject. however, due to the limited number of available noma subjects, it was not possible at this time to associate specific species with the disease.

TI  == skin microflora and bacterial infections of the skin.
AB  == the skin is a milieu for controlled bacterial growth. skin supports the growth of commensal bacteria, which protect the host from pathogenic bacteria. environmental and local factors, host immunity, and organism adherence and virulence are intricately related to cutaneous infection. resident gram-positive  bacteria include staphylococcus, micrococcus, and corynebacterium sp. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes are notoriously pathogenic in the skin. in order for bacteria to be pathogenic, they must be able to adhere to, grow on, and invade the host. bacteria possess numerous virulence genes that allow for growth in these privileged niches. epidermal infections caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes include impetigo and ecthyma. dermal infections consist of erysipelas, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. the pilosebaceous unit is involved in folliculitis, furunculosis, and carbunculosis. moreover, s. aureus and s. pyogenes produce toxins that may elicit a superantigen response, causing massive release of cytokines. staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and scarlet fever are all superantigen-mediated. gram-negative organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, pasteurella multocida, capnocytophaga canimorsus, bartonella sp., klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, and vibrio vulnificus are not typical resident skin microflora but may cause cutaneous infection.

AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

TI  == growth differences of capnocytophaga canimorsus strains and some other fastidious organisms on various columbia-based blood agar media.
AB  == three human isolates of capnocytophaga canimorsus from blood cultures showed no growth when cultivated on sheep blood agar plates based on bbl columbia agar base, whereas the same three strains grew excellently on sheep blood agar plates  based on difco columbia agar bases no. 2 or eh. two of the three strains also grew well on blood agar plates based on biomerieux columbia agar. strains that grew better on either difco or biomerieux columbia based blood agar plates were found among eikenella corrodens, haemophilus aphrophilus, kingella kingae, lactobacillus sp., and streptococcus adjacens, but these strains were never lost  when cultivated on bbl columbia agar plates. one strain of lactobacillus failed to grow on difco columbia no. 2 agar and showed best growth on biomerieux columbia agar. strains of corynebacterium g 2, corynebacterium afermentans and streptococcus adjacens showed poor growth on chocolate agar when compared to blood agar media. microbiologists should be aware of the importance of media formulations for optimal recovery of fastidious organisms.

TI  == microbial keratitis in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  == background: posterior segment complications of systemic infection with the human  immunodeficiency virus (hiv) are well recognized. the anterior segment complications often are, however, overlooked. the author treated 20 episodes of nonherpetic infectious keratitis in 17 eyes of 13 patients infected with hiv who  presented between august 1990 and may 1994. methods: review of records. results:  nine patients were women, and four were men. mean age was 35.2 years. the keratitis was bilateral in four patients, polymicrobial in four, and recurrent in two. the most common infecting organism was candida albicans (5 eyes), a rare cause of keratitis in immunocompetent individuals. other organisms included staphylococcus aureus in four eyes, staphylococcus epidermidis in four, bacillus  sp in two, and one each pseudomonas aeruginosa, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, micrococcus sp, and capnocytophaga sp. seven eyes retained 20/30 or better visual acuity after treatment, eight had visual acuity of 20/50 or worse, and two were eviscerated. classic predisposing factors for infectious keratitis were found in  only two patients and included contact lens wear and atopy in one patient each. twelve patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse. conclusion: infectious keratitis should be recognized as a complication of systemic hiv infection, especially in the context of drug abuse. the prognosis for recovery of vision in  these patients often is poor.

TI  == dog-associated bacterial infections in humans: isolates submitted to an australian reference laboratory, 1981-1992.
AB  == over the period 1981-92, 32 bacterial isolates were referred to the microbiological diagnostic unit from infected dog-bite wounds and 10 isolates were submitted from blood cultures after dog bites or close contact with dogs. the isolates from the bite wounds were identified, or confirmed, as pasteurella multocida (11 isolates), pasteurella dagmatis (3), cdc group m-5 (9), cdc group ef-4a (8) and streptococcus anginosus (1). five of the 9 patients from whom cdc group m-5 was cultured had mixed infections: 2 with p. multocida one of which also had bacteroides sp., one with p. dagmatis, one with cdc group ef-4a and another with bacteroides sp. nine of the 10 blood isolates were identified as capnocytophaga canimorsus. the remaining one of streptobacillus moniliformis, which is typically associated with rat-bite fever, was the result of a bite from  a breed of dog (greyhound) that eats rodents. clinical notes are provided for infections caused by the more unusual bacterial isolates and their laboratory identification is described.

TI  == sub-gingival microflora in macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey.
AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), capnocytophaga sp. (30%), eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == subgingival temperature (iii). relation to microbial counts.
AB  == the present investigation examined the relationship of selected bacterial species and subgingival temperature. 35 subjects were measured at 6 sites per tooth for clinical parameters and subgingival temperature. measurements were repeated for 21 subjects at 2 month intervals providing a total of 66 subjects visits. at each visit, subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non-selective media. after anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species  detected using digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes. species enumerated were; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes a and b, b. forsythus, b. gingivalis, b. intermedius i and ii, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, p.  micros, s. intermedius, s. sanguis i and ii, v. parvula and w. recta. total viable counts and counts of capnocytophaga sp. were determined directly from the  primary isolation plates. a total of 1581 samples were evaluated. subject visits  with higher mean subgingival temperatures had significantly higher mean %s of b.  intermedius i and p. micros, and lower mean %s of capnocytophaga sp. sites with higher subgingival temperatures had elevated proportions of b. intermedius i and  ii, a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a and b. gingivalis more frequently than sites with lower temperatures, while capnocytophaga sp. were elevated more often  at cooler sites. 43 of the subject visits had follow up attachment level measurements at 2 months. the 1026 microbial samples and the subgingival temperature measurements from these visits were related to longitudinal attachment change.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacteriological study of juvenile periodontitis in china.
AB  == the predominant cultivable bacteria associated with juvenile periodontitis (jp) in china were studied for the first time. subgingival plaque samples were taken on paper points from 23 diseased sites in 15 jp patients and from 7 healthy sites in 7 control subjects. serially diluted plaque samples were plated on nonselective blood agar and on mgb agar, a selective medium for the isolation of  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. fifteen or more isolated colonies from each sample (in sequence without selection) were purified for identification. the results indicated that the microflora in healthy sulci of the 7 control subjects  was significantly different from that in diseased sites of jp patients. the predominant species in healthy sulci were streptococcus spp. and capnocytophaga gingivalis. in jp patients, eubacterium sp. was found in significantly higher frequency and proportion. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any samples. it appears that this species is not associated with juvenile periodontitis in china.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == relationship of subgingival plaque flora to lysosomal and cytoplasmic enzyme activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == examining the relationships among indicators of the acute inflammatory response in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and specific bacterial species in subgingival  plaque may provide indications of which bacterial species or groups of species may be associated with potentially destructive host-derived processes. here we report on the relationship of the subgingival plaque flora to the activity of mammalian forms of the enzymes beta-glucuronidase (beta g), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), and arylsulfatase (as) in gcf from a total of 54 4-6 mm periodontal sites  from 13 periodontitis patients. sites were scored for probing depth (pd) and bleeding on probing, and gcf was collected using filter paper strips inserted into the sulcus for 30 s, eluted in buffer and assayed for enzyme activity. 1 week later, the patients were again evaluated for pd and bleeding, and subgingival plaque was removed with a curette oriented toward the pocket epithelium. plaque samples were examined by darkfield microscopy and cultured anaerobically on selective and non-selective media. various groups of bacteria, including species of black pigmenting bacteroides (bpb), fusobacterium sp., capnocytophaga sp, streptococcus sanguis, and total facultative organisms were enumerated. relationships among the enzymes and bacterial groups expressed as colony-forming unit (cfu) counts or as a % of the total cultivable flora were assessed by spearman correlation analysis. beta g levels were significantly correlated with populations of spirochetes, b. intermedius, b. gingivalis, and total lactose negative bpb's. correlation between beta g and f. nucleatum sp. or  capnocytophaga sp. approached but did not reach statistically significant levels. in contrast, ldh activity showed a significant positive correlation with levels of b. gingivalis and total lactose negative bpb's. as levels were significantly correlated only with b. gingivalis. beta g and ldh showed a significant negative  correlation with levels of coccoid forms. thus, beta g, an acid hydrolase which can serve as a marker for primary granule release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes, was most closely correlated with the micro-organisms found in other studies to be associated with chronic adult periodontitis.

TI  == relationship between oxygen tension and subgingival bacterial flora in untreated  human periodontal pockets.
AB  == the predominance of anaerobic bacteria in subgingival plaque samples suggests that the pocket environment is anaerobic. in the present investigation, a small oxygen tension (po2) electrode was inserted into the base of the pocket and the po2 was recorded. in addition, the plaque in these pockets was examined culturally and microscopically. the oxygen tension at the bottom of 36 pockets (5 to 10 mm in depth) ranged from 5 to 27 mmhg (1 mmhg congruent to 133.3 pa) with a mean value of 13.3 mmhg. moderate pockets (5 and 6 mm) exhibited a mean po2 of 15.7 mmhg, which was significantly higher than the 12.0 mmhg found in the deeper  pockets. the deep pockets had higher percentages of spirochetes and bacteroides intermedius, whereas the moderate pockets had elevated proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus mutans. the sites with oxygen tensions equal to or less than 15 mmhg had significantly higher percentages of spirochetes, whereas the microaerophilic capnocytophaga species were found in pockets with a po2 greater than 15 mmhg. the presence of bleeding in the pocket was associated with  higher proportions of b. intermedius, capnocytophaga sp., and a. naeslundii. these po2 readings of periodontal pockets indicated that there is a spectrum of po2 values which seem to define, in a general way, the microbiological composition of the pocket.
