TI  == beta-phosphoglucomutase contributes to aciduricity in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == streptococcus mutans encounters an array of sugar moieties within the oral cavity due to a varied human diet. one such sugar is beta-d-glucose 1-phosphate (betadg1p), which must be converted to glucose 6-phosphate (g6p) before further metabolism to lactic acid. the conversion of betadg1p to g6p is mediated by beta-phosphoglucomutase, which has not been previously observed in any oral streptococci, but has been extensively characterized and the gene designated pgmb in lactococcus lactis. an orthologue was identified in s. mutans, smu.1747c, and  deletion of the gene resulted in the inability of the deletion strain to convert  betadg1p to g6p, indicating that smu.1747c is a beta-phosphoglucomutase and should be designated pgmb. in this study, we sought to characterize how deletion  of pgmb affected known virulence factors of s. mutans, specifically acid tolerance. the deltapgmb strain showed a decreased ability to survive acid challenge. additionally, the strain lacking beta-phosphoglucomutase had a diminished glycolytic profile compared with the parental strain. deletion of pgmb had a negative impact on the virulence of s. mutans in the galleria mellonella (greater wax worm) animal model. our results indicate that pgmb plays a role at the juncture of carbohydrate metabolism and virulence.

TI  == activated human nasal epithelial cells modulate specific antibody response against bacterial or viral antigens.
AB  == nasal mucosa is an immune responsive organ evidenced by eliciting both specific local secretory iga and systemic igg antibody responses with intra-nasal administration of antigens. nevertheless, the role of nasal epithelial cells in modulating such responses is unclear. human nasal epithelial cells (hnecs) obtained from sinus mucosa of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis were cultured  in vitro and firstly were stimulated by lactococcus lactis bacterium-like particles (blps) in order to examine their role on antibody production. secondly, both antigens of immunodominant protein idg60 from oral streptococcus mutans and  hemagglutinin (ha) from influenza virus were tested to evaluate the specific antibody response. stimulated hnecs by blps exhibited a significant increase in the production of interleukin-6 (il-6), and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (tslp).  conditioned medium of stimulated hnecs has effects on enhancing the proliferation of cd4+ t cells together with interferon-gamma and il-5 production, increasing the costimulatory molecules on dendritic cells and augmenting the production of idg60 specific iga, ha specific igg, iga by human peripheral blood lymphocytes. such production of antigen specific igg and iga is significantly counteracted in  the presence of il-6 and tslp neutralizing antibodies. in conclusion, properly stimulated hnecs may impart immuno-modulatory effects on the antigen-specific antibody response at least through the production of il-6 and tslp.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == the branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase encoded by ilve is involved in acid tolerance in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the ability of streptococcus mutans to produce and tolerate organic acids from carbohydrate metabolism represents a major virulence factor responsible for the formation of carious lesions. pyruvate is a key metabolic intermediate that, when rerouted to other metabolic pathways such as amino acid biosynthesis, results in  the alleviation of acid stress by reducing acid end products and aiding in maintenance of intracellular ph. amino acid biosynthetic genes such as ilvc and ilve were identified as being upregulated in a proteome analysis of streptococcus mutans under acid stress conditions (a. c. len, d. w. harty, and n. a. jacques, microbiology 150:1353-1366, 2004). in lactococcus lactis and staphylococcus carnosus, the ilve gene product is involved with biosynthesis and degradation of  branched-chain amino acids, as well as in the production of branched-chain fatty  acids (b. ganesan and b. c. weimer, appl. environ. microbiol. 70:638-641, 2004; s. m. madsen et al., appl. environ. microbiol. 68:4007-4014, 2002; and m. yvon, s. thirouin, l. rijnen, d. fromentier, and j. c. gripon, appl. environ. microbiol. 63:414-419, 1997). here we constructed and characterized an ilve deletion mutant of s. mutans ua159. growth experiments revealed that the ilve mutant strain has a lag in growth when nutritionally limited for branched-chain amino acids. we further demonstrated that the loss of ilve causes a decrease in acid tolerance. the ilve strain exhibits a defect in f(1)-f(o) atpase activity and has reduced catabolic activity for isoleucine and valine. results from transcriptional studies showed that the ilve promoter is upregulated during growth at low ph. collectively, the results of this investigation show that amino acid metabolism is a component of the acid-adaptive repertoire of s. mutans.

TI  == an in vitro investigation of lactococcus lactis antagonizing cariogenic bacterium streptococcus mutans.
AB  == objectives: the present study tested the antagonism between lactococcus lactis and streptococcus mutans and evaluated the feasibility of the application of l. lactis for the inhibition of s. mutans in the oral cavity. methods: competition assays on plates were employed to determine whether l. lactis antagonises s. mutans under different nutritional conditions, and real-time reverse-transcriptase pcr was used to evaluate the effects of metabolites of s. mutans on the bacteriocin nisin genes in l. lactis. furthermore, the colonisation and effects of l. lactis on the surface of a tooth were examined by scanning electron microscopy. results: l. lactis competitively inhibited s. mutans growth  under nutritional deficiency, and the metabolites of s. mutans, including several exogenous molecular signals, enhanced the expression of genes related to nisin synthesis, nisa, nisb and nisi. additionally, l. lactis effectively colonised the surface of tooth enamel, which showed substantially less decay with l. lactis adhesion compared to s. mutans adhesion. conclusions: these findings suggest avenues of research into a new strategy to reduce major cariogenic s. mutans adhesion on the surfaces of teeth.

TI  == nisin inhibits dental caries-associated microorganism in vitro.
AB  == nisin, produced by lactococcus lactis, is an antibiotic peptide to effectively antagonize a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria, and is widely used as a safe food antimicrobial agent. in the present study, we investigated whether nisin could be used as an effective antibiotic peptide against the nine common cariogenic microorganisms, and its antimicrobial activity could be affected by the ingredients of saliva in oral cavity. in the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericide concentration (mbc) and spot-on-lawn assay, nisin displayed different mic, mbc and antimicrobial activity against the nine tested strains. there was statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin against the different tested bacteria (p<0.05), but no statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin dissolved in pbs and saliva (p>0.05). furthermore, morphology and membranes of streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus fermenti and lactobacillus acidophilus with nisin treatment were observed and showed different degrees of variation by a field emission scanning electron microscope (fe-sem). our findings suggested that nisin has considerable potential for prevention and treatment of dental caries.

TI  == probiotic bacteria affect the composition of salivary pellicle and streptococcal  adhesion in vitro.
AB  == introduction: the use of probiotic bacteria is increasing worldwide and at least  some of them can transiently colonize the oral cavity. several studies have shown that probiotic bacteria, which are often thought of in relation only to intestinal health, can also affect the oral ecology, but the mechanisms for this  are largely unknown. the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro if the probiotic bacteria used in commercial products affect the protein composition of  the salivary pellicle and the adherence of other oral bacteria. methods: salivary pellicle on hydroxyapatite and the adhesion of two oral streptococci, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus gordonii, were used as a model. results: probiotic bacteria that bound to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite reduced the adhesion of s. mutans but the inhibitory effect on the adherence of s. gordonii was weaker. salivary pellicle protein composition was modified by all the strains tested. the modifications in the pellicle affected the adherence of s. mutans but not of s. gordonii. two of the proteins missing from the pellicles made of saliva-treated with the probiotic bacteria were identified as salivary agglutinin gp340 and salivary peroxidase. all bacterial strains bound salivary agglutinin gp340. the ability of the probiotic bacteria to degrade peroxidase was demonstrated with purified bovine lactoperoxidase and two of the probiotic strains. conclusion: this in vitro study showed that probiotic strains used in commercial products may affect the oral ecology by specifically preventing the adherence of other bacteria and by modifying the protein composition of the salivary pellicle.

TI  == short-term relative antibacterial effect of octenidine dihydrochloride on the oral microflora in orthodontically treated patients.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the efficacy of common antiseptic mouth rinses and octenidine dihydrochloride (oct). methods: the antibacterial activities of antiseptics against total and cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus species) in saliva were studied in vitro and in vivo. after unstimulated saliva was collected, one of the mouth rinse solutions was applied for 30seconds. saliva samples were collected 15, 30, 60, and 120min later and evaluated for their bacterial count. results: oct had a significantly greater inhibitory effect on the studied bacteria than 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate (chx) and 7.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine complex (pvp-i) from 15min to 120min following the application (p<0.01). the antiseptic efficacy of 0.2% chx on total  bacteria and lactobacillus species was very similar to the efficacy observed with 7.5% pvp-i mouth solution from 15min up to 120min. streptococcus mutans was completely inhibited by 0.15mg/ml pvp-i, 0.5mg/ml chx, and 0.1mg/ml oct concentrations, while streptococcus salivarius was inhibited by 0.15mg/ml pvp-i,  2mg/ml chx, and 0.8mg/ml oct concentrations. lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis was inhibited with 0.00313mg/ml oct, 30mg/ml pvp-i, and 0.0063mg/ml chx concentrations. conclusions: oct compared favorably with chx and pvp-i in its antibacterial effects, both in vitro and in vivo (p<0.01).

TI  == innate immunity glycoprotein gp-340 variants may modulate human susceptibility to dental caries.
AB  == background: bacterial adhesion is an important determinant of colonization and infection, including dental caries. the salivary scavenger receptor cysteine-rich glycoprotein gp-340, which mediates adhesion of streptococcus mutans (implicated  in caries), harbours three major size variants, designated gp-340 i to iii, each  specific to an individual saliva. here we have examined the association of the gp-340 i to iii polymorphisms with caries experience and adhesion of s. mutans. methods: a case-referent study was performed in 12-year-old swedish children with high (n = 19) or low (n = 19) caries experiences. we measured the gp-340 i to iii saliva phenotypes and correlated those with multiple outcome measures for caries  experience and saliva adhesion of s. mutans using the partial least squares (pls) multivariate projection technique. in addition, we used traditional statistics and 2-year caries increment to verify the established pls associations, and bacterial adhesion to purified gp-340 i to iii proteins to support possible mechanisms. results: all except one subject were typed as gp-340 i to iii (10, 23 and 4, respectively). the gp-340 i phenotype correlated positively with caries experience (vip = 1.37) and saliva adhesion of s. mutans ingbritt (vip = 1.47). the gp-340 ii and iii phenotypes tended to behave in the opposite way. moreover,  the gp-340 i phenotype tended to show an increased 2-year caries increment compared to phenotypes ii/iii. purified gp-340 i protein mediated markedly higher adhesion of s. mutans strains ingbritt and ng8 and lactococcus lactis expressing  agi/ii adhesins (spap or pac) compared to gp-340 ii and iii proteins. in addition, the gp-340 i protein appeared over represented in subjects positive for db, an allelic acidic prp variant associated with caries, and subjects positive for both gp-340 i and db tended to experience more caries than those negative for both proteins. conclusion: gp-340 i behaves as a caries susceptibility protein.

TI  == a lacticin 3147 enriched food ingredient reduces streptococcus mutans isolated from the human oral cavity in saliva.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterise streptococcus mutans from irish saliva samples  and to assess their sensitivity to a food-grade preparation of the lantibiotic, lacticin 3147, produced by lactococcus lactis dpc3147. methods and results: saliva samples collected from children with varying oral health status were screened on mitis salivarius agar for the presence of pathogenic streptococci. following selective plating, 16s rdna sequencing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), 15 distinct strains of strep. mutans were identified. these were grouped according to their relative sensitivity to lacticin 3147 which ranged from 0.78 to 6.25%; relative to a sensitive indicator strain, lactococcus  lactis ssp. lactis hp. inhibition of indicator strep. mutans strains from sensitive, intermediate and tolerant groupings were assessed in microtitre plate  assays with increasing concentrations of lacticin 3147. the concentration of lacticin 3147 required to give 50% growth inhibition correlated with their relative sensitivities (as assayed by well diffusion methodology) and ranged from 1280 to 5120 au ml(-1). concentrated preparations of lacticin 3147 caused a rapid killing of strep. mutans strains in broth. moreover, in human saliva deliberately spiked with strep. mutans, the pathogen was eliminated (initial inoculum of 10(5)) in the presence of 40,000 au ml(-1) of lacticin 3147. furthermore, a food-grade lacticin 3147 spray dried powder ingredient was assessed for the inhibition of strep. mutans in human saliva, spiked with a strain of intermediate sensitivity, resulting in up to a 4-log reduction in counts after 20 min. conclusion: a food grade preparation of lacticin 3147 was effective in the inhibition of oral strep. mutans. significance and impact of the study: the inhibition of oral streptococci by food grade preparations of lacticin 3147 may offer novel opportunities for the development of lacticin 3147 as an anti-cariogenic agent particularly in the area of functional foods for the improvement of oral health.

TI  == copy-like copper inducible repressors are putative 'winged helix' proteins.
AB  == copy of enterococcus hirae is a well characterized copper-responsive repressor involved in copper homeostasis. in the absence of copper, it binds to the promoter. in high copper, the copz copper chaperone donates copper to copy, thereby releasing it from the promoter and allowing transcription of the downstream copper homeostatic genes of the cop operon. we here show that the copy-like repressors from e. hirae, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus mutans  have similar affinities not only for their native promoters, but also for heterologous cop promoters. copz of l. lactis accelerated the release of copy from the promoter, suggesting that copz of l. lactis acts as copper chaperone, similar to copz in e. hirae. the consensus binding motif of the copy-like repressors was shown to be tacaxxtgta. the same binding motif is present in promoters controlled by blai of bacillus licheniformis, meci of staphylococcus aureus and related repressors. blai and meci have known structures and belong to  the family of 'winged helix' proteins. in the n- terminal domain, they share significant sequence similarity with copy of e. hirae. moreover, they bind to the same tacaxxtgta motif. nmr analysis of the n-terminal dna binding domain of copy  of l. lactis showed that it contained the same alpha-helical content like the same regions of blai and meci. these findings suggest that the dna binding domains of copy-like repressors are also of the 'winged helix' type.

TI  == food commensal microbes as a potentially important avenue in transmitting antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  == the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant (art) pathogens is a major threat to  public health. while the surfacing of art food-borne pathogens is alarming, the magnitude of the antibiotic resistance (ar) gene pool in food-borne commensal microbes is yet to be revealed. incidence of art commensals in selected retail food products was examined in this study. the presence of 10(2)-10(7) cfu of art  bacteria per gram of foods in many samples, particularly in ready-to-eat, 'healthy' food items, indicates that the art bacteria are abundant in the food chain. ar-encoding genes were detected in art isolates, and streptococcus thermophilus was found to be a major host for ar genes in cheese microbiota. lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc sp. isolates were also found carrying ar genes. the data indicate that food could be an important avenue for art bacterial evolution and dissemination. ar-encoding plasmids from several food-borne commensals were transmitted to streptococcus mutans via natural gene transformation under laboratory conditions, suggesting the possible transfer of ar genes from food commensals to human residential bacteria via horizontal gene transfer.

TI  == identification of the gene encoding a 38-kilodalton immunogenic and protective antigen of streptococcus suis.
AB  == in our continued effort to search for a streptococcus suis protein(s) that can serve as a vaccine candidate or a diagnostic reagent, we constructed and screened a gene library with a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole-cell protein of s. suis type 2. a clone that reacted with the antibody was identified and characterized. analysis revealed that the gene encoding the protein is localized  within a 2.0-kbp ecori dna fragment. the nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 445 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 46.4 kda. by in vitro protein synthesis and western  blot experiments, the protein exhibited an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 38 kda. at the amino acid level the deduced primary sequence shared homology with sequences of unknown function from streptococcus pneumoniae (89%),  streptococcus mutans (86%), lactococcus lactis (80%), listeria monocytogenes (74%), and clostridium perfringens (64%). except for strains of serotypes 20, 26, 32, and 33, southern hybridization analysis revealed the presence of the gene in  strains of other s. suis serotypes and demonstrated restriction fragment length differences caused by a point mutation in the ecori recognition sequence. we confirmed expression of the 38-kda protein in the hybridization-positive isolates using specific antiserum against the purified protein. the recombinant protein was reactive with serum from pigs experimentally infected with virulent strains of s. suis type 2, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic and may serve as an antigen of diagnostic importance for the detection of most s. suis infections. pigs immunized with the recombinant 38-kda protein mounted antibody responses to  the protein and were completely protected against challenge with a strain of a homologous serotype, the wild-type virulent strain of s. suis type 2, suggesting  that it may be a good candidate for the development of a vaccine that can be used as protection against s. suis infection. analysis of the cellular fractions of the bacterium by western blotting revealed that the protein was present in the surface and cell wall extracts. the functional role of the protein with respect to pathogenesis and whether antibodies against the antigen confer protective immunity against diseases caused by strains of other pathogenic s. suis capsular  types remains to be determined.

TI  == differential binding specificities of oral streptococcal antigen i/ii family adhesins for human or bacterial ligands.
AB  == the antigen i/ii (agi/ii) family polypeptides, ranging from 1310 to 1653 amino acid (aa) residues, are cell wall anchored adhesins expressed by most indigenous  species of oral streptococci. the polypeptides interact with a wide range of host molecules, in particular salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (sag or gp340), and with ligands on other oral bacteria. to determine the receptor recognition properties of six different agi/ii family polypeptides from strains of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus mutans, the genes were cloned and expressed on the surface of the surrogate host lactococcus  lactis. the s. gordonii sspa and sspb polypeptides mediated higher binding levels of l. lactis cells to surface immobilized gp340 than did s. intermedius pas protein, or s. mutans spap or pac proteins. however, the agi/ii proteins were all similar in their abilities to mediate aggregation of lactococci by fluid phase gp340. the spap(i) polypeptide from s. mutans ingbritt, which was c-terminally truncated by approximately 400 aa residues, did not bind gp340. lactococci expressing agi/ii proteins, including spap(i), were aggregated by a synthetic 16  aa residue peptide srcrp2 derived from the aa repeat block sequences within gp340. in coaggregation assays, sspb from s. gordonii was unique in mediating coaggregation with only group a and group e strains of actinomyces naeslundii. all the other agi/ii polypeptides mediated coaggregation with group c and group d strains of a. naeslundii. analysis of chimeric protein constructs revealed that coaggregation specificity was determined by sequences within the n-terminal half  of agi/ii protein. a synthetic peptide (20 aa residues), which defines a putative adhesion epitope within the c-terminal region of polypeptide, inhibited agi/ii-mediated aggregation by gp340 but did not affect coaggregation with a. naeslundii. these results suggest that different mechanisms operate in interactions of agi/ii family polypeptides with native gp340, gp340 srcr domain peptide, and a. naeslundii. specificity of these interactions appears to be determined by discontinuous but interacting regions of the polypeptides, thus providing flexibility in receptor recognition for streptococcal colonization of the human host.

TI  == the putative autolysin regulator lytr in streptococcus mutans plays a role in cell division and is growth-phase regulated.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is the primary odontopathogen present in supragingival plaque and causes the oral disease known as dental caries. colonization of the oral cavity by s. mutans requires the bacteria to adhere to the tooth surface and occurs by both sucrose-dependent and -independent mechanisms. sucrose-independent adhesion of s. mutans in vitro has been shown to involve an orf (orf0317) encoding a homologue (39 %) to lytr, a regulator of autolysin activity in bacillus subtilis. the protein encoded by orf0317, lytr, belongs to the lytr/cpsa/psr protein family. this family has a putative role in cell-wall structural maintenance, possibly through autolysin regulation. autolysins have also been shown to be important in surface adhesion in lactococcus lactis and in  the pathogenic properties of streptococcus pneumoniae. to investigate the role of autolysins in the adhesion and pathogenesis of s. mutans, a lytr mutant was constructed. the mutant grows in long chains, which may indicate a defect in cell division. further experiments with the mutant strain show increased autolytic activity, indicating that lytr attenuates s. mutans autolytic activity, possibly  through regulation of the expression of autolytic enzymes. no defect in cell-to-surface adherence or biofilm growth was seen in the lytr mutant. however, a connection between cell growth phase and transcription of lytr was found.

TI  == genetic analysis of a unique bacteriocin, smb, produced by streptococcus mutans gs5.
AB  == a dipeptide lantibiotic, named smb, in streptococcus mutans gs5 was characterized by molecular genetic approaches. the smb biosynthesis gene locus is encoded by a  9.5-kb region of chromosomal dna and consists of seven genes in the order smbm1,  -t, -f, -m2, -g, -a, -b. this operon is not present in some other strains of s. mutans, including strain ua159. the genes encoding smb were identified as smba and smbb. inactivation of smbm1, smba, or smbb attenuated the inhibition of the growth of the indicator strain rp66, confirming an essential role for these genes in smb expression. mature smb likely consists of the 30-amino-acid smba together  with the 32-amino-acid smbb. smba exhibited similarity with the mature lantibiotic lacticina2 from lactococcus lactis, while smbb was similar to the mersacidin-like peptides from bacillus halodurans and l. lactis. we also demonstrated that smb expression is induced by the competence-stimulating peptide (csp) and that a com box-like sequence is located in the smb promoter region. these results suggest that smb belongs to the class i bacteriocin family, and its expression is dependent on csp-induced quorum sensing.

TI  == effect of acidic ph on expression of surface-associated proteins of streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis, a member of the mitis group of oral streptococci, is implicated in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and is the predominant aciduric non-mutans-group streptococcus in dental plaque. we undertook to identify the most abundant surface-associated proteins of s. oralis and to investigate changes in protein expression when the organism was grown under acidic culture conditions. surface-associated proteins were extracted from cells  grown in batch culture, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption  ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. putative functions were assigned by homology to a translated genomic database of streptococcus pneumoniae. a total of 27 proteins were identified; these included a lipoprotein, a ribosome recycling factor, and the glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enolase. the most abundant protein, phosphocarrier protein hpr, was present as three isoforms. neither lactate dehydrogenase nor pyruvate oxidase, dominant intracellular proteins, were present among the proteins on the gels, demonstrating that proteins in the surface-associated pool did not arise as a result of cell lysis. eleven of the proteins identified were differentially expressed when cells were grown at ph 5.2 versus ph 7.0, and these included superoxide dismutase, a homologue of dipeptidase v from lactococcus lactis, and the protein translation elongation factors g, tu, and ts. this study has extended the range of streptococcal proteins known to be expressed at the cell surface. further investigations are required to ascertain their functions at this extracellular location and determine how their expression is influenced by other environmental conditions.

AB  == the prsa-like gene from lactococcus lactis encoding its single homologue to prsa, an essential protein triggering the folding of secreted proteins in bacillus subtilis, was characterized. this gene, annotated pmpa, encodes a lipoprotein of  309 residues whose expression is increased 7- to 10-fold when the source of nitrogen is limited. a slight increase in the expression of the prsa-like protein (plp) in l. lactis removed the degradation products previously observed with the  staphylococcus hyicus lipase used as a model secreted protein. this shows that pmpa either triggers the folding of the secreted lipase or activates its degradation by the cell surface protease htra. unlike the case for b. subtilis, the inactivation of the gene encoding pmpa reduced only slightly the growth rate  of l. lactis in standard conditions. however, it almost stopped its growth when the lipase was overexpressed in the presence of salt in the medium. like prsa of  b. subtilis and prtm of l. lactis, the l. lactis pmpa protein could thus have a foldase activity that facilitates protein secretion. these proteins belong to the third family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerases (ppiases) for which parvulin is the prototype. almost all plp from gram-positive bacteria contain a domain with the ppiase signature. an exception to this situation was found only in streptococcaceae, the family to which l. lactis belongs. plp from streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis possess this signature, but those of l. lactis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus mutans do not. however, secondary structure predictions suggest that the folding of plp is conserved over the entire length of the proteins, including the unconserved signature region. the activity associated with the expression of pmpa in l. lactis and these genomic data show that either the ppiase motif is not necessary for ppiase activity or, more likely, pmpa foldase activity does not necessarily require ppiase activity.

TI  == coinvasion of dentinal tubules by porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii depends upon binding specificity of streptococcal antigen i/ii adhesin.
AB  == cell wall-anchored polypeptides of the antigen i/ii family are produced by many species of oral streptococci. these proteins mediate adhesion of streptococci to  salivary glycoproteins and to other oral microorganisms and promote binding of cells to collagen type i and invasion of dentinal tubules. since infections of the root canal system have a mixed anaerobic bacterial etiology, we investigated  the hypothesis that coadhesion of anaerobic bacteria with streptococci may facilitate invasive endodontic disease. porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 cells were able to invade dentinal tubules when cocultured with streptococcus gordonii  dl1 (challis) but not when cocultured with streptococcus mutans ng8. an isogenic  noninvasive mutant of s. gordonii, with production of sspa and sspb (antigen i/ii family) polypeptides abrogated, was deficient in binding to collagen and had a 40% reduced ability to support adhesion of p. gingivalis. heterologous expression of the s. mutans spap (antigen i/ii) protein in this mutant restored collagen binding and tubule invasion but not adhesion to p. gingivalis or the ability to promote p. gingivalis coinvasion of dentin. an isogenic afimbrial mutant of p. gingivalis had 50% reduced binding to s. gordonii cells but was unaffected in the ability to coinvade dentinal tubules with s. gordonii wild-type cells. expression of the s. gordonii sspa or sspb polypeptide on the surface of lactococcus lactis  cells endowed these bacteria with the abilities to bind p. gingivalis, penetrate  dentinal tubules, and promote p. gingivalis coinvasion of dentin. the results demonstrate that collagen-binding and p. gingivalis-binding properties of antigen i/ii polypeptides are discrete functions. specificity of antigen i/ii polypeptide recognition accounts for the ability of p. gingivalis to coinvade dentinal tubules with s. gordonii but not with s. mutans. this provides evidence that the  specificity of interbacterial coadhesion may influence directly the etiology of pulpal and periapical diseases.

TI  == a protein-based phylogenetic tree for gram-positive bacteria derived from hrca, a unique heat-shock regulatory gene.
AB  == the dnak operon from bacillus subtilis and other gram-positive bacteria with low  g + c dna content contains additional heat-shock genes, including hrca. the hrca  gene encodes a transcription factor that negatively regulates heat-shock genes and is uniformly present in all gram-positive bacteria studied to date. an hrca homologue is also present in synechocystis species, leptospira interrogans, chlamydia trachomatis, caulobacter crescentus and methanococcus jannaschii, organisms that diverged early on from the common ancestor of all gram-positive bacteria and proteobacteria, according to 16s rrna phylogeny. a partial, protein-based phylogenetic tree, derived using amino acid sequence homology of hrca proteins from gram-positive bacteria, is presented here, and the results are compared with the phylogenetic trees generated from 16s rrna, dnak and dnaj sequences. the location of the hrca gene and the genome organization of the dnak  operon support the division of all gram-positive bacteria into three major groups: one group contains high-g + c gram-positive bacteria, and two others contain low-g + c gram-positive bacteria. among the gram-positive bacteria with low g + c dna content, the results indicate that there is a close phylogenetic relationship between bacillus species and clostridium species on the one hand and between lactococcus lactis and streptococcus mutans on the other. streptomyces and mycobacterium species also exhibited a close relationship. a hierarchical arrangement of gram-positive bacteria based on hrca sequences is proposed as an additional refinement of the phylogenetic relationships within this important bacterial group.

AB  == lacticin 3147 is a broad-spectrum bacteriocin produced by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis dpc3147, which has been shown to be active against a range of food-borne bacteria. the reported inhibitory range for lacticin is extended to include methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant pneumococcus, propionibacterium acne  and streptococcus mutans. this extended host range is not obvious from traditional agar plate-based methods, but reductions in bacterial cell numbers by up to 6 log10 cfu ml-1 was observed after 2 h in time-kill curve studies conducted in broth, suggesting that the bacteriocin may have potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of human infections.

TI  == cofactor engineering: a novel approach to metabolic engineering in lactococcus lactis by controlled expression of nadh oxidase.
AB  == nadh oxidase-overproducing lactococcus lactis strains were constructed by cloning the streptococcus mutans nox-2 gene, which encodes the h2o-forming nadh oxidase,  on the plasmid vector pnz8020 under the control of the l. lactis nisa promoter. this engineered system allowed a nisin-controlled 150-fold overproduction of nadh oxidase at ph 7.0, resulting in decreased nadh/nad ratios under aerobic conditions. deliberate variations on nadh oxidase activity provoked a shift from  homolactic to mixed-acid fermentation during aerobic glucose catabolism. the magnitude of this shift was directly dependent on the level of nadh oxidase overproduced. at an initial growth ph of 6.0, smaller amounts of nisin were required to optimize nadh oxidase overproduction, but maximum nadh oxidase activity was twofold lower than that found at ph 7.0. nonetheless at the highest  induction levels, levels of pyruvate flux redistribution were almost identical at both initial ph values. pyruvate was mostly converted to acetoin or diacetyl via  alpha-acetolactate synthase instead of lactate and was not converted to acetate due to flux limitation through pyruvate dehydrogenase. the activity of the overproduced nadh oxidase could be increased with exogenously added flavin adenine dinucleotide. under these conditions, lactate production was completely absent. lactate dehydrogenase remained active under all conditions, indicating that the observed metabolic effects were only due to removal of the reduced cofactor. these results indicate that the observed shift from homolactic to mixed-acid fermentation under aerobic conditions is mainly modulated by the level of nadh oxidation resulting in low nadh/nad+ ratios in the cells.

TI  == sequence analysis of muta and mutm genes involved in the biosynthesis of the lantibiotic mutacin ii in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == streptococcus mutans, along with many other gram-positive bacteria produce small  antibacterial peptides called bacteriocins. bacteriocins elaborated by s. mutans, termed mutacins, may provide a selective force necessary for initial or sustained colonization in dental plaque by this major dental pathogen. previously, we purified and characterized mutacin ii, the first lantibiotic found in s. mutans.  specific oligonucleotides designed according to the n-terminal amino acid sequence permitted amplification of 0.7 kb upstream and 2.1 kb downstream of the  n-terminus, using single-specific-primer pcr (ssp-pcr). the gene encoding the mutacin ii prepeptide, muta, was subsequently cloned and sequenced. the complete  prepeptide consists of 53 amino acids, including the 26 amino acid amphipathic leader peptide with the gly(-2)-gly(-1) sequence at the processing site. the prepeptide showed similarity to the lantibiotics lacticin 481, variacin, salivaricin and streptococcin a-ff22. a 3 kb open reading frame immediately downstream of muta, denoted mutm, showed sequence similarities to lcndr2 from lactococcus lactis. by analogy, mutm is probably involved in post-translational modification of the mutacin prepeptide. gene disruption with an insertional vector pva891 showed that intact copies of muta and mutm are required for production of mutacin ii.

TI  == the lac operon of lactobacillus casei contains lact, a gene coding for a protein  of the bg1g family of transcriptional antiterminators.
AB  == the 5' region of the lac operon of lactobacillus casei has been investigated. an  open reading frame of 293 codons, designated lact, was identified upstream of lace. the gene product encoded by lact is related to the family of transcriptional antiterminator proteins, which includes bglg from escherichia coli, arbg from erwinia chrysanthemi, sact, sacy, and lict from bacillus subtilis, and bglr from lactococcus lactis. amino acid sequence identities range  from 35 to 24%, while similarities range from 56 to 47%. the transcriptional start site of the lac operon was identified upstream of lact. the corresponding mrna would contain in the 5' region a sequence with high similarity to the consensus rna binding site of transcriptional antiterminators overlapping a sequence capable of folding into a structure that resembles a rho-independent terminator. lact was shown to be active as an antiterminator in a b. subtilis test system using the sacb target sequence. lact directly precedes lacegf, the genes coding for enzyme iicb, phospho-beta-galactosidase, and enzyme iia, and these genes are followed by a sequence that appears to encode a second rho-independent transcription terminator-like structure. northern hybridizations  with probes against lact, lace, and lacf revealed transcripts of similar sizes for the lac mrnas of several l. casei strains. since the length of the lac mrna is just sufficient to contain lactegf, we conclude that the lac operon of l. casei does not contain the genes of the accessory tagatose-6-phosphate pathway as occurs in the lac operons of lactococcus lactis, streptococcus mutans, or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == a system to generate chromosomal mutations in lactococcus lactis which allows fast analysis of targeted genes.
AB  == a system for generating chromosomal insertions in lactococci is described. it is  based on the conditional replication of lactococcal pwv01-derived ori+ repa- vector pori19, containing lacz alpha and the multiple cloning site of puc19. chromosomal alui fragments of lactococcus lactis were cloned in pori19 in repa+ helper strain escherichia coli ec101. the frequency of campbell-type recombinants, following introduction of this plasmid bank into l. lactis (repa-), was increased by combining the system with temperature-sensitive pwv01 derivative pve6007. transformation of l. lactis mg1363 (pve6007) with the pori19 bank of lactococcal chromosomal fragments at the permissive temperature allowed replication of several copies of a recombinant plasmid from the bank within a cell because of the provision in trans of repa-ts from pve6007. a temperature shift to 37 degrees c resulted in loss of pve6007 and integration of the pori19 derivatives at high frequencies. a bank of lactococcal mutants was made in this way and successfully screened for the presence of two mutations: one in the monocistronic 1.3-kb peptidoglycan hydrolase gene (acma) and one in the hitherto  uncharacterized maltose fermentation pathway. reintroduction of pve6007 into the  mal- mutant at 30 degrees c resulted in excision of the integrated plasmid and restoration of the ability of ferment maltose. the integration plasmid (pmal) was rescued by using the isolated plasmid content of a restored mal+ colony to transform e. coli ec101. nucleotide sequencing of the 564-bp chromosomal fragment in pmal revealed an internal part of an open reading frame of which the translated product showed significant homology with atp-binding proteins malk of  e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and enterobacter aerogenes and msmk of streptococcus mutans. this combined use of two types of conditional replicating pwv01-derived vectors represents a novel, powerful tool for chromosomal gene inactivation, targeting, cloning, and sequencing of the labelled gene.

TI  == distribution of proteins similar to iiimanh and iiimanl of the streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  == in streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins ei and hpr, the specific membrane-bound iiiman, and two  forms of a protein called iiiman, with molecular weights of 38,900 (iiimanh) and  35,200 (iiimanl), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the  membrane. several lines of evidence suggest that iiimanh and/or iiimanl are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. to determine whether other bacteria  possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. three approaches were used to determine whether the iiiman proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-iiimanh and anti-iiimanh rabbit  polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of pep-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-iiiman antibodies of the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. only the species s. salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of iiiman. fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. in the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of pep. no such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. a iii(man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in lactobacillus casei by western blot experiments as well as by pep-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-iii(man) antibodies was detected in lactococcus lactis. in several cases, the involvement  of these putative iii(man) proteins in the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-iii(man) antibodies. no proteins cross-reacting with anti-iii(man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and e. coli. in s. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. this protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of pep.

AB  == the complete nucleotide sequences of lacrabcdf and partial nucleotide sequence of lace from the lactose operon of streptococcus mutans are presented. comparison of the streptococcal lac determinants with those of staphylococcus aureus and lactococcus lactis indicate exceptional protein and nucleotide identity. the deduced polypeptides also demonstrate significant, but lower, sequence similarity with the corresponding lactose proteins of lactobacillus casei. additionally, lacr has sequence homology with the repressor (deor) of the escherichia coli deoxyribonucleotide operon, while lacc is similar to phosphokinases (fruk and pfkb) from e. coli. the primary translation products of the lacrabcdfe genes are  polypeptides of 251 (m(r) 28,713), 142 (m(r) 15,610), 171 (m(r) 18,950), 310 (m(r) 33,368), 325 (m(r) 36,495), 104 (m(r) 11,401), and 123 (nh2-terminal) amino acids, respectively. as inferred from their direct homology to the staphylococcal lac genes, these determinants would encode the repressor of the streptococcal lactose operon (lacr), galactose-6-phosphate isomerase (laca and lacb), tagatose-6-phosphate kinase (lacc), tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (lacd), and the sugar-specific components enzyme iii-lactose (lacf) and enzyme ii-lactose (lace) of the s. mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system.  the nucleotide sequence encompassing the s. mutans lac promoter appears to contain repeat elements analogous to those of s. aureus, suggesting that repression and catabolite repression of the lactose operons may be similar in these organisms.

TI  == role of the arginine deiminase system in protecting oral bacteria and an enzymatic basis for acid tolerance.
AB  == the arginine deiminase system was found to function in protecting bacterial cells against the damaging effects of acid environments. for example, as little as 2.9  mm arginine added to acidified suspensions of streptococcus sanguis at a ph of 4.0 resulted in ammonia production and protection against killing. the arginine deiminase system was found to have unusual acid tolerance in a variety of lactic  acid bacteria. for example, for streptococcus rattus fa-1, the ph at which arginolysis was reduced to 10% of the maximum was between 2.1 and 2.6, or more than 1 full ph unit below the minimum for glycolysis (ph 3.7), and more than 2 units below the minimum for growth in complex medium (ph 4.7). the acid tolerance of the arginine deiminase system appeared to be primarily molecular and to depend on the tolerance of individual enzymes rather than on the membrane physiology of  the bacteria; ph profiles for the activities of arginine deiminase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, and carbamate kinase in permeabilized cells showed that the enzymes were active at phs of 3.1 or somewhat lower. overall, it appeared that ammonia could be produced from arginine at low ph values, even by cells with damaged membranes, and that the ammonia could then protect the cells against acid damage until the environmental ph value rose sufficiently to allow for the reestablishment of a difference in ph (delta ph) across the cell membrane.

AB  == streptococcus pyogenes, s. equinus, s. bovis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mutans, s. rattus, s. cricetus, s. lactis, s. raffinolactis and enterococcus faecalis have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16s ribosomal rna. all the organisms form a loose but coherent group that is phylogenetically equivalent to those of lactobacilli, bacilli, the brochothrix and listeria group, and related taxa that constitute one of several sublines within the 'clostridium' branch of gram-positive eubacteria. within the steptococcus-enterococcus group, organisms fall into three moderately related clusters defined by enterococcus, the lactic acid streptococci and streptococci of the pyogenic and oral groups, respectively.

TI  == identification of streptococci in a medical laboratory.
AB  == a total of 965 cultures of streptococci received at a reference unit for identification were examined with api-20 strep kits and also by established methods. the api method, although it needed to be supplemented with additional tests, largely overcame the difficulty that pyogenic streptococci are usually identified by their serological reactions and that biochemical tests are used for the identification of the other streptococci. representatives of at least 24 established or possible species were identified.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == the biological aspects of oral pathogenicity.
AB  == the bacteria in the oral region tend to localize in the form of plaque deposits on tooth surfaces and in gingival crevices. the "metabolic nature" of this complex flora focuses on the reversible interactions between the plaque flora and their environmental modifications. the environmental circumstances will influence the range of expression in situ for the plaque (oral) organisms. then, it is suggested that the potential for caries induction or periodontal disease may develop when conditions approaching extremes of environment result in altered metabolism and antigenicity of particular oral organisms.

TI  == selective adsorption of heterophile polyglycerophosphate antigen from antigen extracts of streptococcus mutans and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == hot saline extracts of streptococcus mutans have been shown to contain antigenic  substances which occasionally react nonspecifically with some antisera against whole cells of various serological groups and types of streptococci. chromatography of the extract of s. mutans strain mt703 (serotype e) on a diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 column gave two principal antigens. one antigen was eluted without adsorption to the resin and was identified as the serotype-specific polysaccharide. the other antigen, which contained a large quantity of phosphorus, was absorbed to and released from the resin by gradient elution. it was reactive against the antisera specific for polyglycerophosphate (pgp) from group a streptococcus pyogenes and/or s. mutans strain ingbritt (type  c). the pgp antigen was further purified by gel filtration with sephadex g-75. two peaks, pgp-1, and pgp-2, were obtained. each possessed the same antigenic specificity to anti-pgp serum as shown by immunodiffusion. chemical analyses revealed that the molar ratio of phosphorus to glycerol in both was about 1:1, although the protein content between the two was significantly different. pgp antigen was found to be widely distributed in hot saline extracts from various gram-positive bacteria, with a few exceptions. however, all gram-negative bacteria examined were free of pgp. the pgp in the hot saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria possessed an essentially identical antigenic specificity.  the addition of diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 resin to hot saline extracts successfully removed the cross-reacting pgp antigen. after adsorption of the extract from s. mutans, the supernatant contained only type-specific polysaccharide antigen, except type b, in which both type b-specific polysaccharide and pgp antigens were absorbed with the resin. this simple procedure should be useful for the removal of the pgp-type teichoic acid from antigen extracts of bacteria that contain uncharged polysaccharides.
