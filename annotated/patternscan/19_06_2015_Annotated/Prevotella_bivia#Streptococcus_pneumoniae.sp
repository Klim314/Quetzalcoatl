TI  == human serum activity of telithromycin, azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate against common aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  == telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial with a good in vitro activity against both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity over time of telithromycin (800mg), azithromycin (500mg), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (875/125mg) in serum following  single oral doses of these agents to 10 healthy subjects. inhibitory and bactericidal titers were determined at 2, 6, 12, and 24h after each dose and the  median titer was used to determine antibacterial activity. against two azithromycin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both telithromycin (mic=0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml) and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited inhibitory and cidal activity for at least 6h. all three antibiotics provided prolonged (>or=12h) inhibitory activity against strains of hemophilus influenzae (telithromycin mic=4.0 microg/ml). both telithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited rapid and prolonged inhibitory activity (>or=12h) against each of the anaerobes studied (finegoldia [peptostreptococcus] magna peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella bivia, and prevotella melaninogenica). moreover, both agents provided bactericidal activity against both prevotella species. in this ex vivo pharmacodynamic study, we found that telithromycin provided rapid and prolonged antibacterial activity in serum against macrolide-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of h. influenzae, and common respiratory anaerobic pathogens. these findings suggest that telithromycin could have clinical utility in the treatment of community-acquired mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections, including chronic sinusitis and aspiration pneumonia.

TI  == multilocus enzyme analysis in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria using gel electrophoresis-nitrocellulose blotting.
AB  == an optimized multilocus enzyme electrophoresis method, which involves polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfers  on nitrocellulose sheets, was developed for the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in several aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca, clostridium bifermentans and c. sordellii, and prevotella bivia. serial  electrophoretic transfers (during 5-15 min each) from a single polyacrylamide gel could be achieved for most enzymes studied, and allowed an increased definition of enzyme bands on nitrocellulose as compared to migration gels. four enzymes, which could not be blotted in such conditions, could still be stained in gels after blotting. thus, the method allowed the combined analysis of several enzymes after a single gel electrophoresis separation. the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in the various species studied raised the interest of polymorphic loci such as esterase or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase for epidemiologic studies. the method characterized a genetic diversity of enzyme loci of s. pneumoniae higher than previously reported, and is thus convenient for the analysis of genetic relationships between related isolates. since the present method reduces the tediousness of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and requires  experimental conditions that are not specific for the bacterial population studied, it may be proposed for rapid population genetics analysis of a wide variety of bacteria.

TI  == bacteremia shortly after placental separation during cesarean delivery.
AB  == objective: to assess frequency, risk factors, and microbiology of bacteremia within 15 minutes of placental separation during cesarean delivery. methods: ninety-three women undergoing cesarean delivery after a minimum of 4 hours of labor or ruptured membranes were compared with 26 women not in labor undergoing cesarean. blood cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained within  15 minutes of delivery of the placenta and before prophylactic antibiotic administration. chorioamnionic membranes were also cultured. demographic, labor,  delivery, and postpartum characteristics were abstracted from the medical record. results: bacteremia was detected in 13 (11%) of 119 women. bacteremia occurred in 13 (14%) of 93 women after labor or rupture of membranes compared with zero of 26 women not in labor (p = .02). isolates included group b streptococcus (n = 5), gardnerella vaginalis (n = 5), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1), peptostreptococcus sp (n = 1), and mixed flora of prevotella bivia, g vaginalis,  and viridans streptococci (n = 1). bacteremia was associated with earlier median  gestational age, lower median birth weight, and a positive chorioamnionic membrane culture. after adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine monitoring was also significantly associated with bacteremia. conclusion: bacteremia was common after labor in this population, especially in preterm deliveries and those with positive chorioamnionic-placental culture. many of the isolates are capable  of causing endocarditis. appraisal of the risk of bacteremia and the risk of bacterial endocarditis should be made in individual patients to assess the need for antibiotic prophylaxis.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.
