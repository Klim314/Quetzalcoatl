TI  == phylogenetic evidence for the transfer of eubacterium lentum to the genus eggerthella as eggerthella lenta gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  == eubacterium lentum has unique phenotypic characters within the genus eubacterium. the 16s rrna sequence of eubacterium lentum was determined and its phylogenetic position was defined. this micro-organism is a member of the genus eubacterium but it is not closely related to eubacterium limosum, the type species of the genus eubacterium, and is nearer to collinsella aerofaciens and coriobacterium glomerans. a pcr-based identification system using species-specific primers designed on the basis of dna sequences encoding the 16s rrna of strains of eubacterium lentum, collinsella aerofaciens and coriobacterium glomerans is described. a species-specific primer set can distinguish eubacterium lentum from  eubacterium limosum or closely related species including collinsella aerofaciens, coriobacterium glomerans and atopobium species. this species-specific pcr method  can be used to identify eubacterium lentum-like species isolated from human faeces. on the basis of the 16s rrna sequence divergence from collinsella aerofaciens and coriobacterium glomerans and the presence of unique phenotypic characters, a new genus, eggerthella gen. nov., is proposed for eubacterium lentum, with one species, eggerthella lenta comb. nov. the type strain of eggerthella lenta is jcm 9979t.

TI  == phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence for the transfer of eubacterium aerofaciens  to the genus collinsella as collinsella aerofaciens gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  == three strains of eubacterium aerofacien, jcm 10188t, jcm 7790 and jcm 7791, and 178 freshly isolated strains of the eubacterium aerofaciens group from human faeces were characterized by biochemical tests, cell wall peptidoglycan type and  16s rrna analysis. the eubacterium aerofaciens group was divided into four groups by fermentation patterns of sucrose and cellobiose, and were further divided into 16 sub-groups by fermentation patterns of aesculin, salicin and amygdalin. all of the strains of the eubacterium aerofaciens group were shown to be phylogenetically distantly related to eubacterium limosum, which is the type species of genus eubacterium. eubacterium aerofaciens was shown to have a specific phylogenetic association with coriobacterium glomerans. all the strains  belonging to eubacterium aerofaciens resembled coriobacterium glomerans in possessing a high g + c content (60 mol%). cell wall analysis, however, revealed  the presence of different a4 beta (l-ala)-d-glu-l-orn-l-asp peptidoglycan types.  based on a 16s rrna sequence divergence of greater than 9% with coriobacterium glomerans and the presence of a unique peptidoglycan type, a new genus, collinsella, is proposed for eubacterium aerofaciens, with one species, collinsella aerofaciens. the type strain of collinsella aerofaciens is jcm 10188t.
