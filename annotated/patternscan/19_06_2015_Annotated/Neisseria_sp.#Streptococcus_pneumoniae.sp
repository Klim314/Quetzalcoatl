TI  == epidemiologic pattern of meningococcal meningitis in northern cameroon in 2007-2010: contribution of pcr-enhanced surveillance.
AB  == objectives: monitoring acute bacterial meningitis in northern cameroon. methods:  health professionals collected cerebrospinal fluid (csf) specimens from patients  presenting with clinical symptoms of meningitis. specimens were tested using gram stain, latex agglutination test, and culture. a pcr assay completed the diagnostic testing. multilocus sequence typing (mlst) was performed on some neisseria meningitidis (nm) isolates. results: from 2007 through 2010, of the 1429 csf specimens tested, 292 (20.4%) were positive, either for nm (205), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) (57), or haemophilus influenzae (hi) (30). from 2007 through 2009, the serogroup w135 represented 98.8% of 164 case isolates. until 2008, most serogroup w135 isolates presented the sequence-type st-2881 usually associated with sporadic cases. since 2009, the st-11 (an epidemic-associated clone) became predominant, although no epidemic occurred. serogroup a st-7 was observed in 2010 and caused a localized epidemic. using the  detection pcr on turbid csf, a 2.7-fold increase in cases with etiologic diagnosis was obtained, compared to culture. all tested meningococcal isolates (42) were susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cefotaxim. conclusions: resurgence of serogroup a and recent increase in st-11 among serogroup w135 isolates were worrying when considered with the epidemic wave of serogroup a meningitis, which affected neighboring countries and the serogroup w135 epidemic  in niger in 2009-2010.

TI  == the formyl peptide receptor like-1 and scavenger receptor marco are involved in glial cell activation in bacterial meningitis.
AB  == background: recent studies have suggested that the scavenger receptor marco (macrophage receptor with collagenous structure) mediates activation of the immune response in bacterial infection of the central nervous system (cns). the chemotactic g-protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) formyl-peptide-receptor like-1 (fprl1) plays an essential role in the inflammatory responses of host defence mechanisms and neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer's disease (ad). expression of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin cramp/ll-37 is up-regulated  in bacterial meningitis, but the mechanisms underlying cramp expression are far from clear. methods: using a rat meningitis model, we investigated the influence  of marco and fprl1 on rcramp (rat cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide) expression after infection with bacterial supernatants of streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) and neisseria meningitides (nm). expression of fprl1 and marco was analyzed by immunofluorescence and real-time rt-pcr in a rat meningitis model. furthermore, we examined the receptor involvement by real-time rt-pcr, extracellular-signal regulated kinases 1/2 (erk1/2) phosphorylation and camp level measurement in glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) and transfected hek293 cells using receptor deactivation by antagonists. receptors were inhibited by small interference rna and the consequences in nm- and sp-induced camp (rcramp gene) expression and signal transduction were determined. results: we show an nm-induced increase of marco expression by immunofluorescence and real-time rt-pcr in glial and meningeal cells. receptor deactivation by antagonists and small interfering rna (sirna) verified the importance of fprl1 and marco for nm-  and sp-induced camp and interleukin-1beta expression in glial cells. furthermore, we demonstrated a functional interaction between fprl1 and marco in nm-induced signalling by real-time rt-pcr, erk1/2 phosphorylation and camp level measurement and show differences between nm- or sp-induced signal transduction. conclusions:  we propose that nm and sp induce glial cell activation and rcramp expression also via fprl1 and marco. thus the receptors contribute an important part to the host  defence against infection.

TI  == anti-bacterial activity of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy: comparative in vitro study of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, mefloquine,  and azithromycin.
AB  == background: intermittent preventive treatment of malaria with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) is recommended for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in sub-saharan africa. increasing drug resistance necessitates the urgent evaluation of alternative drugs. currently, the most promising candidates  in clinical development are mefloquine and azithromycin. besides the anti-malarial activity, sp is also a potent antibiotic and incurs significant anti-microbial activity when given as iptp - though systematic clinical evaluation of this action is still lacking. methods: in this study, the intrinsic anti-bacterial activity of mefloquine and azithromycin was assessed in comparison to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine against bacterial pathogens with clinical importance in pregnancy in a standard microdilution assay. results: sp was highly active against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. all tested gram-positive bacteria, except enterococcus faecalis, were sensitive to azithromycin. additionally, azithromycin was active against neisseria gonorrhoeae. mefloquine showed good activity against pneumococci but lower in vitro action against all other tested pathogens. conclusion: these data indicate  important differences in the spectrum of anti-bacterial activity for the evaluated anti-malarial drugs. given the large scale use of iptp in africa, the need for prospective clinical trials evaluating the impact of antibiotic activity of anti-malarials on maternal and foetal health and on the risk of promoting specific drug resistance of bacterial pathogens is discussed.

TI  == bacterial 16s sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  == previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also  suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. in addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in ph homeostasis. the bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16s rrna genes. lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions.  s. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated  with caries progression in the overall model. lactobacillus or s. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of selenomonas, neisseria, and streptococcus mitis. propionibacterium fma5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. an overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the streptococcus mitis-s. pneumoniae-s. infantis group, corynebacterium matruchotii, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium ir009,  campylobacter rectus, and lachnospiraceae sp. c1. the relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16s rrna gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and  metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.

TI  == african meningitis belt pneumococcal disease epidemiology indicates a need for an effective serotype 1 containing vaccine, including for older children and adults.
AB  == background: pneumococcal conjugate vaccine strategies in gavi-eligible countries  are focusing on infant immunization but this strategy may not be optimal in all settings. we aimed to collect all available population based data on pneumococcal meningitis throughout life in the african meningitis belt and then to model overall meningitis risk to help inform vaccine policy. methods: after a systematic review of literature published from 1970 through the present, we found robust population-based streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) meningitis data across age  strata for four african meningitis belt countries that included 35 surveillance years spanning from 1970 to 2005. using these data we modeled disease risk for a  hypothetical cohort of 100,000 persons followed throughout life. results: similar to meningococcal meningitis, laboratory-confirmed pneumococcal meningitis was seasonal, occurring primarily in the dry season. the mean annual sp meningitis incidence rates were 98, 7.8 to 14, and 5.8 to 12 per 100,000 among persons <1, 1 through 19, and 20 to 99 years of age, respectively, which (in the absence of major epidemics) were higher than meningococcal meningitis incidences for persons less than 1 and over 20 years of age. mean sp meningitis case fatality ratios (cfr) among hospitalized patients ranged from 36-66% depending on the age group,  with cfr exceeding 60% for all age groups beyond 40 years; depending on the age group, sp meningitis mortality incidences were 2 to 12-fold greater than those for meningococcal meningitis. the lifetime risks of pneumococcal meningitis disease and death were 0.6% (1 in 170) and 0.3% (1 in 304), respectively. the incidences of these outcomes were highest among children age <1 year. however, the cumulative risk was highest among persons age 5 to 59 years who experienced 59% of pneumococcal meningitis outcomes. after age 5 years and depending on the country, 59-79% of meningitis cases were caused by serotype 1. conclusions: in the african meningitis belt, sp is as important a cause of meningitis as neisseria meningitidis, particularly among older children and working age adults. the meningitis belt population needs an effective serotype 1 containing vaccine and policy discussions should consider vaccine use outside of early childhood.

TI  == [antibiotic management of pediatric presumptive bacterial meningitis (rational, methods, course, and follow-up)].
AB  == the epidemiology of acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis in children in  industrialized nations was greatly modified because of recommended vaccination against haemophilus influenzae b, streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) and in some countries against neisseria meningitidis (nm) group c. however, most cases of bacterial meningitis are caused by sp and nm most frequently group b, which validates the first intention use of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone combined or not with vancomycin according to the probability of pneumococcal resistance.

TI  == adrenal gland hemorrhage in patients with fatal bacterial infections.
AB  == a wide spectrum of adrenal gland pathology is seen during bacterial infections. hemorrhage is particularly associated with meningococcemia, while abscesses have  been described with several neonatal infections. we studied adrenal gland histopathology of 65 patients with bacterial infections documented in a variety of tissues by using immunohistochemistry. the infections diagnosed included neisseria meningitidies, group a streptococcus, rickettsia rickettsii, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ehrlichia sp., bacillus anthracis, leptospira sp., clostridium sp., klebsiella sp., legionella sp., yersinia pestis, and treponema pallidum. bacteria were detected in the adrenal of 40 (61%) cases. adrenal hemorrhage was present in 39 (60%) cases. bacteria or bacterial antigens were observed in 31 (79%) of the cases with adrenal hemorrhage including 14 with n. meningitidis, four with r. rickettsii, four with s. pneumoniae, three with group a streptococcus, two with s. aureus, two with b. anthracis, one with t. pallidum, and one with legionella sp. bacterial antigens were observed in nine of 26 non-hemorrhagic adrenal glands that showed inflammatory foci (four cases), edema (two cases), congestion (two cases), or necrosis (one case). hemorrhage is the most frequent adrenal gland pathology observed in fatal bacterial infections. bacteria and bacterial antigens are frequently seen in adrenal glands with hemorrhage and may play a pathogenic role. although n. meningitidis is the most frequent bacteria associated with adrenal gland pathology, a broad collection of bacteria can also cause adrenal lesions.

TI  == a pneumococcal merr-like regulator and s-nitrosoglutathione reductase are required for systemic virulence.
AB  == a transcriptional regulator, nmlr(sp), has been identified in streptococcus pneumoniae that is required for defense against nitric oxide (no) stress. the nmlr(sp) gene is cotranscribed with adhc, which encodes an alcohol dehydrogenase  that is able to reduce s-nitrosoglutathione (gsno) with nadh as reductant. nmlr(sp) and adhc mutants exhibited a reduced level of nadh-gsno oxidoreductase activity and were more susceptible to killing by no than were wild-type cells. comparison of the virulence of wild-type and mutant strains by use of a mouse model system showed that nmlr(sp) and adhc do not play a key role in the adherence of pneumococci to the nasopharynx in vivo. an intraperitoneal challenge experiment revealed that both nmlr(sp) and adhc were required for survival in blood. these data identify novel components of a no defense system in pneumococci that are required for systemic infection.

TI  == regulation of constitutive and microbial pathogen-induced human macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif) gene expression.
AB  == the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif) is an important regulator of innate immunity, inflammation and oncogenesis. however, four decades after its identification, the molecular mechanism(s) regulating the expression of the mif gene remain largely unknown. analyses of human monocytic (thp-1), epithelial (hela and a549) and keratinocytic (hacat) cells transfected with wild-type, truncated and mutated mif promoter reporter constructs, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and sirna inhibition indicated that the transcription factors specificity protein (sp)1 and camp response element-binding protein (creb) are critical positive regulators of  constitutive human mif gene expression. albeit located in a cytosine guanine dinucleotide island, the mif gene was found to be hypomethylated, an observation  consistent with high baseline transcriptional activity. moreover, stimulation of  thp-1 cells and of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with microbial products up-regulated phosphorylated sp1 nuclear content, sp1 dna-binding activity, mif promoter activity and mif mrna levels in a mek1/2-, sp1-dependent manner. taken together with previous observations of an important role for mif in pro-inflammatory macrophage responses, these present findings suggest a key role  for sp1 and creb in transcriptional regulation of mif gene expression and mif-dependent host antimicrobial innate immune defense.

TI  == acute bacterial meningitis among children, in manhica, a rural area in southern mozambique.
AB  == introduction: acute bacterial meningitis (abm) is one of the most severe diseases in sub-saharan africa. although data for the continent is very limited, more than one million cases are estimated per year, with mortality and life-long sequelae occurring in 50% of these cases. methods: as part of the clinical management of children admitted to the manhica district hospital, information on cases of abm was recorded. we analysed data from june 1998 to november 2003. results: during the study period, 475 cerebrospinal-fluid (csf) samples were collected from 20,173 children <15 years of age admitted to hospital. culture results confirmed  71 (15%) cases of abm. the most prevalent bacterial aetiologies were streptotoccus pneumoniae (pneumococcus, n=31), haemophilus influenzae (n=13) and  neisseria meningitis (n=8). other important bacteria were streptococcus sp. (n=7), salmonella sp. (n=4) and staphylococcus aureus (n=3). crude incidence rates of abm and pneumococcal meningitis were 20/100,000 and 10/100,000 children-year-at-risk, respectively. incidences were more than three times higher in the <1 year age group. overall case fatality rate was 36%, and was highest for h. influenzae and pneumococcal meningitis (55% and 45%, respectively, p=0.044). pneumococcal susceptibility was 81% for oxacillin and 93% for chloramphenicol. for h. influenzae isolates, susceptibility was 54% for ampicillin and 62% for chloramphenicol. conclusions: s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae are the main aetiologies responsible for the high burden of morbidity and mortality associated with abm in rural mozambique. these findings are important to evaluate treatment  guidelines and potential impact of control measures.

TI  == acute bacterial meningitis at the 'complexe pediatrique' of bangui, central african republic.
AB  == to precis the aetiologies of children meningitis and the susceptibility to antibiotics of bacteria responsible for meningitis in bangui, we conducted a prospective study between october 2004 and september 2005, at the 'complexe pediatrique de bangui', central african republic (car). children from 1 day to 16 years with suspected meningitis and who underwent a lumbar puncture were enrolled. gram staining, culture on chocolate blood medium, cell count, biochemistry (protein level, glucose ratio), capsular antigen detection were performed for each cerebrospinal fluid. mics were determined by the e-test method. four hundred and seventeen patients were enrolled during the study period; 130 were proven acute bacterial meningitis and 37 probable bacterial meningitis. among proven bacterial meningitis, streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common organism responsible for meningitis (62 cases, 48%) followed by haemophilus influenzae (46 cases, 35%) and by neisseria meningitidis and salmonella sp. (8 cases, 6% each). ninety-four percent and 96% of s. pneumoniae strains tested remain susceptible to benzylpenicilline and chloramphenicol, respectively. a beta-lactamase was detected in 92% of h. influenzae strains tested. however, mics 50% and 90% for amoxicillin were found to be 1 and 4 mg/l,  respectively and 33% of these strains were resistant to chloramphenicol. the global mortality rate was 35% (59/167). this mortality rate was 47% for s. pneumoniae, 33% for h. influenzae, 62% for salmonella sp. and 13% for n. meningitidis. the probabilistic treatment with ampicillin and chloramphenicol usually administered for children meningitis in bangui must be reconsidered particularly in cases of h. influenzae meningitis. it is of importance to reduce  the presentation delays of children with suspected meningitis in bangui. the h. influenzae b immunization would allow a dramatic reduction of meningitis cases and deaths in central african children.

TI  == intranasal vaccines for protection against respiratory and systemic bacterial infections.
AB  == more than 4 million deaths per year are due to respiratory diseases. although licensed vaccines are available, bacteria, such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, bordetella pertussis and neisseria meningiditis, among others, continue to be the major agents of diseases in young children, the elderly and/or immunocompromized individuals. following respiratory tract infection, some microorganisms may also invade the epithelial tissue, achieving systemic circulation and/or other organs. nasal administration  of different antigen formulations has shown promising results in the induction of immune responses and the defeat of the pathogens at the site of infection. this review will focus on the main nasal vaccine strategies and technologies being investigated against the most common infections caused by respiratory bacteria.

TI  == bacterial profile and clinical outcome of childhood meningitis in rural yemen: a  2-year hospital-based study.
AB  == background: childhood acute bacterial meningitis (abm) is an important cause of death and long-term neurological disability in yemen, the only low income-high mortality country in the arabian peninsula. the objective of this study was to document the microbial characteristics, the antibacterial sensitivity pattern, and the outcome for children hospitalized with abm, prior to the introduction of  haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) vaccine in yemen. patients and methods: the study was retrospective, conducted at a rural district hospital, serving the rural population of the northern parts of yemen. all patients aged 1 month-15 years admitted between may 1999 and june 2001, with clinical evidence of meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) cultured, were included in the study. clinical information from case notes, including csf result and the outcome on discharge, were obtained. analysis of extracted data was performed using epi info software. results: during the 2-year study period, 160 study patients met the inclusion criteria, and 7 (4.4%) were negative for bacterial growth. in the 153 positive cultures there were 46 (30.1%) streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), 23 (15%) h. influenzae (hi), 81 (52.9) neisseria meningitidis (nm), 2 (1.3%) staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), and 1 (0.7%) escherichia coli. sixteen study patients died (overall case fatality rate (cfr) 10%), 7 aged under 12 months, 6 aged 12-60 months, and 3 more than 60 months. ten deaths were due to sp meningitis, 2 hi meningitis, 3 nm meningitis, and 1 had s. aureus. of the 144 survivors, 28 (19.4%) developed permanent neurological complications, 17 aged less than 12 months, 6 aged 12-60 months, and 5 more than 60 months. sp meningitis accounted for 57.1% (16/28), and 6 (21.4%) had hi meningitis. among the 89 aged 1-60 months, 13 died (cfr 14.6%), and 23 (30.3%) of the 76 survivors  developed permanent complications. of those tested 20% and 35% of the 20 hi tested isolates and 9.5% and 14.3% of the 42 sp isolates, were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin g, respectively, and the majority of the 81 nm isolates were sensitive to both. the 3 pathogens were largely resistant to gentamicin, and almost all were susceptible to chloramphenicol and cefotaxime. conclusion: in contrast to the studies from the low-mortality countries of the region, our study showed that the predominant pathogens of childhood abm were sp and nm. sp meningitis was associated with increased mortality and permanent disability.

TI  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039): a new methoxy quinolone antibacterial.
AB  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039) is a new 8 methoxy quinolone antibacterial. the mic90  values are < or = 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae (irrespective of penicillin susceptibility), haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), morexella catarrhalis, bordetella pertussis, legionella sp., mycoplasma pneumoniae, clamydia pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide-sensitive or -resistant), listeria sp., most enterobacteriaceae, salmonella sp., shigella sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. menigitidis, pasteurella  spp., vibrio spp. and yersinia enterocolitica. for mycobacterium intracellularae, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, citrobacter freundii, providencia sp., serratia sp., p. aeruginosa and other non-fermentive gram-negative rods, mic90s are in the range 0.5-4 mg/l. for anaerobic bacteria species, mic90s are also in the range 0.25-4 mg/l. moxifloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations 2- to 4-fold higher than the mic and is rapidly bactericidal against most common pathogen groups at concentrations achieved in serum with a 400 mg dose that is between 0.5-4 mg/l. there is a post-antibiotic effect against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. resistant mutants are at present difficult to select in the laboratory but in general, moxifloxacin has poorer activity against strains resistant to ciprofloxacin compared to those which are susceptible. animal and laboratory pharmacodynamic models indicate that the mic and area under the serum concentration time curve predict outcome. various animal models mainly of respiratory tract infection indicate equivalent or superior results compared to existing or other developmental agents. human pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers indicate linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 50-800 mg/day. a single dose of 400 mg produces a maximum serum concentration of 2.5-4.5 mg/l, half-life of 11-15 h,  auc of 25-40 mg x h/l and volume of distribution of 2.5-3.5 l/kg. protein binding is about 50% and two metabolites have been identified (m-1 and m-2). bioavailability is > 85% and a minority of clearance is via the kidneys. no dose  modification is required in renal impairment. extra vascular penetration, where studied, is comparable to that of other quinolones. at present undergoing clinical trials, with a focus on respiratory tract infection, it is likely that moxifloxacin will provide effective therapy for pathogens with mics of < or = 0.25-0.5 mg/l. the safety profile in a large number of human subjects is awaited.

TI  == [overwhelming postsplenectomy infection].
AB  == background: splenectomy performed at any age and for any reason increases the risk for death due to overwhelming infection. aim: to evaluate definition, etiology, incidence, risk factors and prophylaxis of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection, as well as the methods related to splenic tissue preservation when total splenectomy is necessary. method: bibliographic review. results: the etiological agents more frequently found are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenza and type b, and neisseria meningitidis. other bacteria like escherichia coli, streptococcus b-hemolytic, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas sp represent a significant risk as well. in addition, a great variety of agents including other enteric gram-negative microorganisms and non-bacteria pathogens can also be sporadically identified. the prophylaxis is based on three  main aspects: patient's education, immune prophylaxis and chemical prophylaxis. however these are not enough to prevent the higher risk of developing sepsis. when total splenectomy is unavoidable, heterotopic splenic autotransplantation seems to be the only alternative for splenic tissue preservation. according to clinical and experimental studies, the splenic autotransplanted tissue present a  similar structure to a normal spleen and preserve the splenic immune function. conclusions: the high risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection, reduced the indication for total splenectomy, in trauma and several diseases. prophylactic methods have been developed to minimize the effects of the sepsis. several researches have been done to determine the immunocompetence of autogenous splenic grafts in response to bacteria invasion.

AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) is an important bacterial pathogen in children. nasopharyngeal (np) colonization of s. pneumoniae is necessary for person-to-person transmission and often precedes invasive disease. methods: np carriage of sp was studied in 49 infants following administration of a heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv) conjugated to the outer membrane protein of serogroup b neisseria meningitidis (vaccine serotypes: 4, 6b, 9v, 14,  18c, 19f, 23f). the vaccine was administered at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age and carriage rates were compared to a concurrent group of 32 infants not given pcv and evaluated over the first 15 months of life. results: overall, sp was isolated in 86/367 (23%) of np cultures and 49% of infants. serotype 23f was significantly less prevalent in the pcv group (1.9%) than the control group (16.1%) (p<0.05). analysis of the proportion of children with prevalent carriage or acquisition of  carriage did not differ between groups when evaluated by age or serotype. we noted, however, decreased acquisition and carriage in the vaccine group 1 month following the 12 month dose of pcv for vaccine serotypes (76 and 52% reduction, respectively), but this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.3). adjustment for age, daycare and antibiotic use by multivariate modeling revealed  no difference in carriage of vaccine containing serotypes or non-vaccine serotypes between groups. conclusion: we did not show a significant effect of this heptavalent pcv on np carriage. further study of this issue, including a larger population size, is needed.

TI  == employment of broad-range 16s rrna pcr to detect aetiological agents of infection from clinical specimens in patients with acute meningitis--rapid separation of 16s rrna pcr amplicons without the need for cloning.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to develop a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) method for the rapid separation of 16s rrna pcr amplicons from aetiological agents of acute meningitis. methods and results: blood samples from  40 patients with suspected acute meningococcal meningitis were examined for the presence of causal agents, including neisseria meningitidis employing two methods: (i) broad-range 16s rrna pcr in conjunction with page and automated sequencing and (ii) species-specific pcr employing abi taqman technology for n. meningitidis. analysis of clinical specimens employing 16s rrna pcr yielded 33/40 (82.5%) positive for the presence of bacterial dna. species-specific pcr yielded  30/40 (75%) clinical specimens positive for n. meningitidis. prior to separation  by page, only 6/33 (18.2%) amplicons were able to be identified by sequence analysis, the remaining amplicons (n=27) did not yield an identification due to the presence of mixed 16s rrna pcr amplicons. following separation, amplicons were re-amplified and sequenced, yielding 24/27 (88.9%) positive for n. meningitidis and three specimens positive for acinetobacter sp., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. one specimen was positive for both n. meningitidis and streptococcus spp. and another specimen was positive for n. meningitidis and pseudomonas sp., by broad-range pcr. seven clinical specimens were negative for n. meningitidis and other eubacteria using both detection techniques. conclusions: clinical specimens including blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with suspected acute bacterial meningitis, may become contaminated with commensal skin flora, resulting in difficulties in downstream sequencing of pathogen plus contaminant dna. this study allows for the rapid separation of amplified pathogen from contaminant dna. significance and impact of study: this study demonstrated the usefulness of the rapid separation of multiple 16s rrna pcr amplicons using a combination of page and automated sequencing, without the need of cloning. adoption of this technique is therefore proposed when trying to rapidly identify pathogens in clinical specimens employing broad-range 16s rrna pcr.

TI  == [investigate of nasopharyngeal flora in highly aged patients].
AB  == to clarify the bacteriological interpretation of flora in the nasopharynx of highly aged patients (n = 107), healthy nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from subjects of advanced age. chief pathogenic bacteria isolated from highly aged persons were coagulase negative staphylococcus (43 strains), corynebacterium spp. (14 strains), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase production and non-production) (16 strains), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase production) (6 strains). chief nonpathogenic bacteria isolated from highly aged persons were alpha-streptococcus (14 strains), neisseria sp (3 strains). streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis which are the chief bacteria isolated from children, demonstrated only 3 strains for each bacteria. in cases showing detection of multiple detected bacteria, common combinations were non-pathogenic bacteria and  weakly pathogenic bacteria and enteric bacteria and pathogenic bacteria. the differences between nasopharyngeal flora of children and highly aged persons are  suspected to be due to the differences in immunological and anatomical factors. we should actively examine these factors in highly aged subjects.

TI  == designing meningitis vaccines.
AB  == conjugate polysaccharide vaccines are a recent intervention to combat the relative inability of young children to mount an effective immune response against encapsulated bacteria, especially haemophilus influenzae (hib), neisseria meningitidis (nm) and streptococcus pneumoniae (sp). these organisms cause the majority of community acquired septicaemia and meningitis in uk children. their capsular polysaccharides, important virulence factors in evading phagocytosis, are poorly immunogenic in young children compared to adults. conjugation, by covalent linking, of the polysaccharide to an immunogenic protein, has been demonstrated for each of these organisms to produce good antibody response to the polysaccharide. conjugate hib vaccines have proven effective in reducing hib meningitis and invasive disease in the countries that have introduced them. pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have proven effective in preventing invasive disease caused by serotypes contained in the vaccines. efficacy studies are awaited for meningococcal conjugate vaccines.

AB  == aims: to evaluate rapid organism identification on positive blood culture bactec  nr media (phial types 26, 27, 42 and 17), and to assess the usefulness of these procedures in a diagnostic microbiology laboratory. methods: two hundred and sixty, first positive, blood culture bottles from individual patients were tested by rapid identification methods selected on the basis of gram film organism morphology. tube coagulase and latex agglutination were applied to presumptive staphylococci; latex agglutination antigen detection methods to suspected pneumococci, neisseria and haemophilus sp; and latex agglutination grouping tests for cultures thought to be non-pneumococcal streptococci. results: media type did not influence test performance (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). misapplication of  methods occurred on eight occasions and there were 14 false positive results, nine involving the latex reagents for group c streptococci and pneumococci. the positive predictive values for tube coagulase tests and latex reactions for h influenzae type b, and n meningitidis groups b and c were 100%. the pneumococcal  and staphylococcal latex tests gave positive predictive values of 94.1% and 62.5%, respectively, and the corresponding figure for streptococcal grouping reactions was 75.9%. with the exception of staphylococcal latex testing (80%) all investigation negative predictive values were > 90%. conclusions: the performance of the staphylococcal latex agglutination method was unsatisfactory and it is not appropriate for use with the media studied. in view of the cross-reactions observed with the tests used to identify group c streptococci and pneumococci, positive findings must be interpreted with caution. in all other regards the protocol evaluated produced rapid, reliable, clinically useful information and, subject to local experience, is recommended to users of bactec nr media.

TI  == [antibiotherapy as first choice in infectious meningitis].
AB  == the choice of antibiotics in bacterial meningitis must integrate several parameters. i) the bacterial epidemiology of community acquired meningitis: haemophilus influenzae (hi) neisseria meningitidis (nm), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) represents more than 95% of cases; ii) the increase of antibiotic bacterial  resistance, particularly preoccupying for sp; iii) the microbiological properties and pharmacokinetics of antibiotics, especially their penetration in csf: the concentrations achieved must be several times higher than the mbc. in fact, csf is not favourable to the antibiotic activity; iv) the results of clinical comparative trials; v) the contribution of animal models to the knowledge of meningitis physiopathology. third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone) satisfy this objective for hi, nm, and penicillin sensitive strains  of sp. for penicillin resistant sp, no treatment can achieve antibiotic csf concentrations higher than ten times the mbc. an increase in dosage of cephalosporins, the use of an other regimen (vancomycin or imipenem) and antibiotic association (rifamycin, fosfomycin) are needed.

AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. a-56620 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, bacteroides sp. and clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. a-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than a-56620. both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive haemophilus influenzae (mic 0.015 micrograms/ml) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mk less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). both agents were more active against streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. they inhibited enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus  at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. these agents show  overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. ci-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against gram-positive aerobic organisms including staphylococcus aureus (mics 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mics 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (mics 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (mics 2 mg/l). all three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas sp., haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly less than 1 mg/l). the other gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for acinetobacter and  pseudomonas aeruginosa mics seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. ci-934 was more active than enoxacin against gardnerella vaginalis (mics 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. bacteroides species (including about half of the  fragilis group) were susceptible to ci-934 (mics mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin  had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to ci-934 (mics 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less  susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.

TI  == in vitro activity of ro 15-8074 and ro 19-5247, two orally administered cephalosporin metabolites.
AB  == the activity of two iminomethoxy aminothiazoly cephalosporins, ro 15-8074 and ro  19-5247, was compared with that of other beta-lactams against a total of 491 bacterial strains. both were highly active (mic for 90% of the strains tested [mic 90], less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml) against the majority of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae, being at least 16-fold more active than cephalexin  and 8-fold more active than cefuroxime. there was no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and poor activity against morganella morganii (in the case of ro 15-8074), enterobacter sp., and citrobacter sp. staphylococcus aureus was moderately susceptible to ro 19-5247 (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml), but ro 15-8074 was eightfold less active. the protein binding of the two compounds at 5 micrograms/ml was 9.1% for ro 15-8074 and 69.9% for ro 19-5247. the major target  site for the two cephalosporins was pbp 3.

TI  == [prospective evaluation of coagglutination and latex agglutination in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in childhood].
AB  == two simple and low-priced kits to detect bacterial antigens in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) specimens from patients with suspected meningitis have recently become available. methods employed by these kits are staphylococcal coagglutination (coa) and latex agglutination (la). the coa "phadebact csf-kit" (pharmacia) detects haemophilus influenzae type b (hib), neisseria meningitidis (nm) groups a, b, c, y and w 135 and streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), whereas the la "slidex meningite-kit" (biomerieux) includes hib, nm a, nm c and sp. these two diagnostic tests were compared with the standard methods for analyzing csf specimens from children with suspected meningitis. a total of 336 csf specimens were tested. forty-three were from children with bacterial meningitis due to hib, nm or sp obtained before antimicrobial therapy. thirty-four of them (79%) were correctly detected by coa, 23 (54%) by la, and 42 (97%) by microscopic analysis of stained smears. there were 65 csf samples of such meningitis cases obtained after initiation of antimicrobial therapy: coa detected 26 (40%), la 17 (26%) and staining 26 (40%). with culture-positive csf specimens from patients before therapy, the best sensitivities were obtained with la for sp (100%) and coa for hib (87%), whereas the results for nm antigen detection were only 43% with coa and 0% with la (no reagent against nm b). cross-reactions with other bacterial antigens were frequent with coa (26%) and rare with la (2%), resulting in false-positive findings in 6 of the 66 positive tests with coa (9%) but in none of the 40 positive tests with la (0%). one of the 48 specimens from aseptic meningitis cases was false-positive for hib by coa, whereas all 172 normal specimens were negative with both methods. with 5 culture-negative csf specimens  from patients with unequivocal purulent meningitis coa detected bacterial antigen in 5 and la in 2. conclusions: the two kits evaluated cannot replace standard methods for analyzing csf specimens, in view of insufficient sensitivity (mainly  la) or frequent cross-reactions and false-positive values (coa). however, due to  their simplicity, rapidity, and possible identification of bacterial pathogens after initiation of antimicrobial therapy, these kits are recommended as an useful addition to standard methods.

TI  == [rhino- and oropharyngeal carriage of haemophilus sp. in children].
AB  == the occurence of haemophilus sp. and other potential pathogens: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and neisseria meningitidis has been investigated in 79 children from rhino and oropharyngeal material. h. parainfluenzae is only isolated from the oropharynx. h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae may be isolated from the rhinopharynx but are associated to signs of infection in the upper respiratory tract. the capsule of h. influenzae represents a colonization factor of the rhinopharynx from an oropharyngeal carriage. 6.1% of h. influenzae and 28% of h. parainfluenzae isolates were found resistant to penicillin by production of betalactamase.

TI  == an evaluation of latex particle agglutination to detect antigenemia in children.
AB  == latex particle agglutination (lpa) was used to detect specific bacterial capsular antigen in sera collected at the time blood samples were taken from children with suspected bacteremia. capsular polysaccharide antigens tested for were haemophilus influenzae type b (hi b), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), streptococcus agalactiae (sa) and neisseria meningitidis (nm) groups a and c. an  adequate volume of serum was available for 1085 of the blood culture sets received. antigenemia was detected in 47 children; 36 children from whom the homologous microorganism was isolated from the associated blood culture and 11 children who had prior antibiotic therapy and whose blood culture grew no microorganism. antigenemia was not detected in 46 children whose blood culture yielded a bacterium for which a homologous lpa reagent was available. fifty children had positive blood cultures with microorganisms considered significant to which no lpa reagent was available. lpa was of value as a rapid diagnostic test in the identification of the etiological agent in severe infectious disease  in children.

TI  == the bacteriology and cytology of chronic otitis media with effusion.
AB  == the bacteriology and cytology of middle ear effusion from 729 children with persistent otitis media with effusion were studied. thirty-five percent of these  chronic effusions were culture-positive. type b and non-type b haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria sp. and staphylococcus epidermidis were the predominant isolates. serous and mucoid effusion cultures yielded bacteria more often in younger than in older children. in addition bacteria were seen in 17% of the gram-stained smears of the sterile effusions; gram-positive cocci predominated in these effusions. disparate effusion culture results were obtained in 32% of bilateral otitis media cases. effusions which yielded h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae on culture had more polymorphonuclear leukocytes than did effusions which yielded s. epidermidis or neisseria or were sterile. phagocytic cells were equally prevalent in sterile effusions with or without bacteria on gram stain. phagocytic cells were seen less often in mucoid effusions from antibiotic-treated patients than in mucoid effusions from untreated patients. the results suggest that certain bacteria in chronic middle ear effusion contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition by eliciting a local inflammatory cell response.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical studies on cefoxitin in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  == studies on antimicrobial activity, absorption and excretion and clinical use of cefoxitin in pediatric field were performed. 1. mic of cefoxitin was compared with that of cefazolin and/or ampicillin for clinical isolates of staphylococcus  aureus (36 strains), escherichia coli (35 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (34 strains) and haemophilus influenzae (80 strains). mic of cefoxitin against s. aureus was approximately 1-2 tubes higher than that of cefazolin. many strains of e. coli and k. pneumoniae that showed high mic to cefazolin were sensitive to cefoxitin. it is presumed that the results are due to the strong resistance of cefoxitin to beta-lactamase degradation. mic of cefoxitin against h. influenzae was approximately 1-2 tubes lower than that of cefazolin, but approximately 4 tubes higher than that of ampicillin. 2. serum level and urinary recovery rate of cefoxitin after one shot i.v. injection of 25 mg/kg were examined. the serum mean levels were 33.8 microgram/ml at 1/2 hour, 7.0 microgram/ml at 1 hour and 2.9 microgram/ml at 2 hours after the injection, respectively, and the drug was not detected in serum at 4 and 6 hours after the injection. the mean half-life of serum level was 27.1 minutes. the mean urinary recovery rate within 6 hours after injection was 96.0% and most of the drug were excreted into urine within 2 hours  after the injection. 3. in order to evaluate clinical response, bacteriological response and side effects, cefoxitin was applied to 19 cases, i.e., 12 cases of either acute lobar pneumonia or acute bronchopneumonia, 2 cases of acute pyelitis, 1 case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent arthritis, acute orbital phlegmon and acute buccal abscess. as for clinical response, the overall efficacy rate (the percentage of cases showed excellent and good efficacy) was 88.9%. as for bacteriological response, among the 13 strains which were determined or supposed to be causative organisms, i.e., 6 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of h. influenzae and 1 strain each of streptococcus pyogenes, alpha-streptococcus, enterococcus, e. coli and neisseria sp., all strains were disappeared except for enterococcus which was reduced by the treatment with cefoxitin. no side effect was observed in any case. abnormalities of laboratory findings were observed in 3 cases, i.e., 1 case each  of reduction of rbc and hb, elevation of got and gpt and elevation of gpt, but all of them returned to normal following completion of the dosage term.

TI  == microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in zaria, nigeria.
AB  == nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in zaria have been identified. the work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. the isolates in order of prevalence were: candida albicans (20.9%), klebsiella sp (15.0%), escherichia coli (9.1%), streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), streptococcus viridans (2.1%), staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), proteus mirabilis (1.1%), peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus sp, lactobacillus sp, and clostridium sp were sought but not found. chlamydia, viruses, and t-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. it appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. for this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
