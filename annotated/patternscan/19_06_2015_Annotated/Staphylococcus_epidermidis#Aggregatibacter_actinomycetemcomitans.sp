TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of dispersinb on methicillin-resistant staphylococcus pseudintermedius biofilm.
AB  == methicillin resistant staphylococcus pseudintermedius (mrsp) is an important canine pathogen that has been shown to produce biofilm in vitro. biofilm production may be an important virulence factor and methods to eliminate biofilm-associated infections are required. an enzyme of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dispersinb, has been shown to degrade the extracellular matrix in the biofilm of a variety of bacteria including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the objective of this study was to determine the  effect of dispersinb on mrsp biofilm production and eradication in vitro. a quantitative microtitre plate assay was used to assess the impact of dispersinb on 30 mrsp isolates from dogs. while dispersinb did not have any effect on mrsp growth (p=0.98), it reduced biofilm formation (p=0.0002) and degraded established biofilm (p=0.0001). these data indicate that in vivo study of the effect of this  enzyme in indicated to determine if it may be a useful treatment option for mrsp  biofilm-associated infections.

TI  == antibiofilm activity of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 capsular polysaccharide.
AB  == cell-free extracts isolated from colony biofilms of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 were found to inhibit biofilm formation by staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  but not by a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 itself, in a 96-well microtiter plate assay. physical and chemical analyses indicated that the antibiofilm activity in  the extract was due to high-molecular-weight polysaccharide. extracts isolated from a mutant strain deficient in the production of serotype 5 capsular polysaccharide did not exhibit antibiofilm activity. a plasmid harboring the serotype 5 capsule genes restored the antibiofilm activity in the mutant extract. purified serotype 5 capsular polysaccharide also exhibited antibiofilm activity against s. aureus. a. pleuropneumoniae wild-type extracts did not inhibit s. aureus growth, but did inhibit s. aureus intercellular adhesion and binding of s. aureus cells to stainless steel surfaces. furthermore, polystyrene surfaces coated with a. pleuropneumoniae wild-type extracts, but not with capsule-mutant extracts, resisted s. aureus biofilm formation. our findings suggest that the a.  pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 capsule inhibits cell-to-cell and cell-to-surface interactions of other bacteria. a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 capsular polysaccharide is one of a growing number of bacterial polysaccharides that exhibit broad-spectrum, nonbiocidal antibiofilm activity. future studies on these antibiofilm polysaccharides may uncover novel functions for bacterial polysaccharides in nature, and may lead to the development of new classes of antibiofilm agents for industrial and clinical applications.

TI  == broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition by kingella kingae exopolysaccharide.
AB  == cell-free extracts prepared from kingella kingae colony biofilms were found to inhibit biofilm formation by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, candida albicans,  and k. kingae. the extracts evidently inhibited biofilm formation by modifying the physicochemical properties of the cell surface, the biofilm matrix, and the substrate. chemical and biochemical analyses indicated that the biofilm inhibition activity in the k. kingae extract was due to polysaccharide. structural analyses showed that the extract contained two major polysaccharides.  one was a linear polysaccharide with the structure -->6)-alpha-d-glcnacp-(1-->5)-beta-d-oclap-(2-->, which was identical to a capsular polysaccharide produced by actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5. the second was a novel linear polysaccharide, designated pam galactan, with the structure -->3)-beta-d-galf-(1-->6)-beta-d-galf-(1-->. purified pam galactan exhibited broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition activity. a cluster of three k. kingae genes encoding udp-galactopyranose mutase (ugm) and two putative galactofuranosyl transferases was sufficient for the synthesis of pam galactan in escherichia coli. pam galactan is one of a growing number of bacterial polysaccharides that exhibit antibiofilm activity. the biological roles and potential technological applications of these molecules remain unknown.

TI  == chitosan coatings deliver antimicrobials from titanium implants: a preliminary study.
AB  == objective: chitosan was investigated as a coating for local delivery of antimicrobials for prevention of acute implant infection. the objectives of this  study were to (1) measure the release of 2 antimicrobials from chitosan coatings, (2) determine efficacy of eluted antimicrobials against bacteria, in vitro, and (3) evaluate toxicity of eluted drugs to host cells/tissues. methods: chitosan coatings (80.7% deacetylated, 108 kda) containing 20% tetracycline or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate were bonded to titanium via silane reactions. after elution in culture medium for 7 days, eluates were tested against model pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and staphylococcus epidermidis in turbidity  tests and in 24-hour cytotoxicity tests using human osteoblasts and fibroblasts.  finally, antibiotic-loaded chitosan-coated titanium pins were implanted for 7 days in muscle of sprague-dawley rats to evaluate the initial tissue response. results: coatings released 89% of tetracycline in 7 days and 100% chlorhexidine in 2 days. released tetracycline inhibited growth (95%-99.9%) of pathogens for up to 7 days with no cytotoxicity to human cells. released chlorhexidine was active  against pathogens for 1 to 2 days (56%-99.5% inhibition) but was toxic to cells on the first day of elution. typical acute inflammatory response was observed to  antimicrobial-loaded chitosan coatings similar to unloaded coatings. conclusion:  these preliminary data support the hypothesis that chitosan coatings have the potential to locally deliver antimicrobials to inhibit bacteria without being toxic to host cells/tissues and warrant additional studies to evaluate the ability of the coatings to prevent/resist infection and promote osseointegration.

TI  == staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms: functional molecules, relation to virulence, and vaccine potential.
AB  == medical device-associated infections, most frequently caused by staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, are of increasing importance in modern medicine. the formation of adherent, multilayered bacterial biofilms is crucial in the pathogenesis of these infections. polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (pia), a homoglycan of beta-1,6-linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d: -glucopyranosyl residues, of which about 15% are non-n-acetylated, is central to biofilm accumulation in staphylococci. it transpires that polysaccharides - structurally  very similar to pia - are also key to biofilm formation in a number of other organisms including the important human pathogens escherichia coli, aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, yersinia pestis, and bordetella spp. apparently, synthesis of pia and related polysaccharides is a general feature important for biofilm formation in diverse bacterial genera. current knowledge about the structure and biosynthesis of pia and related polysaccharides is reviewed. additionally, information on their role in pathogenesis of biomaterial-related and other type of infections and the potential use of pia and related compounds for prevention of infection is evaluated.

TI  == structural analysis of dispersin b, a biofilm-releasing glycoside hydrolase from  the periodontopathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == bacteria in a biofilm are enmeshed in a self-synthesized extracellular polysaccharide matrix that holds the bacteria together in a mass and firmly attaches the bacterial mass to the underlying surface. a major component of the extracellular polysaccharide matrix in several phylogenetically diverse bacteria  is pga, a linear polymer of n-acetylglucosamine residues in beta(1,6)-linkage. pga is produced by the gram-negative periodontopathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans as well as by the gram-positive device-associated pathogen  staphylococcus epidermidis. we recently reported that a.actinomycetemcomitans produces a soluble glycoside hydrolase named dispersin b, which degrades pga. here, we present the crystal structure of dispersin b at 2.0a in complex with a glycerol and an acetate ion at the active site. the enzyme crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group c222(1) with cell dimensions a=41.02a, b=86.13a, c=185.77a. the core of the enzyme consists a (beta/alpha)(8) barrel topology similar to other beta-hexosaminidases but significant differences exist in the arrangement of loops hovering in the vicinity of the active site. the location and interactions of the glycerol and acetate moieties in conjunction with the sequence analysis suggest that dispersin b cleaves beta(1,6)-linked n-acetylglucosamine polymer using a catalytic machinery similar to other family 20 hexosaminidases which cleave beta(1,4)-linked n-acetylglucosamine residues.

TI  == depolymerization of beta-1,6-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine disrupts the integrity of diverse bacterial biofilms.
AB  == polymeric beta-1,6-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (poly-beta-1,6-glcnac) has been implicated as an escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm adhesin, the formation of which requires the pgaabcd and icaabcd loci, respectively. enzymatic hydrolysis of poly-beta-1,6-glcnac, demonstrated for the first time by  chromatography and mass spectrometry, disrupts biofilm formation by these species and by yersinia pestis and pseudomonas fluorescens, which possess pgaabcd homologues.

TI  == enzymatic detachment of staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms.
AB  == the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus epidermidis is the most common cause of infections associated with catheters and other indwelling medical devices. s.  epidermidis produces an extracellular slime that enables it to form adherent biofilms on plastic surfaces. we found that a biofilm-releasing enzyme produced by the gram-negative periodontal pathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans rapidly and efficiently removed s. epidermidis biofilms from plastic surfaces. the enzyme worked by releasing extracellular slime from s. epidermidis cells. precoating surfaces with the enzyme prevented s. epidermidis biofilm formation. our findings demonstrate that biofilm-releasing enzymes can exhibit broad-spectrum activity and that these enzymes may be useful as antibiofilm agents.

TI  == peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (msra) is not a major virulence determinant for the oral pathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is an oral pathogen that is a causative agent for periodontal disease as well as other non-oral infections. the chronic inflammation associated with periodontal diseases suggests that the bacterium must be able to neutralize oxygen intermediates to survive in the host tissues. methionine sulfoxide reductase (msra) is an enzyme that has been demonstrated to  have a role in protection against oxidative damage and has also been identified to be required for the proper expression or maintenance of functional adhesins on the surface of several pathogenic bacteria. the a. actinomycetemcomitans homologue of msra has been isolated and a chromosomal insertion mutant constructed by allele replacement mutagenesis. inactivation of the gene led to a  complete loss of enzymic activity toward a synthetic substrate. however, the isogenic mutant was not more sensitive to oxidative stress or less adherent to epithelial cells as compared with the parent strain. these data suggest that this strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans has redundant systems that compensate for the  msra activities ascribed for other organisms.

TI  == the interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. the reference bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (gf) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (e) from 2 such persons, hela cells (hela), and an amnion cell line (amnion). the cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a bioscreen robot analyzer (labsystems, finland). results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line  of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == occurrence of enteric rods, staphylococci and candida in subgingival samples.
AB  == the frequency and percentage of enteric rods, staphylococci and candida were determined in 973 subgingival samples collected from 535 patients subjected to different periodontal treatment procedures. the analysis was performed with culture technique using selective and nonselective media. one or more organisms were detected in 65.5% of the samples and in 76.7% of the patients. in most samples enteric rods, staphylococci and/or candida constituted a small amount of  the total microbial viable count. enteric rods exceeded 10% of the total viable count in 30 samples. staphylococci occurred in more than 10% in only 3 samples. in these 3 samples, enterics constituted more than 10% of the total viable count. candida was not found to exceed 10% of the total viable count in any of the samples. no statistically significant correlation was found between the presence  of any of the target microorganisms and kind of periodontal treatment procedure received, antibiotic administration or sample transport time.

TI  == cytotoxicity in bacterial cultures: interaction and cell-specificity, possible factors in periodontal disease.
AB  == cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. interaction studies were made by adding each of the different uv-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. the reference oral bacterial strains were: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria staphylococcus aureus 209 and staphylococcus epidermidis. the target cells were:  gingival fibroblasts (gf), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (pmf), pulpal fibroblasts (pf), hela-cells (hela), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (ln). synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. the  cytotoxicity of a. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of p. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of s. aureus it was increased. bacterial interactions with f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. the  cytotoxicity of f. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with a. actinomycetemcomitans. each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the  supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.
