TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == antioxidant properties of potentially probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo activities.
AB  == thirty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria (seven bifidobacterium, 11 lactobacillus, six lactococcus, and 10 streptococcus thermophilus) were assayed in vitro for antioxidant activity against ascorbic and linolenic acid oxidation (taa(aa) and taa(la)), trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (teac), intracellular glutathione (tgsh), and superoxide dismutase (sod). wide dispersion of each of taa(aa), taa(la), teac, tgsh, and sod occurred within bacterial groups, indicating that antioxidative properties are strain specific. the strains bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis dsmz 23032, lactobacillus acidophilus dsmz 23033, and lactobacillus brevis dsmz 23034 exhibited among the highest taa(aa), taa(la), teac, and tgsh values within the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. these  strains were used to prepare a potentially antioxidative probiotic formulation, which was administered to rats at the dose of 10(7), 10(8), and 10(9) cfu/day for 18 days. the probiotic strains colonized the colon of the rats during the trial and promoted intestinal saccharolytic metabolism. the analysis of plasma antioxidant activity, reactive oxygen molecules level, and glutathione concentration, revealed that, when administered at doses of at least 10(8) cfu/day, the antioxidant mixture effectively reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress. probiotic strains which are capable to limit excessive amounts  of reactive radicals in vivo may contribute to prevent and control several diseases associated with oxidative stress.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.
