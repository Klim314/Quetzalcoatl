TI  - Acid-bile, antibiotic resistance and inhibitory properties of propionibacteria isolated from Turkish traditional home-made cheeses.
AB  - In this study, a total of 29 Propionibacterium spp. were isolated from traditional home-made Turkish cheese samples. As a result of the identification, isolates were identified as Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii (15 strains), Propionibacterium jensenii (12), and Propionibacterium thoenii (2). All isolates and 5 reference strains were examined for their abilities to survive at pH 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and in the presence of 0.06, 0.15 and 0.30% bile salts, their influence on the growth of food-borne and spoilage bacteria, as well as their sensitivity against 11 selected antibiotics. Only seven propionibacteria strains survived in both the acidic and bile salt environments. Propionibacterium spp. strains strongly inhibited growth of the Escherichia coli ATCC 11229 and Shigella sonnei Mu:57 strains (91%). All propionibacteria strains were sensitive to a majority of the antibiotics used in the investigations. Overall, dairy propionibacteria showed high antibacterial activity, resistance to pH 4.0, 5.0, high resistance to bile salts and will provide an alternative source to Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium as probiotic culture.
TI  - Use of lactic and propionic acid bacteria in the production of fermented parsley  juice.
AB  - Taking into consideration the proliferation rate of Propionibacterium sp. cells,  pH changes and sensory properties of the fermented product obtained, selection of propionic acid bacteria (PAB) was made in order to determine their usefulness for the production of fermented parsley juice. The analysis included 12 strains, belonging to the following species: P. thoenii (4 strains), P. jensenii (6 strains), P. freudenreichii (1 strain) and P. acidipropionici (1 strain). The experiments show that many strains of propionic acid rods develop well in parsley juice, allowing to achieve the desired taste qualities of the product. The Propionibacterium strains selected by elimination were used as components of vaccine containing: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
TI  - Biochemical and genetic characterization of propionicin T1, a new bacteriocin from Propionibacterium thoenii.
AB  - A collection of propionibacteria was screened for bacteriocin production. A new bacteriocin named propionicin T1 was isolated from two strains of Propionibacterium thoenii. This bacteriocin shows no sequence similarity to other bacteriocins. Propionicin T1 was active against all strains of Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium thoenii, and Propionibacterium jensenii tested and also against Lactobacillus sake NCDO 2714 but showed no activity against Propionibacterium freudenreichii. The bacteriocin was purified, and the N-terminal part of the peptide was determined with amino acid sequencing. The corresponding gene pctA was sequenced, and this revealed that propionicin T1 is produced as a prebacteriocin of 96 amino acids with a typical sec leader, which is processed to give a mature bacteriocin of 65 amino acids. An open reading frame encoding a protein of 424 amino acids was found 68 nucleotides downstream the stop codon of pctA. The N-terminal part of this putative protein shows strong similarity with the ATP-binding cassette of prokaryotic and eukaryotic ABC transporters, and this protein may be involved in self-protection against propionicin T1. Propionicin T1 is the first bacteriocin from propionibacteria that has been isolated and further characterized at the molecular level.
TI  - Jenseniin G, a heat-stable bacteriocin produced by Propionibacterium jensenii P126.
AB  - The genus Propionibacterium includes cutaneous species typically found on human skin and the dairy or classical species (Propionibacterium freudenreichii, P. jensenii, P. thoenii, and P. acidipropionici) used industrially for the production of Swiss cheese and propionic acid. Grinstead (1989, M.S. thesis, Iowa State University, Ames) has previously observed that some dairy propionibacteria inhibit other species in the classical grouping. We further investigated the inhibitor(s) produced by P. jensenii P126 (ATCC 4872). An antagonist(s) from anaerobic agar cultures of P126 strongly inhibited two closely related strains of propionibacteria, P. acidipropionici P5 and P. jensenii P54, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus NCDO 1489, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC 4797, Lactococcus cremoris NCDO 799, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis C2. The inhibitor, designated jenseniin G, was active at pH 7.0; inactivated by treatment with pronase E, proteinase K, and type 14 protease; insensitive to catalase; and stable to freezing, cold storage (4 degrees C, 3 days), and heat (100 degrees C, 15 min). Classification of the inhibitor as a bacteriocin is supported by its proteinaceous nature and its bactericidal activity against L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC 4797. The lack of detectable plasmids suggests a chromosomal location for the determinant(s) of jenseniin G.
