TI  == resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in barbados.
AB  == resistance to third-generation, or extended-spectrum, cephalosporins caused by induction of class i beta-lactamases has been reported rarely from developing countries. seven isolates of cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative rods were recovered recently from urine, burns and ulcers in the queen elizabeth hospital,  barbados. the isolates were identified as acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2), citrobacter freundii (1), enterobacter cloacae (1), morganella morganii (1), providencia stuartii (1) and proteus sp. (1). induction of beta-lactamase by cefoxitin was demonstrated, and minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by agar dilution. beta-lactamases were demonstrated by isoelectric focusing; the presence of chromosomal beta-lactamases was confirmed in at least three of the resistant isolates. the only antibiotics which were uniformly active against these resistant strains were imipenem and ciprofloxacin. these data confirm the existence of resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins in barbados, and emphasise the necessity for continuous surveillance of resistance patterns in the caribbean region.

TI  == antibody coated bacteria in urine of patients with recent spinal injury.
AB  == twenty patients with an acute spinal injury were prospectively studied to assess  the clinical importance of antibody coated bacteria (acb) in the urine and the association among the different bacterial species with a positive antibody coated bacteria test. clinical urinary tract infection was associated with a positive acb test on 45% of occasions. three hundred and ninety nine urine samples containing 541 bacterial isolates were assessed for the presence of acb; 13% were found to be positive and 87% negative for acb; 67% of urines contained a single bacterial isolate. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most commonly associated with clinical urinary tract infection, found in 25% of episodes, followed by proteus mirabilis (17.5%), klebsiella sp (12.5%), and proteus morganii (10%). providencia stuartii, however, was most commonly associated with a positive acb test (found in 17%). other bacteria associated with a positive acb test included klebsiella sp (14%), acinetobacter sp (12.5%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), citrobacter sp  (11.5%). a positive acb test is not to be expected from a patient with spinal injury who has a catheter in place, and the test may provide a useful guide to identify those patients with an invasive infection. it is doubtful that a decision to treat or not treat bacteriuria could rest on the identification of the bacterial species alone.

TI  == in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == fatty acid composition of paracolons: arizona, citrobacter, and providencia.
AB  == the fatty acid compositions of stationary-phase cultures of arizona arizonae, citrobacter freundii, providencia alcalifaciens, providencia stuartii, and providencia sp. were studied. the major fatty acids of a. arizonae, c. freundii,  and providencia were 16:0, 16:1, 17:cyclopropane, and 19:cyclopropane. the fatty  acid compositions of the two strains of a. arizonae examined were similar to each other, but the three strains of c. freundii differed from one another in their fatty acid compositions. in both a. arizonae and c. freundii, the relative quantities of saturated, unsaturated, and cyclopropane fatty acids were similar to those which have been found in stationary-phase cultures of other members of the enterobacteriaceae. the three strains of providencia also differed from one another in their fatty acid compositions. in all three strains, the total quantity of unsaturated fatty acids was larger and that of the cyclopropane fatty acids was smaller than those found in stationary-phase cultures of other enteric  bacteria.
