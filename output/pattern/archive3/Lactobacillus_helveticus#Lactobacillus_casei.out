selected adjunct cultures remarkably increase the content of bioactive peptides in bulgarian white brined cheese.
some lactic acid bacteria strains in milk media are capable of releasing bioactive peptides. in this study, we evaluated the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace)inhibitory activity of 180 lactic acid bacteria and selected several lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and l. casei strains that demonstrated strong ace-inhibitory activity. the aim was to carry out a molecular study on the bioactive peptides released by the strains with the best ace-inhibitory properties and by the strains demonstrating a calcium-binding effect. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of bioactive peptides in bulgarian white cheese. peptides with the strongest ace-inhibitory activity were purified and sequenced. the strains were assessed for production of peptides with calcium-binding properties. these peptides were isolated, purified and sequenced. two strains releasing bioactive peptides with the strongest ace-inhibitory and calcium-binding activities were selected for development of cheese starters. the strain with the best ace-inhibitory activity was l. helveticus a1, which releases the peptide ala-leu-pro-met as a main contributor to the ace inhibition. the strain with the best calcium-binding activity was l. casei c3 releasing the peptide splspspspe (fraction 15-20 of ss-casein) as a main contributor to calcium binding. after pilot production of cheeses with the developed starters, the ace-inhibitory and calcium-binding effects were confirmed during the cheese ripening. the addition of the two selected adjunct cultures led to increased production of bioactive peptides in the cheese. in this way, it is possible to increase the functional properties of bulgarian white brined cheese.
bacteriocin pj4 active against enteric pathogen produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4 isolated from gut microflora of wistar rat (rattus norvegicus): partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin.
the increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the restriction on the use antibiotics due to its side effects have drawn attention to the search for possible alternatives. bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by numerous bacteria. much interest has been focused on bacteriocins because they exhibit inhibitory activity against pathogens. lactic acid bacteria possess the ability to synthesize antimicrobial compounds (like bacteriocin) during their growth. in this study, an antibacterial substance (bacteriocin pj4) produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4, isolated from rat gut microflora, was identified as bacteriocin. it was effective against wide assay of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria involved in various diseases, including escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. the antimicrobial peptide was relatively heat-resistant and also active over a wide ph range of 2-10. it has been partially purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation and size exclusion chromatography and checked on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of bacteriocin pj4 purified through size exclusion chromatography resolved ~6.5 kda protein with bacteriocin activity. the peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, and lipase but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, and pepsin. it showed a bactericidal mode of action against the indicator strains e. coli mtcc443, lactobacillus casei mtcc1423, and e. faecalis dt48. such characteristics indicate that this bacteriocin may be a potential candidate for alternative agents to control important pathogens.
isolation and preliminary probiotic selection of lactobacilli from koumiss in inner mongolia.
from 16 samples of traditional fermented koumiss collected in inner mongolia autonomous region of china, forty-eight lactobacilli strains were isolated and phenotypically characterized by their abilities to ferment different carbohydrates and by additional biochemical tests. the dominant lactobacilli species were identified as l. casei (17 strains), l. helveticus (10 strains) and l. plantarum (8 strains), with a lower frequency of isolation for l. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis (5 strains), l. paracasei (3 strains), l. kefiranofaciens (2 strains), l. curvatus (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and w. kandleri (1 strain). the ph values of all these samples were ranging from 3.37 to 3.94. in isolates, l. casei zhang, l. helveticus zl12-1, and l. plantarum bx6-6 were selected as potentially probiotic strains through the preliminary tests including resistance to low acid, abilities to grow in mrs with bile salts, antimicrobial activities and the viabilities during prolonged cold storage in fermented milk. moreover 16s rdna was conducted to confirm the identification.
evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.
effect of milk fermented with a lactobacillus helveticus r389(+) proteolytic strain on the immune system and on the growth of 4t1 breast cancer cells in mice.
previous studies on a murine model have demonstrated that the administration of lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus casei inhibits the development of fibrosarcoma and colon carcinoma, respectively. the aim of this work was to study the beneficial effects of the consumption of milk fermented by l. helveticus on a murine model for mammary carcinoma. female balb/c mice were challenged by a single subcutaneous injection of tumoral cells (american type culture collection 4t1) in the left mammary gland. prior to tumour injection, mice were fed for two, five or seven consecutive days with fermented milk. the following factors were monitored for 2 months: rate of tumour development, histological studies, apoptosis, phagocytic index, peritoneal macrophages, determination of beta-glucuronidase enzyme in peritoneal macrophages, determination of gamma-interferon (infgamma) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) in blood serum, determination of cd4+, cd8+, interleukin-6 (il-6), il-10, tnf-alpha and infgamma by immunoperoxidase, and measurement of beta-glucuronidase activity in intestinal fluid. the administration of l. helveticus delayed the development of the tumour in all cases, a 2- or 7-day feeding period being most effective. this work demonstrates that milk fermented with l. helveticus decreases the growth rate of mammary tumours. the effect was mediated by increased apoptosis and decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular il-6, implicated in oestrogen synthesis.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
antimicrobial compounds from lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus helveticus.
three strains of lactobacillus casei and one of lactobacillus helveticus were examined for antagonistic activity toward twenty five indicator strains of different species. under conditions eliminating the effects of organic acid and hydrogen peroxide, culture supernatants of all the lactobacillus strains exhibited a wide spectrum of inhibitory activity toward microorganisms of different genera. the inhibitory compound secreted by one strain of l. casei was active against clostridium tyrobutyricum. the active components were insensitive to proteolytic enzyme and heat treatment.
[bacteriocin typing of lactobacillus cultures using a basic set of bacteriocinogenic strains].
lactic bacilli of 15 species were divided into 78 bacteriocin types by their sensitivity spectra with respect to the main set of the bacteriocinogenic strains. l. acidophilus-l. salivarious, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. buchneri, l. helveticus, l. lactis and l. leichmannii were used in the study. the cultures were divided into 30, 9, 7, 25, 5, 20, 13, 8, 2.2 and 2 bacteriocin types respectively. the method of determining the lactic bacilli sensitivity spectra to 8 bacteriocinogenic strains of the main kit is simple and economic. it allows marking of lactic bacilli and their dividing into bacteriocin types within the species. this may be used in taxonomy and epidemiological studies.
[sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
sensitivity of 278 cultures of thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. it was shown that all cultures of l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii and 94.1 per cent of l. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. the cultures of l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.
[sensitivity of the lactobacilli of the subgenus streptobacterium to bacteriocins of lactobacilli of different species].
sensitivity of 167 cultures of lactobacilli of streptobacterium to 39 bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. jugurti, l. salivarius, l. lactis, l. helveticus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermenti, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied. it was found that the cultures of l. casei were sensitive to 30 types of bacteriocins, while the cultures of l. plantarum were sensitive to 9 bacteriocin types. 89.6 per cent of the cultures of l. casei and all cultures of l. plantarum were sensitive to one or several bacteriocins produced by lactobacilli of different species.
