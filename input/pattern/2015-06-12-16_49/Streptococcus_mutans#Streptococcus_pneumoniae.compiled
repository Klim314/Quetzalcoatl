TI  - Antibacterial effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine monomers against Streptococcus pneumoniae via inhibiting pneumococcal histidine kinase (VicK).
AB  - Two-component systems (TCSs) have the potential to be an effective target of the  antimicrobials, and thus received much attention in recent years. VicK/VicR is one of TCSs in Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), which is essential for pneumococcal survival. We have previously obtained several Traditional Chinese Medicine monomers using a computer-based screening. In this study, either alone or in combination with penicillin, their antimicrobial activities were evaluated based on in vivo and in vitro assays. The results showed that the MICs of 5'-(Methylthio)-5'-deoxyadenosine, octanal 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, deoxyshikonin, kavahin, and dodecyl gallate against S. pneumoniae were 37.1, 38.5, 17, 68.5, and 21 mug/mL, respectively. Time-killing assays showed that these compounds elicited bactericidal effects against S. pneumoniae D39 strain, which led to a 6-log reduction in CFU after exposure to compounds at four times of the MIC for 24 h. The five compounds inhibited the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans or Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, meanwhile, deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate displayed strong inhibitory activities against Staphylococcus aureus. These compounds showed no obvious cytotoxicity effects on Vero cells. Survival time of the mice infected by S. pneumoniae strains was prolonged by the treatment with the compounds. Importantly, all of the five compounds exerted antimicrobial effects against multidrug-resistant clinical strains of S. pneumoniae. Moreover, even at sub-MIC concentration, they inhibited cell division and biofilm formation. The five compounds all have enhancement effect on penicillin. Deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate showed significantly synergic antimicrobial activity with penicillin in vivo and in vitro, and effectively reduced nasopharyngeal and lung colonization caused by different penicillin-resistant pneumococcal serotypes. In addition, the two compounds also showed synergic antimicrobial activity with erythromycin and tetracycline. Taken together, our results suggest that these novel VicK inhibitors may be promising compounds against the pneumococcus, including penicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - Platelet activation is a key event in the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections.
AB  - Diverse Streptococcus species including Streptococcus Pneumoniae, Sanguis, Gordonii, Mitis and Mutans cause life-threatening conditions including pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis. These diseases bear a high morbidity and mortality and for this reason, understanding the key events in the pathogenesis of these infections have a great significance in their prevention and/or treatment. Here, we describe as how the activation of the platelets and their affinity to bind to bacterial proteins act as early key events in the pathogenesis of Streptococcal infections.
TI  - Synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Solanum trilobatum fruits extract and its antibacterial, cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer cell line MCF 7.
AB  - In the present study, we have synthesized silver nanoparticles by a simple and eco-friendly method using unripe fruits of Solanum trilobatum. The aqueous silver ions when exposed to unripe fruits extract were reduced and stabilized over long time resulting in biosynthesis of surface functionalized silver nanoparticles. The bio-reduced silver nanoparticles were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). These biologically synthesized silver nanoparticles were tested for its antibacterial activity against few human pathogenic bacteria including Gram-positive (Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. In addition, we also demonstrated anticancer activity of these nanoparticles in vitro against human breast cancer cell line (MCF 7) using MTT, nuclear morphology assay, Western blot and RT-PCR expression. These results taken together show the potential applications of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles using S. trilobatum fruits.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using ethanolic petals extract of Rosa indica and characterization of its antibacterial, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - The present study was aimed at biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using ethanolic extract of rose (Rosa indica) petals and testing their potential antibacterial activity using selective human pathogenic microbes, anticancer activity using human colon adenocarcinoma cancer cell line HCT 15 as well as anti-inflammatory activity using rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. The biologically synthesized AgNPs were also characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The characterized AgNPs showed an effective antibacterial activity against Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) than Gram positive (Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis) bacteria. MTT assay, analysis of nuclear morphology, mRNA expression of Bcl-2, Bax and protein expression of caspase 3 as well as 9, indicated potential anticancer activity. In addition, green synthesized AgNPs also attenuated cytotoxicity, nuclear morphology and free radical generation (O2(-) and NO) by rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. The results of our study show the potential green synthesis of silver nanoparticles in mitigating their toxicity while retaining their antibacterial activities.
TI  - In vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  - Lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Recent studies have indicated that Streptococcus mutans, Clostridium perfringens, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. However, the previous studies mainly focused on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. This study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. The prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. The screening assays identified 35 species with the ability to utilize lactulose, of which Cronobacter sakazakii, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. In addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found. Thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.
TI  - Xylitol and its usage in ENT practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Xylitol is a five-carbon sugar alcohol. Natural sources of xylitol include plums, strawberries and raspberries. Xylitol is commercially available in chewing gums, lozenges, syrups, nasal sprays, toothpastes, mouthwashes and other products in some countries. It has gained relative prominence in the past decade as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent. OBJECTIVE: A review of contemporary literature was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of xylitol usage in ENT practice. METHOD: The English-language literature was searched using the following terms: xylitol, otitis media, nasal, sinusitis, dental caries and preventive therapy. The articles identified were included in this review. RESULTS: Xylitol has no antibacterial properties of its own; rather, it appears to enhance the body's own innate immunity. Xylitol has anti-adhesive effects on micro-organisms like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, inhibiting their growth. Xylitol has already been used for preventing otitis media, rhinosinusitis and dental caries. The worldwide spread of drug-resistant strains of pneumococci substantiates the need for new approaches to prevent ENT-related infectious diseases. CONCLUSION: Xylitol may be a promising agent for this purpose in ENT practice, but further experimental and clinical studies are required.
TI  - Effective oral health in infective endocarditis: efficacy of high-street mouthwashes against the viridans group streptococci.
AB  - AIM: Recent UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines state that there is no longer a need for oral antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing dental procedures who are at risk of infective endocarditis (IE), and advocate the importance of maintaining good oral health. As viridans group streptococci (VGS) are common etiological agents of IE and inhabitants of the mouth, the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of common high-street mouthwashes against four classes of VGS organisms (salivarius, mitis, anginosus, and mutans groupings). METHODS: The survival of VGS, Streptococcus gordonii (National Collection of Type Cultures [NCTC] 7865), Streptococcus intermedius (NCTC 11324), Streptococcus mutans (NCTC 10449), Streptococcus oralis (NCTC 11427), Streptococcus pneumoniae (NCTC 7465, NCTC 7978, & American Type Culture Collection 49619) and Streptococcus salivarius (NCTC 8618) was assessed in vitro following treatment of approximately 10(7) c.f.u. in planktonic state with four mouthwashes. RESULTS: No organisms were culturable following 1-min exposure, and were not recovered following non-selective enrichment following incubation in Brain Heart Infusion broth supplemented with 0.8% (w/v) yeast extract. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that such mouthwashes are able to completely kill VGS organisms tested in planktonic solution, where their use would promote good oral hygiene in patients at risk of IE.
TI  - Site-directed mutations in the lanthipeptide mutacin 1140.
AB  - The oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans, strain JH1140, produces the antibiotic mutacin 1140. Mutacin 1140 belongs to a group of antibiotics called lanthipeptides. More specifically, mutacin 1140 is related to the epidermin type A(I) lanthipeptides. Mutagenesis experiments of this group of lanthipeptides have been primarily restricted to the posttranslationally modified meso-lanthionine and 3-methyllanthionine residues. Site-directed mutagenesis of the core peptide of mutacin 1140 was performed using the suicide vector pVA891. Substitutions of the N-terminal residue, the charged residue in the hinge region, and residues in ring A and intertwined rings C and D were investigated. A truncation and insertion of residues in ring A and intertwined rings C and D were also performed to determine whether or not they would alter the antimicrobial activity of the producing strain. Bioassays revealed that five of 14 mutants studied had improved antimicrobial activity against the indicator strain Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240. MICs against Streptococcus mutans UA159, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 27336, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Clostridium difficile UK1, and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240 were determined for three mutacin 1140 variants that had the most significant increases in bioactivity in the M. luteus bioassay. This mutagenesis study of the epidermin group of lanthipeptides shows that antimicrobial activity can be significantly improved.
TI  - Insight into the evolution of the histidine triad protein (HTP) family in Streptococcus.
AB  - The Histidine Triad Proteins (HTPs), also known as Pht proteins in Streptococcus  pneumoniae, constitute a family of surface-exposed proteins that exist in many pathogenic streptococcal species. Although many studies have revealed the importance of HTPs in streptococcal physiology and pathogenicity, little is known about their origin and evolution. In this study, after identifying all htp homologs from 105 streptococcal genomes representing 38 different species/subspecies, we analyzed their domain structures, positions in genome, and most importantly, their evolutionary histories. By further projecting this information onto the streptococcal phylogeny, we made several major findings. First, htp genes originated earlier than the Streptococcus genus and gene-loss events have occurred among three streptococcal groups, resulting in the absence of the htp gene in the Bovis, Mutans and Salivarius groups. Second, the copy number of htp genes in other groups of Streptococcus is variable, ranging from one to four functional copies. Third, both phylogenetic evidence and domain structure analyses support the division of two htp subfamilies, designated as htp I and htp II. Although present mainly in the pyogenic group and in Streptococcus suis, htp II members are distinct from htp I due to the presence of an additional leucine-rich-repeat domain at the C-terminus. Finally, htp genes exhibit a faster nucleotide substitution rate than do housekeeping genes. Specifically, the regions outside the HTP domains are under strong positive selection. This distinct evolutionary pattern likely helped Streptococcus to easily escape from recognition by host immunity.
TI  - Microparticles containing propolis and metronidazole: in vitro characterization,  release study and antimicrobial activity against periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Ethylcellulose microparticles containing metronidazole and propolis extractive solution were prepared and evaluated in vitro against periodontal pathogens. Scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis, drug entrapment efficiency and drug release of microparticles were determined. The antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of periodontal importance (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli). It was obtained particles with regular morphology, mean diameter of 1.23 microm, and entrapment efficiency for propolis and metronidazole were 91.41% and 22.23%, respectively. In vitro release studies of propolis and metronidazole from microparticles showed prolonged drug release and controlled by Fickian diffusion. Both propolis and metronidazole displayed activity against the tested strains. Moreover, the results showed that the strains of E. faecalis, S. pyogenes and S. mutans were more susceptible to the propolis and E. faecalis to the metronidazole. It was also observed that the amount of metronidazole to inhibit the microorganism strains in the physical mixture with propolis was smaller than in the metronidazole alone, suggesting potentiation effect between propolis and metronidazole. These microparticles would be useful for developing intermediary or eventual dosage form to be administered into the periodontal pocket more easily and safely.
TI  - Cryptic Streptococcus mutans 5.6-kb plasmids encode a toxin-antitoxin system for  plasmid stabilization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In all Streptococcus mutans strains, 5-13% carry a 5.6-kb plasmid. Despite its frequency, little is known about its mediated functions with most of the information coming from a single study focussing on plasmid pUA140. OBJECTIVE: Here, we describe the sequence and genetic organization of two S. mutans 5.6-kb plasmids, pDC09 and pNC101. RESULTS: Based on PicoGreen dsDNA quantification and Real-Time quantitative PCR (RTQ-PCR), the plasmid copy number was found to range between 10 and 74, depending on the strain tested. In contrast to literature, we identified six instead of five open reading frames (ORFs). While the putative gene products of ORF1 (as a Rep-protein) and ORF2 (as a Mob-protein) could be confirmed as being identical to those from pUA140, the functions of ORF3 (unknown) and ORF 4 (possibly AtpE homologue) could not be further revealed. However, the product of ORF5 showed a fairly high identity (38-50%) and structural similarity (58-74%) to RelE of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus equi, and Streptococcus downei. In addition, we identified a functionally corresponding ORF6 encoding a protein with 61-68% identity (81-86% similarity) to the S. equi and S. downei antitoxin of the RelB family. RelE and RelB together form a plasmid-encoded toxin-antitoxin (TA) system, RelBE(plas). Despite its rather limited sequence similarity with chromosomal TA systems in S. mutans (RelBE(chro), MazEF, HicBA), we found similar tertiary structures applying I-Tasser protein prediction analysis. CONCLUSION: Type II-toxins, as the plasmid-encoded RelE, are RNA endonucleases. Depending on their mRNA cleavage activity, they might 1) kill every plasmid-free progeny, thereby stabilizing plasmid transfer at the expense of the host and/or 2) help S. mutans enter a dormant state and survive unfavourable environmental conditions. Whilst a function in plasmid stabilization has been confirmed, a function in persistence under nutritional stress, tested here by inducing amino acid starvation, could not be demonstrated so far.
TI  - Anti-viral and anti-bacterial activities of an extract of blackcurrants (Ribes nigrum L.).
AB  - The inhibitory effects of an extract of the blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum L.) against pathogens associated with oral, nasopharyngeal and upper respiratory infectious diseases; namely respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus A and B (IFV-A and IFV-B), adenovirus (AdV), herpes simplex virus type 1, Haemophilus influenzae type B, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, were investigated. Less than 1% concentration of extract of blackcurrant inhibited replication of RSV, IFV-A and -B and HSV-1 by over 50% and a 10% extract inhibited adsorption of these viruses onto the cell surface by over 95%. The effects on AdV were much less pronounced; the half minimal inhibitory concentration of AdV replication was 2.54 +/- 0.26, and a 10% concentration of the extract inhibited AdV adsorption on the cell surface by 72.9 +/- 3.4%. The antibacterial activities of the blackcurrant were evaluated based on its efficacy as a disinfectant. A 10% extract disinfected 99.8% of H. Influenzae type B and 78.9% of S. pneumoniae in 10 min, but had no demonstrable effect against S. mutans. The blackcurrant extract still showed antiviral and antibacterial activities after the pH had been made neutral with sodium hydroxide, suggesting that these activities are not the result of acidic reactions or of components precipitated at a neutral pH. These findings demonstrate the potential of blackcurrant extract as a functional food for oral care.
TI  - UV-C-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  - AIM: Previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. LED curing lights (315-400 nm) and other UV lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. We examined the effect of UV-C light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy UV-A light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. METHODS: Twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus australis, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguinis. These organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal UV-C radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before UV-C exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal UV-C exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to UV-C light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. Given that UV-C is more toxic and mutagenic than UV-A light, it is unlikely than UV-A light would yield any difference in response to such exposure.
TI  - SpxA1 involved in hydrogen peroxide production, stress tolerance and endocarditis virulence in Streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguinis is one of the most common agents of infective endocarditis. Spx proteins are a group of global regulators that negatively or positively control global transcription initiation. In this study, we characterized the spxA1 gene in S. sanguinis SK36. The spxA1 null mutant displayed opaque colony morphology, reduced hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production, and reduced antagonistic activity against Streptococcus mutans UA159 relative to the wild type strain. The DeltaspxA1 mutant also demonstrated decreased tolerance to high temperature, acidic and oxidative stresses. Further analysis revealed that DeltaspxA1 also exhibited a approximately 5-fold reduction in competitiveness in an animal model of endocarditis. Microarray studies indicated that expression of several oxidative stress genes was downregulated in the DeltaspxA1 mutant. The expression of spxB and nox was significantly decreased in the DeltaspxA1 mutant compared with the wild type. These results indicate that spxA1 plays a major role in H(2)O(2) production, stress tolerance and endocarditis virulence in S. sanguinis SK36. The second spx gene, spxA2, was also found in S. sanguinis SK36. The spxA2 null mutant was found to be defective for growth under normal conditions and showed sensitivity to high temperature, acidic and oxidative stresses.
TI  - The cryptic competence pathway in Streptococcus pyogenes is controlled by a peptide pheromone.
AB  - Horizontal gene transfer is an important means of bacterial evolution that is facilitated by transduction, conjugation, and natural genetic transformation. Transformation occurs after bacterial cells enter a state of competence, where naked DNA is acquired from the extracellular environment. Induction of the competent state relies on signals that activate master regulators, causing the expression of genes involved in DNA uptake, processing, and recombination. All streptococcal species contain the master regulator SigX and SigX-dependent effector genes required for natural genetic transformation; however, not all streptococcal species have been shown to be naturally competent. We recently demonstrated that competence development in Streptococcus mutans requires the type II ComRS quorum-sensing circuit, comprising an Rgg transcriptional activator and a novel peptide pheromone (L. Mashburn-Warren, D. A. Morrison, and M. J. Federle, Mol. Microbiol. 78:589-606, 2010). The type II ComRS system is shared by the pyogenic, mutans, and bovis streptococci, including the clinically relevant pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Here, we describe the activation of sigX by a small-peptide pheromone and an Rgg regulator of the type II ComRS class. We confirm previous reports that SigX is functional and able to activate sigX-dependent gene expression within the competence regulon, and that SigX stability is influenced by the cytoplasmic protease ClpP. Genomic analyses of available S. pyogenes genomes revealed the presence of intact genes within the competence regulon. While this is the first report to show natural induction of sigX, S. pyogenes remained nontransformable under laboratory conditions. Using radiolabeled DNA, we demonstrate that transformation is blocked at the stage of DNA uptake.
TI  - Lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by Gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. Lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. However, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of Gram positive pathogens, including strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus uberis and Enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. It is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. Here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.
TI  - Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabK) from Streptococcus mutans strain UA159.
AB  - A triclosan-resistant flavoprotein termed FabK is the sole enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans. In this study, FabK from S. mutans strain UA159 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized. Diffraction data were collected to 2.40 A resolution using a synchrotron-radiation source. The crystal belonged to space group P6(2), with unit-cell parameters a = b = 105.79, c = 44.15 A. The asymmetric unit contained one molecule, with a corresponding V(M) of 2.05 A(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 39.9%.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Genome-wide essential gene identification in Streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  - A clear perception of gene essentiality in bacterial pathogens is pivotal for identifying drug targets to combat emergence of new pathogens and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, for synthetic biology, and for understanding the origins of life. We have constructed a comprehensive set of deletion mutants and systematically identified a clearly defined set of essential genes for Streptococcus sanguinis. Our results were confirmed by growing S. sanguinis in minimal medium and by double-knockout of paralogous or isozyme genes. Careful examination revealed that these essential genes were associated with only three basic categories of biological functions: maintenance of the cell envelope, energy production, and processing of genetic information. Our finding was subsequently validated in two other pathogenic streptococcal species, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans and in two other gram-positive pathogens, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Our analysis has thus led to a simplified model that permits reliable prediction of gene essentiality.
TI  - Characterization of NrnA homologs from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycoplasma  pneumoniae.
AB  - Processive RNases are unable to degrade efficiently very short oligonucleotides,  and they are complemented by specific enzymes, nanoRNases, that assist in this process. We previously identified NrnA (YtqI) from Bacillus subtilis as a bifunctional protein with the ability to degrade nanoRNA (RNA oligos </=5 nucleotides) and to dephosphorylate 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (pAp) to AMP. While the former activity is analogous to that of oligoribonuclease (Orn) from Escherichia coli, the latter corresponds to CysQ. NrnA homologs are widely present in bacterial and archaeal genomes. They are found preferably in genomes that lack Orn or CysQ homologs. Here, we characterize NrnA homologs from important human pathogens, Mpn140 from Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Rv2837c from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Like NrnA, these enzymes degrade nanoRNA and dephosphorylate pAp in vitro. However, they show dissimilar preferences for specific nanoRNA substrate lengths. Whereas NrnA prefers RNA 3-mers with a 10-fold higher specific activity compared to 5-mers, Rv2837c shows a preference for nanoRNA of a different length, namely, 2-mers. Mpn140 degrades Cy5-labeled nanoRNA substrates in vitro with activities varying within one order of magnitude as follows: 5-mer>4-mer>3-mer>2-mer. In agreement with these in vitro activities, both Rv2837c and Mpn140 can complement the lack of their functional counterparts in E. coli: CysQ and Orn. The NrnA homolog from Streptococcus mutans, SMU.1297, was previously shown to hydrolyze pAp and to complement an E. coli cysQ mutant. Here, we show that SMU.1297 can complement an E. coli orn(-) mutant, suggesting that having both pAp-phosphatase and nanoRNase activity is a common feature of NrnA homologs.
TI  - Effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and Actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. Poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of oral microorganisms. OBJECTIVES: To examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. Co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. RESULTS: Nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. All tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. The co-aggregation of Streptococcus oralis with A. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. The per cent co-aggregation of S. oralis with A. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.
TI  - The Streptococcus sanguinis competence regulon is not required for infective endocarditis virulence in a rabbit model.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguinis is an important component of dental plaque and a leading  cause of infective endocarditis. Genetic competence in S. sanguinis requires a quorum sensing system encoded by the early comCDE genes, as well as late genes controlled by the alternative sigma factor, ComX. Previous studies of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans have identified functions for the >100-gene com regulon in addition to DNA uptake, including virulence. We investigated this possibility in S. sanguinis. Strains deleted for the comCDE or comX master regulatory genes were created. Using a rabbit endocarditis model in conjunction with a variety of virulence assays, we determined that both mutants possessed infectivity equivalent to that of a virulent control strain, and that measures of disease were similar in rabbits infected with each strain. These results suggest that the com regulon is not required for S. sanguinis infective endocarditis virulence in this model. We propose that the different roles of the S. sanguinis, S. pneumoniae, and S. mutans com regulons in virulence can be understood in relation to the pathogenic mechanisms employed by each species.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of novel silver(I) tris(pyrazolyl)methanesulfonate and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphadamantane complexes.
AB  - Five new silver(I) complexes of formulas [Ag(Tpms)] (1), [Ag(Tpms)(PPh(3))] (2),  [Ag(Tpms)(PCy(3))] (3), [Ag(PTA)][BF(4)] (4), and [Ag(Tpms)(PTA)] (5) {Tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, PPh(3) = triphenylphosphane, PCy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, PTA = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)H, (13)C, and (31)P NMR, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and IR spectroscopic techniques. The single crystal X-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the Tpms ligand acting in the N(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a N(2)O-coordination is found, with the SO(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant free pyrazolyl ring. Features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. A detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. They were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619), Streptococcus pyogenes (SF37), Streptococcus sanguinis (SK36), Streptococcus mutans (UA159), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and the fungus Candida albicans (ATCC 24443). Complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. Interaction of Ag complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (EB) as a fluorescence probe of DNA. The decrease in the fluorescence of DNA-EB system on addition of Ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of DNA-EB complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. Complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (A375) with an activity often higher than that of AgNO(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on DNA, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > AgNO(3)>> 4.
TI  - Exploring internal features of 16S rRNA gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. The genus has been divided into different groups based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. The variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. The present study was taken up to explore 16S rRNA gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus Streptococcus. METHODS: 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to the isolates of S. dysgalactiae, S. equi, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, S. gallolyticus, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, S. thermophilus and S. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. RESULTS: The framework based analysis was used to segregate Streptococcus spp. previously identified upto genus level. This segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized Streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. CONCLUSIONS: The markers generated exploring 16S rRNA gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus Streptococcus.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans GlnK protein: an unusual PII family member.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is a Gram-positive bacterium present in the oral cavity, and is considered to be one of the leading causes of dental caries. S. mutans has a glnK gene, which codes for a PII-like protein that is possibly involved in the integration of carbon, nitrogen and energy metabolism in several organisms. To characterize the GlnK protein of S. mutans, the glnK gene was amplified by PCR, and cloned into the expression vectors pET29a(+) and pET28b(+). The native GlnK-Sm was purified by anion exchange (Q-Sepharose) and affinity (Hi-Trap Heparin) chromatography. The GlnK-His-Sm protein was purified using a Hi-Trap Chelating-Ni2+ column. The molecular mass of the GlnK-His-Sm proteins was 85 kDa as determined by gel filtration, indicating that this protein is a hexamer in solution. The GlnK-His-Sm protein is not uridylylated by the Escherichia coli GlnD protein. The activities of the GlnK-Sm and GlnK-His-Sm proteins were assayed in E. coli constitutively expressing the Klebsiella pneumoniae nifLA operon. In K. pneumoniae, NifL inhibits NifA activity in the presence of high ammonium levels and the GlnK protein is required to reduce the inhibition of NifL in the presence of low ammonium levels. The GlnK-Sm protein was unable to reduce NifL inhibition of NifA protein. Surprisingly, the GlnK-His-Sm protein was able to partially reduce NifL inhibition of the NifA protein under nitrogen-limiting conditions, in a manner similar to the GlnK protein of E. coli. These results suggested that S. mutans GlnK is functionally different from E. coli PII proteins.
TI  - Streptococcus
AB  - The genus Streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of Gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. Various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. Among the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. Streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. The nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. For several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: S pyogenes (group A streptococci) and S pneumoniae (pneumococci). In 1984, two members were assigned a new genus - the group D enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became Enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and E faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). In recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. A variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. Some of the other medically important streptococci are S agalactiae (group B), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease; E faecalis (group D), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. Particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. Important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include S mutans and S sanguis (involved in dental caries), S mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "S milleri" (associated with suppurative infections in children and adults). There remains persistent taxonomic confusion regarding "S milleri." These and other streptococci of medical importance are listed inTable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci in viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. However, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (CF) airways has not yet been examined. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (VGS), in terms of MICs and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs). METHODS: The MICs of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the QRDRs for 190 isolates of VGS, originating from the sputa of adult CF patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. VGS organisms included Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus australis and Streptococcus mutans. Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and QRDRs within the gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs >/=8 mg/L) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (MICs 4 mg/L). As a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive VGS organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-CF patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. Five novel QRDR PCR assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the CF VGS population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential QRDR resistance mutations. Double mutations in gyrA and parC/parE led to MICs of 16 to >64 mg/L, while single mutations in parC or parE resulted in MICs of 8-32 mg/L and 8 mg/L, respectively. The mean homologies of each species to Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 were: gyrA, 70.3%-95%; gyrB, 69.6%-96.2%; parC, 76.1%-94.8%; and parE, 70.7%-94.7%. The close relatives of S. pneumoniae, S. mitis and S. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of P. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with CF may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal VGS flora, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the Streptococcus milleri group.
TI  - Proposal of protocols using D-glutamine to optimize the 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenly)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) assay for indirect estimation of microbial loads in biofilms of medical importance.
AB  - Due to technical problems, biofilm biomasses are difficult to be precisely determined. One reliable strategy is based on the colorimetry of formazan compounds derived from tetrazolium salt reduction. XTT presents some desirable properties that make the biofilm measurements easier. However, cells entrapped within the extracellular matrixes normally do not metabolize the tetrazolium equally, leading to underestimation of cell contents. This study evaluated the effectiveness of D-glutamine, a plerotic substrate of tricarboxilic acid cycle (TAC), as inducer of XTT reduction. The metabolic activities of aerobic and anaerobic 48 h-old monospecific biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC(R)27853, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC(R)13883, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC(R)12228, Streptococcus mutans ATCC(R)25175, and Candida albicans SC5314 were evaluated. Results showed that D-glutamine 50 mM (for P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. epidermidis) and 25 mM (for S. mutans and C. albicans) may enhance the detection of soluble formazan in a significant manner, what becomes the XTT reduction assay more robust.
TI  - Population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (VGS) including Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
AB  - A study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (VGS) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult CF patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 12 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. cristatus, S. gordonii, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. pneumoniae, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis. The most frequently VGS organism isolated was S. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by S. mitis (36/190; 19%), S. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), S. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), S. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), S. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), S. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), S. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), S. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), S. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), S. australis (1/190; 0.5%), S. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and S. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). All, but four, patients harboured at least one VGS species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. There was no clonality at the subspecies level employing ERIC RAPD PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Overall, resistance to penicillin with all VGS was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. With regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. In addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-CF population comprising 12 individuals (50 VGS isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. In comparison, 8% and 38% of VGS isolates from non-CF individuals were resistant by disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. None of the non-CF VGS organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.
TI  - [Classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  - Viridans group streptococci (VGS) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. They reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. They can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. The diagnosis of VGS are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. Viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (Sanguinis, Mitis, Mutans, Salivarius, Anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16S rRNA sequencing. Since Streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the Mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. Genetic exchange between Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis and S.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. These mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. The cultivation of VGS usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. Observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. VGS are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. The last step in the laboratory diagnosis of VGS is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. In this review article, classification of VGS, similarities between S.pneumoniae and Mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of VGS have been discussed.
TI  - Deletion of competence-induced genes over-expressed in biofilms caused transformation deficiencies in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Previous studies identified nine genes with increased expression in Streptococcus mutans biofilms of which six possessed putative ComX promoter sequences and were homologous to competence-induced genes in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus gordonii and Bacillus subtilis. As competence increases in biofilms, a study was undertaken into the roles that these biofilm-induced genes might play in transformation. Only five of the nine gene deletions had a significant effect on transformation efficiency. Deletion of the genes for recombinase A, recA, DNA processing protein, dprA and single-stranded DNA-binding protein, ssbA, produced results comparable with those from other bacteria, supporting the contention that these proteins have similar functions in S. mutans competence. The uncharacterized genes SMU.769 and SMU.836 produced results in variance to deletion mutants of putative homologues in S. pneumoniae. Deletion of SMU.769 reduced chromosomal transformation 2.3-fold. SMU.769 belongs to a family of conserved genes induced by the competence-stimulating peptide and which have no established function. In contrast, deletion of SMU.836 reduced transformation of both plasmid and chromosomal DNA to <3%. Homology searches suggested that Smu.836 belongs to a family of competence-induced peptidoglycan hydrolases with a conserved enzyme domain and a species-variable cell-binding domain for which the best characterized member is the choline-binding protein D, CbpD, of S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Increasing competence in the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most important model organisms for studies on natural genetic transformation in bacteria. The prevalence of this gene exchange mechanism in the genus Streptococcus has not been subjected to systematic investigations, but it has been known for decades that only a few streptococcal species develop the competent state spontaneously when grown under laboratory conditions. The recent discovery of a new mechanism regulating natural transformation in Streptococcus thermophilus suggested that this property might be more widespread among streptococci than previously thought. This suspicion has been confirmed by Mashburn-Warren and co-workers, who in the current issue of Molecular Microbiology report the discovery of a novel competence-inducing pheromone that is conserved in Streptococcus mutans and a number of pyogenic streptococci.
TI  - Light insensitive silver(I) cyanoximates as antimicrobial agents for indwelling medical devices.
AB  - Ten silver(I) cyanoximates of AgL composition (L = NC-C(NO)-R, where R is electron withdrawing groups: -CN, -C(O)NR(2), -C(O)R' (alkyl), -C(O)OEt, 2-heteroaryl fragments such as 2-pyridyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 2-benzoxazolyl, 2-benzthiazolyl) were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic methods and X-ray analysis. Crystal structures of four complexes were determined and revealed the formation of two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymers of different complexity in which anions exhibit bridging or combined chelate and bridging binding modes. In these compounds, anions are in the nitroso form. All studied AgL complexes are sparingly soluble in water and are thermally stable to 150 degrees C. Synthesized compounds demonstrated remarkable insensitivity toward visible light and UV-radiation, which was explained based on their polymeric structures with multiple covalent bonds between bridging cyanoxime ligands and Ag(I) centers. All 10 silver(I) cyanoximates were tested in vitro on the subject of their antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus hirae, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium fortuitum as well as against Candida albicans in solutions, and in the solid state as pressed pellets and dried filter paper disks presoaked with solutions of AgL in DMF. Results showed pronounced antimicrobial activity for all investigated complexes. A combination of five factors: (1) light insensitivity, (2) poor water solubility, (3) high thermal stability, (4) lack of toxicity of organic ligands, and (5) in vitro antimicrobial activity allows development of silver(I) cyanoximates for medical applications. These include antimicrobial additives to acrylate glue, cured by UV-radiation, used in introduction of prosthetic joints and dental implants, and prevention of biofilm formation on several types of indwelling medical devices.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sodium citrate against Streptococcus pneumoniae and several oral bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study is to assess the antibacterial activity of sodium citrate against Streptococcus pneumoniae and several oral bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antibacterial activity was determined by broth microdilution method. The results showed that although Enterocuccus faecium OB7084 and Klebsiella pneumoniae OB7088 had high tolerance to sodium citrate, several oral bacteria including Fusobacterium nucleatum JCM8532(T) , Streptococcus mutans JCM5705(T) and Strep. pneumoniae NBRC102642(T) were susceptible. Furthermore, the bactericidal activity of sodium citrate against Strep. pneumoniae NBRC102642(T) was not influenced by pH in the range of 5.0-8.0, whereas that of sodium lactate was weakened at neutral or weak alkaline pH. When Strep. pneumoniae NBRC102642(T) was treated with sodium citrate for 2 h, many burst cells were observed. However, addition of MgCl(2) or CaCl(2) to an assay medium weakened the antimicrobial activity although ZnCl(2) or MnCl(2) did not influence. CONCLUSIONS: Independent of pH, sodium citrate inhibited the growth of oral bacteria, which suggests that the mechanism is different from that of sodium lactate. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results presented in this study would be available for understanding the antimicrobial property of sodium citrate.
TI  - Bacterial 16S sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  - Previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. In addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in pH homeostasis. The bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using Sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16S rRNA genes. Lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions. S. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated with caries progression in the overall model. Lactobacillus or S. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. Other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of Selenomonas, Neisseria, and Streptococcus mitis. Propionibacterium FMA5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. An overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the Streptococcus mitis-S. pneumoniae-S. infantis group, Corynebacterium matruchotii, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus cristatus, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eubacterium IR009, Campylobacter rectus, and Lachnospiraceae sp. C1. The relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16S rRNA gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.
TI  - Enhanced protection against nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae elicited by oral multiantigen DNA vaccines delivered in attenuated Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Developing carrier systems and choosing appropriate antigens are essential steps  in improving the safety and efficacy of Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA vaccines, which have enhanced the mucosal protection against nasopharyngeal colonization. In this study, we reconstructed a Salmonella-based balanced-lethal host-eukaryotic vector system, which was used as carrier to orally deliver the Streptococcus pneumoniae multiantigen DNA vaccines encoding psaA (pneumococcal surface adhesion A) and pspA' (N-terminal of pneumococcal surface protein A) genes. The results showed that the multiantigen DNA vaccines using the new vector system as carrier afforded better protection than the vaccination with injected intramuscularly (i.m.) against Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 colonization infection in BALB/c mice models. This finding has associated with a high level of sIgA in the nasal mucosa as well as systemic IgG antibodies and a shift toward a Th1-mediated immune response. These studies have demonstrated the feasibility and advantage of using the new Salmonella-based balanced-lethal host-eukaryotic vector system as carrier to deliver S. pneumoniae DNA vaccines.
TI  - Mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  - The oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. When this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. Generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. The mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. Several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the Streptococcus (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis) and Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, some members of both the Streptococcus and the Staphylococcus genera, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. The current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. The pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Increase in detectable opportunistic bacteria in the oral cavity of orthodontic patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to detect the opportunistic bacteria and fungi from the oral cavities of orthodontic patients and examine the ability of the organisms to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. METHODS: Opportunistic bacteria and fungi were isolated from 58 patients (orthodontic group: 42; non-orthodontic group: 16) using culture methods and were identified based on their biochemical and enzymatic profiles. Seven opportunistic and four streptococcal strains were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. RESULTS: More opportunistic bacteria and fungi were detected in the orthodontic group than in the non-orthodontic group (P < 0.05). Opportunistic bacteria adhered to saliva-coated metallic brackets to the same degree as oral streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation frequencies of opportunistic bacteria and fungi increase during orthodontic treatment, suggesting the importance of paying special attention to oral hygiene in orthodontic patients to prevent periodontal disease and the aggravation of systemic disease in immunocompromised conditions.
TI  - Peptide alarmone signalling triggers an auto-active bacteriocin necessary for genetic competence.
AB  - The induction of genetic competence is a strategy used by bacteria to increase their genetic repertoire under stressful environmental conditions. Recently, Streptococcus pneumoniae has been shown to co-ordinate the uptake of transforming DNA with fratricide via increased expression of the peptide pheromone responsible for competence induction. Here, we document that environmental stress-induced expression of the peptide pheromone competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) in the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans. We showed that CSP is involved in the stress response and determined the CSP-induced regulon in S. mutans by microarray analysis. Contrary to pneumococcus, S. mutans responds to increased concentrations of CSP by cell lysis in only a fraction of the population. We have focused on the mechanism of cell lysis and have identified a novel bacteriocin as the 'death effector'. Most importantly, we showed that this bacteriocin causes cell death via a novel mechanism of action: intracellular action against self. We have also identified the cognate bacteriocin immunity protein, which resides in a separate unlinked genetic locus to allow its differential regulation. The role of the lytic response in S. mutans competence is also discussed. Together, these findings reveal a novel autolytic pathway in S. mutans which may be involved in the dissemination of fitness-enhancing genes in the oral biofilm.
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  - The influence of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. A potassium salt of CLA (CLA-K) was tested against three Gram-positive strains ( Bacillus cereus , Staphylococcus aureus , and Streptococcus mutans ) and five Gram-negative strains ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Salmonella typhimurium , Vibrio parahemolyticus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Proteus mirabilis ). CLA-K-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the Gram-positive strains. The IC(50) value of CLA-K was 0.3 mM for B. cereus, 1.2 mM for S. aureus, and 0.3 mM for S. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mM for K. pneumoniae, 1.2 mM for P. aeruginosa, 1.8 mM for S. typhimurium, 1.8 mM for V. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mM for P. mirabilis. The CLA-K delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower CLA-K concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. All cells grown in the medium containing CLA-K contained CLA in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in Gram-positive than Gram-negative strains. Higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (LDH), protein content, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were evident in Gram-positive strains than in Gram-negative strains. These results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by CLA mediated through the lipid peroxidation of CLA in the membranes and in the medium.
TI  - Rhodomyrtone: a new candidate as natural antibacterial drug from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa.
AB  - Rhodomyrtone [6,8-dihydroxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-(3-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-9-(2-methylpropyl)-4,9 -dihydro-1H-xanthene-1,3(2H)-di-one] from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Aiton) Hassk. displayed significant antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius. Especially noteworthy was the activity against MRSA with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranging from 0.39 to 0.78 microg/ml. As shown for S. pyogenes, no surviving cells were detected within 5 and 6h after treatment with the compound at 8MBC and 4MBC concentrations, respectively. Rhodomyrtone displays no bacteriolytic activity, as determined by measurement of the optical density at 620 nm. A rhodomyrtone killing test with S. mutans using phase contrast microscopy showed that this compound caused a few morphological changes as the treated cells were slightly changed in color and bigger than the control when they were killed. Taken together, the results support the view that rhodomyrtone has a strong bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria, including major pathogens.
TI  - An ABC transporter of Streptococcus pneumoniae involved in susceptibility to vancoresmycin and bacitracin.
AB  - Vancoresmycin is a novel tetramic acid antibiotic, probably interfering with functions of the cytoplasmic membrane. To investigate its mode of action, mutants of Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibiting reduced susceptibility to vancoresmycin were isolated at a low frequency. Four of them were further examined and showed similar pleiotropic phenotypes, including reduced growth rate, early autolysis, and chain formation. In one mutant, the level of transcripts from a single locus encoding the potential ABC transporter Spr0812-Spr0813 was increased sixfold. The corresponding DNA sequence revealed a nonsense mutation (C1744T) in spr0813, leading to the formation of a truncated permease lacking 2 of the 10 predicted transmembrane helices. As demonstrated by deletion and transformation analysis and reconstructing the spr0813(C1744T) mutation in the wild-type background, this nucleotide exchange was sufficient to cause reduced susceptibility to vancoresmycin and higher amounts of spr0812-spr0813 mRNA. Mapping and reporter assays of the cognate promoter P(abc) showed that spr0812 and spr0813 are cotranscribed with a preceding small gene and that the spr0813(C1744T) mutation does not affect the activity of P(abc). Due to the similarity of Spr0812-Spr0813 to bacitracin transporters of Streptococcus mutans and Bacillus spp., the bacitracin susceptibility of spr0813 mutants was examined. Both the spr0813(C1744T) nonsense mutation and the deletion of the transporter genes led to a clearly increased sensitivity to bacitracin. Thus, the intact transporter is required for intrinsic resistance to bacitracin, whereas reduced vancoresmycin susceptibility is mediated by the truncated permease.
TI  - Effects of recombinase A deficiency on biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Recombinase A (RecA) is essential for the transformation of both  plasmid and chromosomal DNA in Streptococcus pneumoniae and is considered to be related to the SOS-response in Streptococcus mutans. METHODS: In the present study, a RecA-deficient mutant strain (RAD) was constructed by insertional inactivation of the recA gene encoding the RecA protein in strain MT8148 of S. mutans, after which the biological functions of acid tolerance and biofilm formation were investigated. RESULTS: RAD showed reduced acid tolerance and produced lower density biofilm compared with the wild-type strain. In addition, confocal microscopic observation indicated that the biofilm produced by RAD was composed of cells with significantly lower viability compared with that produced by strain MT8148. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that RecA has a relationship with biofilm formation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of five herbal extracts against multi drug resistant (MDR) strains of bacteria and fungus of clinical origin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of the crude ethanolic extracts of five plants were screened against multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans. ATCC strains of Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus bovis, Pseudimonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans were also tested. The strains that showed resistance against the maximum number of antibiotics tested were selected for an antibacterial assay. The MDR strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of Acacia nilotica, Syzygium aromaticum and Cinnamum zeylanicum, whereas they exhibited strong resistance to the extracts of Terminalia arjuna and Eucalyptus globulus. Community-acquired infections showed higher sensitivity than the nosocomial infections against these extracts. The most potent antimicrobial plant was A. nilotica (MIC range 9.75-313 microg/ml), whereas other crude plant extracts studied in this report were found to exhibit higher MIC values than A. nilotica against community acquired as well as nosocomial infection. This study concludes that A. nilotica, C. zeylanicum and S. aromaticum can be used against multidrug resistant microbes causing nosocomial and community acquired infections.
TI  - Comparison of clustered, regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPRs) in viridans streptococci (Streptococcus gordonii, S. mutans, S. sanguinis, S. thermophilus) and in S. pneumoniae.
AB  
TI  - Streptococcus mutans SMU.623c codes for a functional, metal-dependent polysaccharide deacetylase that modulates interactions with salivary agglutinin.
AB  - The genome sequence of the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans predicts the presence of two putative polysaccharide deacetylases. The first, designated PgdA in this paper, shows homology to the catalytic domains of peptidoglycan deacetylases from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Listeria monocytogenes, which are both thought to be involved in the bacterial defense mechanism against human mucosal lysozyme and are part of the CAZY family 4 carbohydrate esterases. S. mutans cells in which the pgdA gene was deleted displayed a different colony texture and a slightly increased cell surface hydrophobicity and yet did not become hypersensitive to lysozyme as shown previously for S. pneumoniae. To understand this apparent lack of activity, the high-resolution X-ray structure of S. mutans PgdA was determined; it showed the typical carbohydrate esterase 4 fold, with metal bound in a His-His-Asp triad. Analysis of the protein surface showed that an extended groove lined with aromatic residues is orientated toward the active-site residues. The protein exhibited metal-dependent de-N-acetylase activity toward a hexamer of N-acetylglucosamine. No activity was observed toward shorter chitooligosaccharides or a synthetic peptidoglycan tetrasaccharide. In agreement with the lysozyme data this would suggest that S. mutans PgdA does not act on peptidoglycan but on an as-yet-unidentified polysaccharide within the bacterial cell surface. Strikingly, the pgdA-knockout strain showed a significant increase in aggregation/agglutination by salivary agglutinin, in agreement with this gene acting as a deacetylase of a cell surface glycan.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus gordonii prophage PH15: complete genome sequence and functional analysis of phage-encoded integrase and endolysin.
AB  - Streptococcus gordonii OMZ1039, isolated from supragingival dental plaque, was found to harbour a prophage, PH15, whose excision could be induced by mitomycin treatment. Phage PH15 belongs to the Siphoviridae. The complete genome sequence of PH15 was determined. The genome was 39 136 bp in size and contained 61 ORFs. The genome of PH15 was most similar in the structural module to the temperate bacteriophages MM1 and phiNIH1.1 from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively. In strain OMZ1039, PH15 was found to reside as a prophage in the cysteinyl-tRNA gene. A plasmid, harbouring the attP site and the integrase gene downstream of a constitutive promoter, was capable of site-specific integration into the genomes of different oral streptococcal species. The phage endolysin was purified after expression in Escherichia coli and found to inhibit growth of all S. gordonii strains tested and several different streptococcal species, including the pathogens Streptococcus mutans, S. pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Purification of bacteriocin LS1 produced by human oral isolate Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, a human oral isolate with antagonistic activity against growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, and Salmonella enteritidis, probably produces more than one proteinaceous antimicrobial substance. The objective of this study was the purification of a bacteriocin, named LS1, produced by L. salivarius BGHO1. METHODS: A simple and fast procedure for bacteriocin purification was developed, consisting of reverse-phase chromatography of the ammonium sulfate precipitate of cell-free culture supernatant by fast protein liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), with the subsequent extraction of bacteriocin from the gel. RESULTS: The supernatant of L. salivarius BGHO1 culture retained its antimicrobial activity after boiling in a water bath for 15 min. Its antimicrobial activity was also maintained even after treatment for 20 min at 121 degrees C in an autoclave. Bacteriocin LS1 was purified to homogeneity. The molecular mass of bacteriocin LS1 was estimated to be approximately 10 kDa, based on tricine SDS-PAGE. During purification, another compound with antimicrobial activity, produced by L. salivarius BGHO1, was detected. The molecular mass of this compound was estimated to be approximately 5 kDa, based on tricine SDS-PAGE. CONCLUSION: Our results imply that LS1 is most probably a new bacteriocin, different from previously described bacteriocins produced by L. salivarius strains. The purification of bacteriocin LS1 enabled the further characterization of LS1 on both the molecular and genetic levels.
TI  - [The disinfecting effect of ozone on four kinds of bacteria].
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the disinfecting effect of ozone on 4 kinds of bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. METHODS: The concentration of ozone that was transmitted by ozone generator at different time was determined by using iodine titrimetric method. According to the bactericidal assay of quantitative vehicle, the bacteria on the ozonized vehicles and unozonized vehicles was washed, 50 microl eluant was seeded on the TSA plates. The TSA plates were put into the anaerobiotic incubator (90% N(2),10% CO(2),37 degrees centigrade). After 24 to 48 hours, the CFU on the plate was counted.The data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with SAS 6.12 software package. RESULTS: The sterilization effect depended on the ozone concentration and the treatment time. When the 4 kinds of bacteria were treated with 2.73 mg/L ozone for 45 minutes, there was no bacteria alive. CONCLUSIONS: Ozone has obvious disinfecting effect on the 4 kinds of bacteria and the effect is correlated with the concentration of ozone.
TI  - The utility of affinity-tags for detection of a streptococcal protein from a variety of streptococcal species.
AB  - There is no systematic examination of affinity tag utility in Gram-positive bacteria, which limits the investigation of protein function in this important group of bacteria as specific antibodies for many of native proteins are generally not available. In this study, we utilized an E. coli-streptococcal shuttle vector pVT1666 and constructed two sets of expression plasmids pVPT-CTag and pVPT-NTag, with each set containing five affinity tags (GST, GFP, HSV, T7 and Nano) that can be fused to either the C- or N-terminus of a target protein. A putative glycosyltransferase (Gtf2) essential for Fap1 glycosylation was used to demonstrate the utility of the cassettes in detection of Gtf2 fusion proteins, and the biological relevance of the proteins in our working strain Streptococcus parasanguinis. GFP and T7 tags were readily expressed in S. parasanguinis as either an N- or C-terminal fusion to Gtf2. Only the C- terminal fusion of GST and HSV were able to be identified in S. parasanguinis. The Nano tag was not detected in either E. coli or S. parasanguinis. Genetic complementation experiments indicated that all the tagged Gtf2 fusion proteins could restore the Gtf2 function in the null mutant except for the Nano-tagged Gtf2 at its N-terminal fusion. Using a T7-tagged Gtf2 fusion construct, we demonstrated that the fusion cassette is also useful in detection of the fusion tag expression in other streptococci including S. mutans, S. pneumoniae and S. sanguinis. Therefore, the expression cassettes we constructed will be a useful tool not only to investigate protein-protein interactions in Fap1 biogenesis in S. parasanguinis, but also to study protein functions in other gram-positive bacteria in which pVT1666 replicates.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) biosynthesis is essential for the maintenance of membrane structure and function in many groups of anaerobic bacteria. Like Escherichia coli, the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae produces straight-chain saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids. In E. coli UFA synthesis requires the action of two gene products, the essential isomerase/dehydratase encoded by fabA and an elongation condensing enzyme encoded by fabB. S. pneumoniae lacks both genes and instead employs a single enzyme with only an isomerase function encoded by the fabM gene. In this paper we report the construction and characterization of an S. pneumoniae 708 fabM mutant. This mutant failed to grow in complex medium, and the defect was overcome by addition of UFAs to the growth medium. S. pneumoniae fabM mutants did not produce detectable levels of monounsaturated fatty acids as determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and thin-layer chromatography analysis of the radiolabeled phospholipids. We also demonstrate that a fabM null mutant of the cariogenic organism Streptococcus mutants is a UFA auxotroph, indicating that FabM is the only enzyme involved in the control of membrane fluidity in streptococci. Finally we report that the fabN gene of Enterococcus faecalis, coding for a dehydratase/isomerase, complements the growth of S. pneumoniae fabM mutants. Taken together, these results suggest that FabM is a potential target for chemotherapeutic agents against streptococci and that S. pneumoniae UFA auxotrophs could help identify novel genes encoding enzymes involved in UFA biosynthesis.
TI  - The response regulator ComE in Streptococcus mutans functions both as a transcription activator of mutacin production and repressor of CSP biosynthesis.
AB  - In Streptococcus pneumoniae, competence and bacteriocin genes are controlled by two two-component systems, ComED and BlpRH, respectively. In Streptococcus mutans, both functions are controlled by the ComED system. Recent studies in S. mutans revealed a potential ComE binding site characterized by two 11 bp direct repeats shared by each of the bacteriocin genes responsive to the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP). Interestingly, this sequence was not found in the upstream region of the CSP structural gene comC. Since comC is suggested to be part of a CSP-responsive and ComE-dependent autoregulatory loop, it was of interest to determine how it was possible that the ComED system could simultaneously regulate bacteriocin expression and natural competence. Using the intergenic region IGS1499, shared by the CSP-responsive bacteriocin nlmC and comC, it was demonstrated that both genes are likely to be regulated by a bifunctional ComE. In a comE null mutant, comC gene expression was increased similarly to a fully induced wild-type. In contrast, nlmC gene expression was nearly abolished. Deletion of ComD exerted a similar effect on both genes to that observed with the comE null mutation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with purified ComE revealed specific shift patterns dependent on the presence of one or both direct repeats in the nlmC-comC promoter region. The two direct repeats were also required for the promoter activity of both nlmC and comC. These results suggest that gene regulation of comC in S. mutans is fundamentally different from that reported for S. pneumoniae, which implicates a unique regulatory mechanism that allows the coordination of bacteriocin production with competence development.
TI  - In vitro reconstitution of antimicrobial pathogen activity by expressed recombinant bovine lactoferrin N-terminal peptide in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Recombinant bovine lactoferrin N-terminal polypeptide (rbLF-N) Escherichia coli expression system was constructed and the rbLF-N antimicrobial activity was displayed by enzymatic proteolysis in this study. A 162 bp 5'-terminal fragment of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) gene from bovine liver gDNA was amplified by PCR. The DNA fragment containing exon-2 of the bLF gene was cloned into the expression vector pGEX-4T1 and the glutathione-S-transferase-rbLF-N (GST-rbLF-N) fusion protein was obtained by over-expression in Esch. coli BL21(DE3). After thrombin/pepsin digestion, the rbLF-N was released from the fusion protein. The recombinant peptide was separated and identified by SDS-PAGE, HPLC and LC-MS/MS analysis. A very strong anti-food-born microbial pathogen activity of the rbLF-N peptides was displayed through bio- and kinetic-assays in vitro. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the rbLF-N peptide for bacterial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Esch. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 11.7, 11.7, 11.7, 23.4 microg and 23.4, 11.7, 11.7, 46.4 microg, respectively. This study created a new route for exploring lactoferrin peptide application in food science.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. METHODS: Samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. On the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. The isolates were determined as Lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16S rDNA. Sequencing of 16S rDNA genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. RESULTS: Predominant species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus gasseri were also present. The isolates Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, Lactobacillus fermentum BGHO36 and BGHO64, Lactobacillus gasseri BGHO89 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BGHO99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, Salmonella enteritidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of Candida albicans. Moreover, the isolates L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 were tolerant to low pH and high concentration of bile salts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings imply that L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - Genetic variation in comC, the gene encoding competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The genetic variability in comC, the gene encoding the quorum-sensing molecule, competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) in Streptococcus mutans is reported. Seven comC alleles encoding three distinct mature CSPs were identified among 36 geographically diverse strains, although, compared with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the amount of predicted amino acid sequence variation is low. In agreement with other studies, significant variation was found in the natural competence for DNA uptake in these strains. However, there was no correlation between the CSP genotype and the ability to transform these strains. Representative strains encoding each of the CSP variants became competent in response to synthetic CSPs of each type. Therefore, in contrast to S. pneumoniae, comC alleles in S. mutans are functionally equivalent and there is no evidence of pherotype specificity.
TI  - [Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - We searched for new members of the TnrA and GlnR regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. We identified the regulatory signals for these transcription factors with consensuses ATGTNAWWWWWWWTNACAT for GlnR and TGTNAWWWWWWWTNACA for TnrA. We described the structure and found new potential members for the TnrA/GlnR regulons in Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the TnrA regulon in B. halodurans and for the GlnR regulons in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis.
TI  - Cell density- and ComE-dependent expression of a group of mutacin and mutacin-like genes in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is a major cariogenic inhabitant of the high cell density oral biofilm (dental plaque). In previous studies, we showed that production of one of its virulence factors, the bacteriocin mutacin IV, was regulated by high cell density as well as the competence regulatory system ComED. In this study, we utilized luciferase fusions and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), to demonstrate that high cell density and ComED also regulate an uncharacterized group of mutacin and mutacin-like genes. Under high cell density or in the presence of externally added competence-stimulating peptide (CSP), gene expression increased 10- to 30-fold. Interestingly, high cell density was able to bypass the requirement for CSP addition. However, both cell density and CSP-dependent gene expression had a strict requirement for the ComE response regulator.
TI  - Gene gain and gene loss in streptococcus: is it driven by habitat?
AB  - Bacterial genomes can evolve either by gene gain, gene loss, mutating existing genes, and/or by duplication of existing genes. Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that the acquisition of new genes by lateral gene transfer (LGT) is a predominant force in bacterial evolution. To better understand the significance of LGT, we employed a comparative genomics approach to model species-specific and intraspecies gene insertions/deletions (ins/del among 12 sequenced streptococcal genomes using a maximum likelihood method. This study indicates that the rate of gene ins/del is higher on the external branches and varies dramatically for each species. We have analyzed here some of the experimentally characterized species-specific genes that have been acquired by LGT and conclude that at least a portion of these genes have a role in adaptation.
TI  - Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of RafE, a sugar-binding lipoprotein from Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae contains a large number of sugar-transport systems and the system responsible for raffinose uptake has recently been identified. The substrate-binding protein component of this system shares strong sequence homology with the multiple sugar metabolism substrate-binding protein MsmE from S. mutans and contains a lipoprotein-attachment site at cysteine residue 23. A truncated form (residues 24-419) of RafE from S. pneumoniae was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Native and selenomethionine-labelled protein have been crystallized in the hexagonal space group P6(1)22. Diffraction data have been successfully phased to 2.90 angstroms using Se SAD data and model building is in progress.
TI  - Independent evolution of competence regulatory cascades in streptococci?
AB  - Natural genetic transformation is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer that is widely distributed in bacteria and requires assembly of a DNA uptake machinery. Transformable bacteria use fundamentally the same machine, which in most species is assembled only in cells that are developing competence. Competence regulation usually differs between unrelated species. Here, we examine whether related streptococci use the same competence regulatory cascade. Phylogenetic analyses of streptococcal genome sequences reveal the existence of two paralogous two-component regulatory systems, either of which might control competence. This suggests the distribution of streptococci into two groups that use competence regulatory cascades that have at least partly evolved independently. Comparison of data obtained with two transformable streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, provides support to this suggestion.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Substance P and Neuropeptide Y against laboratory strains of bacteria and oral microorganisms.
AB  - Infection and inflammation of mucosal tissue may induce the production of neuropeptides, specifically Substance P and Neuropeptide Y. Since these neuropeptides are similar to antimicrobial peptides in their amino acid composition, amphipathic design, cationic charge, and size, we wanted to determine if they had antimicrobial activity against a panel of common bacteria and oral microorganisms using the radial diffusion assay. Neuropeptide Y and Substance P had antimicrobial activity against E. coli (MIC 20.6+/-5.5 microg/ml SEM and 71.5+/-15 SEM microg/ml, respectively), but did not have activity against laboratory strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (MIC>500 microg/ml) nor oral strains of Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (MIC>500 microg/ml). While Substance P and Neuropeptide Y did not have direct antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested, they still may stimulate local epithelial cells to produce other innate immune factors like defensins and cathelicidins. However, this remains to be determined.
TI  - Functional analysis of glucan binding protein B from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Mutans streptococci are major etiological agents of dental caries, and several of their secreted products contribute to bacterial accumulation on teeth. Of these, Streptococcus mutans glucan binding protein B (GbpB) is a novel, immunologically dominant protein. Its biological function is unclear, although GbpB shares homology with a putative peptidoglycan hydrolase from S. agalactiae and S. pneumoniae, indicative of a role in murein biosynthesis. To determine the cellular function of GbpB, we used several approaches to inactivate the gene, analyze its expression, and identify interacting proteins. None of the transformants analyzed were true gbpB mutants, since they all contained both disrupted and wild-type gene copies, and expression of functional GbpB was always conserved. Thus, the inability to obtain viable gbpB null mutants supports the notion that gbpB is an essential gene. Northern blot and real-time PCR analyses suggested that induction of gbpB expression in response to stress was a strain-dependent phenomenon. Proteins that interacted with GbpB were identified in pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays, and these data suggest that GbpB interacts with ribosomal protein L7/L12, possibly as part of a protein complex involved in peptidoglycan synthesis and cell division.
TI  - Detection of bacterial DNA in atheromatous plaques by quantitative PCR.
AB  - This is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial DNA from ten species, including periodontal species and Chlamydia pneumoniae. We examined 129 samples of DNA extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences from ten different species: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.), Tannerella forsythensis, Eikenella corrodens, Prevotella intermedia, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, Treponema denticola and C. pneumoniae. All determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods employing SYBR Green. Species from the Bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. Almost half of the samples contained DNA from A. a. and C. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. S. aureus and S. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. S. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. The proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic DNA. The data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. We conclude that DNA from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of C. pneumoniae to the inflammation may be minimal.
TI  - Multilevel control of competence development and stress tolerance in Streptococcus mutans UA159.
AB  - Genetic competence appears to be important in establishment of biofilms and tolerance of environmental insults. We report here that the development of competence is controlled at multiple levels in a complex network that includes two signal-transducing two-component systems (TCS). Using Streptococcus mutans strain UA159, we demonstrate that the histidine kinase CiaH, but not the response regulator CiaR, causes a dramatic decrease in biofilm formation and in transformation efficiency. Inactivation of comE or comD had no effect on stress tolerance, but transformability of the mutants was poor and was not restored by addition of competence-stimulating peptide (CSP). Horse serum (HS) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) had no impact on transformability of any strains. Interestingly, though, the presence of HS or BSA in combination with CSP was required for efficient induction of comD, comX, and comYA, and induction was dependent on ComDE and CiaH, but not CiaR. Inactivation of comC, encoding CSP, had no impact on transformation, and CiaH was shown to be required for optimal comC expression. This study reveals that S. mutans integrates multiple environmental signals through CiaHR and ComDE to coordinate induction of com genes and that CiaH can exert its influence through CiaR and as-yet-unidentified regulators. The results highlight critical differences in the role and regulation of CiaRH and com genes in different S. mutans isolates and between S. mutans and Streptococcus pneumoniae, indicating that substantial divergence in the role and regulation of TCS and competence genes has occurred in streptococci.
TI  - Biological activities of Schefflera leucantha.
AB  - This study investigated various biological activities of the ethanolic extract of dried ground leaves of Schefflera leucantha Viguier (Araliaceae). The extract possessed very low cytotoxicity to brine-shrimp with the LC(50) of 4,111.15 microg/ml; the significant antioxidant activity on DPPH with the EC(50) of 71.90 microg/ml; the inhibitory activity on mushroom tyrosinase with the IC(50) of 10.53 mg/ml using the dopachrome microplate-assay. The extract of 5-20 mg/ml range in the agar dilution assay were active against various pathogenic microbial (11 species, 11 strains), with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 5 mg/ml against Clostridium spp.; MIC=10 mg/ml against enteropathogens as Bacteroides spp., Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Lactobacillus spp., Peptococcus spp. and Streptococcus mutans; MIC=10 mg/ml against a pneumonia causing bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and a dermatopathogen as Propionibacterium acnes; MIC=20 mg/ml against dermatopathogens as Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus spp. and Candida albicans ATCC 90028. TLC fingerprints of the specific extracts from the leaf powder exhibited zones of steroids-terpenes and flavonoids. HPLC fingerprint of the flavonoid extract was performed.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - We determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently FDA-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 Streptococcus mitis species group, 12 S. mutans species group, 9 S. anginosus species group, 8 S. sanguinis species group, 5 S. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual Gram-positive bacteria: 3 Listeria monocytogenes, 4 Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 Corynebacterium species, 10 Abiotrophia/Granulicatella species, 2 Rothia (Stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 Gemella morbillorum. Daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. The daptomycin MIC range for the unusual Gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. We conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types of unusual Gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.
TI  - Interactions of oral pathogens with toll-like receptors: possible role in atherosclerosis.
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLR) function as important signal transducers that mediate innate immune and inflammatory responses to pathogens through pattern recognition of virulence molecules. Although TLRs mediate protection against infection, it is also likely that they may have a pathophysiologic role in certain inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis. In atherosclerotic lesions, endothelial cells and macrophages have been shown to upregulate TLR expression and may respond to TLR agonists of microbial origin, resulting in detrimental inflammatory reactions. Some of these potential TLR-activating virulence factors may be of oral origin. The detection in atherosclerotic plaques of DNA specific for Porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontal pathogens suggests that these pathogens disseminate into the systemic circulation and localize in atheromas. The potential of periodontal and some other oral pathogens to activate TLRs in vivo is suggested by findings from cell culture experiments on interactions of selected virulence protein adhesins with TLRs and their coreceptors. Specifically, we have shown that proinflammatory cytokine induction by P. gingivalis fimbriae was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to TLR2, TLR4, CD14, and beta2 integrins, but not by immunoglobulin isotype controls. Cytokine induction by Bacteroides forsythus protein A depended heavily on CD14 and TLR2. We also found that the ability of Streptococcus mutans protein AgI/II to stimulate cytokine release was partially dependent on CD14 and TLR4. Moreover, P. gingivalis fimbriae induced TLR-dependent activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and upregulation of costimulatory molecules in monocytic cells. These proinflammatory activities have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis, and similar inflammatory mechanisms could potentially operate in atherosclerosis. Studies by other groups have shown that P. gingivalis is capable of stimulating low-density lipoprotein oxidation, foam cell formation, and rupture of atherosclerotic plaque through induction of matrix metalloproteinases. Interestingly, at least some of these activities can be induced by TLR agonists (lipopolysaccharide and heat-shock protein-60) from Chlamydia pneumoniae, a major risk factor in atherosclerosis. Future research in animal models and in vitro cellular systems with defined mutations in TLRs may implicate TLR participation in oral pathogen-mediated atherosclerotic processes, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for the epidemiological findings linking oral pathogens to atherosclerotic disease.
TI  - Co-ordinated bacteriocin production and competence development: a possible mechanism for taking up DNA from neighbouring species.
AB  - It is important to ensure DNA availability when bacterial cells develop competence. Previous studies in Streptococcus pneumoniae demonstrated that the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) induced autolysin production and cell lysis of its own non-competent cells, suggesting a possible active mechanism to secure a homologous DNA pool for uptake and recombination. In this study, we found that in Streptococcus mutans CSP induced co-ordinated expression of competence and mutacin production genes. This mutacin (mutacin IV) is a non-lantibiotic bacteriocin which kills closely related Streptococcal species such as S. gordonii. In mixed cultures of S. mutans and S. gordonii harbouring a shuttle plasmid, plasmid DNA transfer from S. gordonii to S. mutans was observed in a CSP and mutacin IV-dependent manner. Further analysis demonstrated an increased DNA release from S. gordonii upon addition of the partially purified mutacin IV extract. On the basis of these findings, we propose that Streptococcus mutans, which resides in a multispecies oral biofilm, may utilize the competence-induced bacteriocin production to acquire transforming DNA from other species living in the same ecological niche. This hypothesis is also consistent with a well-known phenomenon that a large genomic diversity exists among different S. mutans strains. This diversity may have resulted from extensive horizontal gene transfer.
TI  - Analysis of the prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes in clinical isolates  of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in a Japanese hospital.
AB  - Prevalence of seven tetracycline resistance (TC(R)) genes--tet(L), tet(M), tet(K), tet(O), tet(S), tet(T), and tet(U)--which are known to be distributed to gram-positive cocci was analyzed for 224 Enterococcus faecalis and 46 Enterococcus faecium clinical isolates obtained in a Japanese hospital. Any of the TC(R) genes was detected in 75.9% of all the enterococcal strains. The tet(M) was detected at highest rates in both E. faecalis (75.0%) and E. faecium (69.6%), followed by tet(L), which was harbored in 6.7% of E. faecalis isolates and 30.4% of E. faecium isolates. The tet(O), tet(S), and tet(T) were detected in E. faecalis at low frequencies mostly associated with tet(M), while tet(K) and tet(U) were not detected. Nucleotide sequences of tet(S) from E. faecalis strains were identical to that reported in Listeria monocytogenes. Sequences of tet(O) from two E. faecalis strains were almost identical to each other and also to those from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Campylobacter jejuni, and Campylobacter coli, although minor sequence divergence was observed. The tet(T), which had been reported only in Streptococcus pyogenes, was found in five E. faecalis strains. Sequence of the enterococcal tet(T) differed from that of S. pyogenes by only four nucleotides (four amino acids) and showed high sequence identity (99.8%, amino acid level). Enterococcal strains with any one TC(R) gene or those with two TC(R) genes showed generally similar MICs of tetracyclines, and no evident difference in resistance level was observed.
TI  - Identification of the gene encoding a 38-kilodalton immunogenic and protective antigen of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - In our continued effort to search for a Streptococcus suis protein(s) that can serve as a vaccine candidate or a diagnostic reagent, we constructed and screened a gene library with a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole-cell protein of S. suis type 2. A clone that reacted with the antibody was identified and characterized. Analysis revealed that the gene encoding the protein is localized within a 2.0-kbp EcoRI DNA fragment. The nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 445 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 46.4 kDa. By in vitro protein synthesis and Western blot experiments, the protein exhibited an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 38 kDa. At the amino acid level the deduced primary sequence shared homology with sequences of unknown function from Streptococcus pneumoniae (89%), Streptococcus mutans (86%), Lactococcus lactis (80%), Listeria monocytogenes (74%), and Clostridium perfringens (64%). Except for strains of serotypes 20, 26, 32, and 33, Southern hybridization analysis revealed the presence of the gene in strains of other S. suis serotypes and demonstrated restriction fragment length differences caused by a point mutation in the EcoRI recognition sequence. We confirmed expression of the 38-kDa protein in the hybridization-positive isolates using specific antiserum against the purified protein. The recombinant protein was reactive with serum from pigs experimentally infected with virulent strains of S. suis type 2, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic and may serve as an antigen of diagnostic importance for the detection of most S. suis infections. Pigs immunized with the recombinant 38-kDa protein mounted antibody responses to the protein and were completely protected against challenge with a strain of a homologous serotype, the wild-type virulent strain of S. suis type 2, suggesting that it may be a good candidate for the development of a vaccine that can be used as protection against S. suis infection. Analysis of the cellular fractions of the bacterium by Western blotting revealed that the protein was present in the surface and cell wall extracts. The functional role of the protein with respect to pathogenesis and whether antibodies against the antigen confer protective immunity against diseases caused by strains of other pathogenic S. suis capsular types remains to be determined.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  - Viridans streptococci (VS) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. Many species of VS are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. An oligonucleotide array based on 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer (ITS) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant VS. These 11 species were Streptococcus anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, and S. uberis. The method consisted of PCR amplification of the ITS regions by using a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled PCR products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. After 120 strains of the 11 species of VG and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. S. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of S. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate S. pneumoniae from S. mitis. In conclusion, identification of species of VS by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of VS.
TI  - The putative autolysin regulator LytR in Streptococcus mutans plays a role in cell division and is growth-phase regulated.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is the primary odontopathogen present in supragingival plaque and causes the oral disease known as dental caries. Colonization of the oral cavity by S. mutans requires the bacteria to adhere to the tooth surface and occurs by both sucrose-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Sucrose-independent adhesion of S. mutans in vitro has been shown to involve an ORF (ORF0317) encoding a homologue (39 %) to LytR, a regulator of autolysin activity in Bacillus subtilis. The protein encoded by ORF0317, LytR, belongs to the LytR/CpsA/Psr protein family. This family has a putative role in cell-wall structural maintenance, possibly through autolysin regulation. Autolysins have also been shown to be important in surface adhesion in Lactococcus lactis and in the pathogenic properties of Streptococcus pneumoniae. To investigate the role of autolysins in the adhesion and pathogenesis of S. mutans, a LytR mutant was constructed. The mutant grows in long chains, which may indicate a defect in cell division. Further experiments with the mutant strain show increased autolytic activity, indicating that LytR attenuates S. mutans autolytic activity, possibly through regulation of the expression of autolytic enzymes. No defect in cell-to-surface adherence or biofilm growth was seen in the LytR mutant. However, a connection between cell growth phase and transcription of lytR was found.
TI  - A unique nine-gene comY operon in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria possess natural competence mechanisms for DNA capture and internalization. In Bacillus subtilis, natural competence is absolutely dependent upon the presence of a seven-gene operon known as the comG operon (comGA-G). In species of Streptococcus, this function has been described for a four-gene operon (comYA-D in Streptococcus gordonii and cglA-D in Streptococcus pneumoniae). In this study, a nine-orf operon (named comYA-I) required for natural competence in Streptococcus mutans was identified and characterized. Orf analysis of this operon indicates that the first four Orfs (ComYA-D) share strong homology with ComYA-D of S. gordonii and CglA-D of S. pneumoniae, the fifth to seventh Orfs (ComYE-G) match conserved hypothetical proteins from various species of Streptococcus with ComYF possessing a predicted ComGF domain, the eighth Orf (ComYH) shows a strong homology to numerous DNA methyltransferases from restriction/modification systems, and the ninth Orf (ComYI) is homologous to acetate kinase (AckA). RT-PCR analysis of the orf junctions confirmed that all nine orfs were present in a single transcript, while real-time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that these orfs were expressed at a level very similar to that of the first orf in the operon. Mutations were constructed in all nine putative orfs. The first seven genes (comYA-G) were found to be essential for natural competence, while comYH and comYI had reduced and normal natural competence ability, respectively. Analyses of S. mutans comY-luciferase reporter fusions indicated that comY expression is growth-phase dependent, with maximal expression at an OD(600) of about 0.2, while mutations in ciaH, comC and luxS reduced the level of comY expression. In addition, comY operon expression appears to be correlated with natural competence ability.
TI  - Conserved repeat motifs and glucan binding by glucansucrases of oral streptococci and Leuconostoc mesenteroides.
AB  - Glucansucrases of oral streptococci and Leuconostoc mesenteroides have a common pattern of structural organization and characteristically contain a domain with a series of tandem amino acid repeats in which certain residues are highly conserved, particularly aromatic amino acids and glycine. In some glucosyltransferases (GTFs) the repeat region has been identified as a glucan binding domain (GBD). Such GBDs are also found in several glucan binding proteins (GBP) of oral streptococci that do not have glucansucrase activity. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of 20 glucansucrases and GBP showed the widespread conservation of the 33-residue A repeat first identified in GtfI of Streptococcus downei. Site-directed mutagenesis of individual highly conserved residues in recombinant GBD of GtfI demonstrated the importance of the first tryptophan and the tyrosine-phenylalanine pair in the binding of dextran, as well as the essential contribution of a basic residue (arginine or lysine). A microplate binding assay was developed to measure the binding affinity of recombinant GBDs. GBD of GtfI was shown to be capable of binding glucans with predominantly alpha-1,3 or alpha-1,6 links, as well as alternating alpha-1,3 and alpha-1,6 links (alternan). Western blot experiments using biotinylated dextran or alternan as probes demonstrated a difference between the binding of streptococcal GTF and GBP and that of Leuconostoc glucansucrases. Experimental data and bioinformatics analysis showed that the A repeat motif is distinct from the 20-residue CW motif, which also has conserved aromatic amino acids and glycine and which occurs in the choline-binding proteins of Streptococcus pneumoniae and other organisms.
TI  - ComX activity of Streptococcus mutans growing in biofilms.
AB  - In many streptococci, including Streptococcus mutans, genetic competence is regulated by a quorum sensing system mediated by a competence stimulating peptide (CSP) pheromone, encoded by the comC gene. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, a central component of this system is ComX, which acts as an alternative sigma factor to activate competence genes involved in DNA uptake and processing. The quorum sensing system responsible for genetic competence induction in S. mutans has been linked to biofilm formation and the acid tolerance response. To examine the response of comX to CSP in S. mutans, a transcriptional fusion of the comX promoter (pcomX) with lacZ was constructed to generate reporter vector pcomx::pALH122 (replicative vector) and transformed into S. mutans UA159 comC-, which is unable to produce endogenous CSP. CSP was added and pcomX::lacZ relative expression index (REI) examined, revealing a 2-fold increase in maximal beta-gal activity 5 and 10 min after CSP addition. The effect of endogenous CSP on pcomX::lacZ expression was also examined by measuring REI in cells grown as a biofilm; peak pcomX activity was observed at 3 h. To determine the temporal pattern of transformation frequency, pMA2, a Spr shuttle vector, was transformed into biofilm-grown cells, with maximal transformation frequency observed at 3 h. Confocal microscopy was performed to examine pcomX activity using a similarly constructed green fluorescent protein reporter vector, pcomX::gfp, in a 4-h biofilm, revealing active pcomX activity in high cell density areas within the biofilm population. These results demonstrated a positive correlation between pcomX activity, natural transformation and competence development in biofilms.
TI  - Comparative genomics of streptococcal species.
AB  - Microbial genome sequencing has produced an unprecedented amount of new information and insights into an organism's metabolic activities, virulence properties, and evolution. The complete genome sequence has been reported for four different species of streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae and S. mutans. Comparative genome analysis among organisms of the same species not only shows a high degree of similarity in gene content and organization, but also a high degree of sequence heterogeneity as evidenced by the large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms present. Considerable differences were also observed in the number of mobile genetic elements found in each organism, including complete and partial bacteriophage genomes, IS elements, transposons, and plasmids. S. pyogenes was the only species to contain complete bacteriophage genomes in its genome, while only S. pneumoniae and S. mutans contained the full complement of competence genes essential for natural transformation. Comparative genome analysis between the species showed that S. pyogenes was more closely related to S. agalactiae than with S. pneumoniae or S. mutans.
TI  - The fabM gene product of Streptococcus mutans is responsible for the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids and is necessary for survival at low pH.
AB  - Previously, it has been demonstrated that the membrane fatty acid composition of  Streptococcus mutans is affected by growth pH (E. M. Fozo and R. G. Quivey, Jr., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 70:929-936, 2004; R. G. Quivey, Jr., R. Faustoferri, K. Monahan, and R. Marquis, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 189:89-92, 2000). Specifically, the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids increases when the organism is grown in acidic environments; if the shift to increased monounsaturated fatty acids is blocked by the addition of a fatty acid biosynthesis inhibitor, the organism is rendered more acid sensitive (E. M. Fozo and R. G. Quivey, Jr., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 70:929-936, 2004). Recently, work with Streptococcus pneumoniae has identified a novel enzyme, FabM, responsible for the production of monounsaturated fatty acids (H. Marrakchi, K. H. Choi, and C. O. Rock, J. Biol. Chem. 277:44809-44816, 2002). Using the published S. pneumoniae sequence, a putative FabM was identified in the S. mutans strain UA159. We generated a fabM strain that does not produce unsaturated fatty acids as determined by gas chromatography of fatty acid methyl esters. The mutant strain was extremely sensitive to low pH in comparison to the wild type; however, the acid-sensitive phenotype was relieved by growth in the presence of long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids or through genetic complementation. The strain exhibited reduced glycolytic capability and altered glucose-PTS activity. In addition, the altered membrane composition was more impermeable to protons and did not maintain a normal DeltapH. The results suggest that altered membrane composition can significantly affect the acid survival capabilities, as well as several enzymatic activities, of S. mutans.
TI  - The pathogenesis of streptococcal infections: from tooth decay to meningitis.
AB  - The development of bacterial disease has been likened to a 'molecular arms race', in which the host tries to eliminate the bacteria, while the bacteria try to survive in the host. Although most bacteria do not cause disease, some cause serious human infection in a large proportion of encounters. Between these two extremes are bacteria that can coexist with humans in a carriage state but, under appropriate circumstances, cause disease. The streptococci exemplify this group of organisms, and by studying them we can begin to address why bacteria cause such a wide spectrum of disease.
TI  - Effect of acidic pH on expression of surface-associated proteins of Streptococcus oralis.
AB  - Streptococcus oralis, a member of the mitis group of oral streptococci, is implicated in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and is the predominant aciduric non-mutans-group streptococcus in dental plaque. We undertook to identify the most abundant surface-associated proteins of S. oralis and to investigate changes in protein expression when the organism was grown under acidic culture conditions. Surface-associated proteins were extracted from cells grown in batch culture, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Putative functions were assigned by homology to a translated genomic database of Streptococcus pneumoniae. A total of 27 proteins were identified; these included a lipoprotein, a ribosome recycling factor, and the glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enolase. The most abundant protein, phosphocarrier protein HPr, was present as three isoforms. Neither lactate dehydrogenase nor pyruvate oxidase, dominant intracellular proteins, were present among the proteins on the gels, demonstrating that proteins in the surface-associated pool did not arise as a result of cell lysis. Eleven of the proteins identified were differentially expressed when cells were grown at pH 5.2 versus pH 7.0, and these included superoxide dismutase, a homologue of dipeptidase V from Lactococcus lactis, and the protein translation elongation factors G, Tu, and Ts. This study has extended the range of streptococcal proteins known to be expressed at the cell surface. Further investigations are required to ascertain their functions at this extracellular location and determine how their expression is influenced by other environmental conditions.
TI  - Functional and comparative genomic analyses of an operon involved in fructooligosaccharide utilization by Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus is a probiotic organism that displays the ability to use prebiotic compounds such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS), which stimulate the growth of beneficial commensals in the gastrointestinal tract. However, little is known about the mechanisms and genes involved in FOS utilization by Lactobacillus species. Analysis of the L. acidophilus NCFM genome revealed an msm locus composed of a transcriptional regulator of the LacI family, a four-component ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system, a fructosidase, and a sucrose phosphorylase. Transcriptional analysis of this operon demonstrated that gene expression was induced by sucrose and FOS but not by glucose or fructose, suggesting some specificity for nonreadily fermentable sugars. Additionally, expression was repressed by glucose but not by fructose, suggesting catabolite repression via two cre-like sequences identified in the promoter-operator region. Insertional inactivation of the genes encoding the ABC transporter substrate-binding protein and the fructosidase reduced the ability of the mutants to grow on FOS. Comparative analysis of gene architecture within this cluster revealed a high degree of synteny with operons in Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, the association between a fructosidase and an ABC transporter is unusual and may be specific to L. acidophilus. This is a description of a previously undescribed gene locus involved in transport and catabolism of FOS compounds, which can promote competition of beneficial microorganisms in the human gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral Streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (KTmAb) and recombinant (KTscFv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. KTmAb and KTscFv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. Effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and S. mutans in particular. In this study, the activity of KTmAb and KTscFv against S. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by KTmAb of dental colonization by S. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: KTscFv and KTmAb were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay against a serotype C strain of S. mutans, and other oral streptococci (S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. salivarius). An ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish KTmAb potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by S. mutans and other oral streptococci. RESULTS: KTmAb and KTscFv kill in vitro S. mutans and other oral streptococci. KTmAb inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by S. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. CONCLUSIONS: Killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.
TI  - Novel two-component regulatory system involved in biofilm formation and acid resistance in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The abilities of Streptococcus mutans to form biofilms and to survive acidic pH are regarded as two important virulence determinants in the pathogenesis of dental caries. Environmental stimuli are thought to regulate the expression of several genes associated with virulence factors through the activity of two-component signal transduction systems. Yet, little is known of the involvement of these systems in the physiology and pathogenicity of S. mutans. In this study, we describe a two-component regulatory system and its involvement in biofilm formation and acid resistance in S. mutans. By searching the S. mutans genome database with tblastn with the HK03 and RR03 protein sequences from S. pneumoniae as queries, we identified two genes, designated hk11 and rr11, that encode a putative histidine kinase and its cognate response regulator. To gain insight into their function, a PCR-mediated allelic-exchange mutagenesis strategy was used to create the hk11 (Em(r)) and rr11 (Em(r)) deletion mutants from S. mutans wild-type NG8 named SMHK11 and SMRR11, respectively. The mutants were examined for their growth rates, genetic competence, ability to form biofilms, and resistance to low-pH challenge. The results showed that deletion of hk11 or rr11 resulted in defects in biofilm formation and resistance to acidic pH. Both mutants formed biofilms with reduced biomass (50 to 70% of the density of the parent strain). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the biofilms formed by the mutants had sponge-like architecture with what appeared to be large gaps that resembled water channel-like structures. The mutant biofilms were composed of longer chains of cells than those of the parent biofilm. Deletion of hk11 also resulted in greatly diminished resistance to low pH, although we did not observe the same effect when rr11 was deleted. Genetic competence was not affected in either mutant. The results suggested that the gene product of hk11 in S. mutans might act as a pH sensor that could cross talk with one or more response regulators. We conclude that the two-component signal transduction system encoded by hk11 and rr11 represents a new regulatory system involved in biofilm formation and acid resistance in S. mutans.
TI  - The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase motif is lacking in PmpA, the PrsA-like protein involved in the secretion machinery of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The prsA-like gene from Lactococcus lactis encoding its single homologue to PrsA, an essential protein triggering the folding of secreted proteins in Bacillus subtilis, was characterized. This gene, annotated pmpA, encodes a lipoprotein of 309 residues whose expression is increased 7- to 10-fold when the source of nitrogen is limited. A slight increase in the expression of the PrsA-like protein (PLP) in L. lactis removed the degradation products previously observed with the Staphylococcus hyicus lipase used as a model secreted protein. This shows that PmpA either triggers the folding of the secreted lipase or activates its degradation by the cell surface protease HtrA. Unlike the case for B. subtilis, the inactivation of the gene encoding PmpA reduced only slightly the growth rate of L. lactis in standard conditions. However, it almost stopped its growth when the lipase was overexpressed in the presence of salt in the medium. Like PrsA of B. subtilis and PrtM of L. lactis, the L. lactis PmpA protein could thus have a foldase activity that facilitates protein secretion. These proteins belong to the third family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerases (PPIases) for which parvulin is the prototype. Almost all PLP from gram-positive bacteria contain a domain with the PPIase signature. An exception to this situation was found only in Streptococcaceae, the family to which L. lactis belongs. PLP from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis possess this signature, but those of L. lactis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus mutans do not. However, secondary structure predictions suggest that the folding of PLP is conserved over the entire length of the proteins, including the unconserved signature region. The activity associated with the expression of PmpA in L. lactis and these genomic data show that either the PPIase motif is not necessary for PPIase activity or, more likely, PmpA foldase activity does not necessarily require PPIase activity.
TI  - PCR ligation mutagenesis in transformable streptococci: application and efficiency.
AB  - PCR ligation mutagenesis is a novel technique that can easily be adapted for many gene modification purposes. Successful application of this versatile technique involves sequence identification of the target gene region, creation of a mutagenic construct consisting of two gene-flanking proximal sequences specifically ligated to a selectable marker, and incorporation of this construct into the genome via genetic transformation and homologous recombination. In this study, we demonstrate the use of PCR, followed by restriction digestion and re-ligation to generate transforming constructs for the rapid deletion of open reading frames in transformable streptococci. Moreover, we characterized the dependence of transformation efficiency for mutant generation on the length of the homologous regions harbored by the mutagenic construct. Our results indicated that PCR ligation mutagenesis could be reliably employed for the systematic generation of gene deletion mutants in both highly transformable Streptococcus mutans and S. pneumoniae. Evaluation of the method showed a strong influence of the length of homologous flanking region on integration efficiency.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus suis genes encoding proteins homologous to sortase of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Many surface proteins which are covalently linked to the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria have a consensus C-terminal motif, Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly (LPXTG). This sequence is cleaved, and the processed protein is attached to an amino group of a cross-bridge in the peptidoglycan by a specific enzyme called sortase. Using the type strain of Streptococcus suis, NCTC 10234, we found five genes encoding proteins that were homologous to sortases of other bacteria and determined the nucleotide sequences of the genetic regions. One gene, designated srtA, was linked to gyrA, as were the sortase and sortase-like genes of other streptococci. Three genes, designated srtB, srtC, and srtD, were tandemly clustered in a different location, where there were three segments of directly repeated sequences of approximately 110 bp in close vicinity. The remaining gene, designated srtE, was located separately on the chromosome with a pseudogene which may encode a transposase. The deduced amino acid sequences of the five Srt proteins showed 18 to 31% identity with the sortases of Streptococcus gordonii and Staphylococcus aureus, except that SrtA of S. suis had 65% identity with that of S. gordonii. Isogenic mutants deficient for srtA, srtBCD, or srtE were generated by allelic exchanges. The protein fraction which was released from partially purified cell walls by digestion with N-acetylmuramidase was profiled by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. More than 15 of the protein spots were missing in the profile of the srtA mutant compared with that of the parent strain, and this phenotype was completely complemented by srtA cloned from S. suis. Four genes encoding proteins corresponding to such spots were identified and sequenced. The deduced translational products of the four genes possessed the LPXTG motif in their C-terminal regions. On the other hand, the protein spots that were missing in the srtA mutant appeared in the profiles of the srtBCD and srtE mutants. These results provide evidence that the cell wall sorting system involving srtA is also present in S. suis.
TI  - Mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  - This study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in Spain. Six different antiseptic mouthrinses were studied by means of determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. Results suggested that the determination of MIC values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. On the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. All tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and Triclosan.
TI  - A XerD recombinase with unusual active site motifs in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - XerD belongs to the site specific recombinases of the integrase family of proteins that catalyze recombination events via a phosphotyrosine intermediate. Sequence alignments and crystal structure resolution of E. coli XerD and related enzymes demonstrated the importance of four conserved amino acids R-H-R-H that are spaced along the C-terminal domain in addition to a conserved K and the active site Y, all of which have been implicated in catalysis. The deduced amino acid sequence of the putative S. pneumoniae XerD contained three unique replacements at the conserved positions resulting in L-Q-R-L; moreover, the active site Y was the penultimate amino acid residue, and the extreme C-terminal region suggested to be involved in interaction of E. coli XerD with XerC was lacking. Severe growth defects in a loss-of-function xerD mutant are consistent with an important in vivo function of the S. pneumoniae XerD protein. Highly related xerD genes with similar unusual amino acid replacements were found in S. mitis, S. mutans and S. pyogenes but not in other Gram-positive bacteria, although the genetic environment was very similar in many species. There are at least another four genes in the S. pneumoniae KNR_7/87 genome encoding Xer related peptides, one of which was identified as the xerC homologue. The xerD and xerC genes were present in a sample of 20 S. pneumoniae strains whereas the other xer genes appear to be absent in some of the strains and are more closely related to integrases of phage and transposon origin.
TI  - Autolysis control hypotheses for tolerance to wall antibiotics.

TI  - Genetic competence and transformation in oral streptococci.
AB  - The oral streptococci are normally non-pathogenic residents of the human microflora. There is substantial evidence that these bacteria can, however, act as "genetic reservoirs" and transfer genetic information to transient bacteria as they make their way through the mouth, the principal entry point for a wide variety of bacteria. Examples that are of particular concern include the transfer of antibiotic resistance from oral streptococci to Streptococcus pneumoniae. The mechanisms that are used by oral streptococci to exchange genetic information are not well-understood, although several species are known to enter a physiological state of genetic competence. This state permits them to become capable of natural genetic transformation, facilitating the acquisition of foreign DNA from the external environment. The oral streptococci share many similarities with two closely related Gram-positive bacteria, S. pneumoniae and Bacillus subtilis. In these bacteria, the mechanisms of quorum-sensing, the development of competence, and DNA uptake and integration are well-characterized. Using this knowledge and the data available in genome databases allowed us to identify putative genes involved in these processes in the oral organism Streptococcus mutans. Models of competence development and genetic transformation in the oral streptococci and strategies to confirm these models are discussed. Future studies of competence in oral biofilms, the natural environment of oral streptococci, will be discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) compared to eleven other antimicrobial agents against streptococcal isolates, excluding Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The purpose of the study presented here was to determine the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared with that of 11 other antimicrobial agents (5 of them quinolones) against 400 isolates of beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci. The minimum inhibitory concentration values for gemifloxacin against 90% of the streptococci tested were as follows: Lancefield groups A, C and G, 0.06 microg/ml; Lancefield group B, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus bovis, 0.125 microg/ml; and Streptococcus milleri, 0.03 microg/ml. Resistance to penicillin, ampicillin and erythromycin was found mainly in the Streptococcus mitis isolates; tetracycline showed variable results, and no vancomycin resistance was encountered. Higher rates of ciprofloxacin resistance were identified in the Streptococcus bovis, mitis and mutans isolates. In conclusion, gemifloxacin was the most active quinolone tested followed by trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, especially against isolates resistant to beta-lactam agents, macrolides and tetracycline.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Streblus asper leaf extract.
AB  - Bactericidal activity was found in the 50% ethanol (v/v) extract of Streblus asper leaves. The extract possessed a selective bactericidal activity towards Streptococcus, especially to Streptococcus mutans which has been shown to be strongly associated with dental caries. The extract had no effect on cultures of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus coagulase positive, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia pseudomeallei and Candida albicans. The minimum growth inhibitory concentration and the minimum bactericidal concentration of S. asper extract against 10(8) CFU/mL of S. mutans was 2 mg/mL. The active compound is partially polar, partially heat labile, precipitated by 80% ammonium sulphate, and possesses a molecular weight larger than 10 000 Da. The potential for using S. asper extract as a natural product for controlling dental caries is discussed.
TI  - Mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  - The production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of RNase B and subsequent utilization of released mannose. RNase B is an excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. Mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. None of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or Streptococcus peroris and Streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the Man(5) glycan alone was degraded while Man(6) to Man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in Man(5), remained intact. Investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone- or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation of the Man(5) glycan of RNase B. No species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the Streptococcus anginosus, S. gordonii, and S. intermedius species. The data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.
TI  - Natural genetic transformation of Streptococcus mutans growing in biofilms.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is a bacterium that has evolved to be dependent upon a biofilm "lifestyle" for survival and persistence in its natural ecosystem, dental plaque. We initiated this study to identify the genes involved in the development of genetic competence in S. mutans and to assay the natural genetic transformability of biofilm-grown cells. Using genomic analyses, we identified a quorum-sensing peptide pheromone signaling system similar to those previously found in other streptococci. The genetic locus of this system comprises three genes, comC, comD, and comE, that encode a precursor to the peptide competence factor, a histidine kinase, and a response regulator, respectively. We deduced the sequence of comC and its active pheromone product and chemically synthesized the corresponding 21-amino-acid competence-stimulating peptide (CSP). Addition of CSP to noncompetent cells facilitated increased transformation frequencies, with typically 1% of the total cell population transformed. To further confirm the roles of these genes in genetic competence, we inactivated them by insertion-duplication mutagenesis or allelic replacement followed by assays of transformation efficiency. We also demonstrated that biofilm-grown S. mutans cells were transformed at a rate 10- to 600-fold higher than planktonic S. mutans cells. Donor DNA included a suicide plasmid, S. mutans chromosomal DNA harboring a heterologous erythromycin resistance gene, and a replicative plasmid. The cells were optimally transformed during the formation of 8- to 16-h-old biofilms primarily consisting of microcolonies on solid surfaces. We also found that dead cells in the biofilms could act as donors of a chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance determinant. This work demonstrated that a peptide pheromone system controls genetic competence in S. mutans and that the system functions optimally when the cells are living in actively growing biofilms.
TI  - Xylitol in preventing acute otitis media.
AB  - Xylitol is a polyol sugar alcohol and is referred to as birch sugar, because it can be produced from birch. Natural sources of xylitol include plums, strawberries, raspberries and rowan berries. Xylitol inhibits the growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae and it inhibits the attachment of both pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae on the nasopharyngeal cells. In two clinical trials xylitol was found efficient to prevent the development of acute otitis media with a daily dose of 8.4-10 g of xylitol given in five divided doses. The efficacy in these 2-3 months follow-up trials was approximately 40% when chewing gum was used and approximately 30% with xylitol syrup. The need to use antimicrobials reduced markedly when using xylitol. In a high-risk group of children with tympanostomy tubes xylitol was ineffective in preventing otitis. Xylitol appears to be an attractive alternative to prevent acute otitis media. A more practical frequency of doses should be found before its use can be widely recommended.
TI  - Genetic transformation in Streptococcus mutans requires a peptide secretion-like  apparatus.
AB  - Competence for genetic transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus gordonii involves the ComAB secretion apparatus, which is thought to export the competence-stimulating peptide. Homologous secretory systems are also used for the export of certain bacteriocins and bacteriocin-like peptides. In this study, a similar secretory apparatus was found in the Streptococcus mutans genome, and its role in transformation was investigated. Gene inactivation resulted in a mutant deficient in transformability. We suggest that secretion of a peptide, possibly the competence-stimulating peptide itself, is involved in competence induction also in S. mutans.
TI  - Effect of xylitol on growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the presence of fructose and sorbitol.
AB  - Xylitol is effective in preventing acute otitis media by inhibiting the growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae. To clarify this inhibition we used fructose, which is known to block similar growth inhibition observed in Streptococcus mutans. In addition, we evaluated the efficacy of sorbitol in inhibiting the growth of pneumococci, as sorbitol is widely used for indications similar to those for which xylitol is used. The addition of 5% xylitol to the growth medium resulted in marked growth inhibition, an effect which was totally eliminated in the presence of 1, 2.5, or 5% fructose but not in the presence of 1 or 5% glucose, 1% galactose, or 1% sucrose. This finding implies that xylitol-induced inhibition of pneumococcal growth is mediated via the fructose phosphotransferase system in a way similar to that in which mutans group streptococcal growth is inhibited. The addition of sorbitol at concentrations of 1, 2.5, or 5% to the growth medium did not affect the growth of pneumococci and neither inhibited nor enhanced the xylitol-induced growth impairment. Thus, it seems that xylitol is the only commercially used sugar substitute proven to have an antimicrobial effect on pneumococci.
TI  - Genetic characterization of a Streptococcus mutans LraI family operon and role in virulence.
AB  - Proteins belonging to the LraI (for "lipoprotein receptor antigen") family function as adhesins in several streptococci, as a virulence factor for endocarditis in at least one of these species, and potentially as metal transporters in many bacteria. We have identified and characterized the chromosomal locus containing the LraI family gene (designated sloC) from Streptococcus mutans, an agent of dental caries and endocarditis in humans. Northern blot analysis indicated that sloC is cotranscribed with three other genes. As with other LraI operons, the sloA and sloB genes apparently encode components of an ATP-binding cassette transport system. The product of the fourth gene, sloR, has homology to the metal-dependent regulator from Corynebacterium diphtheriae, DtxR. A potential binding site for SloR was identified upstream from the sloABCR operon and was conserved upstream from LraI operons in several other streptococci. Potential SloR homologs were identified in the unfinished genomic sequences from two of these, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Mutagenesis of sloC in S. mutans resulted in apparent loss of expression of the entire operon as assessed by Northern blot analysis. The sloC mutant was indistinguishable from its wild-type parent in a gnotobiotic rat model of caries but was significantly less virulent in a rat model of endocarditis. Virulence for endocarditis was restored by correction of the sloC mutation but not by provision of the sloC gene in trans, suggesting that virulence requires the expression of other genes in the sloC operon.
TI  - The gene encoding IIAB(Man)L in Streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  - Glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-PTS (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic IIAB protein, called IIAB(Man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. This paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the specific components of the mannose-PTS of Streptococcus salivarius. The man operon was composed of four genes, manL, manM, manN and manO. These genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (Pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mRNA that contained a 5'-UTR (untranslated region). The predicted manL gene product encoded a 35.5 kDa protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the IIA and IIB phosphorylation sites already determined from purified S. salivarius IIAB(Man)L. Expression of manL in Escherichia coli generated a 35 kDa protein that reacted with anti-IIAB(Man)L antibodies. The predicted ManM protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kDa. ManM had similarity with IIC domains of the mannose-EII family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-IIC proteins from Gram-negative bacteria. From multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified IIC(Man) signature is proposed: GX3G[DNH]X3G[LIVM]2XG2[STL][LT][EQ]. The deduced product of manN was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kDa. The ManN protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the IID domains of the mannose-EII family. manO encoded a 13.7 kDa protein. This gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA from a promoter located in the manN-manO intergenic region. A search of current databases revealed the presence of IIAB(Man)L, ManM, ManN and ManO orthologues in Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. This work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose PTS in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (ManO) within the man operon.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  - The utility of PCR analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tDNA-ILP) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15 species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rRNA homology groups. PCR products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tDNA primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and by laser fluorescence scanning. Eleven species showed specific and distinct tDNA patterns: Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus criceti and Streptococcus ratti. Indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: Streptococcus vestibularis and Streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius on the other. S. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing S. mitis biovar 1 and two S. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with S. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. These results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that S. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. In conclusion, PCR analysis of tDNA-ILP holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.
TI  - The Streptococcus agalactiae hylB gene encoding hyaluronate lyase: completion of  the sequence and expression analysis.
AB  - We report the cloning, sequencing and expression analysis of the Streptococcus agalactiae strain 4755 hylB4755 allele, the first chromosomally-encoded streptococcal hyaluronate lyase gene to be cloned and sequenced completely. This gene lies in a region homologous to that found in S. mutans, between the mutX and rmlB genes, a region involved in the synthesis of the serotype c-specific polysaccharide antigen of this organism. Sequencing of hylB4755 revealed a 3216-bp open reading frame that encodes a 121.2-kDa polypeptide possessing a 30-amino acid signal sequence which was theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed. A recombinant plasmid, pHYB100, containing hylB4755 together with its promoter and terminator was constructed and used to analyze the expression of the gene in Escherichia coli. In Northern hybridization experiments, hylB4755 was found to be transcribed as 3.3-kb monocistronic mRNA from its own promoter which exhibits an extended, sigma70-like 10 consensus sequence. Transcript mapping by primer extension analysis placed the major transcription initiation site leading to the longest transcript 38 bp upstream of the translational initiation codon, ATG. E. coli TG1(pHYB100) efficiently synthesized hyaluronan-cleaving enzyme activity at approximately 7000 working units/109 cells, with lyase activity detectable in all principle cellular locations. Zymography and Western analysis identified functional activity in TG1(pHYB100) to be associated with approximately 118, 110 and 94-kDa polypeptides, with the two low molecular weight species constituting the major components of the enzyme purified from the culture supernatant fluid of S. agalactiae 4755. The 118-kDa form was shown to represent the undegraded mature enzyme, whereas the smaller species are likely to arise from proteolytic cleavage in the N-terminal part of the mature protein. The HylB4755 protein showed extensive sequence identity to the homologous enzymes from S. agalactiae 3502 and S. pneumoniae characterized by others but sequence comparisons clearly show that incomplete genes truncated at their 5' ends had been isolated from these two organisms.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Growth inhibition of oral bacteria related to denture stomatitis by anti-candidal chalcones.
AB  - In the antimicrobial therapy of denture stomatitis, it is desirable to inhibit the growth of not only the primary causative organism, Candida albicans, but also other oral bacteria closely associated with the condition. Three synthetic anti-candidal chalcones were characterized and compared for their additional activity in inhibiting these causative bacteria. Among the tested chalcones, 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone showed the highest activity for different Gram-positive bacteria. It inhibited the growth of streptococci, staphylococci and lactobacilli at 25.0-50.0 micrograms/mL which was lower than or comparable to its minimum inhibitory concentration for candida. It functioned with a bactericidal action and leaked 260 nm-absorbing substances from the streptococcal cells. The antimicrobial activity of 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone against both primary and secondary causative agents suggests it could be useful as a potent therapeutic agent in denture stomatitis.
TI  - A 13-kDa protein with a helix-turn-helix motif is encoded by bacterial operons related to the SRP pathway.
AB  - We have identified a 13 kDa protein (p13) in Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides  that is encoded immediately downstream of a protein homologous to E. coli FtsY, a protein taking part in the bacterial signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway. The same organisation of the p13 and FtsY genes occurs in Mycoplasma pneumoniae. PCR analysis of different mycoplasma strains revealed the same organisation in strains belonging to the Mycoplasma mycoides cluster of the mycoplasma phylogenetic tree. Searches in sequence databases identified homologues to p13 in Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus mutans. In these bacteria the p13 protein is encoded by the same operon as a protein homologous to the 54 kDa subunit of SRP. These findings suggest that there is a functional relationship between the p13 protein and the SRP pathway. Sequence analysis of the p13 proteins strongly suggest that they have a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif, indicating that they are gene regulatory proteins.
TI  - Identification of the tetracycline resistance gene, tet(O), in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Five isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to tetracycline but lacking tet(M) were studied. The tetracycline resistance gene, tet(O), was detected for the first time in the pneumococcus. The gene was amplified and sequenced and found to share 99% nucleotide sequence identity and 99, 99, and 98% deduced amino acid sequence identity with the tet(O) resistance genes of Streptococcus mutans, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter jejuni, respectively.
TI  - Xylitol chewing gum in prevention of acute otitis media: double blind randomised  trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether xylitol, which reduces the growth of Streptococcus  pneumoniae, might have clinical importance in the prevention of acute otitis media. DESIGN: A double blind randomised trial with xylitol administered in chewing gum. SETTING: Eleven day care nurseries in the city of Oulu. Most of the children had had problems with recurrent acute otitis media. SUBJECTS: 306 day care children: 149 children in the sucrose group (76 boys; mean (SD) age 4.9 (1.5) years) and 157 in the xylitol group (80 boys; 5.0 (1.4) years). INTERVENTION: Either xylitol (8.4 g a day) or sucrose (control) chewing gum for two months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The occurrence of acute otitis media and antimicrobial treatment received during the intervention and nasopharyngeal carriage of S pneumoniae. RESULTS: During the two month monitoring period at least one event of acute otitis media was experienced by 31/149 (20.8%) children who received sucrose compared with 19/157 (12.1%) of those receiving chewing gum containing xylitol (difference 8.7%; 95% confidence interval 0.4% to 17.0%; P = 0.04). Significantly fewer antimicrobials were prescribed among those receiving xylitol: 29/157 (18.5%) children had at least one period of treatment versus 43/149 (28.9%) (difference 10.4%; 0.9% to 19.9%; P = 0.032). The carriage rate of S pneumoniae varied from 17.4% to 28.2% with no difference between the groups. Two children in the xylitol group experienced diarrhoea, but no other adverse effects were noted among the xylitol users. CONCLUSION: Xylitol seems to have a preventive effect against acute otitis media.
TI  - Characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  - An internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven Gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction assay. The DNA sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were determined. Comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of the SOD proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. Phylogenetic analysis of SOD peptides showed that members of the genera Streptococcus and those of the genera Enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. The method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Effect of xylitol on growth of nasopharyngeal bacteria in vitro.
AB  - Xylitol is known to reduce caries by inhibiting the growth of Streptococcus mutans. We hypothesized that xylitol could also affect the growth of other nasopharyngeal bacterial flora, which could be important when considering respiratory infections caused by these bacteria. We studied this in vitro by adding xylitol to the medium and observed that 1 and 5% xylitol reduced markedly the growth of alpha-hemolytic streptococci, including S. pneumoniae. It reduced slightly the growth of beta-hemolytic streptococci but not that of Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis. The inhibitory growth pattern was similar to that previously seen with S. mutans, which may indicate a similarity in the enzymatic processing of five-carbon sugars such as xylitol. This sugar alcohol is a widely used sweetener, and the concentrations used in our experiments are easily achieved in the oral cavity. If xylitol reduces the growth of S. pneumoniae in the nasopharynx, it could also reduce the carriage of this pathogen and thus have clinical significance in the prevention of pneumococcal diseases.
TI  - Determination of 16S rRNA sequences of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii and phylogenetic relationships among members of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - We determined the 16S rRNA sequences of the type strains of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii and calculated the phylogenetic distances between those organisms and other members of the genus Streptococcus. The viridans group streptococci were separated into five phylogenetic groups; we named these groups the anginosus group, the mitis group, the salivarius group, the bovis group, and the mutans group. S. mitis and S. gordonii clustered in the mitis group together with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus parasanguis at levels of sequence homology of more than 96%. Within this group, S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. pneumoniae exhibited more than 99% sequence homology with each other, although the DNA-DNA similarity values for their total chromosome DNAs were less than 60%.
TI  - Definition of a fundamental repeating unit in streptococcal glucosyltransferase glucan-binding regions and related sequences.
AB  - The C-termini of the glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) of oral streptococci are responsible for glucan binding. These glucan-binding domains (GBDs) are composed of a series of repeated sequences that have been classified into four different classes (A-D) by virtue of sequence similarity and which, by inference, have been suggested to be of functional importance. In contrast, we propose that repeat sequences evolve in response to selection for an increase in the number of copies of a particular domain through multiple duplication events occurring at different times. According to this hypothesis, repeats should possess various degrees of similarity, especially if only key residues are of functional importance. Analysis of the GBDs of the Gtfs indicated that a common fundamental repeat, designated the "YG" repeat, could be discerned within the "A", "B", "C", and "D" repeats. Similar elements were also conserved in the ligand-binding repeats of the Clostridium difficile toxins and the lysins and the PspA protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae, suggesting that similar selective pressures had also been imposed on these sequences. Analysis of the "YG" repeats present in the GtfJ and GtfK of Streptococcus salivarius indicated that some of the "YG" repeats in the GBDs of these proteins had arisen as a result of duplication events involving a series of three sequential "YG" repeats.
TI  - Sequence analysis of scrA and scrB from Streptococcus sobrinus 6715.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 scrA and scrB, which encode sucrose-specific enzyme II of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system and sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase, respectively, have been determined. These two genes were transcribed divergently, and the initiation codons of the two open reading frames were 192 bp apart. The transcriptional initiation sites were determined by primer extension analysis, and the putative promoter regions of these two genes overlapped partially. The gene encoding enzyme IIScr, scrA, contained 1,896 nucleotides, and the molecular mass of the predicted protein was 66,529 Da. The hydropathy plot of the predicted amino acid sequence indicated that enzyme IIScr was a relatively hydrophobic protein. The gene encoding sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase, scrB, contained 1,437 nucleotides. The molecular mass of the predicted protein was 54,501 Da, and the encoded enzyme was hydrophilic. The predicted amino acid sequences of the two open reading frames exhibited approximately 45 and 70% identity with those encoded by scrA and scrB, respectively, from Streptococcus mutans GS5. Homology also was observed between the N-terminal region of the S. sobrinus 6715 enzyme IIScr and other enzyme IIs specific for the glucopyranoside molecule, all of which generate glucopyranoside-6-phosphate during translocation and phosphorylation of the respective substrates. The sequence of the C-terminal domain of the S. sobrinus 6715 enzyme IIScr shared significant homology with enzyme IIIGlc from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium and with the C-terminal domain of enzyme IIBgl from E. coli, indicating that the two functional domains, enzyme IIScr and enzyme IIIScr, were covalently linked as a single polypeptide in S. sobrinus 6715. The deduced amino acid sequence of the gene product of S. sobrinus scrB shared strong homology with sucrase from Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Vibrio alginolyticus, suggesting conservation based on the physiological roles of these proteins.
TI  - Isolation, characterization and sequence analysis of the scrK gene encoding fructokinase of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A gene encoding an ATP-dependent fructokinase from Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was  identified within a 2 kb DNA fragment immediately downstream from the scrA gene. The gene cloned in Escherichia coli also expressed mannokinase activity. Insertional inactivation of this gene in S. mutans markedly decreased both fructokinase and mannokinase activities. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 2 kb fragment revealed an ORF starting 199 bp downstream from the scrA gene, preceded by potential ribosome-binding (Shine-Dalgarno) and promoter-like sequences. This ORF specified a putative protein of 293 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 31,681. The deduced amino acid sequence of the fructokinase gene, scrK, from S. mutans exhibited no significant similarity to fructokinase genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli plasmid pUR400 or Vibrio alginolyticus, but was similar to a comparable gene from Zymomonas mobilis.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a surface protein-releasing activity in Streptococcus mutans and other pathogenic streptococci.
AB  - Surface proteins of Streptococcus mutans have been reported to be released into the culture filtrate at concentrations that vary with the growth conditions. The reason for this is not clear. The present study attempts to investigate the mechanism of the protein release. The results showed that whole cells and raffinose-stabilized protoplasts of S. mutans NG8, when incubated in buffers, were capable of releasing their surface proteins in a pH-dependent manner with optimal release at pH 5 to 6. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the released proteins were very complex. Two proteins, adhesin P1, which has been previously shown to interact with a human salivary agglutinin, and glucosyltransferase have been identified among the released proteins. The release of adhesin P1 and other proteins was found to be inhibited by heat, Cu2+,Zn2+, and thiol-blocking reagents. The inhibition by heat and Cu2+ was irreversible, whereas that by the thiol-blocking reagents was reversible. EDTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and N-p-tosyl-L-lysyl-chloromethyl ketone had no effect on the release of P1, indicating that the release was probably not due to proteolytic activity. Adhesin P1 from Cu(2+)-inactivated S. mutans NG8 protoplasts could be released by mixing with fresh whole cells and protoplasts, but not the culture filtrate, of a P1-negative mutant of NG8, suggesting that the enzyme is located on the cell surface. This P1-releasing activity was also detected in two other strains of S. mutans and one strain each of S. gordonii, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes. The biological role(s) of this enzyme activity remains to be determined. However, owing to its ability to release virulent surface proteins from the cell, it may play an important role in cell surface modulation among the pathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Structural properties and evolutionary relationships of PspA, a surface protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae, as revealed by sequence analysis.
AB  - Analysis of the sequence for the gene encoding PspA (pneumococcal surface protein A) of Streptococcus pneumoniae revealed the presence of four distinct domains in the mature protein. The structure of the N-terminal half of PspA was highly consistent with that of an alpha-helical coiled-coil protein. The alpha-helical domain was followed by a proline-rich domain (with two regions in which 18 of 43 and 5 of 11 of the residues are prolines) and a repeat domain consisting of 10 highly conserved 20-amino-acid repeats. A fourth domain consisting of a hydrophobic region too short to serve as a membrane anchor and a poorly charged region followed the repeats and preceded the translation stop codon. The C-terminal region of PspA did not possess features conserved among numerous other surface proteins, suggesting that PspA is attached to the cell by a mechanism unique among known surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria. The repeat domain of PspA was found to have significant homology with C-terminal repeat regions of proteins from Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus downei, Clostridium difficile, and S. pneumoniae. Comparisons of these regions with respect to functions and homologies suggested that, through evolution, the repeat regions may have lost or gained a mechanism for attachment to the bacterial cell.
TI  - A family of clostridial and streptococcal ligand-binding proteins with conserved  C-terminal repeat sequences.
AB  - Analysis of the derived amino acid sequences of toxins A and B from Clostridium difficile has identified an extraordinarily large number of repeat amino acid units in the C-terminal regions of the proteins. Nearly one third of each of the proteins consist of repeating units which appear, at least in the case of toxin A, to be responsible for carbohydrate binding. Similar repeat units are also found in the C-terminal region of four glucosyltransferases from Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus downei, and in four lytic enzymes from Streptococcus pneumoniae and its bacteriophages (HB-3, Cp-1 and Cp-9). In each case the repeats constitute the ligand-binding portion of the respective enzymes. A glucan-binding protein from S. mutans, which lacks enzymatic activity, has similar repeats spanning almost the entire molecule. This family of ligand-binding proteins appears to be of modular design, with one module consisting of a repetitive ligand-binding domain located in the C-terminal region and the other module(s) providing enzymatic functions.
TI  - Immunoblotting and culture positive endocarditis.
AB  - Serum samples from patients with endocarditis due to Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus lactis and a "nutritionally" variant streptococcus were immunoblotted against antigenic extracts from all five species. In S mutans endocarditis there was an endocarditis specific pattern of IgM against bands of 220, 200, and 190 kilodaltons. In S pneumoniae IgM against antibody of a molecular weight greater than 150 kilodaltons was specific to endocarditis. In S agalactiae IgM against bands at 82, 71, and 66-67 kilodaltons was endocarditis specific. In S lactis endocarditis specific IgM was present against antigenic bands at 105, 66, 61 and 58 kilodaltons. With the "nutritionally" variant streptococcus it was impossible to distinguish between cases of endocarditis and controls.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of Dycal and visible-light-cured Dycal (Prisma VLC Dycal).
AB  
TI  - [In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of fusafungine].
AB  - Fusafungine is an antibiotic extracted from the fungus Fusarium laterium WR strain 437. The antimicrobial activity of fusafungine was determined on strains from laboratory collections and clinical isolates; since fusafungine is not soluble in the classical media, the usual techniques had to be modified. MICs for all the Gram-positive cocci and bacteria tested, aerobic, or anaerobic, were below 30 mcg/ml. The antimicrobial activity included Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MIC less than 18 mcg/ml) and Streptococcus mutans (MIC less than 30 mcg/ml). An antifungal activity was shown for most of the Candida albicans tested (MIC less than 32 mcg/ml) and for different Nocardia sp. (MIC less than 13 mcg/ml). Moreover, fusafungine induced neither acquired resistance nor cross-resistance towards the antibiotics classically used in therapy.
TI  - Cultural and electronmicroscopic studies of the effect of penicillin on tolerant  oral streptococci.
AB  - Penicillin-tolerant and -sensitive strains of oral streptococci were treated with penicillin to determine the production of a post-antibiotic effect (PAE). No PAE was seen with any of the S. sanguis strains tested but most strains of the other oral streptococcal species produced a PAE. Cultures on nitrocellulose filters treated with penicillin were examined by scanning electronmicroscopy and showed that tolerant and sensitive strains lost the ability to adhere to the filter after application of antibiotic. When the filters were treated with beta-lactamase, before processing for microscopy, the tolerant strains but not the sensitive ones recovered and grew in a confluent lawn similar to the control cultures that had not received antibiotic. Transmission electronmicroscopic examination of similarly treated cultures produced comparable results. Bizarre morphological changes were a feature of the tolerant strains of S. sanguis.
TI  - DNA probe for identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - A total of 287 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. The test was positive for all but one isolate, strain DOC-1. This autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of S. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lytA gene. We used lytA as a DNA probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae. In dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the DNA of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate DOC-1. No hybridization occurred when strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus bovis were tested. The lytA gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a DNA probe for the identification of S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Penicillin tolerance among oral streptococci.
AB  - Penicillin tolerance was elicited in 18 of 46 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from the mouths of 19 of 20 healthy subjects and in 31 of 54 consecutive blood-culture isolates of streptococci. Enterococci and Streptococcus sanguis were the organisms most frequently tolerant but the property was also common among isolates of S. mutans, S. mitior and Lancefield Group G streptococci. Pneumococci and S. salivarius were rarely tolerant. When incubated with penicillin at 5 x MIC in batch or continuous cultures, both tolerant and sensitive strains of oral streptococci declined in number less rapidly than S. pyogenes. However, combinations of penicillin and gentamicin killed tolerant and sensitive oral streptococci.
TI  - Deletion analysis of sucrose metabolic genes from a Salmonella plasmid cloned in  Escherichia coli K12.
AB  - The sucrose operon from pUR400, a 78-kbp conjugative Salmonella plasmid, was cloned in Escherichia coli K12. The operon was located in a 5.7-kbp SalI restriction fragment and was subcloned, in each of two possible orientations, using the expression vector pUC18. The insert DNA was restriction mapped and duplicate restriction sites in the insert and in the polylinker of the vector were used to create various deletions promoter distal in the operon sequence. Additional deletions were made with the restriction exonuclease Bal31. Cells containing hybrid plasmids with specified deletions lacked the ability to transport sucrose or were constitutive for hydrolase and/or uptake activities. The scrA (enzyme IIScr) and scrR (regulatory) genes resided within 2900-bp SmaI-SalI DNA fragment and were assigned the order scrB, scrA, scrR. An amplified sucrose-inducible gene product, Mr 68,000, was detected only in the membrane fraction from recombinant cells that contained plasmid with the intact operon sequence. This protein represented 11% of the total membrane protein and was resistant to extraction with 0.5 M sodium chloride, 2% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. The protein did not appear to be the product of either the scrA, scrB, or scrR gene and may therefore represent a previously unidentified membrane-bound sucrose protein. A new gene, scrC, is proposed. In addition, the cloned 5.7-kbp SalI and 2.5-kbp SmaI-SalI DNA fragments failed to hybridize to chromosomal DNA from Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus mutans, and Lactobacillus acidophilus as well as to DNA from a sucrose plasmid from Salmonella tennessee. However, the probes showed weak homology with a 20-kbp EcoRI restriction fragment from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a Streptococcus sanguis DNase necessary for repair of DNA damage induced by UV light and methyl methanesulfonate.
AB  - We developed a method for cloning cellular nucleases from streptococci. Recombinant lambda gt11 bacteriophage containing streptococcal nuclease determinants were identified by the production of pink plaques on toluidine blue O DNase plates. We used this technique to clone a 3.2-kilobase-pair EcoRI fragment with DNase activity from the chromosome of Streptococcus sanguis. The locus was designated don (DNase one) and could be subcloned and stably maintained on plasmid vectors in Escherichia coli. Minicell analyses of various subclones of the don locus allowed us to determine the coding region and size of the Don nuclease in E. coli. The don gene product had an apparent molecular mass of 34 kilodaltons and degraded native DNA most efficiently, with lesser activity against denatured DNA and no detectable activity against RNA. S. sanguis don deletion mutants were constructed by transformation of competent cells with in vitro-prepared plasmid constructs. S. sanguis don deletion mutants retained normal transformation frequencies for exogenously added donor DNA. However, when compared with Don+ wild-type cells, these mutants were hypersensitive to DNA damage induced by UV light and methyl methanesulfonate. An S. sanguis don-specific DNA probe detected homology to chromosomal DNA isolated from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans Bratthall serogroups d and g. Our results suggested that the don locus was the S. sanguis allele of the previously described S. pneumoniae major exonuclease and was involved in repair of DNA damage. Furthermore, hybridization studies suggested that the don locus was conserved among species of oral streptococci.
TI  - Evaluation of aztreonam in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in  patients with cirrhosis.
AB  - To determine the efficacy of aztreonam in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial  peritonitis in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, 14 patients (7 males, 7 females) with 16 Gram-negative infective episodes (12 Escherichia coli and 4 Klebsiella pneumoniae) were treated with aztreonam infusions at doses of 1 gm per 8 hr for a planned 14-day period. Ages ranged from 40 to 75 years with a mean of 57 +/- 10 years. All organisms were highly susceptible to aztreonam (minimal inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms per ml). Serum antibiotic levels were 61.9 +/- 25.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 27 +/- 18.5 micrograms per ml (trough). Ascitic fluid antibiotic levels were 33.6 +/- 22.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 32.7 +/- 16.8 micrograms per ml (trough). Although the symptoms of infection were controlled within 3 days and ascitic fluid cultures became negative after 48 hr, 10 patients (62.5%) died, with hepatorenal syndrome and digestive tract hemorrhage as the principal causes of death. Three patients developed streptococcal superinfections during treatment; Streptococcus faecalis peritonitis in one case and spontaneous bacteremia due to Streptococcus equinus and Streptococcus mutans in the other two. Aztreonam was well tolerated and clinically and bacteriologically efficacious in controlling the infection. Serum and ascitic fluid levels were considerably higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration for the causative organisms, suggesting that lower doses may achieve suitable therapeutic levels. A negative aspect of the antibiotic therapy was the superinfections. The high mortality rate was attributable to the generally poor underlying condition of the patients.
TI  - Cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and Omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  - In recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. In the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (Omniserum). Representatives of the following species were included: Streptococcus bovis, S. equinus, S. intermedius, S. lactis, S. milleri, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. suis, and Aerococcus viridans. Serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. Fifteen (12%) of the strains gave positive reactions by all three methods. Positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. Altogether 84 (68%) strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. Latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. Absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. These findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.
TI  - Mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. It also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. There is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Induction of bacterial L-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. Stable L-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to vancomycin. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), Str. pyogenes, Str. agalactiae, Str. bovis, Str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species and Lactobacillus species. There has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. Enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against Staph. aureus, Str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. The combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of Staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of Staph. epidermidis. It shows indifference against enterococci. Vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against Staph. aureus.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid latex agglutination test for identification of group D streptococci.
AB  - The SeroSTAT latex agglutination test (Scott Laboratories, Inc., Fiskesville, R.I.) for identification of group D streptococci was compared with bile-esculin agar and Lancefield grouping by using 110 clinical isolates of group D streptococci (S. faecalis, 74; S. bovis, 24; S. durans, 3; S. faecium, 9) and 65 viridans streptococci (S. anginosus-constellatus, 2; Streptococcus MG, 15; S. sanguis II, 14; S. mitis, 7; S. mutans, 5; S. salivarius, 8; S. sanguis I, 8; S. acidominimus, 1; S. morbillorum, 2; S. pneumoniae, 3). All strains of group D streptococci were bile-esculin positive. SeroSTAT reactions were falsely positive with 2 strains of S. sanguisII and 1 strain of Streptococcus MG (4.6% of all viridans streptococci tested) and falsely negative with 10 S. bovis, 8 S. faecalis, 1 S. durans, and 6 S. faecium strains (22.7% of all group D streptococci tested). When considered with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, SeroSTAT is a rapid (60-s) and useful test for recognition of group D streptococci.
TI  - Identification of streptococci in a medical laboratory.
AB  - A total of 965 cultures of streptococci received at a reference unit for identification were examined with API-20 Strep kits and also by established methods. The API method, although it needed to be supplemented with additional tests, largely overcame the difficulty that pyogenic streptococci are usually identified by their serological reactions and that biochemical tests are used for the identification of the other streptococci. Representatives of at least 24 established or possible species were identified.
TI  - A-16686, a new antibiotic from Actinoplanes. II. Biological properties.
AB  - A-16686, a new glycoproteide antibiotic obtained from fermentation of an Actinoplanes strain, is active against Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria; MIC values ranged from 0.016 to 2.0 micrograms/ml. A-16686 is bactericidal for growing cells of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, S. mutans, S. mitis and S. sanguis. There is no cross-resistance with clinically used antibiotics. A-16686, administered subcutaneously, is very effective in experimental S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae septicemias in the mouse.
TI  - Isomeric, anti-rhamnose antibodies having specificity for rhamnose-containing, streptococcal heteroglycans.
AB  - L-Rhamnose (6-deoxy-L-mannose) is a constituent carbohydrate unit of microbial, immunogenic heteroglycans and lipopolysaccharides, and often functions as the immunodeterminant group of such immunogens. Two types of anti-rhamnose antibody have now been isolated by affinity chromatography of immune sera obtained from rabbits immunized with vaccines of Streptococcus mutans, strain KI-R, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, type 32. The antibodies of one type were directed at a glycan of L-rhamnose, D-glucose, and D-galactose in the cell wall of S. mutans, and those of the other type, against a capsular glycan of L-rhamnose and D-glucose from S. pneumoniae. The two types of anti-rhamnose antibody were immunologically distinct, and showed no reciprocal cross-reactivity. Additional properties of the two types of antibody were determined; thus, both types of antibody were of the IgG class of immunoglobulins, both possessed molecular weights of 1.45 X 10(5), and both consisted of multiple or isomeric forms.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - Anaerobic radiometric detection of facultative Gram-positive cocci in blood.
AB  - Radiometric detection of facultative gram-positive cocci, particularly streptococci, has been reported to be suboptimal. A recently marketed anaerobic Bactec bottle (7C) with purportedly improved capability to detect facultative gram-positive cocci in blood was compared with the previously available bottle in a study of simulated bacteremia. The Bactec system detected all beta-hemolytic streptococci and enterococci tested. Detection of alpha-hemolytic streptococci was improved in general. However, detection of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus pneumoniae remained suboptimal under anaerobic conditions. A metabolic index unit threshold for positivity of 15 is recommended when employing the anaerobic Bactec bottle.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of human lactoferrin: sensitivity of a variety of microorganisms.
AB  - Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein that has been detected in secretions that  bathe human mucosal tissues. Previous studies have shown that, when this protein is in the iron-free state, it is capable of a direct bactericidal effect on Streptococcus mutans and Vibrio cholerae. The present study demonstrates variable susceptibilities for a variety of different microorganisms. The list of susceptible organisms includes gram-positive and gram-negative microbes, rods and cocci, facultative anaerobes, and aerotolerant anaerobes. Similar morphological and physiological types are represented among the lalctoferrin-resistant bacteria. S. mutans was more resistant to lactoferrin when grown on a sucrose-contaning medium than when it was grown on brain heart infusion broth without added scurose. When a lactoferrin-sensitive, avirulent strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae was passed through mice, the resultant virulent culture became lactoferrin resistant. Since organisms of the same species and even of the same strain (S. pneumoniae) can differ in susceptibility to lactoferrin, it appears that accessibility to the lactoferrin target site may account for differences in susceptibility. It appears that there may be a relation between virulence and resistance to lactoferrin.
TI  - Does penicillin kill bacteria?.
AB  - The thesis is presented that the bactericidal action of penicillin and of other inhibitors of cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis, such as vancomycin and cycloserine, is secondary or tertiary to their ability inhibit specific reactions in the assembly of an osmotically protective cell wall. Examples are given of the inhibition of these reactions, which results in inhibition of cell growth (bacteriostatic action) in the absence of either cellular lysis or rapid loss of viability. Thus, in some instances, inhibitory concentrations of these drugs are, in effect, sublethal; this is true, for example, for Streptococcus mutans, a species of bacteria that is part of the normal flora of the oropharynx and that can cause subacute bacterial endocarditis. On the other hand, the damaging effects of the subminimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin G on Streptococcus faecalis, a species with an active autolytic enzyme system, can be uncovered and converted to a lytic (and lethal) response by partial inhibition of fatty acid synthesis with low concentrations of cerulenin. Some theoretical and practical implications of the occurrence and inhibition of these secondary lethal consequences are discussed.
TI  - Mode of action of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - Biochemical investigations of the mode of action of beta-lactam antibiotics have  focused on the interaction of these drugs with sensitive enzymes and penicillin-binding proteins in vitro and on the correlation of these data with physiological responses to the drugs. The classical response is inhibition of growth and cell death followed by lysis; however, the bacteriostatic response to penicillins, which is seen in certain bacterial species such as Streptococcus mutans and in mutants of species such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, is also described. The biochemical data remain consistent with the acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine donor substrate analogue theory, but multiple targets with differential sensitivity to different beta-lactam antibiotics exist. The relationship of these targets to penicillin-binding proteins and their possible functions in cell growth and division are discussed.
TI  - Superoxide dismutase and oxygen metabolism in Streptococcus faecalis and comparisons with other organisms.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis contains a single superoxide dismutase that has been purified to homogeneity with a 55% yield. This enzyme has a molecular weight of 45,000 and is composed of two subunits of equal size. It contains 1.3 atoms of manganese per molecule. Its amino acid composition was determined and is compared with that for the superoxide dismutases from Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, and Mycobacterium lepraemurium. When used as an antigen in rabbits, the S. faecalis enzyme elicited the formation of a precipitating and inhibiting antibody. This antibody cross-reacted with the superoxide dismutase present in another strain of S. faecalis, but neither inhibited nor precipitated the superoxide dismutases in a wide range of other bacteria, including several other streptococci, such as S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and S. lactis. The inhibiting antibody was used to suppress the superoxide dismutase activity present in cell extracts of S. faecalis and thus allow the demonstration that 17% of the total oxygen consumption by such extracts, in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, was associated with the production of O(2) (-). A variety of bacterial species were surveyed for their content of superoxide dismutases. The iron-containing enzyme was distinguished from the manganese-containing enzyme through the use of H(2)O(2), which inactivates the former more readily than the latter. Some of the bacteria appeared to contain only the iron enzyme, others only the manganese enzyme, and still others both. Indeed, some had multiple, electrophoretically distinct superoxide dismutases in both categories. There was no discernible absolute relationship between the types of superoxide dismutases in a particular organism and their Gram-stain reaction.
