TI  - [Management of COPD exacerbations: from primary care to hospitalization].
AB  - The Societe de pneumologie de langue francaise defines acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE COPD) as an increase in daily respiratory symptoms, basically duration >/= 48h or need for treatment adjustment. Etiology of EA COPD are mainly infectious, viral (rhinovirus, influenzae or parainfluenzae virus, coronavirus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus) or bacterial (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Moraxella catarrhalis). Pollutant exposure can also lead to AE COPD, such as NO2, SO2, ozone or particulates (PM10 and PM2.5). In 30% the etiology remains unknown. Differential diagnoses of AE COPD include infectious pneumonia, pneumothorax, acute heart failure and pulmonary embolism. Presences of signs of severity impose hospitalization: signs of respiratory distress, shock, acute confusion but also fragile patients, insufficient home support or absence of response to initial treatment. AE COPD treatments consist on increase in bronchodilators, chest physiotherapy, and antibiotics if sputum is frankly purulent. Systemic corticosteroids should not be systematic. Recommended dose is 0.5 mg/kg on short course (5-7 days). During hospitalization, oxygen supplementation and thromboprophylaxis could be prescribed. The main interest in non-invasive ventilation is persistent hypercapnia despite optimal medical management. During ambulatory management or hospitalization, clinical assessment at 48-72 h is mandatory.
TI  - Ophthalmic infections in children presenting to Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap, Cambodia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ophthalmic infections cause significant morbidity in Cambodian children but aetiologic data are scarce. We investigated the causes of acute eye infections in 54 children presenting to the ophthalmology clinic at Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap between March and October 2012. FINDINGS: The median age at presentation was 3.6 years (range 6 days - 16.0 years). Forty two patients (77.8%) were classified as having an external eye infection, ten (18.5%) as ophthalmia neonatorum, and two (3.7%) as intra-ocular infection. Organisms were identified in all ophthalmia neonatorum patients and 85.7% of patients with an external eye infection. Pathogens were not detected in either of the intra-ocular infection patients. Most commonly isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (23 isolates), coagulase-negative staphylococci (13), coliforms (7), Haemophilus influenzae/parainfluenzae (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (2). Chlamydia trachomatis DNA was detected in 60% of swabs taken from ophthalmia neonatorum cases. CONCLUSIONS: This small study demonstrates the wide range of pathogens associated with common eye infections in Cambodian children. The inclusion of molecular assays improved the spectrum of detectable pathogens, most notably in neonates.
TI  - Clinical characteristics of Q fever and etiology of community-acquired pneumonia  in a tropical region of southern Taiwan: a prospective observational study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical characteristics of Q fever are poorly identified in the  tropics. Fever with pneumonia or hepatitis are the dominant presentations of acute Q fever, which exhibits geographic variability. In southern Taiwan, which is located in a tropical region, the role of Q fever in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has never been investigated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the study period, May 2012 to April 2013, 166 cases of adult CAP and 15 cases of acute Q fever were prospectively investigated. Cultures of clinical specimens, urine antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, and paired serologic assessments for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Q fever (Coxiella burnetii) were used for identifying pathogens associated with CAP. From April 2004 to April 2013 (the pre-study period), 122 cases of acute Q fever were also included retrospectively for analysis. The geographic distribution of Q fever and CAP cases was similar. Q fever cases were identified in warmer seasons and younger ages than CAP. Based on multivariate analysis, male gender, chills, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes were independent characteristics associated with Q fever. In patients with Q fever, 95% and 13.5% of cases presented with hepatitis and pneumonia, respectively. Twelve (7.2%) cases of CAP were seropositive for C. burnetii antibodies, but none of them had acute Q fever. Among CAP cases, 22.9% had a CURB-65 score >==2, and 45.8% had identifiable pathogens. Haemophilus parainfluenzae (14.5%), S. pneumoniae (6.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.0%) were the most common pathogens identified by cultures or urine antigen tests. Moreover, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and co-infection with 2 pathogens accounted for 9.0%, 7.8%, and 1.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In southern Taiwan, Q fever is an endemic disease with hepatitis as the major presentation and is not a common etiology of CAP.
TI  - Complications of adenotonsillectomy: a case report of meningitis due to dual infection with nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and a prospective study of the rate of postoperative bacteremia.
AB  - CASE REPORT: Bacterial meningitis is a rare complication of adenotonsillectomy. We present a case of meningitis due to nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae after adenotonsillectomy. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns indicated that the oral cavity was the source of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. BLOOD CULTURE STUDY: As bacteremia is thought to be one of the etiologies of meningitis, we prospectively investigated the rate of bacteremia as a complication of adenotonsillectomy. Of the 46 patients included in the study, mean age of five years old, 11 (24%) had positive blood cultures during the operation. H. influenzae was the commonest organism grown (seven cultures), three of seven produced beta-lactamase, followed by S. pneumoniae (one culture), H. parainfluenzae (one culture), Peptostreptococcus micros (one culture), and Veillonella spp. (one culture). The bacteria were composed of tonsil or adenoid surface cultures in eight of 11 patients (73%). CONCLUSIONS: We present a rare case of meningitis complicating a adenotonsillectomy procedure, in a three years old boy. Meningitis is a rare complication of adenotonsillectomy, but bacteremia which may lead to meningitis occurs frequently, as the results.
TI  - Purulent pericarditis caused by Haemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  - Bacterial pericarditis is a rare disease in the era of antibiotics. Purulent pericarditis is most often caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae. The number of H. parainfluenzae infections has been increasing; in rare cases, it has caused endocarditis. We report a case of purulent pericarditis caused by H. parainfluenzae in a 62-year-old woman who reported a recent upper respiratory tract infection. The patient presented with signs and symptoms of pericardial tamponade. Urgent pericardiocentesis restored her hemodynamic stability. However, within 24 hours, fluid reaccumulation led to recurrent pericardial tamponade and necessitated the creation of a pericardial window. Cultures of the first pericardial fluid grew H. parainfluenzae. Levofloxacin therapy was started, and the patient recovered. Haemophilus parainfluenzae should be considered in a patient who has signs and symptoms of purulent pericarditis. Prompt diagnosis, treatment, and antibiotic therapy are necessary for the patient's survival. To our knowledge, this is the first report of purulent pericarditis caused by H. parainfluenzae.
TI  - [Etiology of acute respiratory tract infection in hospitalized children in Suzhou from 2005 to 2011].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the etiology of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) in hospitalized children in Suzhou from 2005 to 2011. METHODS: A total of 10 243 hospitalized children with ARI in Children's Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University from September 2005 to October 2011 were enrolled in the study. The clinical information was collected; and the nasopharyngeal aspiration fluid and serum samples were sent for multi-pathogen detection. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus type A and B (IV-A, IV-B), parainfluenza virus type 1-3 (PIV-1-PIV-3) and adenovirus (ADV) were detected by direct immunofluorescence assay. Human bocavirus (HBoV), mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) were detected by fluorescent quantitative PCR while human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was detected by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Sputum culture was applied to detect bacterial infection and quantitative ELISA was adopted to detect the specific antibodies of MP and CP. The results of the above detections were analyzed, and thereby to explore the prevalent pathogens among different aging children and the seasonal distribution and characteristics of the disease. RESULTS: At least one type of pathogen was detected in 5871 out of 10 243 hospitalized children and the overall positive rate was 57.32%; including 3326 virus samples with positive rate at 32.47% (3326/10 243), 2870 bacteria samples with positive rate at 28.02% (2870/10 243) and 2759 atypical pathogen samples,with positive rate at 26.94% (2759/10 243). MP was the most common pathogen,whose detected rate was 25.74% (2637/10 243). The median age of children with RSV (6 months) or PIV-3(8 months) infection was younger than the median age of all hospitalized children (12 months) (chi(2) = 380.992, 34.826, P < 0.05). While the median age of children with ADV (42 months), HBoV (14 months) or IV-A (24 months) infection was older than it of all hospitalized children (chi(2) = 83.583, 13.169, 18.012, P < 0.05). The median age of children with MP (30 months),streptococcus pneumoniae (17 months) or haemophilus parainfluenzae (21 months) infection was older than it of all hospitalized children (chi(2) = 728.299, 60.463, 8.803, P < 0.05). The detected rate of RSV in the groups of children aging less than 6 months, 7-12 months, 2-3 years, 4-5 years and over 6 years was separately 25.59% (840/3283), 17.05% (333/1953), 11.85% (310/2615), 6.68% (90/1347), and 2.87% (30/1045); which decreased while the age grew (chi(2) = 178.46, P < 0.01). Conversely, the positive rate of MP increased with the age growing (chi(2) = 379.21, P < 0.01). The rate in the above groups was 8.25% (271/3283), 19.46% (380/1953), 33.00% (863/2615), 41.43% (558/1347), 54.07% (565/1045), respectively. RSV and IV-A were prevalent in winter, whose detected rates were 35.73% (941/2634) and 4.44% (117/2634) respectively.hMPV infection was common in spring, with the detected rate at 10.55% (278/2634); while HBoV infection was common in summer and autumn, with the positive rate at 9.99% (149/1491) and 9.71% (98/1009). MP and CP were frequently detected in summer, up to 31.27% (819/2619) and 10.07% (43/427) respectively. RSV was the most common pathogen in bronchiolitis (33.27% (866/2603)) and MP was the most common pathogen in bronchopneumonia (26.05% (1152/4422)) and lober pneumonia (52.25% (267/511)). CONCLUSION: MP and RSV were the most common pathogens in respiratory tract infection in hospitalized children. The novel virus included hMPV and HBoV, which also played an important role in ARI. Different pathogens were prevalent in different ages; with respective seasonal distribution and characteristics.
TI  - Ocular surface infections in northeastern state of malaysia: a 10-year review of  bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ocular surface infections that include infections of conjunctiva, adnexa, and cornea have the potential risk of causing blindness within a given population. Empirical antibiotic therapy is usually initiated based on epidemiological data of common causative agents. Thus, the aims of this study were to determine the bacterial agents and their susceptibility patterns of isolates from ocular surface specimens in our hospital. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis and records of bacterial isolates from ocular surface specimens in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia from January 2001 to December 2010 were examined. Specimens were processed according to standard laboratory procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations. Only single, nonrepetitive isolates were included in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,267 isolates were obtained during the study period, which comprised Staphylococcus aureus (n = 299, 23.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 194, 15.3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 108, 8.5%), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 100, 7.9%), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 84, 6.6%), and Enterobacter spp. (n = 81, 6.4%). Fungi contributed to 4.4% of the total isolates. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated that gram-positive bacteria were generally resistant to gentamicin (19%-57%), whereas gram-negative bacteria were resistant to chloramphenicol (27%-58%). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the above results, knowledge of the initial Gram stain findings is imperative before the commencement of empirical antibiotic therapy. Therefore, a simple Gram staining for all eye specimens is highly recommended.
TI  - Spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. So far, data on this topic among Chinese are lacking. METHODS: A surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with AECOPD at five areas in China between October 2006 and April 2008. The sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. Agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with AECOPD. The predominant bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), Haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by Haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), Moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and Escherichia coli (3.6%). The majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with AECOPD in China. Haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in AECOPD. This study provides evidence for local surveillance of AECOPD pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in China.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents tested against bacterial isolates causing skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired respiratory tract infections isolated from the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa (2010).
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with in vitro bactericidal activity against resistant Gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and common Gram-negative organisms, including wild-type Enterobacteriaceae. We evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftaroline and selected comparator agents against bacterial isolates collected from patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) and community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTI) in the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa. A total of 2351 isolates, 1100 from SSTI and 1251 from CARTI, were collected from 25 medical centers distributed across 8 countries as part of the 2010 AWARE ceftaroline surveillance program and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftaroline was very active against S. aureus (MIC50/90, 0.25/1 mug/mL; 93.4% susceptible), including MRSA (MIC50/90, 1/2 mug/mL; 80.6% susceptible). Against beta-hemolytic streptococci, ceftaroline demonstrated greater activity (MIC90, 0.015 mug/mL) than penicillin (MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL). Ceftaroline was also highly active against viridans group streptococci (MIC90, 0.12 mug/mL). Similarly to ceftriaxone, ceftaroline activity against Escherichia coli (MIC50/90, >32/>32 mug/mL) and Klebsiella spp. (MIC50/90, 0.12/>32 mug/mL) was compromised by the high prevalence of isolates with an ESBL phenotype in the region, particularly in China. Ceftaroline was the most potent beta-lactam tested against S. pneumoniae (MIC50/90 of 0.015/0.25 mug/mL; 99.8% susceptible by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI] criteria), and it was also highly potent against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50/90, </= 0.008/0.03 mug/mL; 100% susceptible by CLSI criteria). Ceftaroline was also active against H. parainfluenzae (MIC50/90, </= 0.008/0.015 mug/mL) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/mL). In summary, ceftaroline showed potent in vitro activity against a large collection of bacterial isolates (2351) associated with SSTI and CARTI from the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa.
TI  - Ocular penetration of topical antibiotics: study on the penetration of chloramphenicol, tobramycin and netilmicin into the anterior chamber after topical administration.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To compare penetration in the aqueous humour of topically applied antibiotics. DESIGN: Randomized prospective study, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Perugia, Italy PARTICIPANTS: Patients undergoing cataract surgery. METHODS: One hundred twenty-two patients were included: 14 received one drop of chloramphenicol suspension; 12 one application of chloramphenicol gel; 11 one drop of netilmicin suspension; 13 one drop of tobramycin suspension; 37 repeated instillations of chloramphenicol suspension every 10 min for a total of four drops; and 35 repeated instillations of chloramphenicol gel every 10 min for a total of four drops. Samples were taken immediately before surgery from the anterior chamber in order to determine the antibiotic by means of high-performance liquid chromatography. Samples were taken 45-190 min after the eye drops were instilled. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraocular penetration of chloramphenicol, netilmicin and tobramicyn. RESULTS: After a single administration, netilmicin and tobramycin were undetectable, whereas the chloramphenicol suspension reached a mean concentration of 0.23 +/- 0.21 mug/mL, and the chloramphenicol gel a mean concentration of 0.13 +/- 0.14 mug/mL. After repeated administrations, the mean concentrations of the chloramphenicol suspension and gel were 0.60 +/- 0.26 mug/mL and 0.58 +/- 0.18 mug/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Tobramycin and netilmicin do not reach detectable concentrations, whereas chloramphenicol, after multiple administrations, reaches concentrations that are effective against Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, Pasteurella multocida and Streptococcus pneumoniae. This means that chloramphenicol can be rationally used in the prophylaxis and treatment of infections supported by sensitive germs.
TI  - Summary of ceftaroline activity against pathogens in the United States, 2010: report from the Assessing Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance Evaluation (AWARE) surveillance program.
AB  - The Assessing Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance Evaluation (AWARE) surveillance  program is a sentinel resistance monitoring system designed to track the activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents. In the United States, a total of 8,434 isolates were collected during the 2010 surveillance program from 65 medical centers distributed across the nine census regions (5 to 10 medical centers per region). All organisms were isolated from documented infections, including 3,055 (36.2%) bloodstream infections, 2,282 (27.1%) respiratory tract infections, 1,965 (23.3%) acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, 665 (7.9%) urinary tract infections, and 467 (5.5%) miscellaneous other infection sites. Ceftaroline was the most potent beta-lactam agent tested against staphylococci. The MIC(90) values were 1 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; 98.4% susceptible) and 0.5 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Ceftaroline was 16- to 32-fold more potent than ceftriaxone against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcal strains. All staphylococcus isolates (S. aureus and CoNS) were inhibited at ceftaroline MIC values of </= 2 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also displayed potent activity against streptococci (MIC(90), 0.015 mug/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococci; MIC(90), 0.25 mug/ml for penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae). Potent activity was also shown against Gram-negative pathogens (Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis). Furthermore, wild-type strains of Enterobacteriaceae (non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL]-producing strains and non-AmpC-hyperproducing strains) were often susceptible to ceftaroline. Continued monitoring through surveillance networks will allow for the assessment of the evolution of resistance as this new cephalosporin is used more broadly to provide clinicians with up-to-date information to assist in antibiotic stewardship and therapeutic decision making.
TI  - Identification of bacterial DNA in noninfectious pleural fluid with a highly sensitive PCR method.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial DNA due to bacterial translocation has been identified in noninfectious ascitic fluid samples. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the possible presence of bacterial DNA in the pleural fluid of patients with pleural effusions of noninfectious origin, using a highly sensitive PCR-based method. METHODS: Pleural fluid samples from 175 patients (average age +/- SD: 69 +/- 14 years) with noninfectious pleural effusion (62 transudates, 113 exudates) were analyzed. Bacterial DNA was detected using nested PCR with amplification of a fragment of the gene r16S, with 2 amplification protocols, i.e. low sensitivity (10 and 40 cycles) and high sensitivity (40 and 40 cycles). RESULTS: With the less sensitive amplification process, only 1 sample was positive (Haemophilus parainfluenzae in a patient with hepatic hydrothorax). With the highly sensitive nested PCR method, bacterial DNA was identified in the pleural fluid, of both transudative and exudative origin, of 75 of the 175 patients (43%). In cases of isolation of a single bacterium, the more frequent were Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Streptococcus pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of its origin, bacterial DNA can be identified in almost half of noninfectious pleural effusions by using a highly sensitive PCR-based method. The possible clinical significance or prognostic value of these findings deserves to be evaluated.
TI  - [The role of macrolides in treatment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AB  - Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cause a lot of hospital admissions, mortality, and strongly influence health-related quality of life. Approximately half of COPD exacerbations are associated with bacterial infections and many patients have lower airways colonization. Current guidelines recommend antibotic therapy in course of COPD exacerbation for patients with sputum purulence and suggest correlation between severity of symptoms and the type of infecting pathogen. The most common bacterial pathogens isolated in COPD exacerbation are Haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The presence of these bacteria are more common for mild and moderate exacerbations. More virulent organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found in more severe cases. Atypical pathogens such Chlamydophila and Mycoplasma could cause exacerbation alone or they could coexist with typical pathogen. Rules of antibiotic therapy and usefulness of macrolides in treatment of COPD exacerbation has been described in the article.
TI  - Antimicrobial characterisation of CEM-101 activity against respiratory tract pathogens, including multidrug-resistant pneumococcal serogroup 19A isolates.
AB  - CEM-101 is a novel fluorinated macrolide-ketolide with potent activity against bacterial pathogens that are susceptible or resistant to other macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B))-ketolide agents. CEM-101 is being developed for oral and parenteral use in moderate to moderately severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. The objective of this study was to assess the activity of CEM-101 and comparators against contemporary respiratory tract infection (RTI) isolates. A worldwide sample of organisms was used, including Streptococcus pneumoniae [n=168; 59.3% erythromycin-resistant and 18 multidrug-resistant (MDR) serogroup 19A strains], Moraxella catarrhalis (n=21; 11 beta-lactamase positive), Haemophilus influenzae (n=100; 48 beta-lactamase positive), Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus (n=12), and Legionella pneumophila (n=30). Testing and interpretation were performed using reference Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methods. CEM-101 was very potent against S. pneumoniae [minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms (MIC90)=0.25 mg/L; highest MIC at 0.5 mg/L] and was 2- and > or =32-fold more active than telithromycin and clindamycin, respectively. CEM-101 also demonstrated potent activity against S. pneumoniae MDR-19A strains (MIC90=0.5 mg/L). CEM-101 was the most potent antimicrobial agent tested against L. pneumophila, with all MIC values at < or = 0.015 mg/L (telithromycin MIC90=0.03 mg/L). CEM-101 was as potent as azithromycin against Haemophilus spp. RTI pathogens (MIC90=2 mg/L), with no variations for beta-lactamase production. CEM-101 MIC values against M. catarrhalis were all at < or =0.5mg/L. Interestingly, CEM-101 potency was ca. 6 log(2) dilutions greater than telithromycin MIC results among 44 beta-haemolytic streptococci having telithromycin MICs > or = 2 mg/L. CEM-101 exhibited the greatest potency and widest spectrum of activity against RTI pathogens among the tested MLS(B)-ketolide agents (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin, clindamycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) and was comparable overall with levofloxacin.
TI  - NXL-103, a combination of flopristin and linopristin, for the potential treatment of bacterial infections including community-acquired pneumonia and MRSA.
AB  - Novexel is developing the novel, orally active, semisynthetic streptogramin NXL-103, which has potential therapeutic application in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, community- or hospital-acquired MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections. NXL-103 is a combination of streptogramin A:streptogramin B components, initially developed in a 70:30 dose ratio. In multiple in vitro studies, NXL-103 demonstrated potent activity against different types of bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. NXL-103 was not affected by the resistance profiles of bacteria against other commonly used antibiotics. In phase I clinical trials, NXL-103 achieved bactericidal levels in plasma and was generally well tolerated, with side effects primarily on the gastrointestinal system. The first phase II trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy of NXL-103 against community-acquired pneumonia revealed that the compound was comparable with amoxicillin. NXL-103 has promise to become an important agent in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and complex skin and soft tissue infections, pending further development.
TI  - Assessment of the bioequivalence of two formulations of clarithromycin extended-release 500-mg tablets under fasting and fed conditions: a single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-period, two-way crossover study in healthy Jordanian male volunteers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clarithromycin extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of adults with acute maxillary sinusitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae; acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis due to H influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, M catarrhalis, or S pneumoniae; or community acquired pneumonia due to H influenzae, H parainfluenzae, M catarrhalis, S pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the bioequivalence of test and reference formulations of clarithromycin extended-release 500-mg tablets under fasting and fed conditions. METHODS: This was a single-dose, randomized, open-label, 2-period, 2-way crossover study with a 1-week washout period between doses. Separate bioequivalence studies (fasting and fed) were performed in 2 groups of healthy male Jordanian volunteers. Eighteen blood samples were obtained from each volunteer over 38 hours after drug administration. Clarithromycin concentrations were determined in plasma using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method with electrochemical detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters of clarithromycin (C(max), T(max), AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity), lambda(z) [first-order elimination rate constant], and t((1/2))) were calculated and analyzed statistically. Tolerability was assessed based on changes in vital signs and laboratory tests, and by questioning subjects about adverse events. RESULTS: Thirty-eight volunteers each participated in the fasting and fed studies. The mean ages of participants in the fasting and fed studies were 26.7 and 27.6 years, respectively; their mean weight was 71.2 and 70.9 kg and mean height was 171.3 and 179.0 cm. Under fasting conditions, the arithmetic mean (SD) C(max) was 569.4 (189.3) ng/mL for the test formulation and 641.2 (202.0) ng/mL for the reference formulation, with a geometric mean ratio of 0.88. The arithmetic mean AUC(0-t) was 8602.9 (4105.1) and 8245.3 (4122.4) ng . h/mL in the respective formulations, with a geometric mean ratio of 1.06. The arithmetic mean T(max) was 8.0 (5.6) and 6.1 (3.8) hours. In the fed study, the C(max) and AUC of both formulations were significantly increased relative to the fasting study (P < 0.05). The arithmetic mean C(max) of the 2 formulations was 1183.0 (637.5) and 1199.6 (496.3) ng/mL, with a geometric mean ratio of 0.93. The arithmetic mean AUC(0-t) was 12,981.2 (7849.0) and 11,822.9 (5790.2) ng . h/mL, with a geometric mean ratio of 1.06. The arithmetic mean T(max) was 5.7 (2.8) and 6.7 (2.5) hours. The 90% CI for the ratio (test:reference) of log-transformed C(max) and AUC values was within the acceptance range of 0.80 to 1.25. The 2 formulations were both well tolerated, and no adverse events were reported during the study. CONCLUSIONS: In these fasting and fed studies in healthy male Jordanian volunteers, the 2 formulations of clarithromycin extended-release 500-mg tablets were found to be bioequivalent according to the US Food and Drug Administration regulatory definition. Administration with food significantly increased the rate and extent of absorption of both products, with no significant effect on their bioequivalence.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of the isolated bacteria from children with acute respiratory infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution and drug resistance of the isolated bacteria from children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) in Dalian. METHODS: Between January 2006 and February 2007, 930 children with ARI were enrolled, including 364 with acute upper respiratory infection (AURI), and 566 with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI). The AURI children, who did not receive antimicrobial agent treatment or received oral antimicrobial agents 1-2 times, had bacterial cultures of pharyngeal swab. The ALRI children, who received intravenous antibacterial agents more than 3 days, had bacterial cultures of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Isolated bacteria were identified by the ATB system (Bio-Merieux, France). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by means of Kirby-bauer. RESULTS: A total of 404 isolates (43.4%) were identified. Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 22.5%, 12.1% and 7.4% respectively. In the isolates from AURI, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 43.9%, 22.0% and 9.1% respectively; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Nonfermenters accounted for 4.5%, 8.3% and 3.0% respectively. In the isolates from ALRI, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 12.1%, 7.4% and 6.6% respectively; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Nonfermenters accounted for 16.9%, 13.2% and 21.8% respectively. The resistant rates of Haemophilus to ampicillin and TMP-SMZ were 29.3% and 32.9% respectively, and to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefalotin, cefaclor, cefuroxime and cefotaxime were 12.1%, 10.0%, 10.0%, 11.4% and 5.7%, respectively. The resistant rate of Haemophilus to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefaclor, tetracycine and TMP-SMZ in the ALRI group were significantly higher than that in the AURI group (P<0.05 or 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In Dalian, Haemophilus was the main isolate of children with ARI. The distribution of bacteria was different between ALRI and AURI. In ALRI, Gram-negative bacilli were in a higher proportion, and the resistant rates of Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefaclor were higher.
TI  - Effect of eucalyptus essential oil on respiratory bacteria and viruses.
AB  - The activity of Eucalyptus globulus essential oil was determined for 120 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 isolates of S. pneumoniae, 40 isolates of S. agalactiae, 20 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 40 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, 30 isolates of H. parainfluenzae, 10 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and two viruses, a strain of adenovirus and a strain of mumps virus, all obtained from clinical specimens of patients with respiratory tract infections. The cytotoxicity was evaluated on VERO cells by the MTT test. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration. H. influenzae, parainfluenzae, and S. maltophilia were the most susceptible, followed by S. pneumoniae. The antiviral activity, assessed by means of virus yield experiments titered by the end-point dilution method for adenovirus, and by plaque reduction assay for mumps virus, disclosed only a mild activity on mumps virus.
TI  - [Study on the relationship between airway bacterial infections and acute exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to observe the bacterial infections of respiratory tract in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). METHODS: 130 patients with AECOPD in outpatient department, emergency room or in wards were studied prospectively. Patients were divided into different groups according to both Anthonisen's classification and their lung function status. Sputum were cultured together with bacteria positive rate and types of AECOPD as well as the damage degree of lung function were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 130 sputum samples, 50 showed positive through culture (38.5%) and 60 strains of pathogens were isolated. Predominant pathogens isolated would include Haemophilus parainfluenzae (20/60), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5/60) and Haemophilus influenzae (10/60). Positive rate of bacterial culture in type 1 AECOPD was 55.0%, higher than those of type 2 (38.3%) and type 3 (18.5%)(P = 0.01) and was increasing with the decrease of lung function of patients with AECOPD (P < 0.02). CONCLUSION: Positive rate of bacterial culture in patients of type 1 AECOPD was the highest one. Haemophilus parainfluenzae was one of the most important pathogens in AECOPD. There seemed a correlation between positive result of bacterial culture and the severity of COPD.
TI  - Patterns and dynamics of airway colonisation in mechanically-ventilated patients.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns and dynamics of the microbiota in the airways of ventilated patients. Seventy-four mechanically-ventilated patients were recruited consecutively, and oropharyngeal, tracheal and bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid specimens were collected 48 h after intubation, and every 72 h thereafter until the patient was extubated or a total of five sample sets had been collected. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) pathogens were identified, quantified and genotyped. Microbial findings were highly correlated both between airway locations and over time when samples were taken no more than 72 h apart. If no VAP pathogen was present in the oral flora, it was unlikely to be found in a lower airway sample; i.e., the positive predictive value of the oropharyngeal sample was 0.73 (95% CI 0.67-0.80), and the negative predictive value was 0.95 (95% CI 0.92-0.99). Colonisation with Enterobacteriacae, non-fermentative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus was monoclonal in the airways and over time, whereas colonisation with microbes normally found in the oropharynx, i.e., Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, was polyclonal. When antibiotics were used, the chance of recovering VAP pathogens from all sampling sites was reduced three-fold. No correlation was observed between a bacterial count of > or =10(4) CFU/mL in BAL fluid and chest X-rays compatible with VAP.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of 3-day azithromycin versus 5-day moxifloxacin for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Antibiotic therapy is of clinical benefit in certain patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB). In this randomised, investigator-blinded, multicentre trial, azithromycin (500mg once a day (qd) for 3 days) was compared with moxifloxacin (400mg qd for 5 days) for the treatment of outpatients with AECB (forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV(1)) >35%). Of 342 patients randomised to either treatment, 169 received azithromycin and 173 received moxifloxacin. The mean age in the azithromycin and moxifloxacin groups was 56.4 years and 55.5 years, respectively. In the intent-to-treat analysis, clinical success rates for azithromycin and moxifloxacin were comparable at Days 10-12 (90% versus 90%, respectively) and Days 22-26 (81% versus 82%, respectively). Among patients who were culture-positive at baseline for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis or Haemophilus parainfluenzae, clinical efficacy for azithromycin versus moxifloxacin at Days 10-12 was 93% versus 84%, respectively, and at Days 22-26 it was 89% versus 73%, respectively. The incidence of at least one treatment-related adverse event (AE) in the azithromycin and moxifloxacin groups was 18.3% and 19.1%, respectively. The most common AEs were diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain and vaginitis. Most treatment-related AEs were of mild or moderate severity, with no serious treatment-related AEs. One subject in the moxifloxacin group discontinued treatment owing to a treatment-related AE (precordial pain and dry throat). Compliance with both regimens was >90%. Three-day azithromycin and 5-day moxifloxacin demonstrate comparable efficacy and safety for the treatment of AECB in outpatients.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of propolis and its active principles alone and in combination with macrolides, beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones against microorganisms responsible for respiratory infections.
AB  - Propolis is produced by bees and is reported to have several pharmaceutical properties. Its antibacterial activity against strains causing upper respiratory tract infections is particularly important: propolis might be used as a therapeutic agent to prevent the bacterial infections that sometimes overlap viral infections. In this study the in vitro activity of both an alcoholic solution and a hydroglyceric extract of propolis, as well as its active principles, was tested against bacteria responsible for respiratory infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes). We also evaluated the in vitro activity of a combination of propolis and its active principles and some beta-lactams, macrolides and fluoroquinolones. Our results, though not demonstrating a clearly synergistic activity between antibiotics and propolis and its constituents, show the possibility of using natural preparations, due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, to enhance antibacterial therapy.
TI  - [Bacterial tracheitis as the cause of acute respiratory insufficiency in 2 teenagers].
AB  - A 13-year-old girl and a 12-year-old boy developed acute respiratory insufficiency caused by an upper airway obstruction, which necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation. Cultures from throat swabs from the girl and boy yielded Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. Diagnoses of bacterial tracheitis were confirmed by tracheoscopy and both children were treated with antibiotics. After 11 and 4 days of mechanical ventilation, respectively, they were successfully extubated. No further complications were encountered. Bacterial tracheitis is a rare but significant cause of upper airway obstruction in children.
TI  - The Sentinel Project: an update on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in  community-acquired respiratory Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus spp. in Italy.
AB  - A total of 460 Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus spp. collected from respiratory infections during 2000 was tested for their susceptibility to 15 selected antibiotics. Overall, penicillin resistance among pneumococci was 10.5%, while lack of susceptibility to macrolides, co-trimoxazole, tetracycline and chloramphenicol reached 35.2%, 26.2%, 22.6% and 6.0%, respectively. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and levofloxacin were the most potent compounds (100% and 99.9% susceptible strains, respectively). Among isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, beta-lactamase production (12.5% and 10%, respectively), and co-trimoxazole (19.9% and 40.0%) and clarithromycin (11.2% and 40.0%) resistance were the prevalent threats. This study confirms the trend observed in Italy since 1992: macrolide resistance among respiratory microorganisms is increasing, while several drugs including amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, third generation injectable cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones remain active on the great majority of these pathogens.
TI  - Treatment of acute exacerbation of severe-to-very severe COPD with azithromycin in patients vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Sixty-five consecutive eligible adult patients, who were treated as outpatients for stable severe-to-very severe COPD, were enrolled in the study. All of them received 23-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine intramuscularly. Patients were seen monthly, as well as whenever they had symptoms suggestive of an exacerbation, at our outpatient clinic. Eighteen out of 65 patients suffered from acute exacerbation (AECOPD). Three of these patients presented two episodes of AECOPD. Patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD received azithromycin 500 mg/day once daily for 3 days and a short course of oral prednisolone 25 mg/die. In 16 cases, a single species was isolated, while in the remaining 5 cases at least two species were recovered. Clinical cure or improvement at the end of therapy (3-5 days post-therapy) was reported in 17 episodes of AECOPD with no relapse at the late post-therapy (10-14 days after the completion of treatment). Bacteriologic eradication or presumptive eradication rates at the end of therapy were 86% (24 out of 28 isolates). Azithromycin eradicated all isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, H. parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella spp. isolated at baseline. Eradication of Sta aureus occurred in 1 of 3 isolates whereas azithromycin was unable to eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Our data seem to indicate that pneumococcal vaccination reduces the possibility that an AECOPD is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. This finding allows the use of antibiotics such as azithromycin, which, otherwise, should be avoided because of resistances.
TI  - In vitro investigation of the indirect pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing  microorganisms in the nasopharyngeal microflora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nasopharyngeal microflora contains some beta-lactamase-producing microorganisms. In this study, we investigated in vitro on the indirect pathogenicities of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (H. parainfluenzae) and Moraxella catarrhalis (M. catarrhalis) against the antipneumococcul activities of some beta-lactams. METHODS: We compared the antimicrobial and bactericidal activities of beta-lactams against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP) with or without presence of the enzymes of two species of beta-lactamase-producing microorganisms, H. parainfluenzae and M. catarrhalis. RESULTS: When adding the enzymes extracted from these two beta-lactamase-producing microorganisms in equivalent amounts of 10(7) CFU/spot, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of amoxicillin (AMPC) and cefaclor (CCL) increased to >64 microg/mL. Even third-generation cephalosporins, such as cefditren (CDTR) and ceftriaxone (CTRX) showed marked increases with the enzyme of M. catarrhalis. In time-kill kinetics, same phenomenon was observed in mixed culture indicating the indirect pathogenicities of distinct bacteria, not extracted enzymes, on the cidal activities of beta-lactams against PSSP. Clavulanic acid (CVA)/AMPC, faropenem (FRPM), and imipenem (IPM) were not affected by these beta-lactamase-producing strains with respect to their activities against PSSP. However, these two beta-lactamase-producing strains and their enzymes did not show any significant influence on the antipneumococcul activities of beta-lactams, until the number of bacterial cells reached >10(8) CFU/mL. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that these two species of beta-lactamase-producing microorganisms in the nasopharyngeal microflora may act as indirect pathogens on the antipneumococcul activities of beta-lactams with reflecting their substrate profiles, but this is dependent on sufficient amounts of enzyme for their influence as indirect pathogens.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 milligrams twice daily for 5 days versus amoxicillin-clavulanate at 875/125 milligrams twice daily for 7 days in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - This randomized, controlled trial was designed to show that a short, 5-day course of pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg (Augmentin XR) is as effective clinically as a longer, 7-day course of conventional amoxicillin-clavulanate at 875/125 mg (both given twice daily) in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB). Amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg was designed to extend the therapeutic levels of amoxicillin in serum over the 12-h dosing interval, compared with conventional formulations, to eradicate bacterial strains for which amoxicillin MICs were < or =4 microg/ml while retaining efficacy against beta-lactamase-producing pathogens. A total of 893 patients were randomized and received study medication (amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg for 443 patients and 875/125 mg for 450 patients). Overall, 141 patients receiving amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg and 135 receiving the comparator formulation had at least one pathogen identified at screening. Amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg was as effective clinically in the per-protocol (PP) population at the test of cure (days 14 to 21, primary efficacy endpoint) as amoxicillin-clavulanate at 875/125 mg (clinical success rates of 93.0 and 91.2%, respectively; treatment difference, 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.2, 5.7). Bacteriological success in the bacteriology PP population was high for both formulations (amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg, 76.7%; amoxicillin-clavulanate at 875/125 mg, 73.0%; treatment difference, 3.8; 95% CI, -7.5, 15.0). Both therapies were well tolerated, with a similar incidence of adverse events. Fewer than 5% of patients in each group withdrew from the study due to adverse events. The shorter, 5-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg was shown to be as effective clinically as a longer, 7-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate at 875/125 mg, with high bacteriological efficacy and no difference in tolerability.
TI  - Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of garenoxacin in patients with  community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Garenoxacin (T-3811ME, BMS-284756) is a novel, broad-spectrum des-F(6) quinolone  currently under study for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. This analysis assessed garenoxacin population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationships for safety (adverse effects [AE]) and antimicrobial activity (clinical cure and bacteriologic eradication of Streptococcus pneumoniae and the grouping of Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis). Data were obtained from three phase II clinical trials of garenoxacin administered orally as 400 mg once daily for 5 to 10 days for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and sinusitis. Samples were taken from each patient before drug administration, 2 h following administration of the first dose, and on the day 3 to 5 visit. Individual Bayesian estimates of the fu (fraction unbound), the Cmax, and the fu for the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (fu AUC(0-24)) were calculated as measurements of drug exposure by using an ex vivo assessment of average protein binding. Regression analysis was performed to examine the following relationships: treatment-emergent AE incidence and AUC(0-24), Cmax, or patient factors; clinical response or bacterial eradication and drug exposure (fu Cmax/MIC, fu AUC(0-24)/MIC, and other exposure covariates); or disease and patient factors. Garenoxacin pharmacokinetics were described by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. Clearance was dependent on creatinine clearance, ideal body weight, age, obesity, and concomitant use of pseudoephedrine. The volume of distribution was dependent on weight and gender. Patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction had, on average, approximately a 16 or 26% decrease in clearance, respectively, compared to patients of the same gender and obesity classification with normal renal function. AE occurrence was not related to garenoxacin exposure. Overall, clinical cure and bacterial eradication rates were 91 and 90%, respectively, for S. pneumoniae and 93 and 92%, respectively, for the grouping of H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and M. catarrhalis. The fu AUC(0-24)/MIC ratios were high (>90% were >200), and none of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic exposure measurements indexed to the MIC or other factors were significant predictors of clinical or bacteriologic response. Garenoxacin clearance was primarily related to creatinine clearance and ideal body weight. Although garenoxacin exposure was approximately 25% higher for patients with moderate renal dysfunction, this increase does not appear to be clinically significant as exposures in this patient population were not significant predictors of AE occurrence. Garenoxacin exposures were at the upper end of the exposure-response curves for measurements of antimicrobial activity, suggesting that 400 mg of garenoxacin once daily is a safe and adequate dose for the treatment of the specified community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Etiological agents of lower respiratory tract infections in Japanese children.
AB  - To investigate the etiology of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, we conducted a prospective, population-based study covering the total population < 15 years of age in 16 municipalities in Hokkaido, Japan, during the period of April 2000 to March 2001. Chest radiographs were available for all cases (n = 921; 398 as pneumonia and 523 as bronchitis) and paired sera for serologic assays were available for more than half of the cases. The following specimens were also collected: nasopharyngeal swabs for viral, bacteriological, mycoplasmal and chlamydial studies, blood for serology and blood culture. The children were then followed-up on days 3, 7 and 14. Specific infecting organisms were identified in a total of 853 (92.6%) out of 921 patients (398 cases of pneumonia and 523 cases of bronchitis) including 205 with mixed infection as follows: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 252 (274%) patients; respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, 188 (20.4%); influenza A virus, 110 (11.9%); Streptococcus pneumoniae, 95 (10.3%); Haemophilus influenzae, 90 (9.8%); Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 35 (3.8%); Staphylococcus aureus, 29 (3.1%); adenovirus, 27 (2.9%); Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 (1.3%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 7 (0.8%); Chlamydia pneumoniae, 6 (0.7%); and other agents, 2 (0.2%). Mycoplasma infections were seen even in patients less than 5 years and RS and influenza A virus infections in patients more than 5 years of age. The importance of M. pneumoniae and RS virus in the etiology of lower respiratory infections in Japanese children was confirmed.
TI  - Amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release tablets: a new antimicrobial for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract infections are among the most common health disorders requiring medical care and are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and direct and indirect costs. Recent increases in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance have resulted in reduced susceptibility of the most common respiratory tract bacterial pathogens to a number of antimicrobials. Amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release (ER) tablets (Augmentin XR, GlaxoSmithKline) is a new formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate that retains activity against betalactamase-producing organisms whilst increasing the activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae through elevated and sustained plasma amoxicillin concentrations. The bilayer tablet provides immediate release of clavulanate and both immediate and sustained release of amoxicillin to maintain therapeutic concentrations of amoxicillin over longer periods of the dosing interval. In clinical trials of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), amoxicillin/clavulanate ER was shown to have excellent bacteriological and clinical success rates, even in patients infected with antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and was found to be generally well tolerated. Amoxicillin/clavulanate ER is approved in the US for the treatment of patients with ABS or CAP caused by beta-lactamase-producing pathogens (ie, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus) and S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration = 2.0 microg/ml).
TI  - Activities of a new oral streptogramin, XRP 2868, compared to those of other agents against Streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus species.
AB  - MIC methodology was used to test the antibacterial activity of XRP 2868, a new oral combination of two semisynthetic streptogramins, RPR 132552A and RPR 202868, compared to activities of other antibacterial agents against pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. For 261 pneumococci, XRP 2868 and pristinamycin MICs were similar, irrespective of penicillin G and erythromycin A susceptibilities (MIC at which 50% of isolates were inhibited [MIC(50)], 0.25 micro g/ml; MIC(90), 0.5 micro g/ml), while quinupristin/dalfopristin had MICs which were 1 to 2 dilutions higher. Single components of both XRP 2868 and quinupristin/dalfopristin had higher MICs. Erythromycin A, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and clindamycin MICs were higher for penicillin G-intermediate and -resistant than -susceptible pneumococci. Against 150 H. influenzae strains, all compounds tested had unimodal MIC distributions. XRP 2868 had an overall MIC(50) of 0.25 micro g/ml and an MIC(90) of 1.0 micro g/ml, with no differences between beta-lactamase-positive, beta-lactamase-negative, and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains. Of note was the similarly low activity of one of its components, RPR 132552A. Pristinamycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin had MICs of 0.125 to 8.0 micro g/ml; quinupristin alone had MICs of 8.0 to >64.0 micro g/ml, and dalfopristin had MICs of 1.0 to >64.0 micro g/ml. Erythromycin A, azithromycin, and clarithromycin had modal MICs of 4.0, 1.0, and 8.0 micro g/ml, respectively. MICs of all compounds against H. parainfluenzae were 1 to 2 dilutions higher than against H. influenzae. XRP 2868 showed potent activity against pneumococci and Haemophilus strains irrespective of their susceptibility to other agents.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - Etiology of acute otitis media in childhood and evaluation of two different protocols of antibiotic therapy: 10 days cefaclor vs. 3 days azitromycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common childhood infection that is frequently treated by antibiotics. There are no prospective and comprehensive trials evaluating childhood AOM for etiologic pathogens and resistance pattern in Turkey. The aims of the study were to determine the bacterial etiologies and resistance patterns, and identify the efficacy and the relapse rates of 3 days of azitromycin and 10 days of cefaclor therapy in AOM. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, single-blind, open study was carried out in 78 cases of AOM. Mean age was 30.7+/-27 months. Tympanocentesis and aspiration of middle ear fluid (MEF) were used to obtain purulent material from the middle ear. Group 1 consisted of the cases (n=41) on azitromycin therapy and Group 2 (n=37) on cefaclor. Dosage of azitromycin was 10 mg/kg per day for 3 days and cefaclor 40 mg/kg per day for 10 days. The patients were evaluated on days 3-5 (second visit), day 10 (third visit), and day 30 (fourth visit) during follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 50 species were isolated from 44 of 78 cases from which materials were obtained (44/78; 56.4%). Most frequently isolated microorganism was Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=18; 36%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (n=11; 22%), S. aureus (n=9; 18%), Moraxella catarrhalis (n=4; 8%), and group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS, n=4; 8%). Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from three cases and H. parainfluenzae from one. Penicillin and amoxicillin resistances of bacteria were found to be 40 and 36%, respectively. The frequency of penicillin and amoxicillin resistance in </=24-month age group was 59 and 66.6%, respectively. The patients did not demonstrate significant differences in terms of cure rate on the third to fifth day (Group 1: 32.5%; Group 2: 36.4%), 10th day (Group 1: 76.9%; Group 2: 84.8%), and on 30th day (Group 1: 91.3%; Group 2: 81.8%). There were no significant differences with respect to side effects, relapse, and re-infection rate between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In more than half of the AOM cases, bacteria were isolated from MEF and most frequently isolated organisms were S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. aureus. Three-day azitromycin therapy was as effective as 10-day cefaclor therapy.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - This study compared the in vitro activity of ertapenem, ceftriaxone, cefepime, ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate against 381 aerobic and facultative bacterial pathogens isolated from 320 patients with acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis or community-acquired pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 54.6% of the isolates. The ertapenem MIC was < or =2 mg/L for 98.4% of isolates and > or =8 mg/L for 1.0% (all methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Ertapenem had the most potent activity against Enterobacteriaceae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and its activity against H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae, all strains of which were susceptible, was not altered by beta-lactamase production. Only one S. pneumoniae strain, a penicillin-resistant isolate, was resistant to ertapenem. Ertapenem was highly active in vitro against pyogenic bacteria recovered from patients with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Relationship between bacterial colonisation and the frequency, character, and severity of COPD exacerbations.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are prone  to frequent exacerbations which are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Stable COPD patients often have lower airway bacterial colonisation which may be an important stimulus to airway inflammation and thereby modulate exacerbation frequency. METHODS: Twenty nine patients with COPD (21 men, 16 current smokers) of mean (SD) age 65.9 (7.84) years, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) 1.06 (0.41) l, FEV(1) % predicted 38.7 (15.2)%, FEV(1)/FVC 43.7 (14.1)%, inhaled steroid dosage 1.20 (0.66) mg/day completed daily diary cards for symptoms and peak flow over 18 months. Exacerbation frequency rates were determined from diary card data. Induced sputum was obtained from patients in the stable state, quantitative bacterial culture was performed, and cytokine levels were measured. RESULTS: Fifteen of the 29 patients (51.7%) were colonised by a possible pathogen: Haemophilus influenzae (53.3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (33.3%), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (20%), Branhamella catarrhalis (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). The presence of lower airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state was related to exacerbation frequency (p=0.023). Patients colonised by H influenzae in the stable state reported more symptoms and increased sputum purulence at exacerbation than those not colonised. The median (IQR) symptom count at exacerbation in those colonised by H influenzae was 2.00 (2.00-2.65) compared with 2.00 (1.00-2.00) in those not colonised (p=0.03). The occurrence of increased sputum purulence at exacerbation per patient was 0.92 (0.56-1.00) in those colonised with H influenzae and 0.33 (0.00-0.60) in those not colonised (p=0.02). Sputum interleukin (IL)-8 levels correlated with the total bacterial count (rho=0.459, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Lower airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state modulates the character and frequency of COPD exacerbations.
TI  - Cefditoren pivoxil.
AB  - Cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. Cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. Cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the Gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the important Gram-negative pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefditoren does not have antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. In healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/L and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/L, respectively. Cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. In two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. Clinical cure rates in patients with AECB were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. In patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. In uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. These cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes. The most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.
TI  - The efficacy and safety of two oral moxifloxacin regimens compared to oral clarithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - An international multi-centre, randomized, prospective, double-blind study compared oral moxifloxacin (200 mg or 400 mg once daily for 10 days) with oral clarithromycin (500 mg, twice daily for 10 days) in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The clinical success rate in the evaluable population at the primary efficacy assessment, 3-5 days after the end of study treatment, was 93.9% in patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin; 94.4%, with 400 mg moxifloxacin; and 94.3%, with clarithromycin. Clinical success rates were maintained at follow-up, 21-28 days after the end of treatment: 90.7% (200 mg moxifloxacin), 92.8% (400 mg moxifloxacin) and 92.2% (clarithromycin). The 95% confidence intervals indicated that all three treatment regimens were equally effective in treating CAP. At follow-up, the 400 mg moxifloxacin dose had a slightly higher observed cure rate than the 200 mg moxifloxacin dose, but this was not statistically significant. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (42%), Haemophilus influenzae (19%), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (10%), Moraxella catarrhalis (6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%) and Staphylococcus aureus (4%). The bacteriological success rate (eradication and presumed eradication) was 72.5% (29/40) for 200 mg moxifloxacin, 78.7% (37/47) for 400 mg moxifloxacin and 70.7% (29/41) for clarithromycin. The adverse event profile was comparable between the three treatment groups. Most adverse events, possibly or probably related to the study drug, were generally mild or moderate in severity and mostly related to the digestive system: diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain in 200 mg moxifloxacin patients; diarrhoea, liver function abnormalities and nausea in 400 mg moxifloxacin patients and liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea and taste perversion in clarithromycin patients. Study drugs were discontinued because of adverse events in 7/229 (3%) patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin, 11/224 (5%) with moxifloxacin 400 mg and 11/222 (5%) with clarithromycin. In all assessments, moxifloxacin was at least as effective clinically, and as well tolerated as clarithromycin in the treatment of CAP. Bacteriological success rates in moxifloxacin-treated patients were greater than those of clarithromycin. Moxifloxacin, given once daily, is free of many drug-drug interactions and requires no dosage adjustments in most renal hepatic deficient patients.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Bacterial infection in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2000: a state-of-the-art review.
AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. The precise role of bacterial infection in the course and pathogenesis of COPD has been a source of controversy for decades. Chronic bacterial colonization of the lower airways contributes to airway inflammation; more research is needed to test the hypothesis that this bacterial colonization accelerates the progressive decline in lung function seen in COPD (the vicious circle hypothesis). The course of COPD is characterized by intermittent exacerbations of the disease. Studies of samples obtained by bronchoscopy with the protected specimen brush, analysis of the human immune response with appropriate immunoassays, and antibiotic trials reveal that approximately half of exacerbations are caused by bacteria. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the most common causes of exacerbations, while Chlamydia pneumoniae causes a small proportion. The role of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and gram-negative bacilli remains to be established. Recent progress in studies of the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of infection in the human respiratory tract and in vaccine development guided by such studies promises to lead to novel ways to treat and prevent bacterial infections in COPD.
TI  - Absence of bacterial colonization of the airways after therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy without stenting.
AB  - Following airway stenting, bacterial colonization of the airways with potentially pathogenic micro-organisms occurs within 4 weeks after treatment in the majority of patients. The objective of this study was to prospectively investigate whether nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy (using laser, cryotherapy, mechanical dilatation or debridement) is followed by airway colonization or infection. Protected specimen brush sampling of the central airways and quantitative culture were performed immediately prior to, and 4 weeks after nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy in 20 consecutive patients with central airway lesions. Prior to therapeutic bronchoscopy, airway colonization/infection was present in nine of 20 (45%) patients. In these nine patients, 10 different potential pathogens were identified: Streptococcus pneumoniae (four cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (three), Haemophilus influenzae (two), and Serratia marcescens (one). Eight of these nine patients had a history of postobstructive infections, of which three were currently being treated with antibiotics. Four weeks following therapeutic bronchoscopy, airway colonization/infection was present in five of 20 (25%) patients, each of whom had airway colonization/infection prior to bronchoscopy. In three of these five patients, the same organisms were found 4 weeks after bronchoscopy as at baseline bronchoscopy. In two of five patients new organisms were identified: one case of Streptococcus viridans and one case of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, both considered to be nonpathogens. In four of nine patients with airway colonization/infection prior to bronchoscopy, the airways were clear of micro-organisms after the procedure. The authors conclude that: 1) nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy is not complicated by airway colonization or infection by new potential pathogens; and 2) therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy led to clearing of airway colonization/infection in almost half of the patients studied.
TI  - Do bacteria cause exacerbations of COPD?
AB  - Exacerbations of COPD, which include combinations of dyspnea, cough, wheezing, increased sputum production (and a change in its color to green or yellow), are common. The role of bacterial infection in causing these episodes and the value of antibiotic therapy for them are debated. An assessment of the microbiological studies indicates that conventional bacterial respiratory pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, are absent in about 50% of attacks. The frequency of isolating these organisms, which often colonize the bronchi of patients in stable condition, does not seem to increase during exacerbations, and their density typically remains unchanged. Serologic studies generally fail to show rises in antibody titers to H influenzae; the only report available demonstrates none to Haemophilus parainfluenzae; and the sole investigation of S pneumoniae is inconclusive. Trials with vaccines against S pneumoniae and H influenzae show no clear benefit in reducing exacerbations. The histologic findings of bronchial biopsies and cytologic studies of sputum show predominantly increased eosinophils, rather than neutrophils, contrary to what is expected with bacterial infections. The randomized, placebo-controlled trials generally show no benefit for antibiotics, but most have studied few patients. A meta-analysis of these demonstrated no clinically significant advantage to antimicrobial therapy. The largest trials suggest that antibiotics confer no advantage for mild episodes; with more severe attacks, in which patients should receive systemic corticosteroids, the addition of antimicrobial therapy is probably not helpful.
TI  - Respiratory pathogens: assessing resistance patterns in Europe and the potential  role of grepafloxacin as treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms.
AB  - Although most respiratory tract infections (RTI) are caused by viruses, various bacteria, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, are common causes of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis. Empirical antibiotic therapy of patients with RTI must take account of the increasing prevalence of resistance among the predominant pathogens. Europe-wide susceptibility surveillance studies have revealed that resistance to penicillin and macrolides is highly prevalent among isolates of S. pneumoniae from France and Spain. Uniquely, in Italy, macrolide resistance is highly prevalent while the prevalence of penicillin resistance is low. Resistance to other antibiotic classes, including chloramphenicol, doxycycline and, in particular, co-trimoxazole, is associated with penicillin resistance in pneumococci, but resistance to the fluoroquinolones is rare. beta-Lactamase production is the principal mechanism of resistance in isolates of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, with fluoroquinolone resistance being detected rarely in these pathogens. In 1998 a surveillance study involving 15 European countries determined the susceptibilities of many respiratory pathogens to a range of antimicrobials, including grepafloxacin. The MIC(90) of grepafloxacin for 1251 isolates of S. pneumoniae was 0.25 mg/L, the MICs for only five strains being >2 mg/L, and 99.4% of all of the isolates tested were inhibited by concentrations </=0.5 mg/L. The MIC(90)s of grepafloxacin for 587 isolates of H. influenzae and 323 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae were 0.015 and 0.06 mg/L, respectively, while that for 509 isolates of M. catarrhalis was 0.03 mg/L. The MIC(90)s for 1164 isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 435 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.12 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. Other studies have shown grepafloxacin to be highly active against clinical isolates of Legionella pneumophila (MIC(90) 0.015 mg/L), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/L) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (MICs 0.06-0.12 mg/L). Current susceptibility data indicate that fluoroquinolone resistance rates among bacterial respiratory tract pathogens are low in European countries. The enhanced potency and activity of grepafloxacin against isolates of S. pneumoniae, including those exhibiting resistance to unrelated classes of antibiotics, together with its activity against other respiratory tract pathogens, suggest that this drug has considerable potential as empirical therapy of patients with a wide range of RTI.
TI  - Randomized, double-blind study of short-course (5 day) grepafloxacin versus 10 day clarithromycin in patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of grepafloxacin were compared with clarithromycin in a randomized, double-blind, multicentre clinical trial of 805 patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB). Patients were randomized to receive grepafloxacin 400 mg od for either 5 (n = 273) or 10 days (n = 268) or clarithromycin 250 mg bd for 10 days (n = 261). Patients were assessed pre-treatment, 3-5 days during treatment, 1-3 days post-treatment and at follow-up (21-28 days post-treatment). The clinical success rates for the evaluable patients were 91% in the 5 day grepafloxacin group, 95% in the 10 day grepafloxacin group and 86% in the clarithromycin group. At follow-up, respective rates were 72%, 81% and 73%. A total of 513 pathogens were isolated from the pre-treatment sputum specimens of 400 (49%) patients. The primary pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae (36% of isolates), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (27%), Moraxella catarrhalis (12%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11%) and Staphylococcus aureus (3%). Pathogens were eradicated or presumed eradicated at post-treatment in 85%, 91% and 58% of evaluable patients treated with grepafloxacin for 5 days, grepafloxacin 10 days and clarithromycin 10 days, respectively. The eradication rates in both grepafloxacin groups were significantly greater than the clarithromycin group (P<0.001). All treatments were well tolerated and incidence of drug-related adverse events in each group was comparable. This study demonstrates that both a 5 and a 10 day regimen of grepafloxacin 400 mg od are as clinically and bacteriologically effective as in the treatment of ABECB clarithromycin 250 mg bd. for 10 days.
TI  - Management of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - In chronic bronchitis, a common respiratory illness marked by chronic productive  cough and caused largely by cigarette smoking, bacterial exacerbations are thought to be a common cause of progressive airway damage. Common bacterial pathogens, found in 50% to 60% of episodes, include Haemophilus influenzae (the most common), as well as Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics, especially beta-lactam drugs such as amoxicillin, is increasingly common in these pathogens. In this illness, clinical risk stratification based on age, history and comorbidity is an important strategy. Patients in the lowest risk group likely have viral infections and require no specific treatment. Patients in the higher risk groups require aggressive treatment to avoid treatment failure, which can lead to prolonged hospitalization and complications. Preventive therapies (smoking cessation and influenza vaccination) are worthwhile measures for these patients.
TI  - Effectiveness of short-course therapy (5 days) with grepafloxacin in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Three hundred eighty-nine patients were enrolled in a double-masked, multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing the clinical and bacteriologic efficacies and safety of a 5-day course (n = 195) versus a 10-day course (n = 194) of grepafloxacin 400 mg once daily in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB). Patients in the 5-day treatment group received placebo on days 6 through 10. Bacteriologic assessments were based on cultures of sputum specimens obtained before and, when possible, during and after treatment. Organisms were isolated from the pretreatment sputum specimens of 332 of 388 (86%) patients, the primary pathogens being Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus (29%, 19%, 4%, 5%, and 5% of isolates, respectively). Among isolates tested for beta-lactamase production, results were positive in 25% of H influenzae isolates and 90% of M catarrhalis isolates. Forty-two percent of S pneumoniae isolates demonstrated reduced susceptibility (intermediate or high-level resistance) to penicillin. A satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) was achieved in 83% (128 of 155) and 81% (122 of 150) of clinically evaluable patients treated with grepafloxacin for 5 or 10 days, respectively. Pathogens were eradicated or presumed eradicated in 77% (106 of 138) and 80% (98 of 123) of bacteriologically evaluable patients treated with grepafloxacin for 5 or 10 days, respectively. The 2 treatment groups were equivalent with respect to both clinical and bacteriologic efficacy, and no statistically significant differences in the incidence of drug-related adverse events were seen between the 2 groups. Substantial symptom relief was evident with both treatment regimens by the first during-treatment measurement, which occurred between days 3 through 5. These results indicate that treatment with 400 mg grepafloxacin once daily for 5 days is as well tolerated and effective as treatment for 10 days in patients with ABECB. The lower cost compared with a 10-day regimen and the increased likelihood that patients will complete the entire shorter, once-daily regimen make the 5-day grepafloxacin regimen a useful therapeutic option in the treatment of ABECB.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of high dose intravenous ciprofloxacin in the treatment of bacterial pneumonia. Italian Ciprofloxacin Study Group.
AB  - One hundred and fifty three hospitalized patients were enrolled in an open, prospective, multi-center study on the efficacy and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin (400 mg i.v., b.i.d.) for acute bacterial pneumonia: 93 (63%) patients were valid for efficacy out of 148 valid for intention-to-treat analysis. The most commonly isolated organisms from 93 valid-for-efficacy patients were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17%), Haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae (17%), Streptococcus aureus (14%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11%). Cure was achieved in 89/93 (95.7%) valid-for-efficacy patients; effective eradications were obtained in 42 (45%) and presumed eradications in 48 (52%) of the 93 patients. Mild or moderate adverse events (AE) occurred in 13/153 (8.5%) patients assessable for safety; all but one AE were rapidly reversible and only one treatment-stop (0.65%) was decided. The treatment of acute bacterial pneumonias with high-dose parenteral ciprofloxacin appears to be efficacious and well tolerated.
TI  - Etiology, susceptibility, and treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of complicated chronic bronchitis in the primary care setting: ciprofloxacin 750 mg b.i.d. versus clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. Bronchitis Study Group.
AB  - Although controversial, antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) appears beneficial in patients with a history of repeated infections, those who have comorbid illnesses, and those with marked airway obstruction. In a community-based, open, randomized trial, the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin (CIP) 750 mg and clarithromycin (CLA) 500 mg, each given twice daily for 10 days, were compared in 2180 patients with AECB (1083 CIP, 1097 CLA). Patients were >40 years of age and had complicated/severe AECB episodes defined as at least three episodes within the past year, at least three comorbid conditions, previous failed antibiotic treatment for AECB within the previous 2 to 4 weeks, or community susceptibility data indicating a high number of resistant pathogens. Significant bacterial isolates (>10(5) colony-forming units per milliliter) from homogenized sputa were identified. Susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials was determined by the microbroth dilution technique. The majority of patients were white (83%) and were current or previous smokers (81%). Mean patient age was 62 years. A history of at least three AECB episodes in the previous year was reported by 54% of CIP-treated patients and 53% of CLA-treated patients. Of 777 primary isolates positively identified and cultured from 673 patients, the bacterial pathogens isolated and their incidence included Haemophilus species, 28%; Moraxella catarrhalis, 18%; Enterobacteriaceae, 18%; Staphylococcus aureus, 17%; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 7%; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4%. Beta-lactamase production was found in 38% of Haemophilus influenzae, 10% of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and 85% of M catarrhalis isolates. Thirty-four percent of S pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration > or =0.12 mg/L). Among the 673 patients who were valid for clinical assessment and had a pretherapy pathogen isolated, clinical success and overall bacteriologic eradication rates at the end of therapy were 93% and 98% for CIP versus 90% and 96% for CLA. The differences between CIP and CLA did not reach statistical significance. Superinfections were reported significantly more frequently in CLA-treated (3%) versus CIP-treated patients (1%). Eradication rates for specific organisms for CIP and CLA, respectively, were Haemophilus species, 99% and 93%; M catarrhalis, 99% and 100%; S pneumoniae, 91% and 92%; and Enterobacteriaceae, 100% and 95%. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 12% of CIP-treated patients and 10% of CLA-treated patients. CIP 750 mg b.i.d. had a higher (but not statistically significant) clinical and bacteriologic cure rate than CLA 500 mg b.i.d. in the treatment of patients with bacteriologically proven complicated/severe AECB. The causative bacterial pathogens of AECB appear to be evolving, with a predominance of gram-negative and other resistant organisms observed. Thus antibiotic therapy for at-risk patients with AECB should include agents that have activity against gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - [Selection of antibacterial therapy for treatment of infections in elderly patients].
AB  - Examination of 60 elderly outpatients with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) revealed that 73 per cent of the patients isolated the pathogen associations and only 27 per cent isolated the monocultures. Grampositive cocci including Streptococcus pneumoniae were isolated from 70 per cent of the patients, Haemophilus influenzae and H.parainfluenzae were isolated from 20 per cent of the patients and Acinetobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginsa were isolated from 10 per cent of the patients. The patients were treated with ciprofloxacin, cefaclor or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid. Ciprofloxacin proved to be the most efficient agent. The regimens of the ofloxacin use in a dose of 400 mg orally once a day or in a dose of 200 mg intravenously twice a day for 2-4 days followed by the oral use for 6-8 days in the treatment of 24 patients with LRTI hospitalized into a therapeutic unit were compared. it was shown (pharmacokinetically as well) that the regiment with the drug use in the single dose was more efficient. Lomefloxacin was suggested to be the most advantageous drug in the treatment of elderly patients with LRTI because of its easy use, practically no dependence of the pharmacokinetics on the patient age and almost no nephrotoxic action.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on tazobactam/piperacillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), a combination drug of piperacillin (PIPC) with the new beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam (TAZ), were carried out in the field of pediatrics. 1. After intravenous administration of TAZ/PIPC at a dose of 25 mg/kg to one child, the peak plasma levels of TAZ and PIPC were 24.4 micrograms/ml and 119 micrograms/ml respectively after 5 min. The half-lives of TAZ and PIPC were 0.48 and 0.60 hours respectively. Same as 50 mg/kg to two children, the peak plasma levels of TAZ and PIPC were 17.5, 32.2 micrograms/ml and 92.8, 163 micrograms/ml after 5 min. The half-lives of TAZ and PIPC were 0.37, 0.50 hours and 0.51, 0.59 hours. A ratio of TAZ to PIPC was about 1 to 4 in plasma levels. The cumulative urinary recovery rates of TAZ and PIPC in the first 6 hours after intravenous administration were 15.8, 64.9% and 39.8, 53.4%. 2. The antibacterial activity of TAZ/PIPC against clinically isolated organisms was determined. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC were < or = 0.05 microgram/ml against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae and > or = 1.56 micrograms/ml against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. 3. The clinical efficacy of TAZ/PIPC could be evaluated in 14 patients with various bacterial infections, and was evaluated as "excellent" in 9 patients and as "good" in 5. The overall clinical efficacy rate in 14 cases was 100% and excellent was 64.3%. Bacteriological efficacy rate was 91.7% (10/11). 4. As a side effect, loose stool was observed in one case, no abnormal laboratory test values were observed. It has been concluded that TAZ/PIPC was a useful drug in the field of pediatrics.
TI  - Sparfloxacin vs ofloxacin in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, comparative study. Sparfloxacin Multicenter ABECB Study Group.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Comparison of efficacy and safety of sparfloxacin vs ofloxacin for treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB). DESIGN: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized study. SETTING: Sixty-eight private offices and outpatient clinics in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: Seven hundred ninety-eight adults with ABECB, as confirmed by the acute onset of new (or worsened from the immediate premorbid state) cough and sputum production. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization 1:1 to sparfloxacin, 400 mg on day 1, then 200 mg once daily, or ofloxacin, 400 mg twice daily, with matching comparator placebos, given concurrently for 10 consecutive days. RESULTS: The primary efficacy parameter was overall response in the bacteriologically evaluable population. Overall success rates in this population were 85.3% and 89.3% for sparfloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. The two-sided 95% confidence interval was -9.9, 1.9, indicating that sparfloxacin was statistically equivalent to ofloxacin. The all-treated population analysis was similar to that in the evaluable population. Bacterial eradication rates were similar in both treatment groups for Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The frequency of adverse events overall was comparable in the two treatment groups. The sparfloxacin group had a lower frequency of digestive and nervous system adverse events, but a higher frequency of photosensitivity reactions than the ofloxacin group. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily oral treatment with 200 mg sparfloxacin (after initial 400 mg dose) is as effective as twice-daily treatment with 400 mg ofloxacin in patients with ABECB.
TI  - Cefaclor: a contemporary look at susceptibility of key pathogens from around the  globe.
AB  - The orally administered cephalosporin antibiotic, cefaclor, has been available for clinical use in many countries since 1979. Because widespread antibiotic use is often cited as a factor in the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, we sought to determine the degrees of resistance to cefaclor expressed by key pathogens recently isolated in 10 countries widely distributed around the world. Using the E-test, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for cefaclor and several comparator antibiotics against approximately 700 fresh clinical isolates of each of six bacterial species. The results demonstrated that > 90% of Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase producing and non-producing), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (beta-lactamase producing and non-producing), Moraxella catarrhalis (> 90% beta-lactamase producing), and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and 85% of Escherichia coli were susceptible to cefaclor at the NCCLS interpretive breakpoints. MIC distributions showed that there has been no change in the activity of cefaclor against penicillin-susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae since 1977.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of twice-daily ciprofloxacin 750 mg in the treatment of patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and pneumonia.
AB  - In a review of the US Bayer ciprofloxacin (CIP) database, an analysis was undertaken to summarize the effectiveness and tolerability of CIP 750 mg BID in the treatment of patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) and pneumonia. In five controlled studies, comparator (COMP) agents included ampicillin, intravenous cefuroxime/cefaclor, and other unspecified agents. Primary efficacy end points were clinical success (resolution plus improvement) and bacteriologic eradication at the end of therapy. The incidence of adverse events for CIP 750 mg BID was compared with that for COMP and with that in the CIP 500-mg-BID AECB and pneumonia clinical trials database. In five uncontrolled studies, 443 patients received CIP 750 mg BID; in 5 controlled trials comprising 344 patients, 169 received CIP 750 mg BID and 175 received COMP. Clinical success for CIP was 93% (368/396) and 99% (160/162), respectively, in the uncontrolled and controlled studies versus 98% (156/160) for COMP agents. Corresponding bacteriologic eradication rates for CIP 750-mg-BID-treated patients were 77% (273/356) and 95% (122/128), respectively, and 77% (96/125) for COMP agents. Overall bacteriologic eradication by organism for CIP 750 mg BID included Streptococcus pneumoniae 96% (51/53), Haemophilus influenzae 98% (92/94), Haemophilus parainfluenzae 100% (56/56), Moraxella catarrhalis 100% (14/14; 13 of 14 organisms were isolated in patients with AECB), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 66% (135/204). Drug-related adverse events were reported in 113 (26%) CIP 750-mg-BID-treated patients in uncontrolled trials and in 62 (37%) CIP 750-mg-BID- and 61 (35%) COMP-treated patients in controlled trials. In the combined data from the CIP 750-mg-BID uncontrolled and controlled trials, adverse events occurred with similar frequency compared with COMP except for nausea (CIP 10%, COMP 7%) and diarrhea (CIP 3%, COMP 13%). In conclusion, CIP 750 mg BID provided excellent clinical success rates in the treatment of patients with AECB and pneumonia. CIP 750 mg BID was well tolerated compared with the COMP agents administered.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of grepafloxacin 600 mg daily for 10 days in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of grepafloxacin in treating patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was assessed in an open-label, noncomparative study. Patients (N = 273) received grepafloxacin 600 mg QD for 10 days. A total of 237 patients (87%) completed the study. In assessable patients, the clinical success rate at follow-up (4 to 6 weeks after the last dose) was 89% (211/238 patients). In microbiologically assessable patients, the eradication rate at follow-up was 95% (86/91 isolates). Grepafloxacin was highly effective in the treatment of bacterial CAP caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (irrespective of penicillin susceptibility), Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus and in the therapy of atypical pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. Grepafloxacin was well tolerated, with the most frequently reported drug-related adverse events being taste perversion and nausea. Grepafloxacin 600 mg QD for 10 days was highly effective and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with CAP.
TI  - Comparison of cefdinir and cefaclor in treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Six hundred ninety patients were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of cefdinir with those of cefaclor in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Patients received either 10 days of treatment with cefdinir (n = 347) at 300 mg twice daily or 10 days of treatment with cefaclor (n = 343) at 500 mg three times daily. Microbiological assessments were performed on sputum specimens obtained at admission and at the two posttherapy visits, if available. Respiratory tract pathogens were isolated from 538 (78%) of 690 patient admission sputum specimens, with the predominant pathogens being Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The microbiological eradication rates at the test-of-cure visit were 92% (238 of 260 pathogens) and 93% (245 of 264 pathogens) for the evaluable patients treated with cefdinir and cefaclor, respectively. A satisfactory clinical response (cure plus improvement) was achieved in 89% (166 of 187) and 86% (160 of 186) of the evaluable patients treated with cefdinir and cefaclor, respectively. Except for the incidence of diarrhea, adverse event rates while on treatment were equivalent between the two treatment groups. Diarrhea incidence during therapy was higher for patients treated with cefdinir (13.7%) than for patients treated with cefaclor (5.3%). These results indicate that cefdinir is effective and safe in the treatment of patients with pneumonia.
TI  - [Clinical study on azithromycin in 10% fine granules and 100mg capsules in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Azithromycin (AZM), a new oral macrolide antibiotic, in 10% fine granules or 100  mg capsules was given to pediatric patients to treat various infections. The following results were obtained in our studies of AZM for its antibacterial activities against clinical isolates, its pharmacokinetics, its efficacy, and its safety. 1. MICs of AZM, erythromycin (EM) and clarithromycin (CAM) were determined against a total of 57 strains all at 10(6) cfu/ml. Among Gram-positive cocci, MICs of AZM ranged from 0.78 to > 100 micrograms/ml against Staphylococcus aureus (20 strains), from 0.05 to 0.1 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pyogenes (11 strains), and from 0.0125 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains). These MICs were similar to those of the other macrolides. Among Gram-negative bacilli, MICs of AZM were 0.05 micrograms/ml against Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (1 strain), from 0.78 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus influenzae (9 strains), 0.78 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 strain) and 6.25 micrograms/ml against salmonella sp. (1 strain). These values were similar to or lower than those of the other macrolides. Against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, MICs of AZM were < or = 0.0008 micrograms/ml in three strains. One strain of M. pneumoniae showed tolerance to AZM at MIC 25 micrograms/ml. The other agents exhibited higher MIC than AZM against this organism. 2. Plasma samples were collected from five patients receiving fine granules and four patients receiving capsules for drug level determination. The patients received AZM at 10.0 approximately 16.3 mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 days. Drug concentrations in plasma at two hours after Day 3 dosing were in a range between 0.02 and 0.19 micrograms/ml for fine granules and were in a range between 0.11 and 0.42 micrograms/ml for capsules. 3. Urine samples were collected from four patients receiving fine granules and four patients receiving capsules. Drug levels were determined to be 3 micrograms/ml at post-treatment 48 hours for fine granules and post-treatment 72 hours for capsules. Urinary excretion rates of AZM in three patients on capsules lied in a range between 4.69 and 10.17%. 4. Effectiveness of AZM in fine granules was evaluated in 128 patients having a total of 19 different infections. AZM was rated "excellent" in 51 patients, "good" in 63, "fair" in 8, "poor" in 6, resulting in an efficacy rate of 89.1%. Effectiveness of AZM in capsular form was evaluated in 23 patients with five different infections. AZM was found "excellent" in 13 patients and "good" in 10, resulting in an efficacy rate of 100%. 5. AZM in fine granules eradicated 45 strains of 54 in 8 different bacteria. AZM in capsules eradicated 9 strains of 10 strains in 6 different bacteria. 6. As for adverse reactions, one patient complained of eruption, one vomiting, one loose stool, five diarrhea, when administered with fine granular form of AZM. One patient on AZM capsules experienced urticaria and vomiting. 7. As for abnormal laboratory changes, three patients were found with decreased WBC, seven with increased eosinophil, two with increased GOT and GPT, one with increased GPT. They were all on fine granular form of AZM. As far as abnormalities found in patients administered with AZM in capsular form, two showed decreased WBC, one decreased WBC along with increased eosinophil, and three increased eosinophil.
TI  - [A clinical evaluation of azithromycin in the treatment of pediatric infection].
AB  - Fine granule preparation of azithromycin (AZM), a new macrolide antibiotic, was given to treat various infections in pediatric patients. Efficacies of AZM in a total of 21 patients (tonsillitis in six, bronchitis in five, pneumonia in five, impetigo contagiosa in three, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in one and bacterial enterogastritis in one) were rated "excellent" in 11 patients and "good" in eight. The remaining two cases were not included in the evaluation. AZM eradicated all strains of infection-causative bacteria identified in the 21 patients: Staphylococcus aureus in two, Streptococcus pneumoniae in four, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis in four, Haemophilus influenzae in six, Haemophilus parainfluenzae in three and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in one. One patient complained of mild diarrhea, while two patients showed increases in eosinophils as abnormal laboratory changes.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of azithromycin using fine granules or capsules in the pediatric patients].
AB  - Azithromycin (AZM), a new macrolide antibiotic, in fine granules and in capsules  was studied for pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluations. 1. Antibacterial activities. MIC profile of AZM was as follows: 0.78 approximately 1.56 micrograms/ml against Staphylococcus aureus, < or = 0.025 approximately 0.10 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.10 approximately 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae, < or = 0.025 approximately 0.39 microgram/ml against Moraxella(Branhamella) catarrhalis, 0.39 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus influenzae, and 0.20 approximately 6.25 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus parainfluenzae. 2. Absorption and excretion. The elimination half-life of AZM after its administration at 10 mg/kg/day for three days was 28.1 approximately 46.1 hours. The cumulative urinary excretion rate in the first 120 hours after start of treatment was 4.01 approximately 8.47%. 3. Clinical evaluation. AZM was given to 76 pediatric patients to treat following infections: pharyngitis in seven, tonsillitis in 11, bronchitis in 11, pneumonia in 19, Mycoplasma pneumonia in eight, scarlet fever in 13, infective enteritis in one, SSTI in four, and otitis media in two. Effectiveness of AZM was assessed in 75 patients and the drug was rated "excellent" or "good" in 71 resulting in an efficacy rate of 94.7%, 87.0% of the 46 cases indicated that AZM had eradicated bacteria identified before the treatment. One patient complained of moderate diarrhea which disappeared after treatment of anti-diarrheic. Abnormal laboratory changes were reported in 12 patients in the following: decreased leukocytes in eight, increased eosinophils in two, increased platelet count in one, and increased GPT in one. All cases of abnormality was deemed mild in severity and clinically insignificant.
TI  - [Epidemiology of acute bronchopulmonary infections in children].
AB  - In infants and young children acute lower respiratory infection is the most common cause of morbidity and death especially in developing countries. Factors that contribute to the increased susceptibility to respiratory pathogens include young age, season, sex, indoor pollution, large family size, malnutrition, low immunocompetence, socioeconomic disadvantage. The epidemiology of acute respiratory infections in childhood seems similar worldwide. In all countries, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenzae virus 1 and 3 influenzae A and B viruses and adenovirus are reported to be the main causes of acute respiratory infections. Six microorganisms are responsible of 90% of documented acute bacterial pulmonary infections, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus. Mixed viral and bacterial infections occur frequently (30%). The role of respiratory viruses in predisposing to colonization and invasion of bacterial organisms has often been suggested. In recent years acquired resistance against antibiotic for H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae has emerged.
TI  - [Clinical studies on azithromycin in pediatrics].
AB  - Fine granules or capsules of azithromycin (AZM) were given to 32 pediatric patients for the treatment of the following diseases: pharyngitis in three cases; tonsillitis in one; bronchitis in six; pneumonia in six; mycoplasmal pneumonia in 14; pertussis and enteritis in one, each. Effectiveness of AZM was evaluated in 30 cases and the drug was rated "excellent" in 18 patients, "good" in 11 and "fair" in one, resulting in a total efficacy rate of 96.7%. Three strains of bacteria were isolated from 3 patients as the causative organisms including: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, from three different patients, respectively. One patient complained of mild diarrhea, another patient mild urticaria. Abnormal laboratory test results were reported as follows: one patient showed a slight decrease in leukocyte count, three patients showed slight increases in eosinophils, and one patient had slight elevations in GOT and GPT. The above results suggest that AZM is a useful antibiotic drug in the treatment of pediatric patients with various bacterial infections.
TI  - A multicentre collaborative study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired, lower respiratory tract pathogens 1992-1993: the Alexander Project.
AB  - The Alexander Project is a unique, international, collaborative antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance study of bacterial pathogens causing community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection. Fifteen centres, ten in the European Union (EU) and five in the USA, each submitted up to 400 isolated per year for 2 years (1992 and 1993) to a central laboratory for re-identification and determination of MICs of 15 antimicrobials using the Sensititre microbroth incorporation technique. Of the total of 6385 isolates collected, Haemophilus influenzae (2718), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1856) and Moraxella catarrhalis (818) were the most frequently identified pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus (690). Haemophilus parainfluenzae (183) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (120) were identified less commonly. High-level penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae (MIC > or = 2 mg/L) was found in 222 isolates, an overall prevalence of 12% which varied from < 1% in Germany, Italy, UK and two of the five USA centres, to 3.8-40.4% in the remainder, with the highest prevalence found in France and Spain. Intermediate penicillin resistance (MIC 0.12-1 mg/L) was identified in 228 isolates of S. pneumoniae, an overall prevalence of 12.3%, with individual centre prevalence varying widely (EU, 0-52.3%; USA, 0-20.9%) and not always following that of high-level resistance. Resistance to other, unrelated, antimicrobials, except notably the fluoroquinolones, was strongly associated with beta-lactam resistance. beta-lactamase production was detected in 492 isolates of H. influenzae, an overall prevalence of 18.1%. Rates of detection varied widely between centres from 1.4% in Weingarten, Germany in 1993 to 38.5% in Barcelona, Spain in 1992. In general, the prevalence of beta-lactamase production was higher and less variable in USA centres than in those of the EU. beta-Lactamase was detected consistently in the majority of isolates of M. catarrhalis with an overall prevalence of 81.7%. Virtually no other resistance phenotype was recognised in this species. Of the 690 collected, most isolates of S. aureus produced beta-lactamase with rates of detection varying from 52.2%-89.1%. Isolates from two centres, Genoa, Italy in 1992 and Paris, France in 1993, were associated with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistance (34.8% and 43.8%, respectively). Combined isolates of H. parainfluenzae and K. pneumoniae accounted for only 4.7% of the total collection. Although the current data are insufficient to allow analysis of trends in resistance, the study participants have continued to collect further isolates in 1994 and 1995 which will be reported in the future.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir against respiratory pathogens isolated in Sicily with reference to beta-lactamase production.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir (CI-983, FK-482), an orally absorbed aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was evaluated against all 287 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes in comparison with cefaclor, cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, erythromycin and cotrimoxazole. The bactericidal activity of cefdinir, cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and erythromycin was determined against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and S. pneumoniae. With the exception of one beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant strain of H. influenzae (resistant to all antibiotics tested), no resistance to cefdinir was observed (MIC < or = 1 mg/l). Cefdinir was active against H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and M. catarrhalis regardless of whether or not they produced beta-lactamase. In general, the inhibitory concentrations of cefdinir against H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and M. catarrhalis were similar to those of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, one or two dilutions lower than those of cefuroxime and four dilutions lower than those of cefaclor and cotrimoxazole. Against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes cefdinir had the same activity as cefuroxime and amoxicillin but was more effective than the other antibiotics tested. Kinetic studies showed that cefdinir was rapidly bactericidal at concentrations 2 and 4 times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): a reduction of 99.9% in CFU values was generally observed after 6-8 h.
TI  - [Microbiological study of the respiratory tract in children with cystic fibrosis].
AB  - PURPOSE: Pulmonary infections is a main cause of morbimortality in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis. The objective of this study was to know the flora implicated in respiratory pathology of all mucoviscidotic children attending Hospital Sant Joan de Deu of Barcelona. METHODS: Quantitative cultures from respiratory samples (most of them: sputum) of 26 patients were performed from January 91 to June 93. There were 13 girls and 13 boys, aged 1 to 13 years (mean: 7 years). RESULTS: 282 microorganisms were isolated from 203 positive samples. Cultures of 88.4% of patients yielded in some moment Haemophilus influenzae, 82.6% of them Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 65.3% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 50% Streptococcus pneumoniae, 38.4% Staphylococcus aureus. The most prevalent microorganism was P. aeruginosa (66%) followed by H. influenzae (29%) and S. aureus (26.6%). 59% of P. aeruginosa strains showed a mucoid phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Haemophilus sp. causes short term infections that affect children of all ages, whereas infections due to P. aeruginosa persist in spite of correct antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. The in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. Cefetamet killed 100% Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae at < or = 0.5 mg/l, S. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l. Moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective against Escherichia coli (94%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), K. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against Moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x MIC demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and K. pneumoniae within 6 h and S. pneumoniae within 4 h. Hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to TEM1 and SHV1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.
TI  - Phosphorylcholine-containing antigens in bacteria from the mouth and respiratory  tract.
AB  - Phosphorylcholine (PC)-containing antigens were sought in 269 bacterial isolates  from the mouth and respiratory tract by an enzyme immunoassay method. Only 41 (15%) isolates were PC-positive and of these 29 (70%) were strains of Haemophilus influenzae. Other species that produced positive results included two of five isolates of Gemella haemolysans, two of five isolates of Micrococcus spp., and a single strain each of Bacillus sp., Corynebacterium jeikeium, Lactococcus sp. and H. parainfluenzae. The presence of PC-containing antigens in H. influenzae may be an important source of cross-reaction in antigen detection techniques that detect the C-polysaccharide antigen of Streptococcus pneumoniae in respiratory specimens and would result in false positive results.
TI  - Effectiveness of short-course therapy (5 days) with cefuroxime axetil in treatment of secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis.
AB  - Five hundred thirty-seven patients were enrolled in two independent, investigator-blinded, multicenter, randomized clinical trials comparing the clinical and bacteriologic efficacies and the safety of 5- or 10-day treatment with cefuroxime axetil with those of 10-day treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate in the treatment of secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis. Patients received either 5 or 10 days of treatment (n = 177 in each group) with cefuroxime axetil at 250 mg twice daily or 10 days of treatment (n = 183) with amoxicillin-clavulanate at 500 mg three times daily. Patients in the cefuroxime axetil (5 days) group received placebo on days 6 to 10. Bacteriologic assessments were based on sputum specimen cultures obtained preceding and, when possible, following treatment. Organisms were isolated from the pretreatment sputum specimens of 242 of 537 (45%) patients, with the primary pathogens being Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus (28, 25, 13, 9, and 8% of isolates, respectively). Pathogens were eradicated or presumed to be eradicated in 87% (52 of 60), 91% (53 of 58), and 86% (60 of 70) of bacteriologically evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil (5 days), cefuroxime axetil (10 days), and amoxicillin-clavulanate, respectively. A satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) was achieved in 82% (107 of 130), 86% (117 of 136), and 83% (130 of 157) of the clinically evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil (5 days), cefuroxime axetil (10 days), and amoxicillin-clavulanate, respectively. Treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate was associated with a significantly higher incidence of drug-related adverse events than was treatment with cefuroxime axetil for either 5 or 10 days (P = 0.001), primarily reflecting a higher incidence of drug-related gastrointestinal adverse events (37 versus 19 and 15%, respectively; P < 0.001), particularly diarrhea and nausea. These results indicate that treatment with cefuroxime axetil at 250 mg twice daily for 5 days is as effective as treatment for 10 days with either the same dose of cefuroxime axetil or amoxicillin-clavulanate at 500 mg three times daily in patients with acute bronchitis. In addition, treatment with cefuroxime axetil for either 5 or 10 days is associated with significantly fewer gastrointestinal adverse events, particularly diarrhea and nausea, than is 10-day treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate.
TI  - Clinical comparison of cefuroxime axetil and amoxicillin/clavulanate in the treatment of patients with secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis.
AB  - Two independent, investigator-blinded, multicenter, randomized clinical trials compared the clinical and bacteriologic efficacy and safety of two oral antibiotics, cefuroxime axetil and amoxicillin/clavulanate, in the treatment of patients with secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis (hereafter denoted acute bronchitis). Three hundred sixty patients with signs and symptoms of acute bronchitis were enrolled at 22 centers and were randomly assigned to receive 10 days of treatment with either cefuroxime axetil 250 mg twice daily (BID) (n= 177) or amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg three times daily (TID) (n = 183). Patients were assessed for both clinical and bacteriologic responses once during treatment (at 3 to 5 days) and twice after treatment (at 1 to 3 days and at 13 to 15 days). Bacteriologic assessments were based on sputum specimen cultures obtained before treatment and, when possible, after treatment. Organisms were isolated from the pretreatment sputum specimens of 162 (45%) of 360 patients, with the primary pathogens being Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus (28%, 25%, 11%, 9%, and 8% of isolates, respectively). Thirty-four percent of the H influenzae isolates and 94% of the M catarrhalis isolates that were tested for beta-lactamase production were positive. A satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) was achieved in 86% (117 of 136) and 83% (130 of 157) of the clinically assessable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil or amoxicillin/clavulanate, respectively (P = 0.45). With respect to the eradication of bacterial pathogens, a satisfactory outcome (cure, presumed care, or cure with colonization) was obtained in 91% (53 of 58) and 86% (60 of 70) of bacteriologically assessable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil or amoxicillin/clavulanate, respectively (P = 0.32). Treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate was associated with a significantly higher incidence of drug-related adverse events than was treatment with cefuroxime axetil (39% vs 23%; P = 0.001), primarily reflecting a higher incidence of drug-related gastrointestinal adverse events (37% vs 15%; P < 0.001), particularly diarrhea and nausea. Four patients in the cefuroxime axetil group and eight patients in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group withdrew from the study because of drug-related adverse events. These results indicate that cefuroxime axetil 250 mg BID is as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg TID in the treatment of patients with acute bronchitis but produces fewer gastrointestinal adverse events, particularly diarrhea and nausea.
TI  - Multicenter trial of cefpodoxime proxetil vs. amoxicillin-clavulanate in acute lower respiratory tract infections in childhood. International Study Group.
AB  - Acute lower respiratory tract infections in children are a worldwide public health problem, with an estimated 4 million potentially preventable deaths every year. Until recently, penicillin and related drugs were the treatment of choice for empiric therapy of paediatric lower respiratory tract infections. However, concerns over the emergence of penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis have led physicians to turn increasingly towards alternatives, such as the third generation cephalosporins. The oral extended spectrum cephalosporin cefpodoxime proxetil is highly active against the bacterial pathogens commonly associated with childhood lower respiratory tract infections. In order to evaluate its clinical efficacy in children with acute febrile lower respiratory tract infections, an international, multicenter, comparative, randomized open study was conducted in children ages 3 months to 11.5 years. Of 348 cases enrolled, 234 were randomized to cefpodoxime proxetil (8 mg/kg/day twice daily) and 114 to amoxicilin/clavanulate (amoxicillin 40 mg/kg/day 3 times a day). The duration of treatment was 10 days. Pretreatment diagnosis was pneumonia in 292 patients, bronchiolitis in 19 patients and acute bronchitis in 37 patients. Pathogens isolated from 59 cases included H. influenzae (47.5%), S. pneumoniae (23.7%), M. catarrhalis (11.9%) and Haemophilus parainfluenzae (6.8%). Clinical efficacy was evaluable in 278 children at the end of treatment when 95.2% of patients in the cefpodoxime proxetil group and 96.7% of patients in the amoxicillin/clavanulate group showed a satisfactory clinical response (cured or improved). The improvement was sustained at the follow-up visit, 10 to 20 days after completion of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Detection of beta-lactamase in samples obtained after tonsillectomy in children].
AB  - Production of beta-lactamase was detected using a microbiological assay (Guts test) in samples of tonsils, and by in Haemophilus growing from the same samples of both tonsils obtained from 30 children aged 2 to 13 years (18 aged < 6 years and 12 aged > or = 6 years). Two pieces from each tonsil, core and superficial, were studied. The procedure included direct microscopic examination of smears, and culture to identify Haemophilus, beta-haemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Guts test was positive in tonsillar tissue obtained from 26 children (14 aged < 6 years and 2 aged > or = 6 years) (p < 0.01). In 10 of them (9 aged < 6 years and 1 aged > or = 6 years) (p < 0.05) grew beta-lactamase producer Haemophilus influenzae. One to three varieties of Haemophilus could be found in 28 children (11 with H. influenzae = 5 beta-lactamase +, 8 with Haemophilus parainfluenzae = 3 beta-lactamase +); Group A, C, or G streptococci in 5 children, but no strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae. No difference could be demonstrated between core and superficial samples: beta-lactamase activity was positive in superficial samples from 26 children and core samples from 24. Almost all bacteria described grew from superficial as well as (slightly but no significantly less) from core samples.
TI  - Efficacy of a three day course of azithromycin in moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of a 3 day course of azithromycin in low to moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia. Forty patients with low to moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia (29 males, 11 females, mean age 46 +/- 17 yrs; 20 pretreated with betalactams for 2-10 days with no results before admission to hospital; 18 with evidence of co-morbidity) were enrolled in an open, randomized study with azithromycin, 500 mg q.d. oral therapy for 3 days, versus clarithromycin, 250 mg b.i.d. oral therapy for 10 +/- 2 days. The aetiology of pneumonia was identified in 18 patients by serology (nine Mycoplasma pneumoniae, four Chlamydia pneumoniae, five Legionella pneumophila; one patient with chlamydial infection also had Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteraemia). A presumptive aetiological diagnosis was obtained with sputum culture in three other patients (one Haemophilus influenzae, two Haemophilus parainfluenzae), all strains were sole isolates with 10(8) Colony forming units (CFU), and with Gram stain in one patient with Streptococcus pneumoniae. All patients in the azithromycin group (one after a second 3 day course), and all but two (of those available for evaluation) of the clarithromycin group were cured. Defervescence occurred after 2.6 +/- 1.6 days, and chest roentgenogram cleared after 8.9 +/- 3.3 days, with no difference between the two groups. Tolerance was good, and there were no withdrawals from therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of biapenem (L-627) in pediatric field].
AB  - We have carried out bacteriological and clinical studies on L-627. The results are summarized as follows. Treatment with L-627 was made in 14 cases of pediatric bacterial infections including 5 cases of pneumonia and 2 cases each of tonsillitis, urinary tract infection and one case each of colitis, and phlegmon. Results obtained were excellent in 11 cases, good in 2 cases and poor in one case. The bacteriological effect of L-627 was excellent, all causative organisms (Staphylococcus aureus one strain, Streptococcus pyogenes 2 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 3 strains, Escherichia coli 3 strains, Haemophilus influenzae one strain, Haemophilus parainfluenzae one strain) were eradicated. No significant side effects due to the drug were observed in any cases, except 2 cases each of elevated eosinophil counts and elevated platelet counts.
TI  - Randomized comparative trial with ampicillin/sulbactam versus cefamandole in the  therapy of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  - In a randomized prospective study ampicillin/sulbactam and cefamandole were compared in the therapy of patients hospitalized with community acquired pneumonia. Patients receiving ampicillin/sulbactam (n = 37) and cefamandole (n = 38) were similar with respect to age (mean age 70 vs. 76 years respectively), clinical characteristics, severity of illness and underlying disease. Pathogens isolated from patients in the cefamandole and ampicillin/sulbactam group, respectively, were Streptococcus pneumoniae (7 vs. 7 patients), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (7 vs. 6 patients), Haemophilus influenzae (5 vs. 5 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (5 vs. 4 patients), Escherichia coli (4 vs. 4 patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3 vs. 3 patients), Enterobacter spp. (2 vs. 3 patients), Moraxella catarrhalis (1 vs. 2 patients), and organisms of the oral flora (4 vs. 3 patients). The rate of resistance to penicillin was 80%, to clindamycin 76%, to erythromycin 45%, to ampicillin 43%, and to cefazolin 18%. Overall successful treatment rates of 81% for cefamandole and 97% for ampicillin/sulbactam (p = 0.05) were observed. Both cefamandole and ampicillin/sulbactam were shown to be effective agents for therapy of community acquired pneumonia; however ampicillin/sulbactam demonstrated superior overall clinical efficacy.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of S-1108 in the pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on S-1108, a new oral cephem antibiotic, were performed in the field pediatrics. The following results were obtained. 1) Antibacterial activities Antibacterial activities of S-1006, the active form of S-1108, were studied against clinically isolated strains of (Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 3), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 8), Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 5) and Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 2). MIC values ranged < or = 0.025-1.56 for GPC and < or = 0.025-0.78 microgram/ml for GNR. 2) Absorption and excretion Blood concentrations and urinary excretion rates of S-1108 were measured upon administration of S-1108 after meal at dose of 3 mg/kg (n = 4), 4 mg/kg (n = 1) and 6 mg/kg (n = 1). The peak blood concentrations of S-1006 at a dose of 3 mg/kg (n = 4), ranged from 0.57 to 1.82 micrograms/ml at 1, 2 and 4 hours after dosing. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters T1/2 and AUC were 1.29 +/- 0.69 hours and 4.47 +/- 2.25 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. At a dose of 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, peak concentrations were 1.79 and 1.27 micrograms/ml at 2 and 3 hours after treatment. T1/2 and AUC were 1.34 and 1.11 hours, and 8.19 and 5.65 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Urinary recovery rates ranged from 13.0 to 37.2% for the first 8 hours after administration. 3) Clinical studies Clinical efficacies were examined in 32 cases of various pediatric infections including 5 cases of acute pneumonia, 11 cases of bronchitis, 2 cases of scarlet fever, 8 cases of tonsillitis, 1 case of pharyngitis, 2 cases of otitis media and 3 cases of UTI. Clinical efficacy rate was 96.9% (31/32) and bacteriological eradication rate was 87.1% (27/31). There were no side effects and abnormal laboratory test values except 1 case (Eosino. 2-->10%) in the 32 cases.
TI  - A comparison of cefpodoxime proxetil and cefaclor in the treatment of acute exacerbation of COPD in adults.
AB  - In this multicenter, observer-blinded study, 301 patients with signs and symptoms of acute bacterial exacerbation of COPD were randomized (2:1) to receive either cefpodoxime proxetil (200 mg, bid) or cefaclor (250 mg, tid) for 10 days. Clinical and microbiologic evaluations were performed before treatment, during therapy (study days 3 to 5), at the end of therapy (3 to 7 days posttreatment), and at long-term follow-up (4 weeks posttreatment). The most common pretreatment isolates were Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Significantly (p < 0.001) more bacterial isolates were susceptible in vitro to cefpodoxime (233 of 256, 91 percent) than to cefaclor (215 of 255, 84 percent). There were no statistically significant differences between the two drug regimens in eradication of the initial pathogen (cefpodoxime, 116 of 128, 91 percent; cefaclor, 59 of 64, 92 percent) or end-of-therapy clinical response (cure + proved; cefpodoxime, 99 of 100, 99 percent; cefaclor, 45 of 49, 92 percent) rates for evaluable patients. Both drug treatments were well-tolerated, with a similar incidence of drug-related adverse events (cefpodoxime 11 percent, cefaclor 12 percent). Cefpodoxime (bid) was as safe and effective as cefaclor (tid) in the treatment of acute exacerbation of COPD. The less frequent dosing regimen of cefpodoxime may improve patient compliance compared to those antibiotics that require three or four daily doses.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefditoren pivoxil in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME 1207) in granules, a new oral cephalosporin, were performed in the field of pediatrics. The results are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities: Antibacterial activities of CDTR were studied against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis in comparison with those of cefteram (CFTM), cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL), cefpodoxime (CPDX) and cefotiam (CTM). MIC80's of CDTR against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and B. catarrhalis were 1.56, 0.39, < or = 0.025, < or = 0.025, 0.05 and 0.20 micrograms/ml, respectively. These results showed that CDTR has high antibacterial activities against these organisms. 2. Absorption and excretion: Serum concentrations and urinary recovery rates of CDTR-PI (administered in granules) were determined. Upon single oral doses of 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, the peak serum concentrations were 0.5-2.45 micrograms/ml at 2 to 4 hours and 1.79-4.05 micrograms/ml at 1 to 4 hours, respectively, and T 1/2 was 1.07-9.67 hours and 0.99-3.00 hours, respectively. At 8 hours after dosing, serum concentrations were 0-0.87 micrograms/ml with a dose of 3 mg/kg and 0.27-0.73 micrograms/ml with 6 mg/kg. These values indicated that the drug has a dose-dependent pharmacokinetic behavior. Urinary recovery rates in the first 8 hours were 12.9-34.2% with a dose of 3 mg/kg and 11.8-26.9% with 6 mg/kg. 3. Clinical study: Clinical efficacies were examined in a total of 81 cases consisting of 20 cases of acute bronchitis, 13 of acute pneumonia, 21 of tonsillitis, 5 of pharyngitis, 7 of scarlet fever, 2 each of impetigo, otitis media and purulent cervical lymphadenitis, 1 of pertussis and 8 of UTI. The clinical efficacy rate was 97.5% (79/81), and bacteriological eradication rate was 100% (76/76). As for side effects, 2 cases of watery stools and 1 case of minor elevation of GPT were observed.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME 1207) were performed in children. The results were as follows: 1. A total of 18 patients (19 infections) were treated with CDTR-PI. The doses ranged 2.1-3.2 mg/kg, and it was orally administered 3 times daily, for 4-10 days. Clinical efficacies of CDTR-PI in 18 patients with 19 bacterial infections (3 with tonsillitis, 1 with bronchitis, 7 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 4 with otitis media, 1 with urinary tract infection, 2 with skin and soft tissue infection) were evaluated as excellent in 13 infections and as good in 6 infections with an efficacy rate of 100%. Twelve causative strains of 5 species were found in 11 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 cases out of 3, Haemophilus influenzae in 4/4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2/2, Haemophilus parainfluenzae in 2/2 and Escherichia coli in 1/1 were eradicated. Two patients had mild diarrhea but did not need specific treatment. Severe adverse reaction was not observed in any of the 18 patients. 2. MICs of CDTR were examined against 4 clinically isolated S. pneumoniae strains. Two strains of S. pneumoniae were relatively resistant to penicillins. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies Peak serum CDTR concentrations in 3 patients were 2.38 micrograms/ml, 0.72 micrograms/ml and 2.25 micrograms/ml at a dose of CDTR-PI 3 mg/kg orally administered at 30-minute after meal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacy of fleroxacin versus amoxicillin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - In a multicenter study the efficacy and safety of oral fleroxacin at 400 mg once  a day and amoxicillin at 500 mg three times daily for 7 days were compared for the treatment of patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to drug-susceptible bacteria. A total of 194 patients were enrolled, 102 in the fleroxacin group and 92 in the amoxicillin group. Of those enrolled, 22 in the fleroxacin group and 30 (29 for clinical efficacy) in the amoxicillin group were included in the efficacy analysis. All were included in the safety analysis. Clinical success was noted in 21 (95%) of 22 fleroxacin-treated patients and 22 (76%) of 29 amoxicillin-treated patients. Bacteriologic cure was obtained in 21 (95%) of 22 of the fleroxacin group and 18 (60%) of 30 of the amoxicillin group. One Haemophilus parainfluenzae strain persisted with fleroxacin. Persisting organisms with amoxicillin included Haemophilus influenzae (four), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (three), Escherichia coli (two), Streptococcus pneumoniae (one), Neisseria species (one), and Proteus mirabilis (one). Adverse events were reported by 41% of 102 patients receiving fleroxacin and 15% of 92 patients receiving amoxicillin. Insomnia, dizziness, and nausea occurred more frequently with fleroxacin. Fleroxacin may be indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial infection in chronic bronchitis known to be due to Haemophilus species and Moraxella catarrhalis. The 92% incidence of resistance among the S. pneumoniae isolates recovered from all enrolled patients suggests that fleroxacin may not be useful for such infections.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefprozil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates of CFPZ were determined upon oral administration of CFPZ after meal at doses of 4 mg/kg granules in a case, 7.5 mg/kg granules in 2 cases and 15 mg/kg granules in one. Peak serum levels of CFPZ were obtained at an hour in 3 cases and at 2 hours in 1 case after administration of the drug with a range of 2.7-8.6 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 0.69-0.95 hours. Urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration ranged from 59.4-71.3%. 2. MICs of CFPZ against 36 clinical isolates (Staphylococcus aureus 4 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 5, Streptococcus pyogenes 5, Escherichia coli 5, Haemophilus influenzae 12, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 4, and Branhamella catarrhalis 1) were compared with those of cefaclor (CCL) and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of CFPZ was superior to those of CCL against Gram-positive cocci, and to those of ABPC against E. coli, and was equal to those of CCL and inferior to those of ABPC against H. influenzae. 3. Thirty-seven pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (pharyngitis/tonsillitis 17, bronchitis 7, pneumonia 3, skin and soft tissue infection 2, and urinary tract infection 8) were treated with CFPZ at daily doses of 10-47 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 100% clinically and 56% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed except for an increased platelet count in 1 case and elevated GOT, GPT values in 2 cases.
TI  - [Clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. Clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. CFPZ was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute UTI, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. The effectiveness rate was 96.4%. Bacteriologically, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of Salmonella C2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of Escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. The bacteriological eradication rates for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. No side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. As abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. In conclusion, CFPZ was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
TI  - Optimum use of selective plated media in primary processing of respiratory tract  specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - A total of 258 respiratory tract specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis were inoculated onto nine different plated media, and the rates of recovery of potential pathogens were compared. Media included sheep blood agar, enriched chocolate agar, MacConkey agar for gram-negative bacilli, chocolate agar containing bacitracin for Haemophilus spp., bromcresol green agar for yeasts, cetrimide agar for Pseudomonas spp., sheep blood agar containing colistin and nalidixic acid for gram-positive cocci, mannitol salt agar for Staphylococcus aureus, and oxidation-fermentation agar containing 300 U of polymyxin B per ml and 2 U of bacitracin per ml (OF-PBL medium) for Pseudomonas cepacia. With two exceptions, all of these media proved useful in recovering potential pathogens from respiratory tract specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis. The two exceptions were cetrimide agar and colistin-nalidixic acid-supplemented sheep blood agar, which were found to be superfluous. In addition, the results of this study further delineated the prevalence of selected bacteria and fungi in respiratory tract secretions from patients with cystic fibrosis. In rank order of frequency of isolation, we recovered isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Candida albicans, S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, molds, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, yeasts other than Candida albicans, miscellaneous gram-negative bacilli, beta-hemolytic streptococci, P. cepacia, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Microbiological considerations of the etiological agents of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - One hundred eight-four sputum specimens from the same number of patients with lower respiratory tract infections were examined to determine the bacterial count and the relationship between the microorganisms isolated and the presumptive pathology. The sputa were subdivided into three groups; "high probability", "low probability", and "contaminated sputa", following the criteria of the microscopic readings: sputum with more than 25 white cells and low numbers of squamous epithelial cells represents true lower respiratory tract infections (high probability); those with fewer than 25 white cells represent non-bacterial infections or non-infected sputa (low probability) while sputa with more than 25 squamous cells per field represent contaminated specimens (contaminated sputa). Statistical analysis was carried out to correlate these data. Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes showed significant differences in the three groups considered.
TI  - Double-blind randomized study comparing the efficacies and safeties of a short (3-day) course of azithromycin and a 5-day course of amoxicillin in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - The efficacies and safeties of a three-dose regimen of azithromycin (500 mg once  daily for 3 days) and a 15-dose regimen of amoxicillin (500 mg three times daily for 5 days) were compared in a double-blind manner in patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. A total of 92% of patients suffered a type 1 exacerbation. Treatment success, defined as cure or major improvement, was achieved in all patients in the azithromycin group by day 5, compared with 23 (92%) of 25 patients in the amoxicillin group. On day 12, these data were 24 of 25 (96%) in the azithromycin group and 20 of 25 (80%) in the amoxicillin group (results were not significantly different). Several pathogens were isolated (MIC ranges [micrograms per milliliter] in parentheses): Haemophilus influenzae or Haemophilus parainfluenzae was isolated 23 times (azithromycin, less than or equal to 0.06 to 32; amoxicillin, 0.12 to 2); Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from 11 patients (azithromcyin, less than or equal to 0.06 greater than 256; amoxicillin, less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.25); Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis was isolated from eight patients (azithromycin, less than or equal to 0.06; amoxicillin, less than or equal to 0.06 to 16); and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from eight patients. One patient treated with azithromycin had Legionella pneumophila pneumonia, and another in that group had a significant rise in titer of antibody against influenza A virus. One patient treated with amoxicillin also had a significant rise in titer of antibody against influenza A virus. Microbiological response rates were comparable. One patient who received azithromycin developed abnormal liver function. Two patients treated with amoxicillin developed abnormal liver functions, one developed exanthema, and one treatment was stopped because of nausea. It is concluded that a three-dose (3-day) regimen of azithromycin is as effective clinically and microbiologically as a 15-dose (5-day) regimen of amoxicillin in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
TI  - [A study on in vitro antibacterial activity and clinical usefulness in respiratory tract infections of panipenem/betamipron, a newly synthesized carbapenem antibiotic].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) is a combination drug of PAPM, a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic and BP, an amino acid derivative at a weight ratio of 1:1. Its in vitro antibacterial activities against clinically isolated respiratory pathogenic bacteria were determined. It was superior to imipenem (IPM) in the in vitro antibacterial activities against Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. PAPM had antibacterial activities almost equal to those of IPM against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, its antibacterial activity was about 1/4 that of IPM. The clinical usefulness of PAPM/BP was studied by dissolving it in a solution containing lactate and administering the solution by intravenous drip infusion to 12 cases of respiratory tract infections. Out of 11 cases with respiratory tract infections excluding cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the efficacy rate was 90.9%, with 4 cases of excellent and 6 cases of good responses. In terms of its bacteriological efficacies, eradication of pathogenic bacteria including super-infection were observed in 2 out of 4 strains, but 2 strains of P. aeruginosa remained unchanged. Six strains appeared as superinfected bacteria during and after administration of this preparation substituting original pathogens. Side-effects were not observed in the 12 cases, and in laboratory tests, slight transient increases of S-GOT and S-GPT were found in 1 case. In conclusion, PAPM/BP is a very useful parenteral antibiotic against respiratory tract infections and can be one of the drugs of the first choice.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin, L-ofloxacin, and other oral  agents for respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The attainable inhibitory ratios (AR) for oral antibiotics were calculated by using literature reports of concentrations attained in respiratory secretions for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMX/CA), ofloxacin (OFL), L-ofloxacin (L-OFL), cefuroxime (CEFU), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and enoxacin (ENO), and using microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration data of these antimicrobials against the common bacterial respiratory pathogens. AR of each antibiotic against the pathogens was expressed as multiples of the MICs achieved at the respiratory site. Bacteria tested included Staphylococcus aureus, group-A and group-B streptococci, Viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Brahamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Eikenella corrodens, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Legionella pneumophila. The antimicrobials with the narrowest spectrum of activity were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime which had high attainable inhibitory ratios only against Gram-positive cocci. Ofloxacin and L-oflaxacin were among the quinolones with the highest overall ARs against respiratory pathogen, including, L. pneumophila, H. influenzae, and B. catarrhalis. All agents showed no, or inadequately low ARs for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new broad-spectrum, beta-lactamase-stable oral cephalosporin, cefixime, in comparison with other drugs, against Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Cefixime, a new orally absorbed iminomethoxyaminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was tested against some microorganisms involved in upper and lower respiratory tract infections such as Haemophilus (influenzae and parainfluenzae), Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, isolated in the period from November 1990 to April 1991. Its activity was compared to nine other antimicrobial agents: erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefaclor, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and ofloxacin. Cefixime inhibits 90% of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae, both beta-lactamase producers (BLP) or not (NBLP) at concentrations of less than 0.25 mg/l. It inhibits 90% of M. catarrhalis (BLP and NBLP) at concentrations of less than 1 mg/l. In general, cefixime has a superior in vitro activity with respect to cefaclor and the other cephalosporins as well as erythromycin and amoxicillin (the last one in BLP strains). In the evaluation of the antibacterial activity of beta-lactam against Haemophilus and M. catarrhalis, the authors observed different indications in the guidelines for ampicillin. Cefixime is not destroyed by the plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase produced by Haemophilus sp. and M. catarrhalis (TEM and ROB in Haemophilus strains and BRO in M. catarrhalis). In view of its excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory tract pathogens, cefixime is indicated in the therapy of these infections.
TI  - Changes in the spectrum of organisms causing respiratory tract infections: a review.
AB  - Over the last decade, the spectrum of organisms causing community-acquired acute  lower respiratory tract infections has changed. Streptococcus pneumoniae now causes approximately 30% of outpatient acute pneumonia-less than in former decades-whereas Mycoplasma pneumoniae is found in both young and elderly patients. The Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus are now seen more frequently as respiratory tract pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia patients, and they are the major organisms causing pneumonia in residents of homes for the elderly or nursing homes, and in immuno-compromised patients. Agents that were previously considered non-pathogenic for the respiratory tract include serotypes of Haemophilus influenzae other than type b, H. parainfluenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis; these organisms affect mainly patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease. Legionella species can cause sporadic as well as epidemic disease of the lower respiratory tract. Chlamydia pneumoniae is a newly recognized pathogen responsible for mild to severe upper and lower respiratory tract infections. In 60-80% of cases, hospital-acquired pneumonias are caused by Gram-negative bacilli and S. aureus. These organisms colonize the mucosal membranes of the upper respiratory tract and penetrate into the lower tract by aspiration or intubation.
TI  - Treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: state of the art.
AB  - Effective treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABE)  reduces the number of such exacerbations in such patients and may decrease or eliminate background symptoms and improve pulmonary function. The pathologic and physiologic abnormalities of the bronchial system in chronic bronchitis that predispose to bacterial infection probably include impaired mucociliary clearance, obstructed bronchioles, and bacterial infections of the bronchial epithelium. Exacerbations of bronchopulmonary symptoms are usually observed with ABE, although these symptoms are not unique to ABE. While culture and sensitivity testing is not usually required, microscopic examination of sputum is critical to determine the presence of bacterial infection. Bacteria in numbers significantly above the levels present when the patient's condition is stable and at least a doubling of the sputum neutrophil inflammatory level are essential criteria. Bacterial species observed with ABE include Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria species, with a lesser incidence of Klebsiella and Pseudomonas species. One or more elements of background therapy for ABE should accompany antimicrobial therapy, for example, physiotherapy, bronchodilators, and so forth. Ampicillin is effective, safe, economical, and thus remains the drug of choice for ABE. Quinolones are an effective alternative when ampicillin cannot be tolerated or if organisms are resistant. Dosing is at the upper range of recommendations, and the chosen drug should be given for a 10-14-day regimen. Patients should be reevaluated if symptoms and physical findings do not return to baseline after 5-7 days.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefdinir 5% fine granules in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical evaluation in pediatrics on cefdinir (CFDN, FK482) (5% fine granules), a new oral cephem, was performed. 1. CFDN was administered to 112 pediatric patients with ages between 1 month to 13 years with various infections. Dose levels used were 3.0-8.9 mg/kg (mean 5.1 mg/kg) t.i.d. for 3-14 days (mean 6.7 days). The studied patients included 2 patients with scarlet fever, 6 with acute pharyngitis, 6 with acute rhinopharyngitis, 52 with acute purulent tonsillitis, 8 with acute bronchitis, 24 with acute pneumonia, 7 with acute urinary tract infections, 1 with acute vaginitis, and 6 with impetigo. Total doses ranged from 0.6 to 4.05 g. One hundred eleven of the 112 patients were evaluated for clinical efficacy and all the patients were evaluated for safety. 2. Clinical effects were excellent in 51 cases, good in 57, and fair in 3 with an extremely high efficacy rate of 97.3%. Efficacy rates were 100% in scarlet fever, acute pharyngitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute bronchitis, acute vaginitis and impetigo, and 83.3%, 95.7%, 85.7% in acute rhinopharyngitis, acute pneumonia, and acute urinary tract infections, respectively. Good clinical effects were observed regardless of diseases. 3. Causative organisms were identified in 79 cases, of which 71 were found to be monobacterial infections and 8 were found to be multi-bacterial infections. In mono-bacterial infections, clinical efficacies were 100% for those caused by Staphylococcus aureus/Streptococcus pyogenes/Streptococcus pneumoniae/beta-Streptococcus except those in A and B groups with an overall efficacy of 100% against Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and they were 89.5%, 100%, 100% for those caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Escherichia coli, respectively, with an overall efficacy of 90.3% in Gram-negative rods (GNR). In multi-bacterial infections also, a clinical efficacy of 100% was obtained. 4. Bacteriological effects were studied for 89 strains in the 79 cases. The eradication rate for a few strains of S. pneumoniae was low, 25%, but it was 100% for S. aureus, with the same results for S. pyogenes, and beta-Streptococcus. The eradication rate on GPC was high 94.1%. Among GNR, 66.7% of E. coli, 50.0% of H. influenzae, and 71.4% of H. parainfluenzae was eradicated. The overall eradication rate for GNR was 55.3%, lower than that for GPC. Microbial substitutions were observed in 13 cases, with Haemophilus sp. replacing other bacteria. 5. Diarrhea and soft stools were noted in 4 and 2 patients, respectively. The severity of these side effects, however, was slight and it was possible to continue the CFDN treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Etiology of lower respiratory infections in hospitalized infants].
AB  - As a contribution to knowledge about the etiology of lower respiratory tract infections (LRI) in infants, 235 patients aged one year or less admitted to a children's hospital at northern metropolitan area of Santiago, Chile along years 1987 throughout 1989 with radiologically confirmed diagnosis were studied. Infants were eligible only if their symptoms lasted for not more than five days and their hospital stay was less than two days. Controls consisted on 74 healthy infants. A search for presumptive etiology was done by means of usual bacteriological procedures (pharyngeal swabs and blood cultures), plus latex test for type b Haemophilus influenzae (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) in concentrated urine specimens; indirect immunofluorescence (IF) for specific Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) IgM; serological tests, isolation and IF in pharyngeal aspirates for syncytial respiratory virus (SRV), influenza, parainfluenzae and adenoviruses were also used. Evidence of viral infection was detected from 135/235 (57.5%) of cases and 21/74 (28.3%) controls, SRV being the most common. From 18/119 and 2/119 studied patients Hib and SP antigens were respectively detected, but urinary antigens were also present in 6/24 controls, raising questions about this test's specificity. IF titers of 1:32 or higher for CT were found in 5/80 patients, all younger than 5 months. It was possible to perform the whole set of available methods in 80 patients, in 70% of which some evidence of a known etiologic agent was found. Serology alone gave etiological clues in only 30% of these cases and usual microbiological cultures of throat swabs and blood from none of them. No combinations of age, fever, respiratory rate, apnea, bronchial obstructive syndrome, white blood cell counts over 15,000 or of band forms over 500 per cu mm, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, reactive C protein and x-ray findings allowed differential diagnosis between presumptive bacterial or viral etiology, except in one case of an infant presenting with pleural effusion and positive antigenuria for Hib.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpirome in the field  of pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities of CPR against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were superior to those of ceftazidime. 2. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CPR at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 2 cases each were determined. Mean peak plasma concentrations of CPR at these dose levels were 33.9, 62.9 and 96.0 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes with plasma half-lives of 1.58, 1.69, and 2.13 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 51.2, 78.0 and 74.9%, respectively. 3. Ten patients with bacterial infections (pneumonia 5 cases, urinary tract infection 5 cases) were treated with CPR at a daily dose of 16-79 mg/kg/day. The overall clinical efficacy and bacteriological eradication rates were both 100%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except in 1 case of mild pain in blood vessels. Abnormal laboratory test results were also mild, slight elevation of GOT, GPT and thrombocytosis in 1 case and eosinophilia in 1 case.
TI  - Comparative study of clarithromycin and roxithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The efficacy and tolerance of clarithromycin (250 mg twice daily) were compared with those of roxithromycin (150 mg twice daily) in an open, multicentre trial of 77 inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia. Sixty-five patients were clinically evaluable (34, clarithromycin; 31 roxithromycin). Efficacy was comparable between treatment groups: 26 of 34 patients (76%) treated with clarithromycin were clinically cured, including four with atypical pneumonia. In the roxithromycin group 25 of 31 patients (81%) were clinically cured and one was improved. Cough, appearance of sputum, and fever improved in most patients in both treatment groups. Chest X-rays after treatment showed resolution or improvement in 76% of patients who received clarithromycin and 87% of those who received roxithromycin. The clinical evaluation of the response generally agreed with the bacteriological response. Among patients who were bacteriologically evaluable for four target organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis) the pathogen was eradicated in four of seven (57%) in the clarithromycin-treated group and in five of six (83%) in the roxithromycin-treated group. Adverse events were reported in more patients who received roxithromycin (21.6%) than in those who received clarithromycin (12.5%) although the incidences were not statistically significantly different. The majority of adverse events were transient increases in serum alanine aminotransferase, serum aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Clarithromycin was shown to be effective and well-tolerated; the clinical efficacy and safety of clarithromycin and roxithromycin were comparable.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefixime in pediatric respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Cefixime (CFIX) was evaluated clinically in pediatric respiratory tract infections, particularly those caused by Haemophilus influenzae: 1. The total number of children in this study treated with CFIX was 232, out of which 215 cases were evaluated for clinical efficacy and 224 cases were investigated for safety. A daily dosage of 3-6 mg/kg/day was given divided into 2 to 3 times daily for 3-15 days. 2. Causative organisms were identified in 146 cases, out of which 128 cases were found to be single microbial infections and 18 cases were mixed infections. In single microbial infections, clinical efficacy was 100% for those caused by H. influenzae/Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and was 95% for Streptococcus pyogenes with an overall efficacy of 96.9%. In mixed infections, the clinical efficacy was 100% for those caused by a combination of H. influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the overall rate was 94.4%. An involvement of H. influenzae was observed in 108 cases with a clinical efficacy rate of 99.1%, and definite involvement of beta-lactamase secreting strains of H. influenzae was found in 32 cases with a clinical efficacy of 96.9%. 3. Bacteriological effect was studied for 164 strains identified in 146 cases, and eradication rates were 89.5% for H. influenzae, 100% for H. parainfluenzae and S. pyogenes, and 71.4% for S. pneumoniae. The overall eradication rate was 91.4%. Superinfection was observed in 21 cases. MICs against 78 strains of H. influenzae were in a range of less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml regardless of beta-lactamase production, and far superior to cefaclor and amoxicillin. MICs against S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae were in ranges of less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml and 0.39 micrograms/ml, respectively. 4. Clinical efficacy was 93.0% in 215 cases (excellent: 136, good: 64, fairly good: 10, poor: 5). CFIX attained a high efficacy in the range of 89.4-95.7% in acute pharyngitis, acute tonsillitis, acute bronchitis and acute pneumonia. 5. Safety was monitored in 224 cases and there were only one case of loose stool and another of diarrhea as side effects. There were no abnormal findings in 31 cases of the laboratory test. In conclusion, it was confirmed that CFIX is excellent and safe in the treatment of the respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of cefuroxime axetil and cefaclor for treatment of acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Cefuroxime axetil, a new beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin, was compared with cefaclor for the treatment of acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis in 106 adult patients. Direct sinus aspirations for quantitative bacterial culture were done for all patients before treatment; aspiration was repeated for most patients after treatment. Pretreatment sinus aspirates were positive for 63 of 134 sampled sinuses. Of specimens yielding at least 10(4) CFU/mL, Haemophilus influenzae (38%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (37%) were the most common pathogens. Ten (42%) of 24 strains of H influenzae, 2 (40%) of 5 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and all 3 isolates (60%) of Branhamella catarrhalis produced beta-lactamase. Cefuroxime axetil, 250 mg twice a day, was compared with cefaclor, 500 mg three times a day. Among culture-positive sinuses, bacteriologic cure was achieved in 36 (95%) of 38 sinuses and 15 (71%) of 21 sinuses treated with cefuroxime axetil and cefaclor, respectively. The overall frequencies of adverse events were similar between drugs, although cefuroxime axetil was associated with more frequent diarrhea. Cefuroxime axetil was an effective therapy for the treatment of acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis in adults.
TI  - [Clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil in pediatrics].
AB  - The clinical efficacy and the safety of cefteram pivoxil granule (CFTM-PI, T-2588), a newly prepared drug for pediatric use, were performed. A total of 60 patients with ages between 6 months and 14 years 3 months with pediatric infections were medicated with CFTM-PI at dose levels of 3.2-9.9 mg/kg 3 times daily for 3-11 days. Clinical responses to the drug were excellent in 3 of 3 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 14, good in 5 and poor in 2 of 21 patients with acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 1 and good in 2 of 3 patients with acute bronchitis, excellent in 16 and good in 8 of 24 patients with acute pneumonia, excellent in 3 and good in 1 of 4 patients with acute urinary tract infection and excellent in 2 of 2 patients with acute purulent lymphadenitis, hence the overall clinical efficacy rate was 96.5% in a total of 57 patients. Bacteriological responses to the drug were as follows: Eradicated, 8 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 3 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 19 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive; 7, beta-lactamase negative; 12), 1 strain of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (beta-lactamase positive) and 4 strains of Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase positive; 1, beta-lactamase negative; 3), decreased, 1 strain of S. pyogenes, hence the eradication rate was 97.2%. No side effects were encountered in any of the patients but for 3 who had diarrhoea and 1 who had loose stool, though these changes were slight. As abnormal laboratory test data, elevation of GOT was noted in 1 case, thrombocytosis and elevation of GPT in another. Also, none of the patients refused or complained of difficulty in intaking of the drug via oral route. In conclusion, CFTM-PI appeared to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic against pediatric infections.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil granules in pediatrics].
AB  - A newly developed cephalosporin, cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI, T-2588), was evaluated clinically in 40 patients. A pharmacokinetic study was also performed with 8 patients. CFTM-PI was administered as granules. One patient was given CFTM-PI at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg, each of 3 patients was given the drug at a dose of 3 mg/kg and each of 4 patients at a dose of 6 mg/kg. In most cases, serum concentrations of CFTM were determined at 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours after dosing. Urinary concentrations of CFTM were measured for urinary samples collected during periods of 0-2, 2-4, 4-6 and 6-8 hours after dosing. CFTM was assayed using the disk or the cup method using Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 10031 as the test organism. The clinical evaluation was conducted in 40 children including 13 patients of acute tonsillitis, 10 of acute lacunar tonsillitis, 10 of scarlet fever, 2 of acute bronchitis, 2 of pneumonia, and 1 each of pneumonia with enteritis, phlegmon and urinary tract infection. The patients were from 4 months to 13 years old. Daily doses were from 8.7 to 12 mg/kg. After CFTM-PI administration in doses 1.5 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, peak serum concentrations of CFTM were 0.38 microgram/ml, 0.73-2.25 micrograms/ml and 1.2-2.9 micrograms/ml, respectively, and half-lives were 1.55, 0.95-2.30 and 0.80-2.72 hours, respectively. Urinary excretion rates up to 6 or 8 hours after dosing were 10.8-24.7%. Clinical efficacies of CFTM-PI in 40 patients were "excellent" in 27 children, "good" in 12 children and "fair" in 1 with an efficacy rate of 97.5%. Twenty seven strains of causative organisms, including 15 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 of Escherichia coli, 1 of Salmonella 04, 6 of Haemophilus influenzae, 1 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 3 of Branhamella catarrhalis, were isolated. After treatment all strains except 1 strain of B. catarrhalis (unchanged), Salmonella 04 (unknown) and 1 strain of H. parainfluenzae (unknown) were eradicated. Side effects observed clinically were only 1 case of diarrhea. Eosinophilia was observed in 1 case.
TI  - Pulmonary diseases in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus in  Zimbabwe, Central Africa.
AB  - During the 11 month period up to 30 September 1987, 37 patients (26 male, 11 female, mean age 27 years) with respiratory symptoms who were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, were studied prospectively on 40 occasions to determine the cause of any pulmonary complications. HIV was heterosexually transmitted. Predominant symptoms were cough (89%), fever (89%), weight loss (83%), and dyspnoea (60%). Transnasal fibre-optic bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushings and transbronchial lung biopsies) was performed on 35 patients, twice on 3 patients. 'Tru-cut' lung biopsies were obtained from 2 patients who died before bronchoscopy. Pulmonary tuberculosis was the commonest disease, being found in one-third of the patients (12 of 37). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 4; the remainder of the plates were contaminated. Pneumocystis carinii was present in 8 patients: as the sole pathogen in 3, with Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, and one also had tuberculous lymphadenitis. Endobronchial Kaposi's sarcoma was seen in 6 of 7 patients with skin nodules. Bacterial pathogens isolated included Staph. aureus (5), S. pneumoniae (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Haemophilus influenzae (2), H. parainfluenzae (1) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). Invading Aspergillus fumigatus was diagnosed by lung biopsy in one. No diagnosis was reached for 8 patients. It is concluded that in Central Africa pulmonary complications in AIDS patients are similar to those in Europe and North America but the incidence of different pathogens depends on the prevalence of pathogens in the community. M. tuberculosis is probably the commonest pathogen. This study has confirmed that P. carinii pneumonia does occur, but occurs less frequently.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil(cefteram) a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates of cefteram (CFTM) were determined upon oral administration after meal of cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI) at doses of 3 mg/kg granules in 2 cases and 6 mg/kg granules in 2. Peak serum levels of CFTM were obtained at 3 hours in 2 cases and 4 hours in 2 cases after administration of the drug with a range of 0.74-2.2 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 0.77-3.62 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 8 hours after administration ranged from 9.6-23.0%. 2. MICs of CFTM against 22 clinical isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes 4 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 4, Staphylococcus aureus 2, Branhamella catarrhalis 1, Haemophilus influenzae 8, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 1, and Escherichia coli 2) were compared with those of cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX), and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of CFTM was superior to those of CCL and CEX, and was superior against Gram-negative rods and equal against Gram-positive cocci to those of ABPC. 3. Twenty-six pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (scarlet fever 3 cases, tonsillitis 7, epiglottitis 1, bronchitis 5, pneumonia 5, urinary tract infection 3, cervical lymphadenitis 2) were treated with CFTM-PI at daily doses of 9.3-15.3 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 100% clinically and 70% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed except for an increased platelet count in 1 case.
TI  - [Clinical experience with cefodizime in bacterial infection of children].
AB  - Clinical studies were performed on cefodizime (THR-221, CDZM), a new cephem antibiotic as described below. CDZM was administered to 13 patients in dose levels ranging from 55 to 96 mg/kg/day t.i.d. for 3-7 days (5.5 days on average). These patients included 8 with pneumonia, 2 with tonsillitis, 1 each with bronchitis, phlegmon and urinary tract infection. The overall efficacy rate was 92.3%, i.e., efficacy was excellent in 8, good in 4 and poor in 1. Bacteriological efficacy was 83.3%, i.e., 5 strains of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae 1, Haemophilus influenzae 3, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 1) were eradicated and 1 was unchanged (Enterobacter cloacae, MIC greater than 100 micrograms/ml). Clinical side effect was not observed during the treatment. Laboratory abnormalities were observed in 2 cases, i.e., a slight elevation of GPT and a mild eosinophilia. The above results suggest that CDZM is a useful antibiotic for treating pediatric bacterial infections.
TI  - [Clinical and pharmacokinetic study on cefodizime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, in the pediatric infections].
AB  - Cefodizime (THR-221, CDZM), a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 27 children with various bacterial infections. The episodes of infections included pneumonia (6 cases), bronchopneumonia (11 cases), lung abscess (1 case), acute pharyngitis (2 cases), cervical lymphadenitis (1 case), infected cephalohematoma (1 case), urinary tract infection (1 case), sepsis (2 cases) and purulent meningitis (2 cases). CDZM was effective in all but one, and its efficacy rate was 96.3%. The main etiologic pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Branhamella catarrhalis. The elimination rate was 92.3%. As adverse reactions or abnormalities, diarrhea was encountered in 4 cases. A slight elevation of serum transaminases or eosinophils was observed in 4 cases. The serum half-life was approximately 1.8-1.9 hours in children after intravenous bolus injections. Concentrations of CDZM in cerebrospinal fluids were well above MIC values of CDZM against those organisms responsible for the infections. The data suggest that CDZM is a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with bacterial infections including purulent meningitis.
TI  - Histamine synthesis by respiratory tract micro-organisms: possible role in pathogenicity.
AB  - Five bacterial species considered to be potential pathogens in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and pneumonia--Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae--were evaluated for their potential to synthesise histamine in vitro. Bacterial species commonly isolated from infected sputum but generally not considered to be pathogenic--Enterobacteriacae, Neisseria pharyngis, coagulase negative staphylococci, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, and Candida albicans--were similarly studied. Of the "pathogens", the Gram negative species B catarrhalis, H parainfluenzae and Ps aeruginosa synthesised clinically important amounts of histamine; this was not the case for the Gram positive species S aureus and S pneumoniae. Of the "non-pathogenic" species, only the Enterobacteriacae, as a group, were found to synthesise clinically important amounts of histamine. These results show that some Gram negative bacteria, associated with acute exacerbations in respiratory infections, produce histamine and possibly other inflammatory mediators, which may contribute to their pathogenecity in the lower respiratory tract in vivo.
TI  - [Studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) were carried out in the field of pediatrics. 1. Absorption and excretion Serum levels and urinary excretion of SBT/ABPC were studied in 4 children with ages 6 to 8 years. The mean serum concentration of SBT at 15 minutes following a single intravenous injection of 30 mg/kg of SBT/ABPC was 27.4 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml and that of ABPC was 42.8 +/- 3.9 micrograms/ml, and their concentrations declined with mean half-lives of 1.06 +/- 0.15 hours and 0.84 +/- 0.05 hour, respectively, and at 6 hours were 0.3 +/- 0.2 microgram/ml and 0.2 +/- 0.1 microgram/ml on the average, respectively. The urinary recovery rates of SBT and ABPC at 6 hours after the injection were 59.0 +/- 22.4% and 58.4 +/- 25.3% on the average, respectively. 2. Clinical study SBT/ABPC was used for the treatment of a total of 36 pediatric patients with ages ranging 2 months to 11 years and it's clinical effectiveness, bacteriological efficacy and adverse effects were evaluated. Clinical efficacies in 5 patients with acute purulent tonsillitis, 26 with acute pneumonia and 1 with acute pyelonephritis were judged to be excellent in 27 cases and good in 5 cases with an overall efficacy ratio of 100.0%. Clinical efficacies in 6 patients whose infections were caused by beta-lactamase producing strains were judged to be excellent in all cases. Bacteriological efficacies of SBT/ABPC were assessed on 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 16 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (5 beta-lactamase producing strains and 11 non-beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 non-beta-lactamase strain of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 2 strains of Escherichia coli (non-beta-lactamase producing strains). All strains except 1 strain of H. influenzae (beta-lactamase producing strain) which decreased in number were eradicated with a bacteriological eradication rate of 95.5%. Only 1 patient complained of diarrhea which was suspected to be related to the drug. No other side effect was reported. Elevations of GOT and GPT were observed in only 1 patient. The above results suggested that SBT/ABPC was a useful drug with preferable safety profile in the treatment for pediatric patients with infectious disease caused by beta-lactamase producing strains as well as those by non-beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - [Clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - During 8 months from October 1986 to May 1987, the clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) was evaluated in 63 pediatric inpatients with various infections. Clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6 with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis, 1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. Bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Gram-positive cocci, 5 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, 7 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Salmonella subgenus I). Bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for Gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for Gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. No superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. Side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of GOT in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of GPT in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. As an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, PIVKA II was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. From the above results, it appears that SBT/ABPC is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies of clarithromycin in pediatric fields].
AB  - We have carried out laboratory and clinical studies on clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268). The results are summarized as follows. Serum and urinary concentrations of TE-031 were determined in 5 children with ages between 6 and 11 years given single oral doses of 5, 6.7, 10 and 15 mg/kg. Serum concentrations peaked at 1 hour after administration of 5, 6.7 and 15 mg/kg, and respective peak values were 1.98 micrograms/ml, 2.21 micrograms/ml and 5.58 micrograms/ml. Biological half-lives for the drug at 5, 6.7 and 15 mg/kg dose were 2.99 hours, 2.08 hours and 2.09 hours, respectively. Mean serum concentrations peaked at 2 hours after administration of 10 mg/kg, and peak values were 3.91 +/- 1.64 micrograms/ml. Biological half-lives were 3.00 +/- 0.58 hours. The 6-hour urinary recovery rates ranged from 22.7% to 23.8% after administration of 10 mg/kg, and the 6-hour urinary recoveries were 30.1%, 20.5% and 39.1% after administration of 5 mg/kg, 6.7 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, respectively. Therapeutic responses were recorded as excellent or good in 35(89.7%) of the children, comprising 5 with tonsillitis, 3 with pharyngitis, 7 with bronchitis, 5 with pneumonia, 15 with Mycoplasma pneumonia, 1 with whooping cough and 3 with Campylobacter enteritis. The microbiological effectiveness of TE-031 on identified pathogens comprising 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 5 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 strains of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Campylobacter spp. was satisfactory as evidenced by an eradication rate of 82.4%. No significant side effect due to the drug was observed in any cases. In conclusion, TE-031 was found to be efficacious and safe for the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on clarithromycin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268), a new macrolide antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates were determined upon oral administration on fasting of TE-031 at doses of 5 mg/kg granules in 1 case and tablets in 2 cases, and 10 mg/kg granules in 1 and 15 mg/kg granules in 1. Peak serum levels were obtained at 30 minutes in 2 cases, at 1 hour in 2 cases and at 2 hours in 1 case after administration of the drug with a range of 2.29-7.10 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 2.2-7.5 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 6 hours after administration ranged from 7.1-34.5%. 2. MICs of TE-031 against 49 clinical isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes 5 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 9, Staphylococcus aureus 3, Branhamella catarrhalis 4, Haemophilus influenzae 14, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 7, and Campylobacter jejuni 7) were compared with those of josamycin (JM), erythromycin (EM), and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of TE-031 was superior to those of JM and equal to those of EM. 3. Fifty-five pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (scarlet fever 3 cases, pharyngitis and tonsillitis 15, pertussis 2, pneumonia 10, bronchitis 14, Campylobacter enteritis 11) were treated with TE-031 at daily doses of 10-35 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 96% clinically and 72% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed. 5. None of children refused TE-031.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of sultamicillin fine granule in pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granule were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Escherichia coli were compared with those of ampicillin (ABPC). SBTPC was superior to ABPC especially against beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae, E. coli, S. aureus, and B. catarrhalis. 2. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates of sulbactam (SBT) and ABPC after administration of SBTPC fine granule at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in 2 cases were determined. Mean half-lives of SBT and ABPC in the serum following oral administration were about 1.33 and 1.61 hours respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates of SBT and ABPC in 6 hours after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg were 58.7% and 49.6% respectively. 3. SBTPC fine granule was administered to 20 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pneumonia 8 cases, bronchitis 2, pharyngitis 2, tonsillitis 4, subcutaneous abscess 1 and urinary tract infection 3). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 100% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was 75%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except 1 case of loose stool. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed. These results indicate the usefulness of SBTPC fine granule in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Sinusitis in children.
AB  - Upper respiratory tract infection and allergic inflammation are recognized as the important risk factors for acute sinusitis, with upper respiratory tract infection being most common. In children with acute or chronic sinusitis, the respiratory symptoms of nasal discharge, nasal congestion and cough are usually prominent. Radiography has traditionally been used to determine the presence or absence of sinus disease. The radiographic findings most diagnostic of bacterial sinusitis are diffuse opacification, mucous membrane thickening or an air-fluid level. The predominant organisms include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis and nontypable Haemophilus influenzae. Several viruses including adenovirus and parainfluenzae have also been recovered. Clinical improvement is prompt in nearly all children treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on rokitamycin (RKM) dry syrup, a new macrolide antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates after oral administration on fasting of RKM dry syrup at doses of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg to 2 and 1 cases, respectively, were determined. Peak plasma levels were obtained in 30 minutes after administration of both dosages with half-lives of 1.5 to 2.2 hours. A clear-cut dose response was observed. Urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration ranged from 1.75 to 2.26%. 2. The MICs of RKM against 80 clinical isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes 9, Streptococcus pneumoniae 14, Branhamella catarrhalis 4, Haemophilus influenzae 27, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 9, Haemophilus haemolyticus 2, Haemophilus parahaemolyticus 14 and Campylobacter jejuni 1) were compared with MICs of midecamycin acetate (MOM), josamycin (JM) and erythromycin (EM). The antibacterial activity of RKM was superior to those of MOM and JM and slightly inferior to that of EM. 3. Twenty-eight pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (acute tonsillitis 4, streptococcal infection 4, acute bronchitis 9, pneumonia 4, mycoplasmal pneumonia 2 and Campylobacter enteritis 5) were treated with RKM dry syrup at a daily dose of 12-42.9 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. Efficacy rates were 92.9% clinically and 58.6% bacteriologically. 4. No adverse reactions were observed. Abnormal laboratory findings were mild; thrombocytosis in 2 and eosinophilia in 1. 5. The taste and the odor of RKM dry syrup preparation were sufficiently tolerable for the pediatric patients to accept it.
TI  - [Microbiological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  - Rokitamycin (RKM), a newly developed macrolide antibiotic with a 16-membered ring, dissolves well under acidic conditions. It has been improved over other macrolides to minimize individual variations in its absorbability. We measured, using the GA-test, variations in gastric acidities of 43 children with ages between 1 to 14 years, and investigated the relationship between gastric acidities and pharmacokinetic values. Also activities (expressed in MICs) of antimicrobial agents were studied against clinically isolated 229 bacterial strains using an inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. Tested organisms included Streptococcus pyogenes (77 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (29), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), as Gram-positive cocci, and Haemophilus influenzae (1), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), Bordetella pertussis (12), Salmonella sp. (4) and Campylobacter jejuni (103) as Gram-negative bacilli. Against stock strains of bacteria, MICs of 10 drugs (RKM, erythromycin (EM), josamycin (JM), midecamycin (MDM), midecamycin acetate (MOM), clindamycin (CLDM), amoxicillin (AMPC), cefaclor (CCL), minocycline, ofloxacin (OFLX] were determined. Against isolates from patients who underwent treatment with RKM, MICs of only 4 drugs (RKM, EM, JM, MOM) were determined. Measurements were made on plasma and urinary concentrations of RKM and its urinary recovery rates after patients including 6 boys with ages between 5 years 1 month and 11 years 6 months were administered with RKM (dry syrup). Two groups of 6 boys were administered between meals with RKM at dose levels of 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. Clinical and bacteriological effects of RKM were evaluated for 175 patients including 5 cases of pharyngitis, 3 tonsillitis, 32 pneumonia, 17 mycoplasmal pneumonia, 34 atypical pneumonia, 28 streptococcal infections, 29 Campylobacter enteritis, 4 Salmonella gastroenteritis, and 23 enteritis due to unknown organisms. Five drop-out cases were excluded from the evaluations. In the evaluable cases, an average dose level used was 31.8 mg/kg/day, with a daily dose divided into 3 to 4 administrations and with an average treatment duration of 9 days. Adverse reactions of RKM and its effects on laboratory test values were investigated in these patients including the drop out cases. Obtained results of these studies are summarized below. 1. The GA-test produced pH values indicating that amounts of gastric acid were mostly either normal or high in 42 of the 43 subjects tested (97.7%), and only one low acid case (2.3%) was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The epidemiology of respiratory tract pathogens in southern Netherlands.
AB  - Results of sputum cultures and susceptibility tests have been reviewed for the years 1977-1986, with approximately 1,700 positive cultures per year. Haemophilus influenzae always occupied the first place, being grown in 65% of positive specimens in 1977 and 37% in 1986. Streptococcus pneumoniae occupied the second place, rising from 17 to 27% in the same period, during which Branhamella catarrhalis rose from 5 to 26%. Based on the frequency of occurrence of individual bacterial species in the sputum cultures and on the percentage of strains resistant to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and ofloxacin, theoretical chances of failure of blind therapy were calculated and found to be most advantageous for ofloxacin and cotrimoxazole. No explanation could be given for the increase in beta-lactamase production by B. catarrhalis, but the disappearance of Haemophilus parainfluenzae may have been due to improvements in the identification procedure.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of A-56268 (TE-031) and erythromycin against 306  clinical isolates.
AB  - The inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal (MBC) activities of a new macrolide A-56268 (TE-031) against 306 clinical aerobic bacterial isolates was compared with that of erythromycin. The MIC90/MBC90 ratios for A-56268 were: Campylobacter jejuni 4/16, Haemophilus influenzae 8/8-16, H. parainfluenzae 8/8-16, Legionella pneumophila 0.06/0.5, methicillin-sensitive isolates of Staphylococcus aureus 0.5/1, and coagulase negative staphylococci 1/8, methicillin resistant isolates of Staph. aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci greater than 16/ greater than 16, Streptococcus pneumoniae 0.06/0.125, streptococcus Group A 0.06/2-4, streptococcus Group B 0.06/8- greater than 16, streptococcus Groups C and G 0.125/8 and Str. faecalis 4/64. Compared with erythromycin, A-56268 had greater inhibitory and bactericidal activity against isolates of L. pneumophila, with an MIC90 16-fold less and an MBC90 eight-fold less than that of erythromycin. Except for enterococci, A-56268 showed inhibitory activity equal to or greater than that of penicillin G against isolates of streptococci and an MIC two-fold less than that of erythromycin. For other strains tested, the inhibitory and bactericidal activities of A-56268 and erythromycin were similar. The clinical importance of the differences between these two macrolides will depend on the pharmacokinetic and tissue penetration properties of the new compound.
TI  - Imipenem-cilastatin in the treatment of respiratory infections in patients with chronic airways obstruction.
AB  - Chest infections with organisms resistant to conventional antibiotics are common  in patients with chronic lung disease. We have studied the use of imipenem in 40 (28 M 12 F) patients admitted for treatment of chest infections. Patients were treated with imipenem 0.5 g four times daily by intravenous infusion for 6.3 +/- 1.6 (S.D.) days. Forty-six respiratory pathogens were cultured from 36 patients including 18 Haemophilus influenzae, 6 H. parainfluenzae, 6 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 6 Branhamella catarrhalis. Forty-three of the 46 isolates were sensitive to imipenem, 28 to ampicillin, 33 to tetracycline and 35 to cotrimoxazole. Thirty-eight of the 40 patients improved clinically, and 34 of the 36 patients with positive sputum culture had no pathogens in their sputum after treatment. Twenty patients developed minor phlebitis at the infusion site but there were few other side effects. Imipenem may prove useful in the treatment of chest infections, particularly when the organism is resistant to conventional antibiotics.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetical, bacteriological and clinical studies of flomoxef in the pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetical, bacteriological and clinical studies of flomoxef (FMOX, 6315-S), a new cephem antibiotic, were conducted in the pediatric field. 1. Mean drug concentrations in the blood after intravenous one shot injection of FMOX 20 mg/kg to 5 children (aged 5-8 years) were 39.7 micrograms/ml at 1/4 hour, 24.1 micrograms/ml at 1/2 hour, 12.2 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 4.7 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, 1.1 microgram/ml at 4 hours, and 0.3 microgram/ml at 6 hours. The mean half-life in blood was 0.65 hour. Mean concentrations in urine was 3,558 micrograms/ml during 0-2 hours after intravenous injection, 568 micrograms/ml during 2-4 hours, and 117 micrograms/ml during 4-6 hours. The mean 6-hour urinary recovery rate was 72.8%. 2. Clinically, FMOX was administered to 32 children (5 months to 9 years) with infections, i.e. 29 with pneumonia, 1 each with acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent lymphadenitis and cellulitis. The treatment was excellent in 24 cases and good in 8. Thus, the efficacy rate was 100%. 3. The bacteriological effect of FMOX was investigated using 11 clinical isolates which were considered to be causative organisms, i.e. 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain of Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Except one strain (H. influenzae) which was just decreased, all the bacteria were eliminated. 4. No side effect was found at all. As abnormal laboratory findings, elevation of GOT was found in 1 case, thrombocytosis in 2, and eosinophilia in 1 but all the changes were slight and were normalized by the time of re-examination. The above results suggest that FMOX is a useful and safe drug for the pediatric practice just as in the adult field.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefuzonam in pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies were conducted to evaluate cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a new cephem type antibiotic, in the pediatric field. A total of 9 pediatric patients (2-14 years) was treated with intravenous injection of CZON: 4 cases with one shot of 20 mg/kg, 2 cases with one shot of 40 mg/kg and 3 cases with drip infusion over 1 hour of 40 mg/kg. CZON concentrations in serum and the excretion in urine were determined. Mean serum concentrations of CZON after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were 49.0, 22.7, 9.03, 2.13, 0.37, and 0.09 micrograms/ml at 15, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, respectively. With 40 mg/kg one shot intravenous injections, mean serum concentrations were 117.5, 68.0, 26.2, 8.80, 0.63 and 0.19 micrograms/ml at 15, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, respectively. With 40 mg/kg intravenous drip infusions over 1 hour, mean concentrations were 57.1, 78.8, 12.9, 1.12 and 0.23 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, respectively. Mean half-lives were 0.69 hour for 20 mg/kg one shot injections, 0.44 hour for 40 mg/kg one shot injections, and 0.58 hour for 40 mg/kg 1 hour drip infusions. Urinary recovery rates in 6 hour after administration were 70.8% (mean) for the 20 mg/kg one shot injection, 44.1% (1 case) for the 40 mg/kg one shot injection, and 60.0% (mean) for the 40 mg/kg 1 hour drip infusion. CZON was administered in 26 cases of pediatric infections, and the clinical efficacy, antibacterial activity, and side effects were evaluated. Of the 26 cases 2 were excluded for the reason of not having bacterial infection, and the remaining 24 cases were assessed. Included in the 24 cases were 16 cases of acute pneumonia, 2 cases of acute purulent lymphadenitis, and 1 case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent otitis media, acute apical periodontitis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), acute pyelonephritis, and acute enteritis. Clinical efficacy evaluation showed 19 excellent cases and 5 good cases, with an efficacy rate of 100%. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus 1 strain, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1 strain, beta-Streptococcus 1 strain, Haemophilus influenzae 10 strains, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 1 strain, Proteus mirabilis 1 strain, and Campylobacter jejuni 1 strain were determined or assumed as pathogens, but all of them were eradicated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Evaluation of cefuzonam in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefuzonam (L-105, CZON) was studied in pediatric infections. A summary of the results it as follows: For recently isolated Staphylococcus aureus strains, Peak MICs of CZON were distributed between 0.39 and 0.78 micrograms/ml showing a greater susceptibility of S. aureus to CZON than to cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX), and cefmenoxime (CMX). Peak MICs of CZON for Escherichia coli were 0.10-0.20 micrograms/ml, similar to those of CPZ, LMOX, and CMX. Ampicillin (ABPC)-resistant strains were also susceptible to CZON. MICs for Salmonella were similar to those for E. coli. Peak MICs of CZON for Vibrio parahaemolyticus were 0.20-0.39 micrograms/ml. The susceptibility of the bacteria to CZON was far greater than to ABPC, and was similar to CPZ, LMOX, and CMX. With 20 mg/kg drip infusion, serum concentrations reached their peaks at the end of administration with values of 20.6-68.7 micrograms/ml, which decreased to 0.43-1.70 micrograms/ml after 2 hours. Half-lives of CZON in serum were 0.68-1.2 hours. With 50 mg/kg drip infusion, serum concentrations reached their peaks at the end of administration with levels of 69.0-82.0 micrograms/ml, and at after 2 hours 1.85-3.45 micrograms/ml. Thus, an apparent dose response was observed. Half-lives of CZON in serum were 0.63-0.99 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 6 hours were 39.9-80.5%. A total of 44 cases of 10 different types of acute pediatric infections was treated by CZON intravenous drip infusion as the main therapeutic procedure. The efficacy rate was 93.2%, and the compound was effective on purulent infections, acute urinary tract infection, etc. with pathogens such as ABPC-resistant S. aureus, E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis. Dosage levels per day were 50 to 80 mg/kg in most cases. In infections with S. aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 strains), E. faecalis (1 strain), Haemophilus parahaemolyticus (1 strain), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (11 strains), Bordetella pertussis (1 strain), E. coli (3 strains), a total of 30 strains, bacterial elimination was noted with an exception of 1 strain of S. aureus. The compound was used for 4 to 15 days, but side effects observed clinically were only 1 case of diarrhea and 1 case of thrombocytosis.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. Antibacterial activities of CZON against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and H. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefazolin (CEZ). CZON was nearly as active as CEZ against S. aureus and S. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other Gram-positive cocci. Against Gram-negative rods, CZON was as active as CMX and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CZON at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. Mean serum concentrations of CZON at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. Thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2, acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, UTI 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with CZON at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. The overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. No adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. These results clearly indicate the usefulness of CZON in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Sulbactam/ampicillin vs. chloramphenicol/ampicillin for the treatment of meningitis in infants and children.
AB  - Eighty-one patients ages one month to 14 years with meningitis were randomized to receive either sulbactam (50 mg/kg per day) and ampicillin (400 mg/kg per day; 41 patients) or chloramphenicol and ampicillin (40 patients). The groups were comparable in terms of sex and degree of illness; however, more patients treated with chloramphenicol/ampicillin than patients treated with sulbactam/ampicillin were younger than 12 months of age (78% vs. 56%). Pathogens were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 65 (80%) of the 81 patients. In the sulbactam/ampicillin group, there were 18 Haemophilus influenzae isolates (one resistant to ampicillin), five Streptococcus pneumoniae, five Neisseria meningitidis, one Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one Listeria. In the chloramphenicol/ampicillin group, there were 19 H. influenzae isolates, 10 S. pneumoniae, three N. meningitidis, one Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and one Citrobacter. Of 63 patients with assessable CSF pathogens, one (3%) of 29 treated with sulbactam/ampicillin died (S. pneumoniae) and six (18%) of 34 treated with chloramphenicol/ampicillin died (two, H. influenzae; three, S. pneumoniae; and one, Citrobacter). Twelve percent in the sulbactam/ampicillin group and 18% in the chloramphenicol/ampicillin group had neurologic sequelae. No clinically significant reactions or toxicities were noted. Sulbactam/ampicillin was as effective as chloramphenicol/ampicillin in the treatment of meningitis.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on cefminox in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - A new antibiotic of cephamycin group, cefminox (CMNX, MT-141) was studied both fundamentally and clinically in the field of pediatrics. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of CMNX for clinical isolates including 24 strains of S. aureus, 15 strains of S. pyogenes, 21 strains of H. influenzae, 24 strains of E. coli, 22 strains of K. pneumoniae and 22 strains of P. mirabilis were determined and compared to those of cefmetazole (CMZ), latamoxef (LMOX), cefotaxime (CTX), cefoperazone (CPZ) and cefazolin (CEZ). The MIC80 (80% MIC) values of CMNX for H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis were 1.56, 1.56, 0.39 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. When compared to antibacterial activities of the control drugs, the activity of CMNX was inferior to those of CTX and LMOX but superior to those of CMZ and CEZ. On the other hand, MIC80 values of CMNX for S. pyogenes and S. aureus were 6.25 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, the activities being inferior to all of CMZ, CTX, LMOX, CPZ and CEZ used as the control drugs. In 3 pediatric patients of 9 to 12 years old, 20 mg/kg of CMNX was given intravenously as one shot and serum and urinary concentrations were determined. The mean serum concentrations in these 3 cases were 124 micrograms/ml, 102 micrograms/ml, 74.0 micrograms/ml, 47.9 micrograms/ml, 20.4 micrograms/ml, 9.2 micrograms/ml and 4.3 micrograms/ml at 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours, respectively, with a half-life of 1.83 hours. The mean urinary concentrations were 1,968 micrograms/ml at 0 approximately 2 hours, 1,205 micrograms/ml at 2 approximately 4 hours, 761 micrograms/ml at 4 approximately 6 hours and 409 micrograms/ml at 6 approximately 8 hours, with 65.4% of the drug dosed recovered from the urine within the first 8 hours on an average. CMNX was used in the treatment of 22 clinical cases including 3 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 3 cases of acute bronchitis, 9 cases of acute pneumonia, 5 cases of acute pyelonephritis and 2 cases of acute enteritis. Clinical results in 20 cases excluded of 2 cases of Mycoplasma pneumonia were rated as excellent in 19 cases and as good in 1 case, with an efficacy rate being 100% taking excellent and good cases as effective cases. Bacteriological results for 5 strains of H. influenzae, 1 strain of H. parainfluenzae, 5 strains of E. coli, 2 strains of K. oxytoca and 1 strain of S. pneumoniae revealed that disappearance was obtained for all strains but 1 strain of P. aeruginosa which persisted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Ceftriaxone administered once or twice a day for treatment of bacterial infections of childhood.
AB  - Twenty-six children received a single daily intravenous dose of ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg, for a variety of bacterial infections including abscess (5), cellulitis (5), periorbital cellulitis (5), bacteremia without focus (4), osteomyelitis (2), pneumonia (2), pyelonephritis (2) and otitis media (1). Organisms isolated from infectious foci were Staphylococcus aureus (9), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), Streptococcus pyogenes (3), Escherichia coli (2); and Haemophilus influenzae type b, nontypable H. influenzae, Group B streptococcus, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and satelliting streptococcus (1 each). Microbiologic cure was achieved in 20 of 22 (91%) infections and clinical cure in 25 of 26 (96%). Fifteen possible adverse reactions occurred in 34 patients evaluable for drug safety; most were mild and self-limited. Neutropenia developed in two patients necessitating discontinuation of ceftriaxone in one, followed by prompt resolution. Seventeen children received ceftriaxone, 75 mg/kg/day, in two divided doses for a similar variety of infections. Bacteriologic and clinical cure rates of 100 and 94%, respectively, were demonstrated. Leukopenia developed in one patient and resolved when ceftriaxone was discontinued. Once a day dosing of ceftriaxone in pediatric patients provides greater ease of administration combined with efficacy equal to that achieved with a divided dosage schedule.
TI  - [Rhino- and oropharyngeal carriage of Haemophilus sp. in children].
AB  - The occurence of Haemophilus sp. and other potential pathogens: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Neisseria meningitidis has been investigated in 79 children from rhino and oropharyngeal material. H. parainfluenzae is only isolated from the oropharynx. H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae may be isolated from the rhinopharynx but are associated to signs of infection in the upper respiratory tract. The capsule of H. Influenzae represents a colonization factor of the rhinopharynx from an oropharyngeal carriage. 6.1% of H. influenzae and 28% of H. parainfluenzae isolates were found resistant to penicillin by production of betalactamase.
TI  - Treatment of 160 cases of acute bacterial meningitis with cefotaxime.
AB  - One hundred and sixty cases of acute bacterial meningitis were treated with cefotaxime. Patients were between 9 days and 79 years old: 7 new borns, 37 infants, 43 children, 19 adolescents and 54 adults. Fifty-eight patients (36%) were in coma when admitted. Aetiology was determined in 110 patients (68.8%): Neisseria meningitidis in 42, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 36, Haemophilus influenzae in 16, Salmonella spp. in 7, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Enterobacter spp. in 2 and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae in one patient each. All isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime, with MIC's for 26 strains ranging from 0.01 to 0.50 mg/l. One hundred and fifty-six of the 160 patients were treated with cefotaxime alone and the four others with cefotaxime in association with an aminoglycoside in three and rifampicin in one. Cefotaxime was administered by intravenous infusion, in a daily dose 100 to 300 mg/kg. Duration of treatment ranged from 8 days to 6 weeks, with a mean of 15 days. One hundred and forty-nine patients (93.1%) were cured, two after a relapse. Three patients had sequelae. Most (88.5%) had sterile CSF within 72 h after starting treatment. Eleven patients (6.9%) died, eight within the first 48 h. The only side-effects observed were mild transient eosinophilia in some patients and rash and leukopenia in 2 each. The study demonstrates that cefotaxime is effective in the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Acute epiglottitis in adults.
AB  - We treated four adults whose upper airway was compromised due to acute epiglottitis. We also reviewed the English literature for all reports of this condition in adults (18 years and older). Among the 158 cases, the infectious etiology was identified in 29 (H. influenzae 20, Streptococcus pneumoniae six, H. parainfluenzae two, Streptococcus pyogenes one). In the remaining cases, the etiology was uncertain. Bacteremia was documented in 23/32 patients (71.9%), but extra-epiglottic infections were strikingly rare (X = six). The clinical manifestations were sore throat (100%), fever (88%), dyspnea (78%), dysphagia (76%), anterior neck cellulitis or tenderness (27%), hoarseness (21%), pharyngitis (20%) and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (9%). Complete airway obstruction ensued in 23 out of the 119 subjects (18.3%) who had respiratory difficulty. Overall mortality rate was 17.6% but it was 6.4% among the patients who were semi-electively tracheostomized or endotracheally intubated. These findings illustrate that antibiotics therapy active against H. influenzae is required in the treatment of acute epiglottitis in adults. Additionally, airway patency should be established when inspiratory stridor appears assuring uncomplicated recovery.
TI  - The use of beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of septicaemia and endocarditis.
AB  - Despite the availability of numerous beta-lactam antibiotics, benzylpenicillin remains the most important beta-lactam antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Penicillin alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside is effective in the treatment of endocarditis due to all streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus aprophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Listeria monocytogenes. Oral phenoxymethylpenicillin in combination with streptomycin is effective in treating endocarditis due to viridans streptococci. Ampicillin is effective in endocarditis due to Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. paraphrophilus, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli. Oral amoxicillin with gentamicin has been used to treat enterococcal endocarditis. The penicillinase-resistant penicillins are effective in treating S. aureus endocarditis. Carbenicillin or ticarcillin in combination with tobramycin or gentamicin are used to treat endocarditis due to Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The use of piperacillin in combination with tobramycin against P. aeruginosa endocarditis has been associated with failure and increased resistance. The cephalosporins have been used to treat endocarditis caused by susceptible organisms. There have been few data on the efficacy of the newer cephalosporins in treating endocarditis. They have been used to treat septicaemia due to susceptible organisms with good results.
TI  - Latamoxef (moxalactam) in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Forty-three patients admitted to the hospital with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis were treated with latamoxef (moxalactam) twice daily intramuscularly for 10 days. Five patients received 0.5 g injections, 23 patients 1 g and 15 patients were given 2 g. Three patients dropped out of the study; one died suddenly, one was treated with another antibiotic because of suspected Gram-negative pneumonia and one developed pneumococcal septicaemia after the active treatment course. Most strains of Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis were successfully eradicated but, by day 17, there were 7 patients with reinfections with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Latamoxef MIC values for Str. pneumoniae varied from 0.03 to 2 g mg/1, but most were in the region of 1 mg/1. Sputum concentrations reached approximately 1.5 mg/1 on the highest dosage but only 0.25 to 1 mg/1 on the lower doses. Peak Serum concentrations with the increasing doses averaged 14, 27 and 45 mg/1 respectively. The role and dosage of latamoxef in respiratory infections in the possible presence of streptococci are discussed.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of 6059-S therapy in children (author's transl)].
AB  - A new semisynthetic 1-oxa-beta-lactam derivative, 6059-S, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. Twenty-five patients were treated with 10 to 274 mg/kg per day of 6059-S by intravenous administrations. The diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute bronchitis (2), pneumonia (4), pertussis (4), acute enterocolitis (2), recurrent urinary tract infection (2), suspected septicemia (3), and acute purulent meningitis (1); and the remaining 5 patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. The pathogens recovered were Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1), Enterobacter aerogenes (1), Proteus morganii (1), Psuedomonas aeruginosa (2) and Salmonella typhimurium (1). All the patients of bacterial infections were cured after the 6059-S therapy. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium were not eradicated after the 6059-S therapy, and the rate of bacterial disappearance was 75%. Diarrhea (3), precordial pain (2, only in cases with high-dose therapy), transient elevation of GOT and GPT (2), and transient eosinophilia (2) were found to be associated with the 6059-S therapy. However, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. Half life of the serum 6059-S level was 1.34 +/- 0.16 hours. CSF concentrations in a case with Haemophilus influenzae meningitis ranged 4.0 to 9.7 mcg/ml after an intravenous injection of 34.3 to 75 mg/kg of 6059-S. From the present study, 6059-S appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections. It remains to be further determined whether 6059-S is superior to ABPC in the treatment of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of normal maxillary sinuses.
AB  - The bacterial flora of non-inflamed maxillary sinuses were studied in 12 adults.  Patients' median age was 35 years (range 25 to 53 years): 8 were females and 4 were males. Aseptic aspiration of the sinus was made when the patients were under general anaesthesia for corrective plastic surgery of the nasal septum. All aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes. Anaerobes were isolated in all 12 specimen patients; in 5 patients (42%), they were the only organisms isolated, and in 7 (58%), they were recovered mixed with aerobes. There were 33 anaerobic isolates (2.75 pr specimen) and the predominant ones were: 11 Bacteroides sp. (including 6 B. melaninogenicus), 10 anaerobic gram-positive cocci and 5 Fusobacterium sp. There were 16 aerobic isolates (1.3 per specimen) and the predominant ones were: 5 beta hemolytic streptococci, 3 alpha hemolytic streptococci, and 2 each of S. pneumoniae and hemophilus parainfluenzae. Beta lactamase production was noted in 4 isolates recovered from 3 patients. These included all isolates of S. aureus (2) and 2 of 6 isolates of B. melaninogenicus. The presence of aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the non-inflamed sinus demonstrates the non-sterility of the sinus cavity. In the events that follow closure of the sinus ostium, these bacteria may become pathogenic.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  - As a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (CPZ), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) When tested against 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of CPZ was found to be weaker than that of CEZ. Against 5 strains of A-beta-Streptococcus and 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both CPZ and CEZ exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. CPZ was effective against 18 strains of Escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. Against 15 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, CPZ was found to be more effective than CEZ though several high-resistant strains were noted. CPZ also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than CEZ against 4 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of Salmonella sp., 4 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of Proteus sp. (2) The mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of CPZ to three children was 70 minutes. (3) One hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of CPZ to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. In one case, the CSF/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) The average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) Eighteen pediatric patients received CPZ in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. They were RTI in 7, URI in 5, UTI in 5, SSSS in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. The clinical effectiveness of CPZ was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. One patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. The three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) Side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of GOT and GPT, and 1 case of mild elevation of GOT. All were considered to be minor.
TI  - Interactions between viruses and bacteria in patients with chronic bronchitis.
AB  - The possibility that viral infections of the respiratory tract might predispose to bacterial colonization or infection was studied in 120 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 30 control subjects; these individuals were observed for seven years. The ratio of the number of observed to the number of expected associations between viruses and bacteria was 2.43 (P = 0.037) for the pair influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae and was 2.06 (P = 0.056) for influenza virus and Haemophilus influenzae. Consistently positive, but not significant, associations were detected between rhinovirus and herpes simplex virus infections and isolations of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. In contrast, isolations of the nonpathogenic Haemophilus parainfluenzae could not be related to prior viral infections. Significant rises in titer of antibody to H. influenzae were detected on 76 occasions, and 20 (26%) of these antibody rises were associated with viral or mycoplasmal infections during the preceding 120 days. The expected number of such associations was 8.34 (ratio of number observed to number expected, 2.40; P = 0.08). These results suggest that viral infections of the respiratory tract in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are associated with increased colonization by potentially pathogenic bacteria and may also predispose to infections with H. influenzae.
TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
TI  - Bacteriology and clinical significance of hemolytic Haemophilus in the throat.
AB  - Hemolytic Haemophilus are rarely isolated in the clinical laboratory, as they do  not grow on sheep or human blood-agar alone. On rabbit blood-agar they grow well and are hemolytic, but they grow less well and are not hemolytic on sheep blood-agar with added X and V factors. A survey was made to determine their incidence in pharyngitis. From 28 of 100 sore throats and from 57 of 100 normal throats, only normal bacterial flora were isolated. beta-Streptococci were present in significant numbers in 9 sore and 11 normal throats; staphylococci in 8 sore and 4 normal throats; pneumococci in 20 sore and 11 normal throats; H. influenzae or H. parainfluenzae in 13 sore and no normal throats; hemolytic Haemophilus in 30 sore and 18 normal throats; enteric bacilli in 1 of each; Candida and Neisseria in 2 sore throats each. All of the 33 hemolytic Haemophilus isolates identified to species were H. parahaemolyticus. All were sensitive in vitro to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and tetracycline; 30 were sensitive to ampicillin and 30 to penicillin, 26 to novobiocin, and 12 to methicillin. H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and H. haemolyticus are indistinguishable by Gram stain morphology, but H. parahaemolyticus is larger than the other three. Hemolytic and nonhemolytic species are indistinguishable by colonial morphology or by nutritional requirements; only hemolysis gives positive differentiation. Nevertheless, only rarely would this be of clinical importance. H. parahaemolyticus apparently may cause pharyngitis, but it is almost always susceptible to penicillin and rarely if ever causes sequelae.
