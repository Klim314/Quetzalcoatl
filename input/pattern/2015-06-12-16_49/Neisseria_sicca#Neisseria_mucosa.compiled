TI  - Oropharyngeal Colonization With Neisseria lactamica, Other Nonpathogenic Neisseria Species and Moraxella catarrhalis Among Young Healthy Children in Ahvaz, Iran.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neisseria lactamica as one of the main commensal in oropharynx during the childhood is related to the induction of a natural immunity against meningococcal meningitis. Also Moraxella catarrhalis in oropharynx of children is a predisposing factor for otitis media infection. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to investigate the frequency of the N. lactamica, other nonpathogenic Neisseria spp. and M. catarrhalis in the oropharynx of young healthy children in Ahvaz, Iran by the two phenotypic tests and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 192 oropharyngeal swab samples of the young healthy children were studied during four months. Swabs were plated onto enriched selective media and non-selective media. Gram-negative and oxidase-positive diplococci were identified by several conventional biochemical tests. The PCR and sequencing were used to confirm the accuracy of laboratory diagnosis to identify N. lactamica and M. catarrhalis. RESULTS: Among 192 young healthy children with the mean age of 5.93 +/- 2.5903 years, authors identified: N. lactamica (21.9%) in the age group of one to nine years; N. mucosa (6.3%); N. sicca (7.8%); N. cinerea (1.6%); N. subflava (biovar subflava) (4.2%); N. subflava (biovar perflava) (28.1%); N. subflava (biovar flava) (7.3%) and M. catarrhalis (42.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The young healthy children screening by colonization of N. lactamica and other nonpathogenic Neisseria spp. in oropharynx was the first report in Ahvaz, Iran. The study results demonstrated the high frequency of colonization of M. catarrhalis in the studied young healthy children other than Neisseria spp.
TI  - Genome sequence analyses show that Neisseria oralis is the same species as 'Neisseria mucosa var. heidelbergensis'.
AB  - Phylogenies generated from whole genome sequence (WGS) data provide definitive means of bacterial isolate characterization for typing and taxonomy. The species status of strains recently defined with conventional taxonomic approaches as representing Neisseria oralis was examined by the analysis of sequences derived from WGS data, specifically: (i) 53 Neisseria ribosomal protein subunit (rps) genes (ribosomal multi-locus sequence typing, rMLST); and (ii) 246 Neisseria core genes (core genome MLST, cgMLST). These data were compared with phylogenies derived from 16S and 23S rRNA gene sequences, demonstrating that the N. oralis strains were monophyletic with strains described previously as representing 'Neisseria mucosa var. heidelbergensis' and that this group was of equivalent taxonomic status to other well-described species of the genus Neisseria. Phylogenetic analyses also indicated that Neisseria sicca and Neisseria macacae should be considered the same species as Neisseria mucosa and that Neisseria flavescens should be considered the same species as Neisseria subflava. Analyses using rMLST showed that some strains currently defined as belonging to the genus Neisseria were more closely related to species belonging to other genera within the family; however, whole genome analysis of a more comprehensive selection of strains from within the family Neisseriaceae would be necessary to confirm this. We suggest that strains previously identified as representing 'N. mucosa var. heidelbergensis' and deposited in culture collections should be renamed N. oralis. Finally, one of the strains of N. oralis was able to ferment lactose, due to the presence of beta-galactosidase and lactose permease genes, a characteristic previously thought to be unique to Neisseria lactamica, which therefore cannot be thought of as diagnostic for this species; however, the rMLST and cgMLST analyses confirm that N. oralis is most closely related to N. mucosa.
TI  - Intraspecific 16S rRNA gene diversity among clinical isolates of Neisseria species.
AB  - In the present work, nearly the entire 16S rRNA gene sequences of 46 clinical samples of Neisseria spp. were determined, and the aligned sequences were analyzed to investigate the diversity of 16S rRNA genes in each commensal Neisseria species. Two 16S rRNA types were identified in two Neisseria sicca strains, three 16S rRNA types in five Neisseria macacae strains, fourteen 16S rRNA types in twenty Neisseria flavescens isolates, and fourteen 16S rRNA types in nineteen Neisseria mucosa isolates. The number of nucleotides that were different between 16S rRNA sequences within specie ranged from 1 to 15. We found high intraspecific sequence variation in 16S rRNA genes of Neisseria spp. strains.
TI  - [Gene detection of Neisseria spp. isolated from male patients with genitourinary  tract infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect the genes of Neisseria spp. isolated from patients with male genitourinary tract infections, and to study the pathogenicity of non-gonococcal strains of Neisseria and the laboratory diagnosis for the infections caused by Neisseria spp. METHODS: Using polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing, we amplified and sequenced 4 genes of Neisseria spp. isolated from patients with male genitourinary tract infections, including 16S rRNA, orfl, cppB and nspA. RESULTS: Fourteen Neisseria strains were identified through analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, including 3 N. mucosa strains, 3 N. cinerea strains, 2 N. gonorrhoea strains, 2 N. sicca strains, 2 N. subflava strains, 1 N. lactamica strain, and 1 N. polysaccharea strain. Among them, 9 showed positive results in gonococcal fluorescence-labeled multiplex-PCR detection, 1 in cppB gene reaction, 5 in orfl gene reaction, and 3 in nspA gene reaction. The consistency rate was 85.7% between the above results from our gene detection and those from the routine bacteriological methods. CONCLUSION: The cppB gene is absent in the non-gonococcal strains of Neisseria spp. that can cause male genitourinary tract infection. Most of the strains not only lack virulence-associated orfl and nspA genes, but also show positive results in gonococcal fluorescence-labeled multiplex-PCR detection, which is one of the important reasons for the misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. The combination of routine bacteriological methods and gene detection in laboratory examinations may help improve the accuracy rates of Neisseria species identification and clinical diagnosis of the infections caused by Neisseria spp.
TI  - Biochemical and genomic analysis of the denitrification pathway within the genus  Neisseria.
AB  - Since Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are obligate human pathogens, a comparison with commensal species of the same genus could reveal differences important in pathogenesis. The recent completion of commensal Neisseria genome draft assemblies allowed us to perform a comparison of the genes involved in the catalysis, assembly and regulation of the denitrification pathway, which has been implicated in the virulence of several bacteria. All species contained a highly conserved nitric oxide reductase (NorB) and a nitrite reductase (AniA or NirK) that was highly conserved in the catalytic but divergent in the N-terminal lipid modification and C-terminal glycosylation domains. Only Neisseria mucosa contained a nitrate reductase (Nar), and only Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria cinerea, Neisseria subflava, Neisseria flavescens and Neisseria sicca contained a nitrous oxide reductase (Nos) complex. The regulators of the denitrification genes, FNR, NarQP and NsrR, were highly conserved, except for the GAF domain of NarQ. Biochemical examination of laboratory strains revealed that all of the neisserial species tested except N. mucosa had a two- to fourfold lower nitrite reductase activity than N. gonorrhoeae, while N. meningitidis and most of the commensal Neisseria species had a two- to fourfold higher nitric oxide (NO) reductase activity. For N. meningitidis and most of the commensal Neisseria, there was a greater than fourfold reduction in the NO steady-state level in the presence of nitrite as compared with N. gonorrhoeae. All of the species tested generated an NO steady-state level in the presence of an NO donor that was similar to that of N. gonorrhoeae. The greatest difference between the Neisseria species was the lack of a functional Nos system in the pathogenic species N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis.
TI  - Distribution of transferrin binding protein B gene (tbpB) variants among Neisseria species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transferrin binding protein B (tbpB), an outer membrane lipoprotein,  is required for the acquisition of iron from human transferrin. Two tbpB families have been documented in Neisseria meningitidis: an isotype I tbpB gene of 1.8 kb and an isotype II tbpB gene of 2.1 kb, the former expressed by meningococci in the disease-associated ST-11 clonal complex and the latter found among meningococci belonging to the hyper-invasive clonal complexes including ST-8, ST-18, ST-32, ST-41/44 as well as N. gonorrhoeae isolates. The origin of the isotype I tbpB gene is unknown, however several features in common with non-pathogenic Neisseria and the ST-11 clonal complex N. meningitidis isolate FAM18 have been documented leading to the hypothesis that the isotype I tbpB gene may also be shared between non-pathogenic Neisseria and ST-11 meningococci. As a result, the diversity of the tbpB gene was investigated in a defined collection of Neisseria species. RESULTS: Two families of isotype I tbpB were identified: family A containing conserved genes belonging to ST-11 meningococci, N. polysaccharea and N. lactamica isolates and family B including more diverse isotype I tbpB genes from N. sicca, N. mucosa, N. flava, N. subflava as well as N. cinerea, N. flavescens and N. polysaccharea isolates. Three isotype II tbpB families were identified with: family C containing diverse tbpB genes belonging to N. polysaccharea, N. lactamica, N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis isolates, family D including another subset of isotype II tbpB genes from N. lactamica isolates and family E solely composed of N. gonorrhoeae tbpB genes. CONCLUSION: This study reveals another instance of similarity between meningococci of the ST-11 clonal complex and non-pathogenic Neisseria with the origin of the isotype I tbpB gene resulting from a horizontal genetic transfer event occurring between these two populations.
TI  - Plasmid mediated antibiotic resistance in marine bacteria.
AB  - This research work was conducted in Uppanar estuary to ascertain the role of plasmids in the antibiotic resistance of bacteria. Water and sediment samples were collected for a period of three months. When tested against 20 antibiotics 22 MAR strains were isolated from the samples, which were found resistant to 5-13 antibiotics. They belong to 7 genera and 10 species. Gram-negative bacteria namely Neisseria mucosa, N. sicca, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella ozaenae, Citrobacterintermedius, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were isolated. Gram-positive bacteria were of Bacillus subtilis, B. megaterium and Micrococcus luteus. When plasmid curing was done using acredine orange, the resistance against penicillin-G, ampicillin, tetracycline, amoxycillin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol were totally lost in all strains, which confirmed the role of plasmid in these strains against antibiotics. Ten strains belong to different species were selected for the plasmid isolation and electrophoresis was done. Presence of plasmids in all strains was confirmed and the molecular weight was in the range of 2850 to 3170 bp. The study revealed that MAR strains are common in Uppanar estuary and they are plasmid mediated. This environment is seemed to be deteriorating at an alarming rate.
TI  - Variations in gene organization and DNA uptake signal sequence in the folP region between commensal and pathogenic Neisseria species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Horizontal gene transfer is an important source of genetic variation  among Neisseria species and has contributed to the spread of resistance to penicillin and sulfonamide drugs in the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. Sulfonamide resistance in Neisseria meningitidis is mediated by altered chromosomal folP genes. At least some folP alleles conferring resistance have been horizontally acquired from other species, presumably from commensal Neisseriae. In this work, the DNA sequence surrounding folP in commensal Neisseria species was determined and compared to corresponding regions in pathogenic Neisseriae, in order to elucidate the potential for inter-species DNA transfer within this region. RESULTS: The upstream region of folP displayed differences in gene order between species, including an insertion of a complete Correia element in Neisseria lactamica and an inversion of a larger genomic segment in Neisseria sicca, Neisseria subflava and Neisseria mucosa. The latter species also had DNA uptake signal sequences (DUS) in this region that were one base different from the DUS in pathogenic Neisseriae. Another interesting finding was evidence of a horizontal transfer event from Neisseria lactamica or Neisseria cinerea that introduced a novel folP allele to the meningococcal population. CONCLUSION: Genetic recombination events immediately upstream of folP and horizontal transfer have resulted in sequence differences in the folP region between the Neisseria species. This variability could be a consequence of the selective pressure on this region exerted by the use of sulfonamide drugs.
TI  - Neisserial pilin genes display extensive interspecies diversity.
AB  - All Neisseria live in association with host cells, however, little is known about the genetic potential of nonpathogenic Neisseria species to express attachment factors such as pili. In this study, we demonstrate that type IV pilin-encoding genes are present in a wide range of Neisseria species. N. sicca, N. subflava, and N. elongata each contain two putative pilE genes arranged in tandem, while single genes were identified in N. polysaccharea, N. mucosa, and N. denitrificans. Neisserial pilE genes are highly diverse and display features consistent with a history of horizontal gene transfer.
TI  - The integration site of the iga gene in commensal Neisseria sp.
AB  - An IgA1 protease is produced by the human pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, Neisseria species. In this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the N. gonorrhoeae strain MS11 and compared to corresponding loci in N. meningitidis and commensal Neisseria species. In N. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpB and ksgA were found immediately downstream of iga. In addition to comL and comA, a homolog of the Escherichia coli YFII gene was identified upstream of iga. Each gene in the iga region (YFII and comL, comA and iga, and trpB and ksgA) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. The comL/ comA and iga/ trpB pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. These terminators contain the common gonococcal DNA uptake sequence (DUS). A highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in N. gonorrhoeae was also found in N. meningitidis. In Southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal DNAs of the commensal species N. mucosa, N. lactamica, N. flavescens, N. cinerea, N. subflava, N. flava, N. sicca or N. elongata. When N. gonorrhoeae comL and trpB were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. This indicated that commensal Neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between comA and trpB. The region between comA and trpB was therefore amplified by PCR. The fragment obtained from N. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal comA and trpB, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology to any known gonococcal sequence. Our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. N. lactamica, which is more closely related to N. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.
TI  - Acid stress upregulated outer membrane proteins in clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but not most commensal Neisseria.
AB  - Human immune serum recognition of outer membrane components from commensal and pathogenic Neisseria cultured under neutral and acidic conditions was investigated. Acid stress caused no detectable alterations in lipooligosaccharide migration and (or) staining, in outer membrane protein profiles, or in immune serum recognition of outer membrane components from Neisseria mucosa or Neisseria sicca. There was also no difference in the lipoologosaccharide electrophoretic pattern of acid- and neutral-grown Neisseria lactamica, but there were differences in outer membrane protein expression. The outer membrane protein alterations induced by acid stress in N. lactamica were not the same as those seen in isolates from patients with uncomplicated gonococcal infection, pelvic inflammatory disease, and disseminated gonococcal infection. Many differences were detected in the immune serum recognition of outer membrane components from acid- and neutral-cultured N. lactamica and from the clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and these should be considered in vaccine design.
TI  - Multicolonization of human nasopharynx due to Neisseria spp.
AB  - The colonization due to Neisseria spp. in the nasopharynx of forty healthy adults was studied by using a selective medium that allows the differentiation of Neisseria species and inhibits the rest of pharyngeal microbiota. The medium detected a variety of colonial morphology types and some metabolic characteristics of the isolates. We demonstrated the multicolonization by several Neisseria spp. in the same individual, and we isolated several strains of the same species, after analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns obtained from the different colonial types previously identified as the same species. The forty adults studied were colonized by 112 forms of Neisseria spp., and twelve colonization patterns were obtained: one species (45%), two (45%), three (7.5%) and four (2.5%). N. perflava-N. sicca, either alone or in combination with other species was the most frequent isolate (92.5%). The analysis of PFGE patterns obtained from different colonial types revealed the multicolonization by several strains of the same species in some individuals. This fact was found in N. perflava-N. sicca (50%) and N. mucosa (2.5%).
TI  - Identification of the conjugative mef gene in clinical Acinetobacter junii and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates.
AB  - The mef gene, originally described for gram-positive organisms and coding for an  efflux pump, has been identified in clinical isolates of Acinetobacter junii and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. These strains could transfer the mef gene at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) into one or more of the following recipients: gram-negative Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria perflava/sicca and Neisseria mucosa and gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis. Three Streptococcus pneumoniae strains could transfer the mef gene into Eikenella corrodens, Haemophilus influenzae, Kingella denitrificans, M. catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, N. perflava/sicca, and N. mucosa at similar frequencies. The mef gene can thus be transferred to and expressed in a variety of gram-negative recipients.
TI  - Erythromycin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae and oral commensal Neisseria spp. carry known rRNA methylase genes.
AB  - Two Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates from Seattle and two isolates from Uruguay were resistant to erythromycin (MIC, 4 to 16 microg/ml) and had reduced susceptibility to azithromycin (MIC, 1 to 4 microg/ml) due to the presence of the self-mobile rRNA methylase gene(s) ermF or ermB and ermF. The two Seattle isolates and one isolate from Uruguay were multiresistant, carrying either the 25.2-MDa tetM-containing plasmid (Seattle) or a beta-lactamase plasmid (Uruguay). Sixteen commensal Neisseria isolates (10 Neisseria perflava-N. sicca, 2 N. flava, and 4 N. mucosa) for which erythromycin MICs were 4 to 16 microg/ml were shown to carry one or more known rRNA methylase genes, including ermB, ermC, and/or ermF. Many of these isolates also were multiresistant and carried the tetM gene. This is the first time that a complete transposon or a complete conjugative transposon carrying an antibiotic resistance gene has been described for the genus Neisseria.
TI  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae : Detection and Typing by Probe Hybridization, LCR, and PCR.
AB  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae, first described by Neisser in 1879, is a Gram-negative, nonmotile, nonspore-forming diplococcus, belonging to the family Neisseriaceae. It is the etiologic agent of gonorrhea. The other pathogenic species is Neisseria meningitidis, to which N. gonorrhoeae is genetically closely related. Although N. meningitidis is not usually considered to be a sexually transmitted disease, it may infect the mucous membranes of the anogenital area of homosexual men (1). The other members of the genus, which include Neisseria lactamic a, Neisseriapolysaccharea, Neisseria cinerea, and Neisseria flavescens, which are related to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and saccharolytic strains, such as Neisseria subflava, Neisseria sicca, and Neisseria mucosa, which are less genetically related to the aforementioned, are considered to be nonpathogenic, being normal flora of the nasopharyngeal mucous membranes (2).
TI  - Identification and characterization of specific sequences encoding pathogenicity  associated proteins in the genome of commensal Neisseria species.
AB  - The distribution of distinct sequences in pathogenic and commensal Neisseria species was investigated systematically by dot blot analysis. Probes representing the genes of Rmp, pilin and IgA1 protease were found to hybridize exclusively to the chromosomal DNA of the pathogenic species, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Neisseria meningitidis. In contrast, specific sequences for the genes of the porin protein Por and the opacity protein (Opa) were also detected in a panel of commensal Neisseria species such as N. lactamica, N. subflava, N. flava, N. mucosa and N. sicca. Using opa-specific oligonucleotides as probes in chromosomal blots, the genomes of the commensal Neisseria species show a totally reduced repertoire of cross-hybridizing loci compared to the complex opa gene family of N. gonorrhoeae. DNA sequence analysis of one opa-related gene derived from N. flava and N. sicca, respectively, revealed a large degree of homology with previously described gonococcal and meningococcal genes, e.g., a typical repetitive sequence in the leader peptide and the distribution of the hypervariable and conserved regions. This observation, together with the finding, that the gene is constitutively transcribed, leads to the assumption that some of the commensal Neisseria species may have the potential for the expression of a protein harboring similar functions as the Opa proteins in pathogenic Neisseriae.
TI  - A numerical phenotypic taxonomic study of the genus Neisseria.
AB  - A numerical phenotypic taxonomic study of 315 strains of Neisseria and some allied bacteria examined for 155 phenotypic tests showed 31 groups, most of which were reasonably distinct. These fell into four major areas. Areas A, B and C contained species of Neisseria, whereas area D contained the organisms known as 'false neisserias' together with Branhamella, Moraxella and Kingella species. Area A contained N. gonorrhoeae (which showed two subgroups), N. meningitidis (with two subgroups, and N. cinerea closely associated), N. polysaccharea, N. elongata subsp, glycolytica and N. lactamica. Area B contained mainly organisms from the human nasopharynx, and the nine groups were not very distinct: only three, N. mucosa, N. perflava and N. sicca could be recognized by the presence of type strains, and there was little relationship between taxonomic position and species epithets. Area C contained several groups from animals, N. animalis, N. canis and two phenons that may be justified as new species of Neisseria, one from lizards and the other from dental plaque of herbivores. Area C also contained N. elongata, N. subflava (with N. flavescens), type strain of Morococcus cerebrosis and the CDC groups M-5 (N. weaveri) and EF-4. Area D contained Branhamella catarrhalis, a combined group which consists of strains of the 'false neisserias' N. caviae and N. cuniculi, the 'false neisseria' N. ovis, and a group of Moraxella strains. A small group representing Kingella kingae is included in area D. Mean test error was 1.7%.
TI  - Detection of the tetM determinant in Neisseria gonorrhoeae using a non-radioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe.
AB  - Three oligonucleotide probes, complementary to tetM sequences, were labelled non-radiometrically using the DIG-oligonucleotide tailing kit and evaluated for their specificity for the detection of plasmid mediated tetracycline resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Only Probe 3, 5'-GCT CAA CAA TTC TGT TCC AGC-3', was specific for tetM. It hybridized with the tetM-containing 25.2-MDa plasmids from all of the 232 TRNG and the 130 PP/TRNG isolates used in the study. Its sensitivity, determined by dot-blot hybridization, was 0.1 pg of pJ13 plasmid DNA or 10(4) cells. It did not hybridize with the DNA from non-PPNG, CMRNG and tetracycline susceptible isolates from seven other Neisseria species (N. meningitidis, N. subflava, N. cinerea, N. lactamica, N. sicca, N. mucosa, and N. flavescens), Moraxella spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. Probe 3 also hybridized to DNA of three tetracycline resistant P. magnus (MIC = 16 micrograms ml-1) isolates which presumptively carried the tetM determinant. Therefore, probe 3 can be used by reference laboratories as a confirmatory test for TRNG, as well as isolates from other genera containing the tetM determinant.
TI  - Genetic diversity of the iron-binding protein (Fbp) gene of the pathogenic and commensal Neisseria.
AB  - The pathogenic Neisseria and most commensal Neisseria species produce an iron-binding protein (Fbp) when grown under iron-limited conditions. In the current study, we confirmed the presence of Fbp, as well as DNA sequences homologous to the gonococcal fbp, in strains of N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, N. cinerea, N. lactamica, N. subflava, N. kochii and N. polysaccharea. The fbp genes from these strains were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, digested with StuI or RsaI, and the restriction patterns examined. The patterns for the gonococcal and meningococcal fbp were virtually identical; however, variations were observed in the fbp sequences of the commensal Neisseria species. N. flavescens, N. mucosa, N. sicca, N. ovis and Branhamella catarrhalis, did not produce Fbp as detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reactivity with an Fbp specific monoclonal antibody, nor did they hybridize to an fbp-specific DNA probe.
TI  - Distribution of a protein antigenically related to the major anaerobically induced gonococcal outer membrane protein among other Neisseria species.
AB  - The Pan 1 protein of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a novel 54-kDa outer membrane protein expressed only when gonococci are grown in the absence of oxygen. It is a major antigen recognized by sera from patients with gonococcal infection. We raised mouse monospecific polyclonal antiserum to gel-purified Pan 1 from gonococcal strain F62. The antiserum was broadly cross-reactive among gonococcal strains; all strains tested reacted in immunoblot analysis proportionate to the amount of Pan 1 visible in silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels. In immunoblot experiments, N. lactamica and N. cinerea reacted very strongly to the anti-Pan 1 antiserum, whereas N. sicca, N. flava, and N. mucosa did not react at all. The other commensals tested, N. subflava and N. perflava, exhibited only a minor reaction. These results correlated with the apparent amount of Pan 1 seen on SDS-polyacrylamide gels of outer membranes. SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis of six meningococcal strains revealed no visible anaerobically induced outer membrane proteins, and the subsequent immunoblots showed only slight or no reaction to the anti-Pan 1 antibody. In the four meningococcal strains that did react slightly with the antiserum, a Pan 1-like protein was seen only in anaerobically grown cells. Thus, meningococci did not express Pan 1 at levels comparable to that found in gonococci; however, when Pan 1 was expressed in meningococcal strains, it was oxygen regulated. This is the first example of a protein found in the gonococcal outer membrane that, under identical growth conditions, is not expressed at similar levels in the meningococcus.
TI  - The occurrence of Branhamella catarrhalis and other commensal Neisseriaceae in clinical sputum specimens in Lagos, Nigeria.
AB  - Branhamella catarrhalis and other commensal Neisseria species were isolated from  200 out of 500 sputum samples from patients with lower respiratory tract (LRT) infections at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH). B. catarrhalis was isolated from 60 (12%). The isolation rates for other Neisseria species were as follows: N. mucosa from 45 (9%), N. sicca from 40 (8%), N. lactamica from 35 (7%), N. cinerea from 12 (2.4%) and N. subflava from 8 (1.6%). B. catarrhalis occurred in pure cultures in 15 (25%) of the 60 samples positive for this organism. Twenty (33%) out of the 60 N. catarrhalis isolates were beta-lactamase positive.
TI  - Respiratory symptoms due to Branhamella catarrhalis and other Neisseria species infections--response to erythromycin therapy.
AB  - Neisseria microorganisms (Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria sicca, and Neisseria mucosa) are regarded as normal respiratory commensals. Branhamella catarrhalis (formerly Neisseria catarrhalis) has also been regarded as a normal respiratory commensal, but reports indicate that it can be pathogenic. The role of Neisseria spp was studied in 160 patients with chest infections and symptoms and signs of obstructive respiratory disease. Group I patients (n = 140) had a history of asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Group II patients (n = 20) had an initially responsive pulmonary tuberculosis but presented with fever and obstructive airway disease. Group I patients had disease that was difficult to control despite increased bronchodilator therapy, but they responded dramatically after two to three days of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Patients in group II showed a similar response to erythromycin. Neisseria infection was responsible for precipitating or exacerbating respiratory distress in both groups. Accordingly, it is concluded that Neisseria can be pathogenic and that patients with fever and obstructive respiratory symptoms require treatment.
TI  - High-level tetracycline resistance resulting from TetM in strains of Neisseria spp., Kingella denitrificans, and Eikenella corrodens.
AB  - Similar to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, tetracycline-resistant isolates of N. meningitidis, Kingella denitrificans, and Eikenella corrodens contained 25.2-megadalton plasmids carrying the TetM determinant. In contrast, tetracycline-resistant N. subflava biovar perflava-N. sicca and N. mucosa isolates carried the TetM determinant in the chromosome.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid identification method for Neisseria spp.
AB  - A comparison was made of carbohydrate degradation reactions of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria mucosa, Neisseria sicca, Neisseria subflava, and Branhamella catarrhalis in a rapid (0.5- to 1-h) identification micromethod (RIM-N Kit; Austin Biological Laboratories, Inc., Austin, Tex.) and in a serum-free agar slanted medium (72 h). Reactions after 1 h in the RIM-N system agreed completely with those after 72 h in the conventional system.
TI  - Conjugation of plasmids of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to other Neisseria species: potential reservoirs for the beta-lactamase plasmid.
AB  - The discovery that penicillinase production in Neisseria gonorrhoeae was plasmid  mediated and the spread of the beta-lactamase encoding plasmids in gonococcal isolates since 1976, raise the possibility that a nonpathogenic indigenous bacterium could serve as a reservoir for these plasmids. We initiated studies to define the ability of commensal Neisseria species and Branhamella catarrhalis strains, as well as strains of the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis, to serve as recipients in conjugation with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. We found that with N. gonorrhoeae as the donor, 3 of 5 Neisseria cinerea, 2 of 5 Neisseria flava, 0 of 1 Neisseria flavescens, 1 of 3 Neisseria subflava, 0 of 6 B. catarrhalis, 0 of 7 Neisseria lactamica, 1 of 5 Neisseria mucosa, 1 of 7 Neisseria perflava/sicca, and 0 of 13 N. meningitidis strains gave detectable conjugation frequencies (greater than 10(-8). N. cinerea was the only species found to maintain the gonococcal conjugal plasmid (pLE2451). A N. cinerea transconjugant containing pLE2451 was observed to transfer both the beta-lactamase plasmid and pLE2451 to N. gonorrhoeae at high frequency.
TI  - The significance of nongonococcal, nonmeningococcal Neisseria isolates from blood cultures.
AB  - Nongonococcal, nonmeningococcal neisseriae are part of the normal respiratory flora and infrequently cause disease. These organisms include Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria mucosa, Neisseria sicca, Neisseria flavescens, Neisseria subflava , Neisseria perflava , Neisseria flava , and Branhamella catarrhalis (previously classified as Neisseria catarrhalis). Blood cultures positive for these bacteria have been associated with serious infections, including endocarditis, septicemia, and meningitis. In a retrospective survey of a 10-year period, 1970-1980, eight patients were identified at Hartford Hospital (Hartford, Conn.) whose blood cultures were positive for nongonococcal, nonmeningococcal neisseriae. In four patients, the neisseria blood isolates were associated with serious infections: two with endocarditis, one with sepsis, and one with meningitis. In four other patients, the neisseria blood isolates were contaminants.
TI  - Neisseria in early stage of dental plaque.
AB  - Neisseria in the early stage of dental plaque was studied. Two hundred seventeen  strains of Neisseria were isolated from the 12-hour plaque of 9 subjects by using lactose-agar. The isolated strains were divided into 6 major groups with biological characteristics. One hundred twenty-one strains (56%) produced glycogen-like polysaccharide from sucrose. They were divided into 3 groups. Groups 1 and 2 were identified as N. mucosa and N. sicca, respectively. There were 106 strains of N. sica, being the most predominant of the species. The number of strains not producing polysaccharide was 96 (44%). Groups 4 and 5 were Branhamella and N. subflava. The absorption spectra of the ethanol extracts of the pigment in each group were similar and this result supported propriety of the classification by biological characteristics. The adhesiveness of Neisseria to the glass plate was examined. Approximately one-half of N. sica showed an adhesion capacity.
TI  - Selective isolation of Neisseria sicca from the human oral cavity on eosin methylene blue agar.
AB  - Strains of Neisseria sicca and N. mucosa, but not N. perflava, N. subflava, N. flava, or N. flavescens were found to grow on eosin methylene blue agar. The distribution of N. sicca on the tongue dorsum, the gingival crevice area, and the coronal surfaces of teeth of humans was determined using this medium. N. sicca averaged about 5% of the total cultivable organisms of the tongues of 14 subjects examined, but it was present in only trace quantities in dental plaque on the coronal surfaces of teeth or in the gingival crevice area.
TI  - [Isolation and identification of Neisseria in bronchial asthma].
AB  - A study was made of 29 strains of neisseria isolated from the mucosa of the pharynx and the bronchi of patients suffering from infectious-allergic bronchial asthma of different severity. Comparison of the strains by 22 tests (including the assessment of the morphological, biochemical and other signs) permitted to establish the species of neisseria with some probability. The species reference was determined in 23 cultures. N. perflava was isolated in 10 cases, N. subflava--in 6, N. flava--in 3 cases and N. sicca--in 4 cases, 2 strains corresponded to apigmentary N. cinerea. The species was not established in 4 cultures. There was found no connection between a definite microbial association and the species of neisseria and the severity of the disease. Pigment species of neisseria should be tested as diagnostic allergens.
TI  - Fatty acid composition of Neisseria species as determined by gas chromatography.
AB  - Duplicate cultures of 53 strains representing 9 species of Neisseria were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography for cellular fatty acids. N. sicca, N. mucosa, N. flava, N. flavescens, N. perflava, N. subflava, and the several serotypes of N. meningitidis examined were found to comprise a fairly homogeneous group on the basis of the percentages of individual fatty acids present. Lactose-fermenting Neisseria also were in this group. N. catarrhalis, however, contained decanoic acid in addition to the acids occurring in the other species. Moreover, the 18 C-saturated and monoenoic acids together constituted 36% of the total fatty acid composition for N. catarrhalis, while the comparable mean value for the other species was less than 13%.
