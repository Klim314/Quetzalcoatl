TI  == bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) production by the normal flora of the nasopharynx: potential to protect against otitis media?
AB  == the normal bacterial flora of the upper airways provides an important barrier to  invading pathogens. this study investigated the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) by streptococci isolated from the nasopharyngeal flora of children who either do or do not experience recurrent acute otitis media (aom). twenty children with recurrent aom and 15 controls were tested. swabs from the nasopharynx were evaluated for streptococci having blis activity against two  representative strains of each of the aom pathogens streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococci displaying strong blis activity were characterized further and tested for known streptococcal bacteriocin structural genes. sixty-five per cent  of children had nasopharyngeal streptococcal isolates that were inhibitory to strains of one or more of the aom pathogens. six children (17 %) had streptococci that demonstrated strong blis activity against strains of at least three of the pathogenic species. three of these inhibitory isolates were streptococcus salivarius, two were s. pneumoniae and one was s. pyogenes. the inhibitory s. salivarius and s. pyogenes were shown to have structural genes for known streptococcal bacteriocins. no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups of children with respect to the presence of inhibitory streptococci in their nasopharyngeal floras. the finding of s. salivarius with strong inhibitory activity against several aom pathogens in the nasopharyngeal flora of children is unique. although there is no clear evidence from the present study that these organisms protect against aom, their low pathogenicity and strong in-vitro blis production capability indicate that they should be incorporated in future trials of bacteriotherapy for recurrent aom.

TI  == ecological effects on the oro- and nasopharyngeal microflora in children after treatment of acute otitis media with cefuroxime axetil or amoxycillin-clavulanate as suspensions.
AB  == objective: to evaluate if the extent of normal microflora disturbances differed between treatment with amoxycillin-clavulanate administered in an active form and cefuroxime axetil administered as an inactive prodrug. methods: twenty-eight children, 0.5-5 years old, diagnosed with acute otitis media (aom), were treated  with either amoxycillin-clavulanate (13.3 mg/kg 3 times daily) or cefuroxime axetil (15 mg/kg twice daily) for 7 days. saliva samples and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected before, directly after and 2 weeks after treatment. the saliva samples were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed and the nasopharyngeal swabs were qualitatively analyzed. all isolated strains were tested for beta-lactamase production. results: both treatment regimens gave rise to similar  alterations of the normal oropharyngeal microflora. in both groups, the amount of streptococcus salivarius was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). the most common causative pathogens of acute otitis were s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. on the day of enrollment, approximately half of the patients, in both groups, were infected with more than one pathogen. the rate of  infection or colonization with more than one potential pathogen was low on day 7  but recurred 2 weeks after treatment to similar levels as on day 0. the total number of patients with reinfection, recolonization or recurrence of pathogens on day 21 was 11/12 in the amoxycillin-clavulanate group and 4/7 in the cefuroxime axetil group. the most common beta-lactamase producer was m. catarrhalis. conclusion: the local high concentration of antibiotics in the oropharynx immediately after intake of antibiotic suspensions seem to have little or no impact on the extent of disturbance of the microflora in this region. children of this age group seem prone to either reinfection, recolonization or persistence of pathogens within 2 weeks after treatment. furthermore, co-infection with more than one pathogen seems common in children with aom and infection with beta-lactamase producing microorganisms occurs frequently.

TI  == microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  == the microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. streptococci, predominantly s. salivarius, s. sanguis, and s. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. h. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and h. influenzae being identified in only one sample. anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, s. epidermidis dominating. fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.

TI  == oral ofloxacin therapy for lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  == we made an open, noncomparative evaluation of ofloxacin, 400 mg orally bid for 10 days, in 98 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia or pathogen-confirmed bronchitis. thirty-nine (40%) of the subjects were treated in the hospital and 59 (60%) were treated as outpatients. the mean age of those treated was 56.2 years;  73 (74%) of the subjects either were more than 60 years old or had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or both. there were 95 organisms initially isolated in sputum, aspirate, or lavage fluid; all were susceptible to ofloxacin, and none acquired resistance during therapy. haemophilus influenzae was the most  common pathogen (19 isolates), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (18) and staphylococcus aureus (10). clinical responses included cure in 70 patients (71%), improvement in 26 (27%), and failure in two (2%). after 10 days of therapy, pathogens persisted in two cases; in one case, streptococcus salivarius  was isolated, though it remained susceptible to ofloxacin, and in the other, klebsiella pneumoniae was accompanied by superinfection due to a resistant strain of serratia marcescens. we included in this study three confirmed cases of atypical pneumonia successfully treated with ofloxacin, two of them due to mycoplasma pneumonia and one to legionella pneumophila. ofloxacin was well tolerated. our data indicate that ofloxacin is effective and safe as specific and empiric treatment for many lower respiratory tract infections.

TI  == swedish study group. a randomized multicenter trial to compare the influence of cefaclor and amoxycillin on the colonization resistance of the digestive tract in patients with lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  == eighty-four patients with lower respiratory tract infections participated in a randomised double-blind parallel multicenter trial in order to compare the efficacy of cefaclor and amoxycillin as treatment for lower respiratory tract infections and their ability to influence colonization resistance. cefaclor was given to 40 patients and amoxycillin to 44 patients perorally in doses of 250 mg  t.i.d. for seven days in a double-blind fashion. sputum, oropharyngeal and intestinal specimens were taken for microbial analysis to isolate the causative pathogen of the lower respiratory tract infection and to follow the microflora changes before, during and after antibiotic treatment. the clinical outcome showed 92.5% cured or improved patients on cefaclor versus 88.4% on amoxycillin.  the difference in clinical outcome between the two treatment groups was not statistically significant. among the pathogenic bacteria isolated, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis and streptococcus pneumoniae dominated. there was no difference between the two treatments with regard to microbiological efficacy. treatment with cefaclor did not cause any significant impact on the oropharyngeal microflora. administration of amoxycillin caused a significant reduction of the number of streptococcus salivarius and veillonella cocci, while  an increase in number of enterobacteria was seen in the oropharyngeal microflora. in the intestinal flora, cefaclor significantly reduced the number of streptococci, staphylococci and anaerobic cocci, while the number of enterococci, enterobacteria, bacteroides and candida albicans significantly increased. the intestinal microflora was partly influenced by amoxycillin treatment. thus there  was a significant increase in the number of enterobacteria, anaerobic gram-positive rods and bacteroides. in conclusion, none of these agents caused any major disturbances in the colonization resistance in patients with lower respiratory tract infections.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.
