TI  - Crucial roles of single residues in binding affinity, specificity, and promiscuity in the cellulosomal cohesin-dockerin interface.
AB  - Interactions between cohesin and dockerin modules play a crucial role in the assembly of multienzyme cellulosome complexes. Although intraspecies cohesin and dockerin modules bind in general with high affinity but indiscriminately, cross-species binding is rare. Here, we combined ELISA-based experiments with Rosetta-based computational design to evaluate the contribution of distinct residues at the Clostridium thermocellum cohesin-dockerin interface to binding affinity, specificity, and promiscuity. We found that single mutations can show distinct and significant effects on binding affinity and specificity. In particular, mutations at cohesin position Asn(37) show dramatic variability in their effect on dockerin binding affinity and specificity: the N37A mutant binds promiscuously both to cognate (C. thermocellum) as well as to non-cognate Clostridium cellulolyticum dockerin. N37L in turn switches binding specificity: compared with the wild-type C. thermocellum cohesin, this mutant shows significantly increased preference for C. cellulolyticum dockerin combined with strongly reduced binding to its cognate C. thermocellum dockerin. The observation that a single mutation can overcome the naturally observed specificity barrier provides insights into the evolutionary dynamics of this system that allows rapid modulation of binding specificity within a high affinity background.
TI  - Designing novel cellulase systems through agent-based modeling and global sensitivity analysis.
AB  - Experimental techniques allow engineering of biological systems to modify functionality; however, there still remains a need to develop tools to prioritize targets for modification. In this study, agent-based modeling (ABM) was used to build stochastic models of complexed and non-complexed cellulose hydrolysis, including enzymatic mechanisms for endoglucanase, exoglucanase, and beta-glucosidase activity. Modeling results were consistent with experimental observations of higher efficiency in complexed systems than non-complexed systems and established relationships between specific cellulolytic mechanisms and overall efficiency. Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) of model results identified key parameters for improving overall cellulose hydrolysis efficiency including: (1) the cellulase half-life, (2) the exoglucanase activity, and (3) the cellulase composition. Overall, the following parameters were found to significantly influence cellulose consumption in a consolidated bioprocess (CBP): (1) the glucose uptake rate of the culture, (2) the bacterial cell concentration, and (3) the nature of the cellulase enzyme system (complexed or non-complexed). Broadly, these results demonstrate the utility of combining modeling and sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters and/or targets for experimental improvement.
TI  - Intramolecular clasp of the cellulosomal Ruminococcus flavefaciens ScaA dockerin  module confers structural stability.
AB  - The cellulosome is a large extracellular multi-enzyme complex that facilitates the efficient hydrolysis and degradation of crystalline cellulosic substrates. During the course of our studies on the cellulosome of the rumen bacterium Ruminococcus flavefaciens, we focused on the critical ScaA dockerin (ScaADoc), the unique dockerin that incorporates the primary enzyme-integrating ScaA scaffoldin into the cohesin-bearing ScaB adaptor scaffoldin. In the absence of a high-resolution structure of the ScaADoc module, we generated a computational model, and, upon its analysis, we were surprised to discover a putative stacking interaction between an N-terminal Trp and a C-terminal Pro, which we termed intramolecular clasp. In order to verify the existence of such an interaction, these residues were mutated to alanine. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, intrinsic tryptophan and ANS fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy indicated that mutation of these residues has a destabilizing effect on the functional integrity of the Ca(2+)-bound form of ScaADoc. Analysis of recently determined dockerin structures from other species revealed the presence of other well-defined intramolecular clasps, which consist of different types of interactions between selected residues at the dockerin termini. We propose that this thematic interaction may represent a major distinctive structural feature of the dockerin module.
TI  - Improvement of ClosTron for successive gene disruption in Clostridium cellulolyticum using a pyrF-based screening system.
AB  - Clostridium includes a number of species, such as thermophilic Clostridium thermocellum and mesophilic Clostridium cellulolyticum, producing biofuels and chemicals from lignocellulose, while genetic engineering is necessary to improve wild-type strains to fulfill the requirement of industrialization. ClosTron system is widely used in the gene targeting of Clostridium because of its high efficiency and operability. However, the targetron plasmid present in cell hinders the successive gene disruption. To solve this problem, a pyrF-based screening system was developed and implemented in C. cellulolyticum strain H10 in this study for efficient targetron plasmid curing. The screening system was composed of a pyrF-deleted cell chassis (H10DeltapyrF) constructed via homologous recombination and a PyrF expression cassette located in a targetron plasmid containing an erythromycin resistance gene. With the screening system, the gene targeting could be achieved following a two-step procedure, including the first step of gene disruption through targetron transformation and erythromycin selection and the second step of plasmid curing by screening with 5-fluoroorotic acid. To test the developed screening system, successive inactivation of the major cellulosomal exocellulase Cel48F and the scaffoldin protein CipC was achieved in C. cellulolyticum, and the efficient plasmid curing was confirmed. With the assistance of the pyrF-based screening system, the targetron plasmid-cured colonies can be rapidly selected by one-plate screening instead of traditional days' unguaranteed screening, and the successive gene disruption becomes accomplishable with ClosTron system with improved stability and efficiency, which may promote the metabolic engineering of Clostridium species aiming at enhanced production of biofuels and chemicals.
TI  - Unraveling enzyme discrimination during cellulosome assembly independent of cohesin-dockerin affinity.
AB  - Bacterial cellulosomes are generally believed to assemble at random, like those produced by Clostridium cellulolyticum. They are composed of one scaffolding protein bearing eight homologous type I cohesins that bind to any of the type I dockerins borne by the 62 cellulosomal subunits, thus generating highly heterogeneous complexes. In the present study, the heterogeneity and random assembly of the cellulosomes were evaluated with a simpler model: a miniscaffoldin containing three C. cellulolyticum cohesins and three cellulases of the same bacterium bearing the cognate dockerin (Cel5A, Cel48F, and Cel9G). Surprisingly, rather than the expected randomized integration of enzymes, the assembly of the minicellulosome generated only three distinct types of complex out of the 10 possible combinations, thus indicating preferential integration of enzymes upon binding to the scaffoldin. A hybrid scaffoldin that displays one cohesin from C. cellulolyticum and one from C. thermocellum, thus allowing sequential integration of enzymes, was exploited to further characterize this phenomenon. The initial binding of a given enzyme to the C. thermocellum cohesin was found to influence the type of enzyme that subsequently bound to the C. cellulolyticum cohesin. The preferential integration appears to be related to the length of the inter-cohesin linker. The data indicate that the binding of a cellulosomal enzyme to a cohesin has a direct influence on the dockerin-bearing proteins that will subsequently interact with adjacent cohesins. Thus, despite the general lack of specificity of the cohesin-dockerin interaction within a given species and type, bacterial cellulosomes are not necessarily assembled at random.
TI  - Secretion and assembly of functional mini-cellulosomes from synthetic chromosomal operons in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) is reliant on the simultaneous enzyme production, saccharification of biomass, and fermentation of released sugars into valuable products such as butanol. Clostridial species that produce butanol are, however, unable to grow on crystalline cellulose. In contrast, those saccharolytic species that produce predominantly ethanol, such as Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium cellulolyticum, degrade crystalline cellulose with high efficiency due to their possession of a multienzyme complex termed the cellulosome. This has led to studies directed at endowing butanol-producing species with the genetic potential to produce a cellulosome, albeit by localising the necessary transgenes to unstable autonomous plasmids. Here we have explored the potential of our previously described Allele-Coupled Exchange (ACE) technology for creating strains of the butanol producing species Clostridium acetobutylicum in which the genes encoding the various cellulosome components are stably integrated into the genome. RESULTS: We used BioBrick2 (BB2) standardised parts to assemble a range of synthetic genes encoding C. thermocellum cellulosomal scaffoldin proteins (CipA variants) and glycoside hydrolases (GHs, Cel8A, Cel9B, Cel48S and Cel9K) as well as synthetic cellulosomal operons that direct the synthesis of Cel8A, Cel9B and a truncated form of CipA. All synthetic genes and operons were integrated into the C. acetobutylicum genome using the recently developed ACE technology. Heterologous protein expression levels and mini-cellulosome self-assembly were assayed by western blot and native PAGE analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the successful expression, secretion and self-assembly of cellulosomal subunits by the recombinant C. acetobutylicum strains, providing a platform for the construction of novel cellulosomes.
TI  - Indirect ELISA-based approach for comparative measurement of high-affinity cohesin-dockerin interactions.
AB  - The interaction between the cohesin and dockerin modules serves to attach cellulolytic enzymes (carrying dockerins) to non-catalytic scaffoldin units (carrying multiple cohesins) in cellulosome, a multienzyme plant cell-wall degrading complex. This interaction is species-specific, for example, the enzyme-borne dockerin from Clostridium thermocellum bacteria binds to scaffoldin cohesins from the same bacteria but not to cohesins from Clostridium cellulolyticum and vice versa. We studied the role of interface residues, contributing either to affinity or specificity, by mutating these residues on the cohesin counterpart from C. thermocellum. The high affinity of the cognate interactions makes it difficult to evaluate the effect of these mutations by common methods used for measuring protein-protein interactions, especially when subtle discrimination between the mutants is needed. We described in this article an approach based on indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that is able to detect differences in binding between the various cohesin mutants, whereas surface plasmon resonance and standard ELISA failed to distinguish between high-affinity interactions. To be able to calculate changes in energy of binding (DeltaDeltaG) and dissociation constants (K(d)) of mutants relative to wild type, a pre-equilibrium step was added to the standard indirect ELISA procedure. Thus, the cohesin-dockerin interaction under investigation occurs in solution rather than between soluble and immobilized proteins. Unbound dockerins are then detected through their interaction with immobilized cohesins. Because our method allows us to assess the effect of mutations on particularly tenacious protein-protein interactions much more accurately than do other prevalent methods used to measure binding affinity, we therefore suggest this approach as a method of choice for comparing relative binding in high-affinity interactions.
TI  - A diverse set of family 48 bacterial glycoside hydrolase cellulases created by structure-guided recombination.
AB  - Sequence diversity within a family of functional enzymes provides a platform for  elucidating structure-function relationships and for protein engineering to improve properties important for applications. Access to nature's vast sequence diversity is often limited by the fact that only a few enzymes have been characterized in a given family. Here, we recombined the catalytic domains of three glycoside hydrolase family 48 bacterial cellulases (Cel48; EC 3.2.1.176) - Clostridium cellulolyticum CelF, Clostridium stercorarium CelY, and Clostridium thermocellum CelS - to create a diverse library of Cel48 enzymes with an average of 106 mutations from the closest native enzyme. Within this set, we found large variations in properties such as the functional temperature range, stability, and specific activity on crystalline cellulose. We showed that functional status and stability were predictable from simple linear models of the sequence-property data: recombined protein fragments contributed additively to these properties in a given chimera. Using this, we correctly predicted sequences that were as stable as any of the native Cel48 enzymes described to date. The characterization of 60 active Cel48 chimeras expands the number of characterized Cel48 enzymes from 13 to 73. Our work illustrates the role that structure-guided recombination can play in helping to identify sequence-function relationships within a family of enzymes by supplementing natural diversity with synthetic diversity.
TI  - Size-modulated synergy of cellulase clustering for enhanced cellulose hydrolysis.
AB  - Immobilization of enzymes onto nanoparticles for enhanced biocatalytic activity via enzyme clustering is a growing field. In this paper, the effect of nanoparticle size on the hydrolytic activity of artificial cellulosomes was investigated. A simple method based on metal affinity coordination was employed to directly conjugate two enzymes, an endoglucanase CelA and an exoglucanase CelE, onto CdSe-ZnS core-shell quantum dots (QDs) without the use of any chemical modification or linker molecules such as streptavidin. Artificial cellulosomes were created by clustering the enzymes onto two different QDs (5 and 10 nm) to systematically study the influence of particle size and QD to enzyme ratio on the enhancement in cellulose hydrolysis. Our results indicate that enzyme proximity is the most important factor for activity enhancement while the influence of particle size is relatively modest. This detailed understanding will provide insights for the design of other artificial cellulosomes based on nanoclustering of multiple catalytic domains with significantly enhanced activities, and may be applicable for designing improved nanobiocatalysts for biofuel production, bioremediation, and drug design.
TI  - Thermochemical pre- and biological co-treatments to improve hydrolysis and methane production from poultry litter.
AB  - The biochemical methane potential (BMP) of raw poultry litter waste was assessed  in batch assays. Biological co-treatment with Clostridium cellulolyticum, Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticum and Clostridium thermocellum as bioaugmentation strains, and thermochemical pre-treatments with lime and sodium hydroxide performed at different temperatures and pressures were applied as strategies to improve the BMP by favouring the hydrolysis of the cellulolytic material in the waste. Anaerobic digestion of the raw waste allowed a specific methane production of 145 +/- 14 LCH(4)kg(-1)VS, with 1% total solids and 0.72 g VS(inoculum)g(-1)VS(waste). The pre- and co-treatments contributed to a significant increase (up to 74%) in the waste solubilisation when using C. saccharolyticum, but methane production did not improve considerably. Therefore, the conversion of soluble organic matter to methane was the limiting step of the anaerobic digestion process of poultry litter waste.
TI  - Structure of the catalytic domain of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulase CelT.
AB  - Cellulases hydrolyze cellulose, a major component of plant cell walls, to oligosaccharides and monosaccharides. Several Clostridium species secrete multi-enzyme complexes (cellulosomes) containing cellulases. C. thermocellum CelT, a family 9 cellulase, lacks the accessory module(s) necessary for activity, unlike most other family 9 cellulases. Therefore, characterization of the CelT structure is essential in order to understand its catalytic mechanism. Here, the crystal structure of free CelTDeltadoc, the catalytic domain of CelT, is reported at 2.1 A resolution. Its structure differs in several aspects from those of other family 9 cellulases. CelTDeltadoc contains an additional alpha-helix, alpha-helices of increased length and two additional surface-exposed beta-strands. It also contains three calcium ions instead of one as found in C. cellulolyticum Cel9M. CelTDeltadoc also has two flexible loops at the open end of its active-site cleft. Movement of these loops probably allows the substrate to access the active site. CelT is stable over a wide range of pH and temperature conditions, suggesting that CelT could be used to convert cellulose biomass into biofuel.
TI  - Crystal structure of hyperthermophilic endo-beta-1,4-glucanase: implications for  catalytic mechanism and thermostability.
AB  - Endo-beta-1,4-glucanase from thermophilic Fervidobacterium nodosum Rt17-B1 (FnCel5A), a new member of glycosyl hydrolase family 5, is highly thermostable and exhibits the highest activity on carboxymethylcellulose among the reported homologues. To understand the structural basis for the thermostability and catalytic mechanism, we report here the crystal structures of FnCel5A and the complex with glucose at atomic resolution. FnCel5A exhibited a (beta/alpha)(8)-barrel structure typical of clan GH-A of the glycoside hydrolase families with a large and deep catalytic pocket located in the C-terminal end of the beta-strands that may permit substrate access. A comparison of the structure of FnCel5A with related structures from thermopile Clostridium thermocellum, mesophile Clostridium cellulolyticum, and psychrophile Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis showed significant differences in intramolecular interactions (salt bridges and hydrogen bonds) that may account for the difference in their thermostabilities. The substrate complex structure in combination with a mutagenesis analysis of the catalytic residues implicates a distinctive catalytic module Glu(167)-His(226)-Glu(283), which suggests that the histidine may function as an intermediate for the electron transfer network between the typical Glu-Glu catalytic module. Further investigation suggested that the aromatic residues Trp(61), Trp(204), Phe(231), and Trp(240) as well as polar residues Asn(51), His(127), Tyr(228), and His(235) in the active site not only participated in substrate binding but also provided a unique microenvironment suitable for catalysis. These results provide substantial insight into the unique characteristics of FnCel5A for catalysis and adaptation to extreme temperature.
TI  - Small RNAs in the genus Clostridium.
AB  - The genus Clostridium includes major human pathogens and species important to cellulose degradation, the carbon cycle, and biotechnology. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are emerging as crucial regulatory molecules in all organisms, but they have not been investigated in clostridia. Research on sRNAs in clostridia is hindered by the absence of a systematic method to identify sRNA candidates, thus delegating clostridial sRNA research to a hit-and-miss process. Thus, we wanted to develop a method to identify potential sRNAs in the Clostridium genus to open up the field of sRNA research in clostridia. Using comparative genomics analyses combined with predictions of rho-independent terminators and promoters, we predicted sRNAs in 21 clostridial genomes: Clostridium acetobutylicum, C. beijerinckii, C. botulinum (eight strains), C. cellulolyticum, C. difficile, C. kluyveri (two strains), C. novyi, C. perfringens (three strains), C. phytofermentans, C. tetani, and C. thermocellum. Although more than one-third of predicted sRNAs have Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences, only one-sixth have a start codon downstream of SD sequences; thus, most of the predicted sRNAs are noncoding RNAs. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) and Northern analysis were employed to test the presence of a randomly chosen set of sRNAs in C. acetobutylicum and several C. botulinum strains, leading to the confirmation of a large fraction of the tested sRNAs. We identified a conserved, novel sRNA which, together with the downstream gene coding for an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene, responds to the antibiotic clindamycin. The number of predicted sRNAs correlated with the physiological function of the species (high for pathogens, low for cellulolytic, and intermediate for solventogenic), but not with 16S rRNA-based phylogeny.
TI  - Comparison of the mesophilic cellulosome-producing Clostridium cellulovorans genome with other cellulosome-related clostridial genomes.
AB  - Clostridium cellulovorans, an anaerobic and mesophilic bacterium, degrades native substrates in soft biomass such as corn fibre and rice straw efficiently by producing an extracellular enzyme complex called the cellulosome. Recently, we have reported the whole-genome sequence of C. cellulovorans comprising 4220 predicted genes in 5.10 Mbp [Y. Tamaru et al., (2010) J. Bacteriol., 192: 901-902]. As a result, the genome size of C. cellulovorans was about 1 Mbp larger than that of other cellulosome-producing clostridia, mesophilic C. cellulolyticum and thermophilic C. thermocellum. A total of 57 cellulosomal genes were found in the C. cellulovorans genome, and they coded for not only carbohydrate-degrading enzymes but also a lipase, peptidases and proteinase inhibitors. Interestingly, two novel genes encoding scaffolding proteins were found in the genome. According to KEGG metabolic pathways and their comparison with 11 Clostridial genomes, gene expansion in the C. cellulovorans genome indicated mainly non-cellulosomal genes encoding hemicellulases and pectin-degrading enzymes. Thus, by examining genome sequences from multiple Clostridium species, comparative genomics offers new insight into genome evolution and the way natural selection moulds functional DNA sequence evolution. Our analysis, coupled with the genome sequence data, provides a roadmap for constructing enhanced cellulosome-producing Clostridium strains for industrial applications such as biofuel production.
TI  - Comparison of family 9 cellulases from mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria.
AB  - Cellulases containing a family 9 catalytic domain and a family 3c cellulose binding module (CBM3c) are important components of bacterial cellulolytic systems. We measured the temperature dependence of the activities of three homologs: Clostridium cellulolyticum Cel9G, Thermobifida fusca Cel9A, and C. thermocellum Cel9I. To directly compare their catalytic activities, we constructed six new versions of the enzymes in which the three GH9-CBM3c domains were fused to a dockerin both with and without a T. fusca fibronectin type 3 homology module (Fn3). We studied the activities of these enzymes on crystalline cellulose alone and in complex with a miniscaffoldin containing a cohesin and a CBM3a. The presence of Fn3 had no measurable effect on thermostability or cellulase activity. The GH9-CBM3c domains of Cel9A and Cel9I, however, were more active than the wild type when fused to a dockerin complexed to scaffoldin. The three cellulases in complex have similar activities on crystalline cellulose up to 60 degrees C, but C. thermocellum Cel9I, the most thermostable of the three, remains highly active up to 80 degrees C, where its activity is 1.9 times higher than at 60 degrees C. We also compared the temperature-dependent activities of different versions of Cel9I (wild type or in complex with a miniscaffoldin) and found that the thermostable CBM is necessary for activity on crystalline cellulose at high temperatures. These results illustrate the significant benefits of working with thermostable enzymes at high temperatures, as well as the importance of retaining the stability of all modules involved in cellulose degradation.
TI  - Synergy, structure and conformational flexibility of hybrid cellulosomes displaying various inter-cohesins linkers.
AB  - Cellulosomes are large extracellular multi-enzyme complexes that exhibit elevated activity on plant cell-wall polysaccharides. In the present study, the relationships between the conformational flexibility and efficacy of cellulosomes, and the inter-modules linkers of their scaffold protein were investigated. For this purpose, the length of the intrinsically disordered Ser/Thr-rich 50-residue linker connecting a Clostridium thermocellum and a Clostridium cellulolyticum cohesin in a hybrid scaffoldin (Scaf4) was changed by sequences ranging from 4 to 128 residues. The composition was also modified and new linkers composed of series of N, S or repeats of the EPPV motif were generated. Two model cellulases (Cel48F and Cel9G) appended with appropriate dockerins were subsequently bound to the engineered scaffoldins. All the resulting minicomplexes displayed the same activity on crystalline cellulose as the complex based on the initial Scaf4, and were found to be 2-fold more active than Cel48F and Cel9G bound to separate cohesins. Small-angle X-ray scattering assays of the engineered scaffoldins confirmed, however, that the size and the conformational flexibility of some of the new inter-cohesins linkers differed significantly from that of the initial 50 residue linker displayed by the parental Scaf4. Our data suggest that the synergy induced by proximity does not require a specific inter-cohesins sequence or distance. The present study reveals that complexation onto the hybrid scaffoldins modifies the type of soluble sugars released from crystalline cellulose by the selected cellulases, compared to the free enzyme system.
TI  - Surface display of a functional minicellulosome by intracellular complementation  using a synthetic yeast consortium and its application to cellulose hydrolysis and ethanol production.
AB  - In this paper, we report the surface assembly of a functional minicellulosome by  using a synthetic yeast consortium. The basic design of the consortium consisted of four different engineered yeast strains capable of either displaying a trifunctional scaffoldin, Scaf-ctf (SC), carrying three divergent cohesin domains from Clostridium thermocellum (t), Clostridium cellulolyticum (c), and Ruminococcus flavefaciens (f), or secreting one of the three corresponding dockerin-tagged cellulases (endoglucanase [AT], exoglucanase [EC/CB], or beta-glucosidase [BF]). The secreted cellulases were docked onto the displayed Scaf-ctf in a highly organized manner based on the specific interaction of the three cohesin-dockerin pairs employed, resulting in the assembly of a functional minicellulosome on the yeast surface. By exploiting the modular nature of each population to provide a unique building block for the minicellulosome structure, the overall cellulosome assembly, cellulose hydrolysis, and ethanol production were easily fine-tuned by adjusting the ratio of different populations in the consortium. The optimized consortium consisted of a SC:AT:CB:BF ratio of 7:2:4:2 and produced almost twice the level of ethanol (1.87 g/liter) as a consortium with an equal ratio of the different populations. The final ethanol yield of 0.475 g of ethanol/g of cellulose consumed also corresponded to 93% of the theoretical value. This result confirms the use of a synthetic biology approach for the synergistic saccharification and fermentation of cellulose to ethanol by using a yeast consortium displaying a functional minicellulosome.
TI  - Comparative genomics of the mesophilic cellulosome-producing Clostridium cellulovorans and its application to biofuel production via consolidated bioprocessing.
AB  - Clostridium cellulovorans is an anaerobic, mesophilic bacterium that efficiently  degrades native substrates in soft biomass such as corn fibre and rice straw by producing an extracellular enzyme complex called the cellulosomes. By examining genome sequences from multiple Clostridium species, comparative genomics offers new insight into genome evolution and the way natural selection moulds functional DNA sequence evolution. Recently, we reported the whole genome sequence of C. cellulovorans. A total of 57 cellulosomal genes were found in the C. cellulovorans genome and coded for not only carbohydrate-active enzymes but also lipase, peptidase and proteinase inhibitors, in addition to two novel genes encoding scaffolding proteins CbpB and CbpC. Interestingly, the genome size of C. cellulovorans was about 1 Mbp larger than that of other cellulosome-producing clostridia: mesophilic C. cellulolyticum and thermophilic C. thermocellum. Since the C. cellulovorans genome included not only cellulosomal genes but also a large number of genes encoding non-cellulosomal enzymes, the genome expansion of C. cellulovorans included genes more related to degradation of polysaccharides, such as hemicelluloses and pectins, than to cellulose. In this review, we propose a strategy for industrial applications such as biofuel production using enhanced mesophilic cellulosome- and solvent-producing clostridia.
TI  - The unique set of putative membrane-associated anti-sigma factors in Clostridium  thermocellum suggests a novel extracellular carbohydrate-sensing mechanism involved in gene regulation.
AB  - Genome analysis of the Gram-positive cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum revealed the presence of multiple negative regulators of alternative sigma factors. Nine of the deduced proteins share a strong similarity in their N-terminal sequences to the Bacillus subtilis membrane-associated anti-sigma(I) factor RsgI and have an unusual domain organization. In six RsgI-like proteins, the C-terminal sequences contain predicted carbohydrate-binding modules. Three of these modules were overexpressed and shown to bind specifically to cellulose and/or pectin. Bioinformatic analysis of >1200 bacterial genomes revealed that the C. thermocellum RsgI-like proteins are unique to this species and are not present in other cellulolytic clostridial species (e.g. Clostridium cellulolyticum and Clostridium papyrosolvens). Eight of the nine genes encoding putative C. thermocellum RsgI-like anti-sigma factors form predicted bicistronic operons, in which the first gene encodes a putative alternative sigma factor, similar to B. subtilissigma(I), but lacking in one of its domains. These observations suggest a novel carbohydrate-sensing mechanism in C. thermocellum, whereby the presence of polysaccharide biomass components is detected extracellularly and the signal is transmitted intracellularly, resulting in the disruption of the interaction between RsgI-like proteins and sigma(I)-like factors, the latter of which serve to activate appropriate genes encoding proteins involved in cellulose utilization.
TI  - The surprising diversity of clostridial hydrogenases: a comparative genomic perspective.
AB  - Among the large variety of micro-organisms capable of fermentative hydrogen production, strict anaerobes such as members of the genus Clostridium are the most widely studied. They can produce hydrogen by a reversible reduction of protons accumulated during fermentation to dihydrogen, a reaction which is catalysed by hydrogenases. Sequenced genomes provide completely new insights into the diversity of clostridial hydrogenases. Building on previous reports, we found that [FeFe] hydrogenases are not a homogeneous group of enzymes, but exist in multiple forms with different modular structures and are especially abundant in members of the genus Clostridium. This unusual diversity seems to support the central role of hydrogenases in cell metabolism. In particular, the presence of multiple putative operons encoding multisubunit [FeFe] hydrogenases highlights the fact that hydrogen metabolism is very complex in this genus. In contrast with [FeFe] hydrogenases, their [NiFe] hydrogenase counterparts, widely represented in other bacteria and archaea, are found in only a few clostridial species. Surprisingly, a heteromultimeric Ech hydrogenase, known to be an energy-converting [NiFe] hydrogenase and previously described only in methanogenic archaea and some sulfur-reducing bacteria, was found to be encoded by the genomes of four cellulolytic strains: Clostridum cellulolyticum, Clostridum papyrosolvens, Clostridum thermocellum and Clostridum phytofermentans.
TI  - Heterologous expression of a Clostridium minicellulosome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  - The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was genetically modified to assemble a minicellulosome on its cell surface by heterologous expression of a chimeric scaffoldin protein from Clostridium cellulolyticum under the regulation of the phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) promoter and terminator regulatory elements, together with the beta-xylanase 2 secretion signal of Trichoderma reesei and cell wall protein 2 (Cwp2) of S. cerevisiae. Fluorescent microscopy and Far Western blot analysis confirmed that the Scaf3p is targeted to the yeast cell surface and that the Clostridium thermocellum cohesin domain is functional in yeast. Similarly, functionality of the C. thermocellum dockerin domain in yeast is shown by binding to the Scaf3 protein in Far Western blot analysis. Phenotypic evidence for cohesin-dockerin interaction was also established with the detection of a twofold increase in tethered endoglucanase enzyme activity in S. cerevisiae cells expressing the Scaf3 protein compared with the parent strain. This study highlights the feasibility to future design of enhanced cellulolytic strains of S. cerevisiae through emulation of the cellulosome concept. Potentially, Scaf3p-armed yeast could also be developed into an alternative cell surface display strategy with various tailor-made applications.
TI  - Functional assembly of minicellulosomes on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface for cellulose hydrolysis and ethanol production.
AB  - We demonstrated the functional display of a miniscaffoldin on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface consisting of three divergent cohesin domains from Clostridium thermocellum (t), Clostridium cellulolyticum (c), and Ruminococcus flavefaciens (f). Incubation with Escherichia coli lysates containing an endoglucanase (CelA) fused with a dockerin domain from C. thermocellum (At), an exoglucanase (CelE) from C. cellulolyticum fused with a dockerin domain from the same species (Ec), and an endoglucanase (CelG) from C. cellulolyticum fused with a dockerin domain from R. flavefaciens (Gf) resulted in the assembly of a functional minicellulosome on the yeast cell surface. The displayed minicellulosome retained the synergistic effect for cellulose hydrolysis. When a beta-glucosidase (BglA) from C. thermocellum tagged with the dockerin from R. flavefaciens was used in place of Gf, cells displaying the new minicellulosome exhibited significantly enhanced glucose liberation and produced ethanol directly from phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose. The final ethanol concentration of 3.5 g/liter was 2.6-fold higher than that obtained by using the same amounts of added purified cellulases. The overall yield was 0.49 g of ethanol produced per g of carbohydrate consumed, which corresponds to 95% of the theoretical value. This result confirms that simultaneous and synergistic saccharification and fermentation of cellulose to ethanol can be efficiently accomplished with a yeast strain displaying a functional minicellulosome containing all three required cellulolytic enzymes.
TI  - Structure and flexibility within proteins as identified through small angle X-ray scattering.
AB  - Flexibility between domains of proteins is often critical for function. These motions and proteins with large scale flexibility in general are often not readily amenable to conventional structural analysis such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) or electron microscopy. A common evolution of a crystallography project, once a high resolution structure has been determined, is to postulate possible sights of flexibility. Here we describe an analysis tool using relatively inexpensive small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements to identify flexibility and validate a constructed minimal ensemble of models, which represent highly populated conformations in solution. The resolution of these results is sufficient to address the questions being asked: what kinds of conformations do the domains sample in solution? In our rigid body modeling strategy BILBOMD, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to explore conformational space. A common strategy is to perform the MD simulation on the domains connections at very high temperature, where the additional kinetic energy prevents the molecule from becoming trapped in a local minimum. The MD simulations provide an ensemble of molecular models from which a SAXS curve is calculated and compared to the experimental curve. A genetic algorithm is used to identify the minimal ensemble (minimal ensemble search, MES) required to best fit the experimental data. We demonstrate the use of MES in several model and in four experimental examples.
TI  - The Clostridium cellulolyticum dockerin displays a dual binding mode for its cohesin partner.
AB  - The plant cell wall degrading apparatus of anaerobic bacteria includes a large multienzyme complex termed the "cellulosome." The complex assembles through the interaction of enzyme-derived dockerin modules with the multiple cohesin modules of the noncatalytic scaffolding protein. Here we report the crystal structure of the Clostridium cellulolyticum cohesin-dockerin complex in two distinct orientations. The data show that the dockerin displays structural symmetry reflected by the presence of two essentially identical cohesin binding surfaces. In one binding mode, visualized through the A16S/L17T dockerin mutant, the C-terminal helix makes extensive interactions with its cohesin partner. In the other binding mode observed through the A47S/F48T dockerin variant, the dockerin is reoriented by 180 degrees and interacts with the cohesin primarily through the N-terminal helix. Apolar interactions dominate cohesin-dockerin recognition that is centered around a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the cohesin, formed by Leu-87 and Leu-89, which is occupied, in the two binding modes, by the dockerin residues Phe-19 and Leu-50, respectively. Despite the structural similarity between the C. cellulolyticum and Clostridium thermocellum cohesins and dockerins, there is no cross-specificity between the protein partners from the two organisms. The crystal structure of the C. cellulolyticum complex shows that organism-specific recognition between the protomers is dictated by apolar interactions primarily between only two residues, Leu-17 in the dockerin and the cohesin amino acid Ala-129. The biological significance of the plasticity in dockerin-cohesin recognition, observed here in C. cellulolyticum and reported previously in C. thermocellum, is discussed.
TI  - Eukaryotic origin of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes in Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium cellulolyticum genomes and putative fates of the exogenous gene in the subsequent genome evolution.
AB  - Although lateral gene transfer (LGT) events have been frequently documented in the evolution of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), no eukaryote-to-prokaryote transfer has been reported so far. Here we describe the first case of the GAPDH gene transfer from a eukaryote to a subset of Clostridium species (Bacteria, Firmicutes). A series of phylogenetic analyses of GAPDH homologues revealed that Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium cellulolyticum homologues have the evolutionary affinity to the eukaryotic homologues, rather than to those of bacterial species closely related to the two Clostridium species in the organismal phylogeny. These results suggest that the GAPDH genes in the two Clostridium species are of eukaryotic origin, which is the first reported case of eukaryote-to-bacterium GAPDH gene transfer. Since a previously published 16S ribosomal DNA phylogeny and our GAPDH phylogeny commonly suggest an intimate evolutionary relationship between C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum, a common ancestor of the two species likely acquired the eukaryotic GAPDH gene. In the C. cellulolyticum genome, the exogenous GAPDH gene was physically separated from other glycolytic genes, suggesting that this gene organization was likely achieved by a random insertion of the laterally transferred gene. On the other hand, in the C. thermocellum genome, the laterally transferred GAPDH gene clusters with other bacterial glycolytic genes. We discuss possible scenarios for the evolutionarily chimeric glycolytic gene cluster in the C. thermocellum genome.
TI  - Evolution of acetoclastic methanogenesis in Methanosarcina via horizontal gene transfer from cellulolytic Clostridia.
AB  - Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that two genes required for acetoclastic methanogenesis, ackA and pta, were horizontally transferred to the ancestor of Methanosarcina from a derived cellulolytic organism in the class Clostridia. This event likely occurred within the last 475 million years, causing profound changes in planetary methane biogeochemistry.
TI  - Unravelling carbon metabolism in anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  - Carbon metabolism in anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria has been investigated essentially in Clostridium thermocellum, Clostridium cellulolyticum, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus. While cellulose depolymerization into soluble sugars by various cellulases is undoubtedly the first step in bacterial metabolisation of cellulose, it is not the only one to consider. Among anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria, C. cellulolyticum has been investigated metabolically the most in the past few years. Summarizing metabolic flux analyses in continuous culture using either cellobiose (a soluble cellodextrin resulting from cellulose hydrolysis) or cellulose (an insoluble biopolymer), this review aims to stress the importance of the insoluble nature of a carbon source on bacterial metabolism. Furthermore, some general and specific traits of anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria trends, namely, the importance and benefits of (i) cellodextrins with degree of polymerization higher than 2, (ii) intracellular phosphorolytic cleavage, (iii) glycogen cycling on cell bioenergetics, and (iv) carbon overflows in regulation of carbon metabolism, as well as detrimental effects of (i) soluble sugars and (ii) acidic environment on bacterial growth. Future directions for improving bacterial cellulose degradation are discussed.
TI  - Gaining electricity from in situ oxidation of hydrogen produced by fermentative cellulose degradation.
AB  - AIM: To exploit the fermentative hydrogen generation and direct hydrogen oxidation for the generation of electric current from the degradation of cellulose. METHODS AND RESULTS: Utilizing the metabolic activity of the mesophilic anaerobe Clostridium cellulolyticum and the thermophilic Clostridium thermocellum we show that electricity generation is possible from cellulose fermentation. The current generation is based on an in situ oxidation of microbially synthesized hydrogen at platinum-poly(tetrafluoroaniline) (Pt-PTFA) composite electrodes. Current densities of 130 mA l(-1) (with 3 g cellulose per litre medium) were achieved in poised potential experiments under batch and semi-batch conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The presented results show that electricity generation is possible by the in situ oxidation of hydrogen, product of the anaerobic degradation of cellulose by cellulolytic bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: For the first time, it is shown that an insoluble complex carbohydrate like cellulose can be used for electricity generation in a microbial fuel cell. The concept represents a first step to the utilization of macromolecular biomass components for microbial electricity generation.
TI  - Crystal structure of a type-II cohesin module from the Bacteroides cellulosolvens cellulosome reveals novel and distinctive secondary structural elements.
AB  - The incorporation of enzymes into the multi-enzyme cellulosome complex and its anchoring to the bacterial cell surface are dictated by a set of binding interactions between two complementary protein modules: the cohesin and the dockerin. In this work, the X-ray crystal structure of a type-II cohesin from scaffoldin A of Bacteroides cellulosolvens has been determined to a resolution of 1.6 angstroms using molecular replacement. The type-II B. cellulosolvens cohesin (Bc-cohesin-II) is the first detailed description of a crystal structure for a type-II cohesin, and its features were compared with the known type-I cohesins from Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium cellulolyticum (Ct-cohesin-I and Cc-cohesin-I, respectively). The overall jelly-roll topology of the type-II Bc-cohesin is very similar to that observed for the type-I cohesins with three additional secondary structures: an alpha-helix and two "beta-flaps" that disrupt the normal course of a beta-strand. In addition, beta-strand 5 is elevated by approximately 4 angstroms on the surface of the molecule, relative to the type-I Ct and Cc-cohesins. Like its type-I analogue, the hydrophobic/aromatic core of Bc-cohesin-II comprises an upper and lower core, but an additional aromatic patch and conserved tryptophan at the crown of the molecule serves to stabilize the alpha-helix of the type-II cohesin. Comparison of Bc-cohesin-II with the known type-I cohesin-dockerin heterodimer suggests that each of the additional secondary structural elements assumes a flanking position relative to the putative dockerin-binding surface. The raised ridge formed by beta-strand 5 confers additional distinctive topographic features to the proposed binding interface that collectively distinguish between the type-II and type-I cohesins.
TI  - Action of designer cellulosomes on homogeneous versus complex substrates: controlled incorporation of three distinct enzymes into a defined trifunctional scaffoldin.
AB  - In recent work, we reported the self-assembly of a comprehensive set of defined "bifunctional" chimeric cellulosomes. Each complex contained the following: (i) a chimeric scaffoldin possessing a cellulose-binding module and two cohesins of divergent specificity and (ii) two cellulases, each bearing a dockerin complementary to one of the divergent cohesins. This approach allowed the controlled integration of desired enzymes into a multiprotein complex of predetermined stoichiometry and topology. The observed enhanced synergy on recalcitrant substrates by the bifunctional designer cellulosomes was ascribed to two major factors: substrate targeting and proximity of the two catalytic components. In the present work, the capacity of the previously described chimeric cellulosomes was amplified by developing a third divergent cohesin-dockerin device. The resultant trifunctional designer cellulosomes were assayed on homogeneous and complex substrates (microcrystalline cellulose and straw, respectively) and found to be considerably more active than the corresponding free enzyme or bifunctional systems. The results indicate that the synergy between two prominent cellulosomal enzymes (from the family-48 and -9 glycoside hydrolases) plays a crucial role during the degradation of cellulose by cellulosomes and that one dominant family-48 processive endoglucanase per complex is sufficient to achieve optimal levels of synergistic activity. Furthermore cooperation within a cellulosome chimera between cellulases and a hemicellulase from different microorganisms was achieved, leading to a trifunctional complex with enhanced activity on a complex substrate.
TI  - Structural insights into the mechanism of formation of cellulosomes probed by small angle X-ray scattering.
AB  - Exploring the mechanism by which the multiprotein complexes of cellulolytic organisms, the cellulosomes, attain their exceptional synergy is a challenge for biologists. We have studied the solution structures of the Clostridium cellulolyticum cellulosomal enzyme Cel48F in the free and complexed states with cohesins from Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium cellulolyticum by small angle x-ray scattering in order to investigate the conformational events likely to occur upon complexation. The solution structure of the free cellulase indicates that the dockerin module is folded, whereas the linker connecting the catalytic module to the dockerin is extended and flexible. Remarkably, the docking of the different cohesins onto Cel48F leads to a pleating of the linker. The global structure determined here allowed modeling of the atomic structure of the C. cellulolyticum dockerin-cohesin interface, highlighting the local differences between both organisms responsible for the species specificity.
TI  - Cohesin-dockerin interaction in cellulosome assembly: a single Asp-to-Asn mutation disrupts high-affinity cohesin-dockerin binding.
AB  - The cohesive cellulosome complex is sustained by the high-affinity cohesin-dockerin interaction. In previous work, we demonstrated that a single Thr-to-Leu replacement in the Clostridium thermocellum dockerin component differentiates between non-recognition and high-affinity recognition by the interspecies rival cohesin from C. cellulolyticum. In this report, we show that a single Asp-to-Asn substitution on the cohesin counterpart also disrupts normal recognition of the dockerin. The Asp34 carboxyl group of the cohesin appears to play a central role in the resultant hydrogen-bonding network as an acceptor of two crucial hydrogen bonds from Ser45 of the dockerin domain. The results underscore the fragile nature of the intermolecular contact interactions that maintain this very high-affinity protein--protein interaction.
TI  - Production of heterologous and chimeric scaffoldins by Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 converts sugars and various polysaccharides into acids and solvents. This bacterium, however, is unable to utilize cellulosic substrates, since it is able to secrete very small amounts of cellulosomes. To promote the utilization of crystalline cellulose, the strategy we chose aims at producing heterologous minicellulosomes, containing two different cellulases bound to a miniscaffoldin, in C. acetobutylicum. A first step toward this goal describes the production of miniCipC1, a truncated form of CipC from Clostridium cellulolyticum, and the hybrid scaffoldin Scaf 3, which bears an additional cohesin domain derived from CipA from Clostridium thermocellum. Both proteins were correctly matured and secreted in the medium, and their various domains were found to be functional.
TI  - Ruminococcus albus 8 mutants defective in cellulose degradation are deficient in  two processive endocellulases, Cel48A and Cel9B, both of which possess a novel modular architecture.
AB  - The cellulolytic bacterium Ruminococcus albus 8 adheres tightly to cellulose, but the molecular biology underpinning this process is not well characterized. Subtractive enrichment procedures were used to isolate mutants of R. albus 8 that are defective in adhesion to cellulose. Adhesion of the mutant strains was reduced 50% compared to that observed with the wild-type strain, and cellulose solubilization was also shown to be slower in these mutant strains, suggesting that bacterial adhesion and cellulose solubilization are inextricably linked. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that all three mutants studied were impaired in the production of two high-molecular-mass, cell-bound polypeptides when they were cultured with either cellobiose or cellulose. The identities of these proteins were determined by a combination of mass spectrometry methods and genome sequence data for R. albus 8. One of the polypeptides is a family 9 glycoside hydrolase (Cel9B), and the other is a family 48 glycoside hydrolase (Cel48A). Both Cel9B and Cel48A possess a modular architecture, Cel9B possesses features characteristic of the B(2) (or theme D) group of family 9 glycoside hydrolases, and Cel48A is structurally similar to the processive endocellulases CelF and CelS from Clostridium cellulolyticum and Clostridium thermocellum, respectively. Both Cel9B and Cel48A could be recovered by cellulose affinity procedures, but neither Cel9B nor Cel48A contains a dockerin, suggesting that these polypeptides are retained on the bacterial cell surface, and recovery by cellulose affinity procedures did not involve a clostridium-like cellulosome complex. Instead, both proteins possess a single copy of a novel X module with an unknown function at the C terminus. Such X modules are also present in several other R. albus glycoside hydrolases and are phylogentically distinct from the fibronectin III-like and X modules identified so far in other cellulolytic bacteria.
TI  - Crystal structure of the cellulase Cel9M enlightens structure/function relationships of the variable catalytic modules in glycoside hydrolases.
AB  - Cellulases cleave the beta-1.4 glycosidic bond of cellulose. They have been characterized as endo or exo and processive or nonprocessive cellulases according to their action mode on the substrate. Different types of these cellulases may coexist in the same glycoside hydrolase family, which have been classified according to their sequence homology and catalytic mechanism. The bacterium C. celluloyticum produces a set of different cellulases who belong mostly to glycoside hydrolase families 5 and 9. As an adaptation of the organism to different macroscopic substrates organizations and to maximize its cooperative digestion, it is expected that cellulases of these families are active on the various macroscopic organizations of cellulose chains. The nonprocessive cellulase Cel9M is the shortest variant of family 9 cellulases (subgroup 9(C)) which contains only the catalytic module to interact with the substrate. The crystal structures of free native Cel9M and its complex with cellobiose have been solved to 1.8 and 2.0 A resolution, respectively. Other structurally known family 9 cellulases are the nonprocessive endo-cellulase Cel9D from C. thermocellum and the processive endo-cellulase Cel9A from T. fusca, from subgroups 9(B1) and 9(A), respectively, whose catalytic modules are fused to a second domain. These enzymes differ in their activity on substrates with specific macroscopic appearances. The comparison of the catalytic module of Cel9M with the two other known GH family 9 structures may give clues to explain its substrate profile and action mode.
TI  - Design and production of active cellulosome chimeras. Selective incorporation of  dockerin-containing enzymes into defined functional complexes.
AB  - Defined chimeric cellulosomes were produced in which selected enzymes were incorporated in specific locations within a multicomponent complex. The molecular building blocks of this approach are based on complementary protein modules from the cellulosomes of two clostridia, Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium cellulolyticum, wherein cellulolytic enzymes are incorporated into the complexes by means of high-affinity species-specific cohesin-dockerin interactions. To construct the desired complexes, a series of chimeric scaffoldins was prepared by recombinant means. The scaffoldin chimeras were designed to include two cohesin modules from the different species, optionally connected to a cellulose-binding domain. The two divergent cohesins exhibited distinct specificities such that each recognized selectively and bound strongly to its dockerin counterpart. Using this strategy, appropriate dockerin-containing enzymes could be assembled precisely and by design into a desired complex. Compared with the mixture of free cellulases, the resultant cellulosome chimeras exhibited enhanced synergistic action on crystalline cellulose.
TI  - Cohesin-dockerin interaction in cellulosome assembly: a single hydroxyl group of  a dockerin domain distinguishes between nonrecognition and high affinity recognition.
AB  - The assembly of enzyme components into the cellulosome complex is dictated by the cohesin-dockerin interaction. In a recent article (Mechaly, A., Yaron, S., Lamed, R., Fierobe, H.-P., Belaich, A., Belaich, J.-P., Shoham, Y., and Bayer, E. A. (2000) Proteins 39, 170-177), we provided experimental evidence that four previously predicted dockerin residues play a decisive role in the specificity of this high affinity interaction, although additional residues were also implicated. In the present communication, we examine further the contributing factors for the recognition of a dockerin by a cohesin domain between the respective cellulosomal systems of Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium cellulolyticum. In this context, the four confirmed residues were analyzed for their individual effect on selectivity. In addition, other dockerin residues were discerned that could conceivably contribute to the interaction, and the suspected residues were similarly modified by site-directed mutagenesis. The results indicate that mutation of a single residue from threonine to leucine at a given position of the C. thermocellum dockerin differentiates between its nonrecognition and high affinity recognition (K(a) approximately 10(9) m(-1)) by a cohesin from C. cellulolyticum. This suggests that the presence or absence of a single decisive hydroxyl group is critical to the observed biorecognition. This study further implicates additional residues as secondary determinants in the specificity of interaction, because interconversion of selected residues reduced intraspecies self-recognition by at least three orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, as the latter mutageneses served to reduce but not annul the cohesin-dockerin interaction within this species, it follows that other subtle alterations play a comparatively minor role in the recognition between these two modules.
TI  - Structure of a family IIIa scaffoldin CBD from the cellulosome of Clostridium cellulolyticum at 2.2 A resolution.
AB  - The crystal structure of the family IIIa cellulose-binding domain (CBD) from the  cellulosomal scaffoldin subunit (CipC) of Clostridium cellulolyticum has been determined. The structure reveals a nine-stranded jelly-roll topology which exhibits distinctive structural elements consistent with family III CBDs that bind crystalline cellulose. These include a well conserved calcium-binding site, a putative cellulose-binding surface and a conserved shallow groove of unknown function. The CipC CBD structure is very similar to the previously elucidated family IIIa CBD from the CipA scaffoldin of C. thermocellum, with some minor differences. The CipC CBD structure was also compared with other previously described CBD structures from families IIIc and IV derived from the endoglucanases of Thermomonospora fusca and Cellulomonas fimi, respectively. The possible functional consequences of structural similarities and differences in the shallow groove and cellulose-binding faces among various CBD families and subfamilies are discussed.
TI  - Crystal structure of a cohesin module from Clostridium cellulolyticum: implications for dockerin recognition.
AB  - In the assembly of the Clostridium cellulolyticum cellulosome, the multiple cohesin modules of the scaffolding protein CipC serve as receptors for cellulolytic enzymes which bear a dockerin module. The X-ray structure of a type I C. cellulolyticum cohesin module (Cc-cohesin) has been solved using molecular replacement, and refined at 2.0 A resolution. Despite a rather low sequence identity of 32 %, this module has a fold close to those of the two Clostridium thermocellum cohesin (Ct-cohesin) modules whose 3D structures have been determined previously. Cc-cohesin forms a dimer in the crystal, as do the two Ct-cohesins. We show here that the dimer exists in solution and that addition of dockerin-containing proteins dissociates the dimer. This suggests that the dimerization interface and the cohesin/dockerin interface may overlap. The nature of the overall surface and of the dimer interface of Cc-cohesin differ notably from those of the Ct-cohesin modules, being much less polar, and this may explain the species specificity observed in the cohesin/dockerin interaction of C. cellulolyticum and C. thermocellum. We have produced a topology model of a C. cellulolyticum dockerin and of a Cc-cohesin/dockerin complex using homology modeling and available biochemical data. Our model suggests that a special residue pair, already identified in dockerin sequences, is located at the center of the cohesin surface putatively interacting with the dockerin.
TI  - Cloning and DNA sequencing of the genes encoding Clostridium josui scaffolding protein CipA and cellulase CelD and identification of their gene products as major components of the cellulosome.
AB  - The Clostridium josui cipA and celD genes, encoding a scaffolding-like protein (CipA) and a putative cellulase (CelD), respectively, have been cloned and sequenced. CipA, with an estimated molecular weight of 120,227, consists of an N-terminal signal peptide, a cellulose-binding domain of family III, and six successive cohesin domains. The molecular architecture of C. josui CipA is similar to those of the scaffolding proteins reported so far, such as Clostridium thermocellum CipA, Clostridium cellulovorans CbpA, and Clostridium cellulolyticum CipC, but C. josui CipA is considerably smaller than the other scaffolding proteins. CelD consists of an N-terminal signal peptide, a family 48 catalytic domain of glycosyl hydrolase, and a dockerin domain. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the C. josui cellulosomal proteins indicates that both CipA and CelD are major components of the cellulosome.
TI  - Properties of exgS, a gene for a major subunit of the Clostridium cellulovorans cellulosome.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of P70, one of the three major subunits of the Clostridium cellulovorans cellulosome, has been determined. The gene designated as exgS (Genbank Accession No. U34793) consists of 2112 bp and encodes a protein containing 703 amino acids with a molecular mass of 77.7 kDa. ExgS has a putative signal peptide sequence of 32 amino acids. The N-terminal region is separated from the C-terminal region by a short-Pro-Thr-Pro linker. The C-terminal region of ExgS contains a duplicated sequence (DS), each sequence consisting of 22 amino acids. exgS, located 67 bp downstream of cbpA in the chromosome, is immediately upstream of a gene encoding a family 9 type endoglucanase that we have designated as EngH. This gene cluster to date consists of regA-cbpA-exgS-engH. Recombinant ExgS (rExgS) containing no signal peptide was expressed in E. coli. The rExgS actively digested several forms of cellulose, including Avicel, Sigmacell101, crystalline cellulose, and xylan, but not carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Cellotetraose was the smallest oligosaccharide substrate for rExgS. The enzymatic studies indicated that ExgS was an exoglucanase and had some properties similar to that of CelS from C. thermocellum and CelF from C.cellulolyticum. An exoglucanase has now been found to be a component of the C. cellulovorans cellulosome as well as the previously reported endoglucanases.
TI  - Species-specificity of the cohesin-dockerin interaction between Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium cellulolyticum: prediction of specificity determinants of the dockerin domain.
AB  - The cross-species specificity of the cohesin-dockerin interaction, which defines  the incorporation of the enzymatic subunits into the cellulosome complex, has been investigated. Cohesin-containing segments from the cellulosomes of two different species, Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium cellulolyticum, were allowed to interact with cellulosomal (dockerin-containing) enzymes from each species. In both cases, the cohesin domain of one bacterium interacted with enzymes from its own cellulosome in a calcium-dependent manner, but the same cohesin failed to recognize enzymes from the other species. Thus, in the case of these two bacteria, the cohesin-dockerin interaction seems to be species-specific. Based on intra- and cross-species sequence comparisons among the different dockerins together with their known specificities, we tender a prediction as to the amino-acid residues critical to recognition of the cohesins. The suspected residues were narrowed down to only four, which comprise a repeated pair located within the calcium-binding motif of two duplicated sequences, characteristic of the dockerin domain. According to the proposed model, these four residues do not participate in the binding of calcium per se; instead, they appear to serve as recognition codes in promoting interaction with the cohesin surface.
TI  - The cellulolytic system of Clostridium cellulolyticum.
AB  - Recent findings on the cellulolytic system of the mesophilic Clostridium cellulolyticum are reviewed. Six cellulases and the scaffolding protein, which are, at the present time, the known components of the cellulosome have been cloned. The catalytic and structural properties of the cloned enzymes CelA, CelC, CelD and CelF are described. It was shown that the grafting of the cellulases onto the scaffolding protein was performed using the dockerin-cohesin attachment device and was strictly dependent on the integrity of both components of the complex. The amino-acid sequences of dockerin and cohesin domains of C. cellulolyticum were compared to that of C. cellulovorans and C. thermocellum. This sequence analysis shows that domains belonging to the thermophilic or the mesophilic bacteria can be placed into two well defined groups. The genetic organization of the gene cluster of C. cellulolyticum is discussed.
TI  - Cloning and DNA sequence of the gene coding for Clostridium thermocellum cellulase Ss (CelS), a major cellulosome component.
AB  - Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405 produces an extracellular cellulase system capable of hydrolyzing crystalline cellulose. The enzyme system involves a multicomponent protein aggregate (the cellulosome) with a total molecular weight in the millions, impeding mechanistic studies. However, two major components of the aggregate, SS (M(r) = 82,000) and SL (M(r) = 250,000), which act synergistically to hydrolyze crystalline cellulose, have been identified (J. H. D. Wu, W. H. Orme-Johnson, and A. L. Demain, Biochemistry 27:1703-1709, 1988). To further study this synergism, we cloned and sequenced the gene (celS) coding for the SS (CelS) protein by using a degenerate, inosine-containing oligonucleotide probe whose sequence was derived from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the CelS protein. The open reading frame of celS consisted of 2,241 bp encoding 741 amino acid residues. It encoded the N-terminal amino acid sequence and two internal peptide sequences determined for the native CelS protein. A putative ribosome binding site was identified at the 5' end of the gene. A putative signal peptide of 27 amino acid residues was adjacent to the N terminus of the CelS protein. The predicted molecular weight of the secreted protein was 80,670. The celS gene contained a conserved reiterated sequence encoding 24 amino acid residues found in proteins encoded by many other clostridial cel or xyn genes. A palindromic structure was found downstream from the open reading frame. The celS gene is unique among the known cel genes of C. thermocellum. However, it is highly homologous to the partial open reading frame found in C. cellulolyticum and in Caldocellum saccharolyticum, indicating that these genes belong to a new family of cel genes.
TI  - Characterization and comparison of Clostridium cellulovorans endoglucanases-xylanases EngB and EngD hyperexpressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - By the use of a T7 expression system, endoglucanases-xylanases EngB and EngD from Clostridium cellulovorans were hyperexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli. The two enzymes demonstrated both endoglucanase and xylanase activities. The substrate specificities of both endoglucanases were similar except that EngD had four-times-greater p-nitrophenyl beta-1,4-cellobiosidase activity. The two proteins were very homologous (80%) up to the Pro-Thr-Thr region which divided the protein into -NH2- and -COOH-terminals. The -COOH- region of EngB has high homology to the endoglucanases and a xylanase from Clostridium thermocellum and to an endoglucanase from Clostridium cellulolyticum and did not show strong binding to cellulose (Avicel). However, the -COOH- region of EngD, which had homology to the cellulose-binding domains of Cellulomonas fimi exo- and endoglucanases and to Pseudomonas fluorescens endoglucanase, demonstrated binding ability to cellulose even when the domain was fused to the N-terminal domain of EngB. By probing the Avicel-purified cellulase complex (F8) with anti-EngB and anti-EngD antibodies, both EngB and EngD were shown to be present on the cellulase complex of C. cellulovorans. Many proteins homologous to EngB and EngD were also present on the complex.
TI  - Characterization of endoglucanase A from Clostridium cellulolyticum.
AB  - A construction was carried out to obtain a high level of expression in Escherichia coli of the gene celCCA, coding for the endoglucanase A from Clostridium cellulolyticum (EGCCA). The enzyme was purified in two forms with different molecular weights, 51,000 and 44,000. The smaller protein was probably the result of proteolysis, although great care was taken to prevent this process from occurring. Evidence was found for the loss of the conserved reiterated domains which are characteristic of C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum cellulases. The two forms were extensively studied, and it was demonstrated that although they had the same pH and temperature optima, they differed in their catalytic properties. The truncated protein gave the more efficient catalytic parameters on carboxymethyl cellulose and showed improved endoglucanase characteristics, whereas the intact enzyme showed truer cellulase characteristics. The possible role of clostridial reiterated domains in the hydrolytic activity toward crystalline cellulose is discussed.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of the endoglucanase-encoding gene, celCCD, of Clostridium cellulolyticum.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the Clostridium cellulolyticum endo-beta-1,4- glucanase (EGCCD)-encoding gene, celCCD, and its flanking regions, was determined. The open reading frame encodes a protein (Mr 66,061) which consists of 584 amino acids (aa). The N terminus shows the features of the typical signal peptide, with a cleavage site after Gly24. The protein could be divided into N-terminal and C-terminal regions by an intermediate Pro + Thr-rich sequence. Deletion analysis suggests the C-terminal region is not necessary for EG activity. The predicted aa sequence of the mature protein was similar to those of the central catalytic and the following C-terminal regions of the C. thermocellum endoglucanase H (EGH; identity, 58.8%). The N-terminal region resembled that of the endoglucanase, EGCCA, from C. cellulolyticum (identity, 24.7%; 336 aa) and the endoglucanase, EGE, from C. thermocellum (identity, 31.4%; 373 aa). The C-terminal regions ended with two conserved 21-aa stretches which had close similarity to each other. The C-terminal sequence was also highly similar to the reiterated domain of several EG and a xylanase from C. thermocellum, and of an EG from C. cellulolyticum.
TI  - Sequence analysis of the Clostridium cellulolyticum endoglucanase-A-encoding gene, celCCA.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a Clostridium cellulolyticum endo-beta-1,4- glucanase  (EGCCA)-encoding gene (celCCA) and its flanking regions, was determined. An open reading frame (ORF) of 1425 bp was found, encoding a protein of 475 amino acids (aa). This ORF began with an ATG start codon and ended with a TAA ochre stop codon. The N-terminal region of the EGCCA protein resembled a typical signal sequence of a Gram-positive bacterial extracellular protein. A putative signal peptidase cleavage site was determined. EGCCA, without a signal peptide, was found to be composed of more than 35% hydrophobic aa and to have an Mr of 50715. Comparison of the encoded sequence with other known cellulase sequences showed the existence of various kinds of aa sequence homologies. First, a strong homology was found between the C-terminal region of EGCCA, containing a reiterated stretch of 24 aa, and the conserved reiterated region previously found to exist in four Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanases and one xylanase from the same organism. This region was suspected of playing a role in organizing the cellulosome complex. Second, an extensive homology was found between EGCCA and the N-terminal region of the large endoglucanase, EGE, from C. thermocellum, which suggests that they may have a common ancestral gene. Third, a region, which extended for 21 aa residues beginning at aa + 127, was found to be homologous with regions of cellulases belonging to Bacilli, Clostridia and Erwinia chrysanthemi.
TI  - Cloning and expression of two cellulase genes of Clostridium cellulolyticum in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Two cellulase genes isolated from Clostridium cellulolyticum strain ATCC3519 were cloned in Escherichia coli using plasmid pACYC184. Plasmids pB52 and pB43 were isolated from the transformants producing carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) and the two cloned CMCase-coding genes were found to be included in two EcoRI fragments of 5.7 kb and 2.6 kb, respectively. These two genes showed no homology. The CMCase-coding genes were found to be contained in a 1.8-kb KpnI-HindIII fragment and a 2.05-kb HindIII-PvuII fragment of the DNA donor strain. Expression of these genes in E. coli was found not to depend on their orientation in the cloning vector. Hybridization experiments between these two fragments and Clostridium thermocellum NCIB10682 DNA fragments carrying genes celA, celB, celC and celD were carried out and some homologies were detected.
