TI  == impact of cell-free supernatant of lactic acid bacteria on putrescine and other polyamine formation by foodborne pathogens in ornithine decarboxylase broth.
AB  == conversion of ornithine to putrescine by salmonella paratyphi a, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli was investigated in ornithine decarboxylase broth (odb) using cell-free supernatants (cfss) obtained  from leuconostoc mesenterodies subsp. cremoris, pediococcus acidilactici, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus. two groups of cell-free supernatants (25 or 50%) and control (only odb) were prepared to investigate putrescine (put) and other polyamine formation by foodborne pathogens (fbps). significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed among the species for each amine. all of the cfss reduced the formation of put by >/=65%. the production of cadaverine (cad) was scarcely affected by the presence of cfss, with the exception of the samples inoculated with l. monocytogenes. the variation in polyamine was found with respect to the control samples. spermidine (spd) was  produced in lower amount in many samples, especially in gram-negative fbps, whereas spermine (spn) increased drastically in the major part of the samples concerning the control. histamine (his) was characterized by a marked concentration decrease in all of the samples, and tyramine (tyr) was accumulated  in very low concentrations in the controls. therefore, the ability of bacteria to produce certain biogenic amines such as his, tyr, put, and cad has been studied to assess their risk and prevent their formation in food products. the results obtained from this study concluded that the lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains with non-decarboxylase activity are capable of avoiding or limiting biogenic amine formation by fbp.

TI  == enzymatic production of l-citrulline by hydrolysis of the guanidinium group of l-arginine with recombinant arginine deiminase.
AB  == in this study, a simple, efficient enzymatic production process for the environmentally friendly synthesis of l-citrulline from l-arginine was developed  using arginine deiminase (adi) from lactococcus lactis. following overexpression  of l. lactis adi in escherichia coli bl21 (de3) and experimental evolution using  error-prone pcr, mutant fmme106 was obtained with a km for l-arginine of 3.5mm and a specific activity of 195.7u/mg. this mutant exhibited a maximal conversion  of 92.6% and achieved a final l-citrulline concentration of 176.9g/l under optimal conditions (190g/l l-arginine, 15g/l whole-cell biocatalyst treated with  2% isopropanol for 30min, 50 degrees c, ph 7.2, 8h). the average l-citrulline synthesis rate of 22.1g/l/h is considerably higher than that reported for other similar biocatalytic approaches, therefore the process developed in the present work has great potential for large-scale production of l-citrulline.

TI  == proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria grown in goat milk.
AB  == we examined 62 strains and 21 trade starter cultures from the collection of lb bulgaricum plc for proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) grown in goat milk. the aim of this study was to investigate the fermentation of caseins, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin by lab, using the o-phthaldialdehyde (opa) spectrophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). the proteolysis targeted mainly caseins, especially beta-casein. whey proteins were proteolyzed, essentially beta-lactoglobulin. the proteolytic activity of lactococcus lactis l598, streptococcus thermophilus t3d1, dt1, lactobacillus lactis 1043 and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b38, b122 and b24 was notably high. the proteolysis process gave rise to medium-sized peptide populations. most of the examined strains showed antimicrobial activity against some food pathogens, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella cholere enteridis, listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua and enterobacter aerogenes. the most active producers of antimicrobial-active peptides were strains of l. delbrueckii subsp.  bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, which are of practical importance. the starter cultures containing the examined species showed high proteolytic and antimicrobial activity in skimmed goat milk. the greatest antimicrobial activity  of the cultures was detected against e. aerogenes. the obtained results demonstrated the significant proteolytic potential of the examined strains in goat milk and their potential for application in the production of dairy products from goat's milk. the present results could be considered as the first data on the proteolytic capacity of strains and starter cultures in goat milk for the purposes of trade interest of lb bulgaricum plc.

TI  == incorporation of nisin z and lauric arginate into pullulan films to inhibit foodborne pathogens associated with fresh and ready-to-eat muscle foods.
AB  == a combination of food grade compounds with edible films, used to inhibit foodborne pathogens associated with fresh or further processed muscle foods, is receiving considerable attention. in this study, pullulan films containing lauric arginate (lae) and nisin z (produced by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis i8-7-3 and isolated from catfish gut), alone or in combination, were investigated for controlling foodborne pathogens on fresh and further processed muscle foods after long-term refrigerated storage. salmonella typhimurium and salmonella enteritidis on raw turkey breast slices wrapped with a film containing lae or the combination of lae with nisin z were reduced throughout the experiment, 2.5 to 4.5log10cfu/cm(2) and 3.5 to 5.1log10cfu/cm(2), respectively. film containing a combination of lae with nisin z reduced staphylococcus aureus and listeria monocytogenes scott a inoculated onto ham surfaces by approximately 5.53 and 5.62log10cfu/cm(2), respectively during refrigerated storage. escherichia coli o157:h7, o111, and o26 also were reduced by >4log10cfu/cm(2) on raw beef slices after treatment with the combination film and refrigerated storage. the results obtained from this study indicate the lae- and lae-nisin z-containing pullulan films displayed excellent inhibition against foodborne pathogens on fresh and further processed muscle foods.

TI  == highly active and specific tyrosine ammonia-lyases from diverse origins enable enhanced production of aromatic compounds in bacteria and saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  == phenylalanine and tyrosine ammonia-lyases form cinnamic acid and p-coumaric acid, which are precursors of a wide range of aromatic compounds of biotechnological interest. lack of highly active and specific tyrosine ammonia-lyases has previously been a limitation in metabolic engineering approaches. we therefore identified 22 sequences in silico using synteny information and aiming for sequence divergence. we performed a comparative in vivo study, expressing the genes intracellularly in bacteria and yeast. when produced heterologously, some enzymes resulted in significantly higher production of p-coumaric acid in several different industrially important production organisms. three novel enzymes were found to have activity exclusively for phenylalanine, including an enzyme from the low-gc gram-positive bacterium brevibacillus laterosporus, a bacterial-type enzyme from the amoeba dictyostelium discoideum, and a phenylalanine ammonia-lyase from the moss physcomitrella patens (producing 230 mum cinnamic acid per unit of optical density at 600 nm [od600]) in the medium using escherichia coli as the heterologous host). novel tyrosine ammonia-lyases having  higher reported substrate specificity than previously characterized enzymes were  also identified. enzymes from herpetosiphon aurantiacus and flavobacterium johnsoniae resulted in high production of p-coumaric acid in escherichia coli (producing 440 mum p-coumaric acid od600 unit(-1) in the medium) and in lactococcus lactis. the enzymes were also efficient in saccharomyces cerevisiae,  where p-coumaric acid accumulation was improved 5-fold over that in strains expressing previously characterized tyrosine ammonia-lyases.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of fermented soy milk with lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis s-su2 in murine macrophage raw264.7 cells and dss-induced ibd model mice.
AB  == six lactic acid bacteria strains (four lactobacillus plantarum strains and one each of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and pediococcus pentosaceus) have been isolated and shown to possess anti-oxidant activity. in this study, we determined their acid, bile, salt resistance, and adhesion activity on human enterocyte-like ht-29-luc and caco-2 cells. an isolate lc. lactis s-su2 showed highest bile resistance and adhesion activity compared to type strains. s-su2 could ferment both 10% skimmed milk and soy milk while the type strain could not ferment soy milk. soy milk fermented with s-su2 showed an increased nitric oxide (no) secretion in the mouse macrophage raw264.7 cells without bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps). furthermore, the inhibitory effects of the fermented soy milk on escherichia coli o111 lps-induced no secretion were higher than those of fresh soy milk. inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) was induced in mice fed either 5% (w/v) dextran sodium sulfate (dss) in drinking water or 50% soy milk in drinking water. shortening of colon length, breaking of epithelial cells, lowering liver and thymus weights, and enlargement of spleen are some of the characteristics observed in the ibd, which were prevented by the use of soy milk  fermented with lc. lactis s-su2.

TI  == a tyrosine phosphorylation switch controls the interaction between the transmembrane modulator protein wzd and the tyrosine kinase wze of lactobacillus  rhamnosus.
AB  == background: one proposed mechanism for assembly of secreted heteropolysaccharides by many gram positive bacteria relies on the coordinated action of a polymerization complex through reversible phosphorylation events. the role of the tyrosine protein kinase transmembrane modulator is, however, not well understood. results: the protein sequences deduced from the wzb, wzd and wze genes from lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 9595 and rw-9595 m contain motifs also found in corresponding proteins cpsb, cpsc and cpsd from streptococcus pneumoniae d39 (serotype 2). use of an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody demonstrated that both wzd  and wze can be found in tyrosine phosphorylated form. when tyrosine 266 was mutated to phenylalanine, wzdy266f showed slightly less phosphorylated protein than those produced by using eight other tyrosine mutated wzd genes, when expressed along with wze and wzb in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363. in order to demonstrate the importance of atp for the interactions among these proteins, native and fusion wzb, wzd and wze proteins were expressed and purified from escherichia coli cultures. the modulator protein, wzd, binds with the phosphotyrosine kinase wze, irrespective of its phosphorylation status. however,  wze attained a higher phosphorylation level after interacting with phosphorylated wzd in the presence of 10 mm atp. this highly phosphorylated wze did not remain in close association with phosphorylated wzd. conclusion: the wze tyrosine kinase protein of lactobacillus rhamnosus thus carries out tyrosine phosphorylation of wzd in addition to auto- and trans- phosphorylation of the kinase itself.

TI  == construction of a shuttle vector based on the small cryptic plasmid pjy33 from weissella cibaria 33.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid, pjy33, from weissella cibaria 33 was characterized. pjy33 was  2365 bp in size with a gc content of 41.27% and contained two putative open reading frames (orfs). orf1 encoded a putative hypothetical protein of 134 amino  acids. orf2 was 849 bp in size, and its putative translation product exhibited 87% identity with a replication initiation factor from a plasmid from w. cibaria  klc140. a weissella-escherichia coli shuttle vector, pjy33e (6.5 kb, em(r)), was  constructed by ligation of pjy33 with pbluescript ii sk(-) and an erythromycin resistance gene (em(r)). pjy33e replicated in lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella confusa. a  single-stranded dna intermediate was detected from lb. brevis 2.14 harbouring pjy33e, providing evidence for rolling-circle replication of pjy33. most lb. brevis 2.14 cells (85.9%) retained pjy33e after one week of daily culturing in mrs broth without em. an aga gene encoding alpha-galactosidase (alpha-gal) from leuconostoc mesenteroides was successfully expressed in lb. brevis 2.14 using pjy33e, and the highest level of alpha-gal activity (36.13 u/mg protein) was observed when cells were grown on melibiose.

TI  == the conserved modular elements of the acyl carrier proteins of lipid synthesis are only partially interchangeable.
AB  == prior work showed that expression of acyl carrier proteins (acps) of a diverse set of bacteria replaced the function of escherichia coli acp in lipid biosynthesis. however, the acpas of lactococcus lactis and enterococcus faecalis  were inactive. both failed to support growth of an e. coli acpp mutant strain. this defect seemed likely because of the helix ii sequences of the two acpas, which differed markedly from those of the proteins that supported growth. to test this premise, chimeric acps were constructed in which l. lactis helix ii replaced helix ii of e. coli acpp and vice versa. expression of the acpp protein l. lactis acpa helix ii allowed weak growth, whereas the l. lactis acpa-derived protein that contained e. coli acpp helix ii failed to support growth of the e. coli mutant strain. replacement of the l. lactis acpa helix ii residues in this protein showed that substitution of valine for the phenylalanine residue four residues downstream of the phosphopanthetheine-modified serine gave robust growth and allowed modification by the endogenous acps phosphopantetheinyl transferase (rather than the promiscuous sfp transferase required to modify the l. lactis acpa and the chimera of l. lactis acpa helix ii in acpp). further chimera constructs showed that the lack of function of the l. lactis acpa-derived protein containing e. coli acpp helix ii was due to incompatibility of l. lactis acpa helix i with the downstream elements of acpp. therefore, the origins of acp incompatibility can reside in either helix i or in helix ii.

TI  == co-releasing molecules have nonheme targets in bacteria: transcriptomic, mathematical modeling and biochemical analyses of corm-3 [ru(co)cl(glycinate)] actions on a heme-deficient mutant of escherichia coli.
AB  == aims: carbon monoxide-releasing molecules (corms) are being developed with the ultimate goal of safely utilizing the therapeutic potential of co clinically, including applications in antimicrobial therapy. hemes are generally considered the prime targets of co and corms, so we tested this hypothesis using heme-deficient bacteria, applying cellular, transcriptomic, and biochemical tools. results: corm-3 [ru(co)3cl(glycinate)] readily penetrated escherichia coli hema bacteria and was inhibitory to these and lactococcus lactis, even though they lack all detectable hemes. transcriptomic analyses, coupled with mathematical modeling of transcription factor activities, revealed that the response to corm-3 in hema bacteria is multifaceted but characterized by markedly elevated expression of iron acquisition and utilization mechanisms, global stress responses, and zinc management processes. cell membranes are disturbed by corm-3. innovation: this work has demonstrated for the first time that corm-3 (and to a lesser extent its inactivated counterpart) has multiple cellular targets other than hemes. a full understanding of the actions of corms is vital to understand their toxic effects. conclusion: this work has furthered our understanding of the key targets of corm-3 in bacteria and raises the possibility that the widely reported antimicrobial effects cannot be attributed to classical biochemical targets of co. this is a vital step in exploiting the potential, already demonstrated, for using optimized corms in antimicrobial therapy. antioxid. redox signal. 00, 000-000.

TI  == functional analysis of the n-terminal region of endolysin lyb5 encoded by lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage phipyb5.
AB  == lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5 uses endolysin lyb5 and holin hyb5 to burst the host cell. previous results showed that expression of lyb5 in escherichia coli caused host cell lysis slowly, leading us to suppose that lyb5 could pass the cytoplasmic membrane partly. in this work, the function  of a putative signal peptide (splyb5) at the n-terminal of lyb5 was investigated. in e. coli, the cell adopted a spherical shape during induction of lyb5 protein,  while morphological changes were not observed during expression of the splyb5 truncation, indicating that the splyb5 motif may serve as a functional signal peptide. however, splyb5 was not proteolytically cleaved at the predicted site during the translocation of lyb5, and the expressed lyb5 protein appeared in the  cytoplasm, cytoplasmic membrane and periplasm fractions with the same molecular mass. similar results were obtained using lactococcus lactis as a host to express lyb5. these results indicated that splyb5 could direct lyb5 to the periplasm in a membrane-tethered form, and then release it as a soluble active enzyme into the periplasm. in addition, splyb5 could also drive the fused nucleaseb protein to the extracytoplasm environment in e. coli as well as in l. lactis. we proposed that in gram-negative and gram-positive hosts splyb5 acted as a signal-anchor-release domain, which was firstly identified here by experimental evidences in lactic acid bacteria phages. the application of signal-anchor-release domain for endolysin export in bacteriophages infecting gram-positive and gram-negative hosts was discussed.

TI  == active immunization with an octa-valent staphylococcus aureus antigen mixture in  models of s. aureus bacteremia and skin infection in mice.
AB  == proteomic studies with different staphylococcus aureus isolates have shown that the cell surface-exposed and secreted proteins isaa, lytm, nuc, the propeptide of atl (pro-atl) and four phenol-soluble modulins alpha (psmalpha) are invariantly produced by this pathogen. therefore the present study was aimed at investigating whether these proteins can be used for active immunization against s. aureus infection in mouse models of bacteremia and skin infection. to this end, recombinant his-tagged fusions of isaa, lytm, nuc and pro-atl were isolated from  lactococcus lactis or escherichia coli, while the psmalpha1-4 peptides were chemically synthesized. importantly, patients colonized by s. aureus showed significant immunoglobulin g (igg) responses against all eight antigens. balb/cbyj mice were immunized subcutaneously with a mixture of the antigens at day one (5 mug each), and boosted twice (25 mug of each antigen) with 28 days interval. this resulted in high igg responses against all antigens although the response against pro-atl was around one log lower compared to the other antigens. compared to placebo-immunized mice, immunization with the octa-valent antigen mixture did not reduce the s. aureus isolate p load in blood, lungs, spleen, liver, and kidneys in a bacteremia model in which the animals were challenged for 14 days with a primary load of 3 x 10(5) cfu. discomfort scores and animal survival rates over 14 days did not differ between immunized mice and placebo-immunized mice upon bacteremia with s. aureus usa300 (6 x 10(5) cfu). in  addition, this immunization did not reduce the s. aureus isolate p load in mice with skin infection. these results show that the target antigens are immunogenic  in both humans and mice, but in the used animal models do not result in protection against s. aureus infection.

TI  == lactococcus lactis thioredoxin reductase is sensitive to light inactivation.
AB  == thioredoxin, involved in numerous redox pathways, is maintained in the dithiol state by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent flavoprotein thioredoxin reductase (trxr). here, trxr from lactococcus lactis is compared with the well-characterized trxr from escherichia coli. the two enzymes belong to the  same class of low-molecular weight thioredoxin reductases and display similar kcat values ( approximately 25 s(-1)) with their cognate thioredoxin. remarkably, however, the l. lactis enzyme is inactivated by visible light and furthermore reduces molecular oxygen 10 times faster than e. coli trxr. the rate of light inactivation under standardized conditions (lambdamax=460 nm and 4 degrees c) was reduced at lowered oxygen concentrations and in the presence of iodide. inactivation was accompanied by a distinct spectral shift of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad) that remained firmly bound. high-resolution mass spectrometric analysis of heat-extracted fad from light-damaged trxr revealed a mass increment  of 13.979 da, relative to that of unmodified fad, corresponding to the addition of one oxygen atom and the loss of two hydrogen atoms. tandem mass spectrometry confined the increase in mass of the isoalloxazine ring, and the extracted modified cofactor reacted with dinitrophenyl hydrazine, indicating the presence of an aldehyde. we hypothesize that a methyl group of fad is oxidized to a formyl group. the significance of this not previously reported oxidation and the exceptionally high rate of oxygen reduction are discussed in relation to other flavin modifications and the possible occurrence of enzymes with similar properties.

TI  == recombinant expressions of sweet plant protein mabinlin ii in escherichia coli and food-grade lactococcus lactis.
AB  == sweet plant proteins, which are safe, natural, low-calorie sweeteners, may be suitable replacements for sugars in the food and beverage industries. mabinlin ii, a sweet plant protein, shows the most pronounced heat stability and acid resistance of any of the six known types of plant sweet proteins. however, mabinlin ii is difficult to extract from the capparis masaikai plant, which is itself becoming increasingly scarce. this limits the use of naturally acquired mabinlin ii. in this study, recombinant mabinlin ii proteins were expressed and purified in escherichia coli and in food-grade lactococcus lactis. recombinant mabinlin ii proteins mbl-bh (containing the b-chains of mabinlin ii downstream fused with his-tag) and mbl-abh (containing the a- and b-chains of mabinlin ii downstream fused with his-tag) were expressed in e. coli in the form of inclusion bodies. they were then purified and renatured. the refolded mbl-bh was found to be 100 times sweeter than sucrose by weight, but it was not heat-stable. refolded mbl-abh was neither sweet nor heat-stable. recombinant mabinlin ii proteins were  secreted and expressed intracellularly in food-grade l. lactis, in which the concentrated cell samples and culture medium samples were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blotting analysis with anti-mabinlin ii polyclonal antibody. this study demonstrated that the single b chain of mabinlin ii has a sweet taste. the recombinant mabinlin ii proteins have been successfully expressed in food-grade l. lactis, which is a crucial step in the production of mabinlin ii through microorganism expression systems.

TI  == heterologous expression of carcinoembryonic antigen in lactococcus lactis via lcsb-mediated surface displaying system for oral vaccine development.
AB  == background/purpose: carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) is an attractive target for immunotherapy because it is expressed minimally in normal tissue, but is overexpressed in a wide variety of malignant epithelial tissues. lactic acid bacteria (labs), widely used in food processes, are attractive candidates for oral vaccination. thus, we examined whether labs could be used as a live vaccine  vector to deliver cea antigen. methods: cea was cloned into an escherichia coli/lactococcus lactis shuttle vector psec:leiss under the control of a nisin promoter. for displaying the cea on the cell surface of the l. lactis strain, the anchor motif lcsb from the s-layer protein of lactobacillus crispatus was fused with cea. intracellular and cell surface expression of the cea-lcsb fusion was confirmed by western blot analysis. results: significantly higher levels of cea-specific secretory immunoglobulin a in the sera of mice were observed upon oral administration of strain cultures containing the cea-lcsb fused protein. in  addition, the cea-lcsb antigen group showed a higher spleen index compared to the cea antigen alone or negative control, demonstrating that surface-displayed cea antigen could induce a higher immune response. conclusion: these results provided the first evidence for displaying cea antigen on the cell surfaces of labs as oral vaccines against cancer or infectious diseases.

TI  == two lactococcus lactis thioredoxin paralogues play different roles in responses to arsenate and oxidative stress.
AB  == thioredoxin (trx) maintains intracellular thiol groups in a reduced state and is  involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including ribonucleotide reduction, sulphur assimilation, oxidative stress responses and arsenate detoxification. the industrially important lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis contains two trxs. trxa is similar to the well-characterized trx homologue from escherichia coli and contains the common wcgpc active site motif, while trxd is atypical and contains an aspartate residue in the active site (wcgdc). to elucidate the physiological roles of the two trx paralogues, deletion mutants deltatrxa, deltatrxd and deltatrxadeltatrxd were constructed. in general, the deltatrxadeltatrxd strain was significantly more sensitive than either of the deltatrxa and deltatrxd mutants. upon exposure to oxidative stress, growth of the deltatrxa strain was diminished while that of the deltatrxd mutant was similar to the wild-type. the lack of trxa also appears to impair methionine sulphoxide reduction. both deltatrxa and deltatrxd strains displayed growth inhibition after treatment with sodium arsenate and tellurite as compared with the wild-type, suggesting partially overlapping functions of trxa and trxd. overall the phenotype of the deltatrxa mutant matches established functions of wcgpc-type trx while trxd appears to play a more restricted role in stress resistance of lac. lactis.

TI  == physiology and substrate specificity of two closely related amino acid transporters, serp1 and serp2, of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the serp1 and serp2 genes found adjacently on the chromosome of lactococcus lactis strains encode two members of the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (apc)  superfamily of secondary transporters that share 61% sequence identity. serp1 transports l-serine, l-threonine, and l-cysteine with high affinity. affinity constants (km) are in the 20 to 40 mum range. serp2 is a dl-alanine/dl-serine/glycine transporter. the preferred substrate appears to be dl-alanine for which the affinities were found to be 38 and 20 mum for the d and  l isomers, respectively. the common substrate l-serine is a high-affinity substrate of serp1 and a low-affinity substrate of serp2 with affinity constants  of 18 and 356 mum, respectively. growth experiments demonstrate that serp1 is the main l-serine transporter responsible for optimal growth in media containing free amino acids as the sole source of amino acids. serp2 is able to replace serp1 in  this role only in medium lacking the high-affinity substrates l-alanine and glycine. serp2 plays an adverse role for the cell by being solely responsible for the uptake of toxic d-serine. the main function of serp2 is in cell wall biosynthesis through the uptake of d-alanine, an essential precursor in peptidoglycan synthesis. serp2 has overlapping substrate specificity and shares 42% sequence identity with cyca of escherichia coli, a transporter whose involvement in peptidoglycan synthesis is well established. no evidence was obtained for a role of serp1 and serp2 in the excretion of excess amino acids during growth of l. lactis on protein/peptide-rich media.

TI  == expanding the recombinant protein quality in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == background: escherichia coli has been a main host for the production of recombinant proteins of biomedical interest, but conformational stress responses  impose severe bottlenecks that impair the production of soluble, proteolytically  stable versions of many protein species. in this context, emerging generally recognized as safe (gras) bacterial hosts provide alternatives as cell factories  for recombinant protein production, in which limitations associated to the use of gram-negative microorganisms might result minimized. among them, lactic acid bacteria and specially lactococcus lactis are gram-positive gras organisms in which recombinant protein solubility is generically higher and downstream facilitated, when compared to e. coli. however, deep analyses of recombinant protein quality in this system are still required to completely evaluate its performance and potential for improvement. results: we have explored here the conformational quality (through specific fluorescence emission) and solubility of an aggregation-prone gfp variant (vp1gfp) produced in l. lactis. in this context, our results show that parameters such as production time, culture conditions and  growth temperature have a dramatic impact not only on protein yield, but also on  protein solubility and conformational quality, that are particularly favored under fermentative metabolism. conclusions: metabolic regime and cultivation temperature greatly influence solubility and conformational quality of an aggregation-prone protein in l. lactis. specifically, the present study proves that anaerobic growth is the optimal condition for recombinant protein production purposes. besides, growth temperature plays an important role regulating both protein solubility and conformational quality. additionally, our results also prove the great versatility for the manipulation of this bacterial system regarding the improvement of functionality, yield and quality of recombinant proteins in this species. these findings not only confirm l. lactis as an excellent producer of recombinant proteins but also reveal room for significant improvement by the exploitation of external protein quality modulators.

AB  == the function of cell-free solutions (cfss) of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on tyramine and other biogenic amine production by different food borne-pathogens (fbps) was investigated in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (tdb) using hplc. cell free solutions were prepared from four lab strains. two different concentrations  which were 50% (5 ml cfs+5 ml medium/1:1) and 25% (2.5 ml cfs+7.5 ml medium/1:3)  cfs and the control without cfs were prepared. both concentration of cfs of streptococcus thermophilus and 50% cfs of pediococcus acidophilus inhibited tyramine production up to 98% by salmonella paratyphi a. tyramine production by escherichia coli was also inhibited by 50% cfs of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and 25% cfs of leuconostoc lactis. subsp. cremoris. the inhibitor effect of 50% cfs of p. acidophilus was the highest on tyramine production (55%) by listeria monocytogenes, following lc. lactis subsp. lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (20%) whilst 25% cfs of leu. mes. subsp. cremoris and lc. lactis subsp. lactis showed stimulator effects (160%). the stimulation effects of 50% cfs of s. thermophilus and lc. lactis subsp. lactis were more than 70% by staphylococcus aureus comparing to the control. cfs of lab strains showed  statistically inhibitor effect since lactic acid inhibited microbial growth, decreased ph quickly and reduced the formation of amn and bas. consequently, in order to avoid the formation of high concentrations of biogenic amines in fermented food by bacteria, it is advisable to use cfs for food and food products.

TI  == enhanced free fatty acid production by codon-optimized lactococcus lactis acyl-acp thioesterase gene expression in escherichia coli using crude glycerol.
AB  == fatty acid production and composition are determined by the type of acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterases (acyl-acp tes) expressed in escherichia coli. bacterial acyl-acp tes from lactococcus lactis (sgjs47), enterococcus faecalis (sgjs49), and burkholderia cepacia (sgjs50) were codon-optimized and expressed in e. coli for enhanced fatty acid production. samples were extracted at the lag, log, and stationary phases of cell growth, and gene expression levels of the codon optimized acy-acp tes as well as fatty acid production were monitored. at 24h after initiation of gene expression, the opllte expression level and fatty acid production in sgjs47 increased up to 15.8-fold and 3.2-fold compared to the  control and other recombinant strains, respectively. additionally, in sgjs47, improvement in free fatty acid (ffa) composition, high-specificity production of  short-chain fatty acids (c8, c10) and unsaturated fatty acids (c16:1) was achieved in crude glycerol medium condition. compared with control strain, the percentage of ffas (c8 and c10) was enhanced by approximately 16- to 21-fold, c16:1 ffa ratio increased approximately 18-fold. observation of codon-optimized acyl-acp te genes expression level in e. coli may be useful for understanding mechanisms towards improving fatty acid production. engineered strains have the potential to overproduce specific ffas and thereby reduce the cost of fatty acid  production by using industrially inexpensive carbon sources.

AB  == tunable control of protein degradation in bacteria would provide a powerful research tool. here we use components of the mesoplasma florum transfer-messenger rna system to create a synthetic degradation system that provides both independent control of steady-state protein level and inducible degradation of targeted proteins in escherichia coli. we demonstrate application of this system  in synthetic circuit development and control of core bacterial processes and antibacterial targets, and we transfer the system to lactococcus lactis to establish its broad functionality in bacteria. we create a 238-member library of  tagged essential proteins in e. coli that can serve as both a research tool to study essential gene function and an applied system for antibiotic discovery. our synthetic protein degradation system is modular, does not require disruption of host systems and can be transferred to diverse bacteria with minimal modification.

TI  == structure and mechanism of the trna-dependent lantibiotic dehydratase nisb.
AB  == lantibiotics are a class of peptide antibiotics that contain one or more thioether bonds. the lantibiotic nisin is an antimicrobial peptide that is widely used as a food preservative to combat food-borne pathogens. nisin contains dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine residues that are formed by the dehydration of ser/thr by the lantibiotic dehydratase nisb (ref. 2). recent biochemical studies  revealed that nisb glutamylates ser/thr side chains as part of the dehydration process. however, the molecular mechanism by which nisb uses glutamate to catalyse dehydration remains unresolved. here we show that this process involves  glutamyl-trna(glu) to activate ser/thr residues. in addition, the 2.9-a crystal structure of nisb in complex with its substrate peptide nisa reveals the presence of two separate domains that catalyse the ser/thr glutamylation and glutamate elimination steps. the co-crystal structure also provides insights into substrate recognition by lantibiotic dehydratases. our findings demonstrate an unexpected role for aminoacyl-trna in the formation of dehydroamino acids in lantibiotics, and serve as a basis for the functional characterization of the many lantibiotic-like dehydratases involved in the biosynthesis of other classes of natural products.

TI  == bacterial production of isobutanol without expensive reagents.
AB  == isobutanol is attracting attention as a potential biofuel because it has higher energy density and lower hygroscopicity than ethanol. to date, several effective  methods for microbial production of isobutanol have been developed, but they require expensive reagents to maintain expression plasmids and induce expression, which is not suitable for practical production. here, we describe a simple and efficient method for isobutanol production in escherichia coli. it is noteworthy  that no expression plasmids or inducers were used during the production. instead, heterologous genes necessary for isobutanol production were all knocked into the  genome, and the expression of those genes was induced by xylose, which is present in most biomass feedstocks. the constructed strain (mlcxt7-lafc-aakcd) contains bacillus subtilis alss, e. coli ilvcd, lactococcus lactis adha, and l. lactis kivd genes in its genome and efficiently produced isobutanol from glucose and xylose in flask batch cultures. under conditions in which the temperature and ph  of the medium and the aeration in the culture were all optimized, the final isobutanol concentration reached 8.4 g l(-1) after 48 h. isobutanol was also produced using hydrolysate from japanese cedar as the carbon source without supplemented glucose, xylose, or yeast extract. under those conditions, isobutanol (3.7 g l(-1)) was produced in 96 h. taken together, these results indicate that the developed strain is potentially useful for industrial isobutanol production.

TI  == lactococcus lactis trxd represents a subgroup of thioredoxins prevalent in gram-positive bacteria containing wcxdc active site motifs.
AB  == three protein disulfide reductases of the thioredoxin superfamily from the industrially important gram-positive lactococcus lactis (lltrxa, lltrxd and llnrdh) are compared to the "classical" thioredoxin from escherichia coli (ectrx1). lltrxa resembles ectrx1 with a wcgpc active site motif and other key residues conserved. by contrast, lltrxd is more distantly related and contains a  wcgdc motif. bioinformatics analysis suggests that lltrxd represents a subgroup of thioredoxins from gram-positive bacteria. llnrdh is a glutaredoxin-like electron donor for ribonucleotide reductase class ib. based on protein-protein equilibria lltrxa (e degrees '=-259mv) and llnrdh (e degrees '=-238mv) show approximately 10mv higher standard state redox potentials than the corresponding  e. coli homologues, while e degrees ' of lltrxd is -243mv, more similar to glutaredoxin than "classical" thioredoxin. ectrx1 and lltrxa have high capacity to reduce insulin disulfides and their exposed active site thiol is alkylated at  a similar rate at ph 7.0. lltrxd on the other hand, is alkylated by iodoacetamide at almost 100 fold higher rate and shows no activity towards insulin disulfides.  lltrxa, lltrxd and llnrdh are all efficiently reduced by nadph dependent thioredoxin reductase (trxr) from l. lactis and good cross-reactivity towards e.  coli trxr was observed with lltrxd as the notable exception.

TI  == impact of osmotic stress on protein diffusion in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == we measured translational diffusion of proteins in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane of the gram-positive bacterium lactococcus lactis and probed the effect  of osmotic upshift. for cells in standard growth medium the diffusion coefficients for cytosolic proteins (27 and 582 kda) and 12-transmembrane helix membrane proteins are similar to those in escherichia coli. the translational diffusion of gfp in l. lactis drops by two orders of magnitude when the medium osmolality is increased by approximately 1.9 osm, and the decrease in mobility is partly reversed in the presence of osmoprotectants. we find a large spread in diffusion coefficients over the full population of cells but a smaller spread if  only sister cells are compared. while in general the diffusion coefficients we measure under normal osmotic conditions in l. lactis are similar to those reported in e. coli, the decrease in translational diffusion upon osmotic challenge in l. lactis is smaller than in e. coli. an even more striking difference is that in l. lactis the gfp diffusion coefficient drops much more rapidly with volume than in e. coli. we discuss these findings in the light of differences in turgor, cell volume, crowding and cytoplasmic structure of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == precision genome engineering in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == innovative new genome engineering technologies for manipulating chromosomes have  appeared in the last decade. one of these technologies, recombination mediated genetic engineering (recombineering) allows for precision dna engineering of chromosomes and plasmids in escherichia coli. single-stranded dna recombineering  (ssdr) allows for the generation of subtle mutations without the need for selection and without leaving behind any foreign dna. in this review we discuss the application of ssdr technology in lactic acid bacteria, with an emphasis on key factors that were critical to move this technology from e. coli into lactobacillus reuteri and lactococcus lactis. we also provide a blueprint for how to proceed if one is attempting to establish ssdr technology in a lactic acid bacterium. the emergence of crispr-cas technology in genome engineering and its potential application to enhancing ssdr in lactic acid bacteria is discussed. the ability to perform precision genome engineering in medically and industrially important lactic acid bacteria will allow for the genetic improvement of strains  without compromising safety.

AB  == background: epidermal growth factor (egf) is an important growth factor in regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, survival and apoptosis. studies showed that food-grade lactococcus lactis (l. lactis) and nice expression system have superior performance in exogenous protein expression. this study aimed to construct and express porcine egf (pegf), and use l. lactis as vehicle for producing and delivering pegf. furthermore, investigating biological activity of pegf and exploring applications feasibility of combination effects of l. lactis and pegf on early weaned piglets' production. results: a recombinant lactococcus lactis which produced and secreted pegf at 1000 ng/ml in culture supernatant was generated. secreted pegf was a fully biologically active protein, as demonstrated by its capacity to stimulate l929 mouse fibroblast cell line proliferation in vitro. for in vivo study, forty piglets were randomly allocated  to control, antibiotic control, empty vector-expressing l. lactis (ll-ev) and pegf-secreting l. lactis (ll-pegf). after 14 d of rearing, final body weight and  average daily gain in ll-pegf were greater (p < 0.05, 8.95 vs. 8.37 kg, 206.1 vs. 157.7 g/day, respectively) than those in control, but no significant differences  between ll-pegf, ll-ev and antibiotic control. overall period average daily feed  intake was higher in ll-pegf, ll-ev and antibiotic control than in control (p < 0.05, 252.9, 255.6, 250.0, 207.3 g/day, respectively). no significant difference  was observed on adfi/adg. ll-pegf increased villous height in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum than in control and ll-ev (p < 0.05). sucrase in the 3 intestinal segments, aminopeptidase a in the duodenum and jejunum, aminopeptidase n and dipeptidase iv in the duodenum in ll-pegf were higher than those in control (p < 0.05). furthermore, escherichia coli and enterococcus counts decreased in the ileum and lactobacillus increased in the ileum and cecum digesta in ll-pegf compare with the control (p < 0.05). lactobacillus increased in the cecum in ll-ev compared with control and antibiotic control (p < 0.05). conclusion: we have generated a recombinant lactococcus lactis which produced and secreted fully biologically active porcine egf. oral administration of pegf-secreting l. lactis  had beneficial effects on intestinal health and performance of early-weaned piglets.

TI  == estimating biological elementary flux modes that decompose a flux distribution by the minimal branching property.
AB  == motivation: elementary flux mode (efm) is a useful tool in constraint-based modeling of metabolic networks. the property that every flux distribution can be  decomposed as a weighted sum of efms allows certain applications of efms to studying flux distributions. the existence of biologically infeasible efms and the non-uniqueness of the decomposition, however, undermine the applicability of  such methods. efforts have been made to find biologically feasible efms by incorporating information from transcriptional regulation and thermodynamics. yet, no attempt has been made to distinguish biologically feasible efms by considering their graphical properties. a previous study on the transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes found that distinct branches at a branch point metabolite usually belong to distinct metabolic pathways. this suggests an intuitive property of biologically feasible efms, i.e. minimal branching. results: we developed the concept of minimal branching efm and derived the minimal branching decomposition (mbd) to decompose flux distributions. testing in the core escherichia coli metabolic network indicated that mbd can distinguish branches at branch points and greatly reduced the solution space in which the decomposition is often unique. an experimental flux distribution from a previous  study on mouse cardiomyocyte was decomposed using mbd. comparison with decomposition by a minimum number of efms showed that mbd found efms more consistent with established biological knowledge, which facilitates interpretation. comparison of the methods applied to a complex flux distribution  in lactococcus lactis similarly showed the advantages of mbd. the minimal branching efm concept underlying mbd should be useful in other applications. contact: sinhu@bio.dtu.dk or p.ji@polyu.edu.hk supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.

TI  == effect of kcl substitution on bacterial viability of escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and selected probiotics.
AB  == excessive intake of nacl has been associated with the increased risk of several diseases, particularly hypertension. strategies to reduce sodium intake include substitution of nacl with other salts, such as kcl. in this study, the effects of nacl reduction and its substitution with kcl on cell membranes of a cheese starter bacterium (lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis), probiotic bacteria (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei), and a pathogenic bacterium (escherichia coli) were investigated using fourier-transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy. a critical nacl concentration that inhibited the viability of e. coli without affecting the viability of probiotic bacteria significantly was determined. to find the critical nacl concentration, de man, rogosa, and sharpe (mrs) broth was supplemented with a range of nacl concentrations [0 (control), 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0%], and the effect on cell viability and ftir spectra was monitored for all bacteria. a nacl concentration of 2.5% was found to be the critical level of nacl to inhibit e. coli without significantly affecting the viability of most of the probiotic bacteria and the cheese starter bacterium. the ftir spectral analysis also highlighted the changes that occurred mainly in the amide regions upon increasing the nacl concentration from 2.5 to 3.0% in most of  the bacteria. escherichia coli and b. longum were more sensitive to substitution  of nacl with kcl, compared with lb. acidophilus, lb. casei, and lc. lactis ssp. lactis. to evaluate the effect of substitution of nacl with kcl, substitution was carried out at the critical total salt concentration (2.5%, wt/vol) at varying concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% kcl). the findings suggest that 50% substitution of nacl with kcl, at 2.5% total salt, could inhibit e. coli without  affecting the probiotic bacteria.

AB  == a multifunctional transgenic lactobacillus with probiotic characteristics and an  ability to degrade beta-glucan and phytic acid (phytate) was engineered to improve nutrient utilization, increase production performance and decrease digestive diseases in broiler chickens. the bacillus subtilis wl001 endoglucanase gene (celw) and aspergillus fumigatus wl002 phytase gene (phyw) mature peptide (phywm) were cloned into an expression vector with the lactate dehydrogenase promoter of lactobacillus casei and the secretion signal peptide of the lactococcus lactis usp45 gene. this construct was then transformed into lactobacillus reuteri xc1 that had been isolated from the gastrointestinal tract  of broilers. heterologous enzyme production and feed effectiveness of this genetically modified l. reuteri strain were investigated and evaluated. sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the molecular mass of phywm and celw was approximately 48.2 and 55 kda, respectively, consistent with their predicted molecular weights. endoglucanase and phytase activities in the extracellular fraction of the transformed l. reuteri culture were 0.68 and 0.42 u/ml, respectively. transformed l. reuteri improved the feed conversion ratio of broilers from 21 to 42 days of age and over the whole feeding period. however, there was no effect on body weight gain and feed intake of chicks. transformed l. reuteri supplementation improved levels of ash, calcium and phosphorus in tibiae at day 21 and of phosphorus at day 42. in addition, populations of escherichia coli, veillonella spp. and bacteroides vulgatus were decreased, while populations of bifidobacterium genus and lactobacillus spp. were increased in the cecum at day 21.

TI  == lantibiotic immunity: inhibition of nisin mediated pore formation by nisi.
AB  == nisin, a 3.4 kda antimicrobial peptide produced by some lactococcus lactis strains is the most prominent member of the lantibiotic family. nisin can inhibit cell growth and penetrates the target gram-positive bacterial membrane by binding to lipid ii, an essential cell wall synthesis precursor. the assembled nisin-lipid ii complex forms pores in the target membrane. to gain immunity against its own-produced nisin, lactococcus lactis is expressing two immunity protein systems, nisi and nisfeg. here, we show that the nisi expressing strain displays an ic50 of 73 +/- 10 nm, an 8-10-fold increase when compared to the non-expressing sensitive strain. when the nisin concentration is raised above 70  nm, the cells expressing full-length nisi stop growing rather than being killed.  nisi is inhibiting nisin mediated pore formation, even at nisin concentrations up to 1 microm. this effect is induced by the c-terminus of nisi that protects lipid ii. its deletion showed pore formation again. the expression of nisi in combination with externally added nisin mediates an elongation of the chain length of the lactococcus lactis cocci. while the sensitive strain cell-chains consist mainly of two cells, the nisi expressing cells display a length of up to  20 cells. both results shed light on the immunity of lantibiotic producer strains, and their survival in high levels of their own lantibiotic in the habitat.

TI  == polyhydroyxalkanoate synthase fusions as a strategy for oriented enzyme immobilisation.
AB  == polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) is a carbon storage polymer produced by certain bacteria in unbalanced nutrient conditions. the pha forms spherical inclusions surrounded by granule associate proteins including the pha synthase (phac). recently, the intracellular formation of pha granules with covalently attached synthase from ralstonia eutropha has been exploited as a novel strategy for oriented enzyme immobilisation. fusing the enzyme of interest to pha synthase results in a bifunctional protein able to produce pha granules and immobilise the active enzyme of choice to the granule surface. functionalised pha granules can be isolated from the bacterial hosts, such as escherichia coli, and maintain enzymatic activity in a wide variety of assay conditions. this approach to oriented enzyme immobilisation has produced higher enzyme activities and product  levels than non-oriented immobilisation techniques such as protein inclusion based particles. here, enzyme immobilisation via pha synthase fusion is reviewed  in terms of the genetic designs, the choices of enzymes, the control of enzyme orientations, as well as their current and potential applications.

AB  == enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) have been responsible for several outbreaks of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (hus) worldwide. hus is the most common cause of acute renal failure in children and results in fatalities as high as 50% in the elderly. currently, neither a specific treatment nor a vaccine is available for ehec. lactococcus lactis is a generally regarded as safe "gras" bacterium that offers a valuable platform for oral vaccine delivery. toward the development of an oral vaccine against ehec, we have previously constructed a recombinant l. lactis strain expressing the ehec antigen, espb in the cytoplasmic compartment. however, oral immunization of mice with this strain induced weak priming of the immune system. this outcome was attributed to the rather low levels of espb expressed by this recombinant strain. therefore, in the present study we optimized the expression of espb in l. lactis by secreting the antigen either under constitutive or nisin-inducible control. indeed, oral immunization of mice with the espb-secreting strains successfully induced specific mucosal and systemic antibody responses. these responses were associated with mixed th1/th2 cell responses in peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. moreover, immunized mice exhibited significant protection against e. coli o157:h7 colonization, as indicated by the reduced amount and/or duration of the bacterial fecal shedding.  our results demonstrate the protective potential of espb as an oral vaccine against ehec infection. additionally, the study demonstrates the efficient delivery of recombinant espb by the "gras" bacterium, l. lactis. the safety profile of l. lactis as a vaccine vehicle can particularly be beneficial to children and elderly as high-risk groups for hus incidence.

AB  == isoprenoids are a large, diverse group of secondary metabolites which has recently raised a renewed research interest due to genetic engineering advances,  allowing specific isoprenoids to be produced and characterized in heterologous hosts. many researches on metabolic engineering of heterologous hosts for increased isoprenoid production are focussed on escherichia coli and yeasts. e. coli, as most prokaryotes, use the 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (mep) pathway for isoprenoid production. yeasts on the other hand, use the mevalonate pathway which is commonly found in eukaryotes. however, lactococcus lactis is an  attractive alternative host for heterologous isoprenoid production. apart from being food-grade, this gram-positive prokaryote uses the mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid production instead of the mep pathway. previous studies have shown that l. lactis is able to produce sesquiterpenes through heterologous expression  of plant sesquiterpene synthases. in this work, we analysed the gene expression of the lactococcal mevalonate pathway through rt-qpcr to successfully engineer l. lactis as an efficient host for isoprenoid production. we then overexpressed the  mvk gene singly or co-expressed with the mvaa gene as an attempt to increase beta-sesquiphellandrene production in l. lactis. it was observed that co-expression of mvk with mvaa doubled the amount of beta-sesquiphellandrene produced.

AB  == background: over the recent years the production of ehrlich pathway derived chemicals was shown in a variety of hosts such as escherichia coli, corynebacterium glutamicum, and yeast. exemplarily the production of isobutyric acid was demonstrated in escherichia coli with remarkable titers and yields. however, these examples suffer from byproduct formation due to the fermentative growth mode of the respective organism. we aim at establishing a new aerobic, chassis for the synthesis of isobutyric acid and other interesting metabolites using pseudomonas sp. strain vlb120, an obligate aerobe organism, as host strain. results: the overexpression of kivd, coding for a 2-ketoacid decarboxylase from lactococcus lactis in ps. sp. strain vlb120 enabled for the production of isobutyric acid and isobutanol via the valine synthesis route (ehrlich pathway).  this indicates the existence of chromosomally encoded alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases catalyzing the reduction and oxidation of isobutyraldehyde. in addition we showed that the strain possesses a complete pathway for isobutyric acid metabolization, channeling the compound via isobutyryl-coa into valine degradation. three key issues were addressed to allow and optimize isobutyric acid synthesis: i) minimizing isobutyric acid degradation by host intrinsic enzymes, ii) construction of suitable expression systems and iii) streamlining of central carbon metabolism finally leading to production of up to 26.8 +/- 1.5 mm  isobutyric acid with a carbon yield of 0.12 +/- 0.01 g g(glc)(-)(1). conclusion:  the combination of an increased flux towards isobutyric acid using a tailor-made  expression system and the prevention of precursor and product degradation allowed efficient production of isobutyric acid in ps. sp. strain vlb120. this will be the basis for the development of a continuous reaction process for this bulk chemicals.

TI  == engineering of epa/dha omega-3 fatty acid production by lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363.
AB  == eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) and docosahexaenoic acid (dha) have been shown to be  of major importance in human health. therefore, these essential polyunsaturated fatty acids have received considerable attention in both human and farm animal nutrition. currently, fish and fish oils are the main dietary sources of epa/dha. to generate sustainable novel sources for epa and dha, the 35-kb epa/dha synthesis gene cluster was isolated from a marine bacterium, shewanella baltica mac1. to streamline the introduction of the genes into food-grade microorganisms  such as lactic acid bacteria, unnecessary genes located upstream and downstream of the epa/dha gene cluster were deleted. recombinant escherichia coli harboring  the 20-kb gene cluster produced 3.5- to 6.1-fold more epa than those carrying the 35-kb dna fragment coding for epa/dha synthesis. the 20-kb epa/dha gene cluster was cloned into a modified broad-host-range low copy number vector, pil252m (4.7  kb, ery) and expressed in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363. recombinant  l. lactis produced dha (1.35 +/- 0.5 mg g(-1) cell dry weight) and epa (0.12 +/-  0.04 mg g(-1) cell dry weight). this is believed to be the first successful cloning and expression of epa/dha synthesis gene cluster in lactic acid bacteria. our findings advance the future use of epa/dha-producing lactic acid bacteria in  such applications as dairy starters, silage adjuncts, and animal feed supplements.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == lactococcus lactis yfia is necessary and sufficient for ribosome dimerization.
AB  == dimerization and inactivation of ribosomes in escherichia coli is a two-step process that involves the binding of ribosome modulation factor (rmf) and hibernation promotion factor (hpf). lactococcus lactis mg1363 expresses a protein, yfia(l) (l) , which associates with ribosomes in the stationary phase of growth and is responsible for dimerization of ribosomes. we show that full-length yfia(l) (l) is necessary and sufficient for ribosome dimerization in l. lactis but also functions heterologously in vitro with e. coli ribosomes. deletion of the yfia gene has no effect on the growth rate but diminishes the survival of l.  lactis under energy-starving conditions. the n-terminal domain of yfia(l) (l) is  homologous to hpf from e. coli, whereas the c-terminal domain has no counterpart  in e. coli. by assembling ribosome dimers in vitro, we could dissect the roles of the n- and c-terminal domains of yfia(l) (l) . it is concluded that the dimerization and inactivation of ribosomes in l. lactis and e. coli differ in several cellular and molecular aspects. in addition, two-dimensional maps of dimeric ribosomes from l. lactis obtained by single particle electron microscopy  show a marked structural difference in monomer association in comparison to the ribosome dimers in e. coli.

TI  == restoration of bioactive lantibiotic suicin from a remnant lan locus of pathogenic streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides. their biosynthesis genes are usually organized in gene clusters, which are mainly found in gram-positive bacteria, including pathogenic  streptococci. three highly virulent streptococcus suis serotype 2 strains (98hah33, 05zyh33, and sc84) have been shown to contain an 89k pathogenicity island. here, on these islands, we unveiled and reannotated a putative lantibiotic locus designated sui which contains a virulence-associated two-component regulator, suik-suir. in silico analysis revealed that the putative lantibiotic modification gene suim was interrupted by a 7.9-kb integron and that  other biosynthesis-related genes contained various frameshift mutations. by reconstituting the intact suim in escherichia coli together with a semi-in vitro  biosynthesis system, a putative lantibiotic named suicin was produced with bactericidal activities against a variety of gram-positive strains, including pathogenic streptococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. ring topology dissection indicated that the 34-amino-acid lantibiotic contained two methyllanthionine residues and one disulfide bridge, which render suicin in an n-terminal linear and c-terminal globular shape. to confirm the function of suik-suir, suir was overexpressed and purified. in vitro analysis showed that suir could specifically bind to the suia gene promoter. its coexpression with suik could activate suia gene promoter in lactococcus lactis nz9000. conclusively, we obtained a novel lantibiotic suicin by restoring its production  from the remnant sui locus and demonstrated that virulence-associated suik-suir regulates its production.

TI  == prgk, a multidomain peptidoglycan hydrolase, is essential for conjugative transfer of the pheromone-responsive plasmid pcf10.
AB  == peptidoglycan (pg) hydrolases associated with bacterial type iv secretion systems (t4sss) are thought to generate localized lesions in the pg layer to facilitate assembly of the translocation channel. the pheromone-responsive plasmid pcf10 of  enterococcus faecalis encodes a putative cell wall hydrolase, prgk, and here we report that a prgk deletion abolished functionality of the pcf10-encoded t4ss as  monitored by pcf10 conjugative transfer. expression in trans of wild-type prgk fully complemented this mutation. prgk has three potential hydrolase motifs resembling staphylococcal lytm, soluble lytic transglycosylase (slt), and cysteine-, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase (chap) domains. complementation analyses with mutant alleles established that prgk bearing two hydrolase domains in any combination supported near-wild-type plasmid transfer, and prgk bearing a single hydrolase domain supported at least a low level of transfer in filter matings. when exported to the escherichia coli periplasm, each domain disrupted cell growth, and combinations of domains additionally induced cell rounding and blebbing and conferred enhanced sensitivity to osmotic shock. each domain bound pg in vitro, but only the slt domain exhibited detectable hydrolase activity, as shown by zymographic analyses and release of fluorescent pg fragments. genes encoding three t4ss-associated, putative hydrolases, lactococcus lactis csia, tn925 orf14, and pip501 trag, partially complemented the deltaprgk mutation. our findings establish that prgk is an essential component of the pcf10-encoded prg/pcf t4ss and that its hydrolase domains coordinate their activities for full prgk function. prgk is indispensable for plasmid transfer in  liquid matings, suggestive of a role in formation or stabilization of mating junctions.

TI  == group ii intron-ribosome association protects intron rna from degradation.
AB  == the influence of the cellular environment on the structures and properties of catalytic rnas is not well understood, despite great interest in ribozyme function. here we report on ribosome association of group ii introns, which are ribozymes that are important because of their putative ancestry to spliceosomal introns and retrotransposons, their retromobility via an rna intermediate, and their application as gene delivery agents. we show that group ii intron rna, in complex with the intron-encoded protein from the native lactoccocus lactis host,  associates strongly with ribosomes in vivo. ribosomes have little effect on intron ribozyme activities; rather, the association with host ribosomes protects  the intron rna against degradation by rnase e, an enzyme previously shown to be a silencer of retromobility in escherichia coli. the ribosome interacts strongly with the intron, exerting protective effects in vivo and in vitro, as demonstrated by genetic and biochemical experiments. these results are consistent with the ribosome influencing the integrity of catalytic rnas in bacteria in the  face of degradative nucleases that regulate intron mobility.

TI  == structure, adsorption to host, and infection mechanism of virulent lactococcal phage p2.
AB  == lactococcal siphophages from the 936 and p335 groups infect the gram-positive bacterium lactococcus lactis using receptor binding proteins (rbps) attached to their baseplate, a large multiprotein complex at the distal part of the tail. we  have previously reported the crystal and electron microscopy (em) structures of the baseplates of phages p2 (936 group) and tp901-1 (p335 group) as well as the full em structure of the tp901-1 virion. here, we report the complete em structure of siphophage p2, including its capsid, connector complex, tail, and baseplate. furthermore, we show that the p2 tail is characterized by the presence of protruding decorations, which are related to adhesins and are likely contributed by the major tail protein c-terminal domains. this feature is reminiscent of the tail of escherichia coli phage lambda and bacillus subtilis phage spp1 and might point to a common mechanism for establishing initial interactions with their bacterial hosts. comparative analyses showed that the architecture of the phage p2 baseplate differs largely from that of lactococcal phage tp901-1. we quantified the interaction of its rbp with the saccharidic receptor and determined that specificity is due to lower k(off) values of the rbp/saccharidic dissociation. taken together, these results suggest that the infection of l. lactis strains by phage p2 is a multistep process that involves reversible attachment, followed by baseplate activation, specific attachment of the rbps to the saccharidic receptor, and dna ejection.

TI  == probiotic characterization of potential hydrolases producing lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolated from pickled yam.
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize potential probiotic strain co-producing alpha-amylase and beta-galactosidase. sixty-three strains, isolated from pickle samples were screened for their hydrolase producing capacity by utilizing different starches as carbon source. one out of 63 strains, isolated from traditionally fermented pickled yam showing maximum hydrolase activity (alpha-amylase (36.9 u/ml) and beta-galactosidase (42.6 u/ml)) within a period of 48 hours was identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. further, it was assessed for the probiotic characteristics under gastrointestinal conditions like acidic, alkaline, proteolytic enzymes, bile stress and found to exhibit tolerance to these stresses. the therapeutic potential of the isolate is implicated because of its antagonistic effect against enteric foodborne pathogens (salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli 0157:h7, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica and aeromonas hydrophila). the results of this study entail a potential applicability of the isolate in developing future probiotic foods besides the production of industrially significant hydrolases.

TI  == expression and delivery of an endolysin to combat clostridium perfringens.
AB  == clostridium perfringens is a cause for increasing concern due to its responsibility for severe infections both in humans and animals, especially poultry. to find new control strategies to treat c. perfringens infection, we investigated the activity and delivery of a bacteriophage endolysin. we identified a new endolysin, designated cp25l, which shows similarity to an n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase domain and is distinct from other c. perfringens endolysins whose activity has been demonstrated in vitro. the cp25l gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the gene product demonstrated lytic activity against all 25 c. perfringens strains tested. the probiotic strain lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 was engineered to deliver the endolysin to the gastrointestinal tract. the integration of the nisrk two-component regulatory system from the lactococcus lactis nisin a biosynthesis  operon into the chromosome of l. johnsonii allowed constitutive expression of the endolysin under the control of the nisa promoter (p nisa ), while the use of a signal peptide (slpmod) led to successful secretion of the active endolysin to the surrounding media. the high specificity and activity of the endolysin suggest that it may be developed as an effective tool to enhance the control of c. perfringens by l. johnsonii in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == availability of public goods shapes the evolution of competing metabolic strategies.
AB  == tradeoffs provide a rationale for the outcome of natural selection. a prominent example is the negative correlation between the growth rate and the biomass yield in unicellular organisms. this tradeoff leads to a dilemma, where the optimization of growth rate is advantageous for an individual, whereas the optimization of the biomass yield would be advantageous for a population. high-rate strategies are observed in a broad variety of organisms such as escherichia coli, yeast, and cancer cells. growth in suspension cultures favors fast-growing organisms, whereas spatial structure is of importance for the evolution of high-yield strategies. despite this realization, experimental methods to directly select for increased yield are lacking. we here show that the serial propagation of a microbial population in a water-in-oil emulsion allows selection of strains with increased biomass yield. the propagation in emulsion creates a spatially structured environment where the growth-limiting substrate is privatized for populations founded by individual cells. experimental evolution of several isogenic lactococcus lactis strains demonstrated the existence of a tradeoff between growth rate and biomass yield as an apparent pareto front. the underlying mutations altered glucose transport and led to major shifts between homofermentative and heterofermentative metabolism, accounting for the changes in metabolic efficiency. the results demonstrated the impact of privatizing a public good on the evolutionary outcome between competing metabolic strategies. the presented approach allows the investigation of fundamental questions in biology such as the evolution of cooperation, cell-cell interactions, and the relationships between environmental and metabolic constraints.

AB  == plantaricin gene-specific primers were used to obtain plne, -f, -j and -k structural gene amplicons from soil metagenome. these amplicons were cloned and expressed in pet32a (+) vector in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). plne, -f, -j and -k peptides were expressed as his-tagged-fusion proteins and were separated by ni(2+) -chelating affinity chromatography. the peptides were released from the fusion by enterokinase cleavage and separated from the carrier thioredoxin. the cleaved peptides were further analysed for antimicrobial activity and found to be active against listeria innocua nrrl b33314, micrococcus luteus mtcc 106 and lactic acid bacteria, such as enterococcus casseliflavus nrrl b3502, lactococcus  lactis lactis nrrl 1821, lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b4562 and lactobacillus plantarum nrrl b4496. e. coli has been successfully exploited as a host for heterologous expression with a significant yield of fused and cleaved peptides in the range of 8-12 and 1-1.5 mg/l of the culture, respectively. heterologous expression, therefore, can be used to overcome the constraints of low yield often reported from a native strain.

TI  == metabolic engineering of escherichia coli to minimize byproduct formate and improving succinate productivity through increasing nadh availability by heterologous expression of nad(+)-dependent formate dehydrogenase.
AB  == succinic acid is a specialty chemical having numerous applications in industrial, pharmaceutical and food uses. one of the major challenges in the succinate fermentation process is eliminating the formation of byproducts. in this study, we describe eliminating byproduct formate and improving succinate productivity by reengineering a high succinate producing e. coli strain sbs550mg-cms243(phl413km). the nad(+)-dependent formate dehydrogenase gene (fdh1) of candida boidinii was coexpressed with lactococcus lactis pyruvate carboxylase  (pyca) under the control of ptrc and ppyca promoters in plasmid phl413kf1. the newly introduced fdh1 converts 1 mol of formate into 1 mol of nadh and co2. the reengineered strain sbs550mg-cms243(phl413kf1) retains the reducing power of formate through an increase in nadh availability. in anaerobic shake flask fermentations, the parent strain sbs550mg-cms243(phl413km) consumed 99.86 mm glucose and produced 172.38 mm succinate, 16.16 mm formate and 4.42 mm acetate. the fdh bearing strain, sbs550mg-cms243(phl413kf1) consumed 98.43 mm glucose and  produced 171.80 mm succinate, 1mm formate and 5.78 mm acetate. furthermore, external formate supplementation to sbs550mg(phl413kf1) fermentations resulted in about 6% increase in succinate yields as compared to sbs550mg(phl413km). in an anaerobic fed-batch bioreactor process, the average glucose consumption rate, succinate productivity, and byproduct formate concentration of sbs550mg(phl413km) was 1.40 g/l/h, 1g/l/h, and 17 mm, respectively. whereas, the average glucose consumption rate, succinate productivity and byproduct formate concentration of sbs550mg(phl413kf1) was 2 g/l/h, 2 g/l/h, 0-3 mm respectively. a high cell density culture of sbs550mg(phl413kf1) showed further improvement in succinate productivity with a higher glucose consumption rate. reduced levels of byproduct  formate in succinate fermentation broth would provide an opportunity for reducing the cost associated with downstream processing, purification, and waste disposal.

AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus, gas) is an important human pathogen causing mild superficial infections of skin and mucous membranes, but also life-threatening systemic diseases. s. pyogenes and other prokaryotic organisms use the arginine deiminase system (ads) for survival in acidic environments. in this study, the arginine deiminase (ad), and carbamate kinase (ck) from s. pyogenes m49 strain 591 were heterologously expressed in escherichia coli dh5alpha, purified, and kinetically characterized. ad and ck from s. pyogenes m49 share high amino acid sequence similarity with the respective enzymes from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 (45.6% and 53.5% identical amino acids) and enterococcus faecalis v583 (66.8% and 66.8% identical amino acids). we found that the arginine deiminase of s. pyogenes is not allosterically regulated by the intermediates and products of the arginine degradation (e.g., atp, citrulline, carbamoyl phosphate). the km and vmax values for arginine were 1.13+/-0.12mm (mean+/-sd) and 1.51+/-0.07mumol/min/mg protein. the carbamate kinase is inhibited by atp but unaffected by arginine and citrulline. the km and  vmax values for adp were 0.72+/-0.08mm and 1.10+/-0.10mumol/min/mg protein and the km for carbamoyl phosphate was 0.65+/-0.07mm. the optimum ph and temperature  for both enzymes were 6.5 and 37 degrees c, respectively.

TI  == the protective effect of recombinant lactococcus lactis oral vaccine on a clostridium difficile-infected animal model.
AB  == background: oral immunization with vaccines may be an effective strategy for prevention of clostridium difficile infection (cdi). however, application of previously developed vaccines for preventing cdi has been limited due to various  reasons. here, we developed a recombinant lactococcus lactis oral vaccine and evaluated its effect on a c. difficile-infected animal model established in golden hamsters in attempt to provide an alternative strategy for cdi prevention. methods: recombinant l. lactis vaccine was developed using the ptrkh2 plasmid, a  high-copy-number escherichia coli-l. shuttle vector: 1) l. lactis expressing secreted proteins was constructed with recombinant ptrkh2 (secreted-protein plasmid) carrying the usp45 signal peptide (spusp45), nontoxic adjuvanted tetanus toxin fragment c (tetc), and 14 of the 38 c-terminal repeats (14cdta) of nontoxic c. difficile toxin a (tcda); and 2) l. lactis expressing secreted and membrane proteins was constructed with recombinant ptrkh2 (membrane-anchored plasmid) carrying spusp45, tetc, 14cdta, and the cell wall-anchored sequence of protein m6 (cwam6). then, 32 male syrian golden hamsters were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 8 each) for gavage of normal saline (blank control) and l. lactis carrying the empty shuttle vector, secreted-protein plasmid, and membrane-anchored plasmid, respectively. after 1-week gavage of clindamycin, the animals were administered with c. difficile spore suspension. general symptoms and intestinal  pathological changes of the animals were examined by naked eye and microscopy, respectively. protein levels of anti-tcda igg/iga antibodies in intestinal tissue and fluid were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). a cell culture cytotoxicity neutralization assay was done by tcda treatment with or without anti-tcda serum pre-incubation or treatment. apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells was examined by flow cytometry (fl) assay. expression of mucosal inflammatory cytokines in the animals was detected by polymer chain reaction (pcr) assay. results: after the c. difficile challenge, the animals of control group had severe diarrhea symptoms on day 1 and all died on day 4, indicating that the cdi animal model was established in hamster. of the 3 immunization groups, secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups had significantly lower mortalities, body weight decreases, and pathological scores, with higher survival rate/time than the empty plasmid group (p < 0.05). the tilter of igg antibody directed against tcda was significantly higher in serum and intestinal fluid of secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups than in the empty  plasmid group (p < 0.05) while the corresponding titer of iga antibody directed against tcda had no substantial differences (p > 0.05). the anti-tcda serum of membrane-anchored plasmid group neutralized the cytotoxicity of 200 ng/ml tcda with the best protective effect achieved by anti-tcda serum pre-incubation. the incidences of tcda-induced death and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells were significantly reduced by cell pre-incubation or treatment with anti-tcda serum of membrane-anchored plasmid group (p < 0.05). mcp-1, icam-1, il-6, and gro-1 mrna expression levels were the lowest in cecum tissue of the membrane-anchored groups compared to the other groups. conclusion: recombinant l. lactis live vaccine is effective for preventing cdi in the hamster model, thus providing an alternative for immunization of c. difficile-associated diseases.

TI  == effect of the abortive infection mechanism and type iii toxin/antitoxin system abiq on the lytic cycle of lactococcus lactis phages.
AB  == to survive in phage-containing environments, bacteria have evolved an array of antiphage systems. similarly, phages have overcome these hurdles through various  means. here, we investigated how phages are able to circumvent the lactococcus lactis abiq system, a type iii toxin-antitoxin with antiviral activities. lactococcal phage escape mutants were obtained in the laboratory, and their genomes were sequenced. three unrelated genes of unknown function were mutated in derivatives of three distinct lactococcal siphophages: orf38 of phage p008, m1 of phage bil170, and e19 of phage c2. one-step growth curve experiments revealed that the phage mutations had a fitness cost while transcriptional analyses showed that abiq modified the early-expressed phage mrna profiles. the l. lactis abiq system was also transferred into escherichia coli mg1655 and tested against several coliphages. while abiq was efficient against phages t4 (myoviridae) and t5 (siphoviridae), escape mutants of only phage 2 (myoviridae) could be isolated. genome sequencing revealed a mutation in gene orf210, a putative dna polymerase.  taking these observations together, different phage genes or gene products are targeted or involved in the abiq phenotype. moreover, this antiviral system is active against various phage families infecting gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. a model for the mode of action of abiq is proposed.

AB  == we present results of tests with recombinant lactococcus lactis that produce and  secrete heterologous antimicrobial peptides with activity against gram-negative pathogenic escherichia coli and salmonella . in an initial screening, the activities of numerous candidate antimicrobial peptides, made by solid state synthesis, were assessed against several indicator pathogenic e. coli and salmonella strains. peptides a3apo and alyteserin were selected as top performers based on high antimicrobial activity against the pathogens tested and on significantly lower antimicrobial activity against l. lactis . expression cassettes containing the signal peptide of the protein usp45 fused to the codon-optimized sequence of mature a3apo and alyteserin were cloned under the control of a nisin-inducible promoter pnisa and transformed into l. lactis il1403. the resulting recombinant strains were induced to express and secrete both peptides. a3apo- and alyteserin-containing supernatants from these recombinant l. lactis inhibited the growth of pathogenic e. coli and salmonella by up to 20-fold, while maintaining the host's viability. this system may serve as a model for the production and delivery of antimicrobial peptides by lactic acid bacteria to target gram-negative pathogenic bacteria populations.

TI  == cd14-dependent monocyte isolation enhances phagocytosis of listeria monocytogenes by proinflammatory, gm-csf-derived macrophages.
AB  == macrophages are an important line of defence against invading pathogens. human macrophages derived by different methods were tested for their suitability as models to investigate listeria monocytogenes (lm) infection and compared to macrophage-like thp-1 cells. human primary monocytes were isolated by either positive or negative immunomagnetic selection and differentiated in the presence  of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) or macrophage colony-stimulating factor (m-csf) into pro- or anti-inflammatory macrophages, respectively. regardless of the isolation method, gm-csf-derived macrophages (gm-mphi) stained positive for cd206 and m-csf-derived macrophages (m-mphi) for cd163. thp-1 cells did not express cd206 or cd163 following incubation with pma,  m- or gm-csf alone or in combination. upon infection with lm, all primary macrophages showed good survival at high multiplicities of infection whereas viability of thp-1 was severely reduced even at lower bacterial numbers. m-mphi generally showed high phagocytosis of lm. strikingly, phagocytosis of lm by gm-mphi was markedly influenced by the method used for isolation of monocytes. gm-mphi derived from negatively isolated monocytes showed low phagocytosis of lm  whereas gm-mphi generated from positively selected monocytes displayed high phagocytosis of lm. moreover, incubation with cd14 antibody was sufficient to enhance phagocytosis of lm by gm-mphi generated from negatively isolated monocytes. by contrast, non-specific phagocytosis of latex beads by gm-mphi was not influenced by treatment with cd14 antibody. furthermore, phagocytosis of lactococcus lactis, escherichia coli, human cytomegalovirus and the protozoan parasite leishmania major by gm-mphi was not enhanced upon treatment with cd14 antibody indicating that this effect is specific for lm. based on these observations, we propose macrophages derived by ex vivo differentiation of negatively selected human primary monocytes as the most suitable model to study lm infection of macrophages.

TI  == pdb2011, a 7.6 kb multidrug resistance plasmid from listeria innocua replicating  in gram-positive and gram-negative hosts.
AB  == pdb2011, a multidrug resistance plasmid isolated from the foodborne listeria innocua strain tts-2011 was sequenced and characterized. sequence analysis revealed that pdb2011 had a length of 7641 bp and contained seven coding dna sequences of which two were annotated as replication proteins, one as a recombination/mobilization protein and one as a transposase. furthermore, pdb2011 harbored the trimethoprim, spectinomycin and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin  b resistance genes dfrd, spc and erm(a), respectively. however, pdb2011 was only  associated with trimethoprim and spectinomycin resistance phenotypes and not with phenotypic resistance to erythromycin. a region of the plasmid encoding the resistance genes spc and erm(a) plus the transposase was highly similar to staphylococcus aureus transposon tn554. the dfrd gene was 100% identical to dfrd  found in a number of listeria monocytogenes isolates. additionally, assessment of the potential host range of pdb2011 revealed that the plasmid was able to replicate in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363 as well as in escherichia  coli mc1061 and dh5alpha. this study reports the first multidrug resistance plasmid in l. innocua. a large potential for dissemination of pdb2011 is indicated by its host range of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == enhancement of succinate production by metabolically engineered escherichia coli  with co-expression of nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase and pyruvate carboxylase.
AB  == escherichia coli ba002, in which the ldha and pflb genes are deleted, cannot utilize glucose anaerobically due to the inability to regenerate nad(+). to restore glucose utilization, overexpression of nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (naprtase) encoded by the pncb gene, a rate-limiting enzyme of nad(h) synthesis pathway, resulted in a significant increase in cell mass and succinate production under anaerobic conditions. however, a high concentration of pyruvate accumulated. thus, co-expression of naprtase and the heterologous pyruvate carboxylase (pyc) of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris nz9000 in recombinant e. coli ba016 was investigated. the total concentration of  nad(h) was 9.8-fold higher in ba016 than in ba002, and the nadh/nad(+) ratio decreased from 0.60 to 0.04. under anaerobic conditions, ba016 consumed 17.50 g l(-1) glucose and produced 14.08 g l(-1) succinate with a small quantity of pyruvate. furthermore, when the reducing agent dithiothreitol or reduced carbon source sorbitol was added, the cell growth and carbon source consumption rate of  ba016 was reasonably enhanced and succinate productivity increased.

TI  == novel particulate vaccines utilizing polyester nanoparticles (bio-beads) for protection against mycobacterium bovis infection - a review.
AB  == bovine tuberculosis (tb) continues to be a major health problem in cattle and development of a safe effective vaccine to control tb in cattle would be very useful. this paper reviews progress and provides new data in development of a tb  bio-bead vaccine based on polyester nanoparticle inclusions which were produced by bioengineered bacteria. polyhydroxybutyrate (phb) biopolyester nanoparticles (bio-beads) have been produced which displayed mycobacterial antigens, ag85a and  esat-6, on the surface of the bio-beads for use as vaccines for the control of tuberculosis. bio-beads were purified from the host production bacteria, escherichia coli and the generally regarded as safe (gras) bacterium, lactococcus lactis. previous published studies showed that vaccination with ag85a/esat-6 bio-beads induced antigen-specific ifn-gamma, il-17a, il-6, tnf-alpha and il-2 in splenocytes, but no significant increase in il-4, il-5 or il-10. new results showed that antigen-specific ifn-gamma release was induced by both cd4 and cd8 t  cells in mice vaccinated with the ag85a/esat-6 bio-beads. mice vaccinated with ag85a/esat-6 bio-beads alone or in combination with bcg had significantly lower bacterial counts from the lungs and spleen following aerosol challenge with mycobacterium bovis compared to control groups. this unique approach to the design and production of bacterial-derived bio-beads displaying antigens enables  a cost-effective way to express a diverse antigen repertoire for use as vaccines  to combat tb or other diseases.

TI  == in vitro activity of the nisin dehydratase nisb.
AB  == the biosynthesis of several classes of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides involves dehydration of serine and threonine residues. for class i lantibiotics, thiopeptides, and goadsporin, this  dehydration is catalyzed by lanthionine biosynthetic enzyme b (lanb) or lanb-like proteins. although lanb proteins have been studied since 1992, in vitro reconstitution of their dehydration activity has been elusive. we show here the in vitro activity of the dehydratase involved in the biosynthesis of the food preservative nisin (nisb). in vitro, nisb dehydrated its substrate peptide nisa eight times in the presence of glutamate, atp, mg(2+), and the ribosomal/membrane fraction of bacterial cell extract. mutation of 23 highly conserved residues of nisb identified a number of amino acids that are essential for dehydration activity. in addition, these mutagenesis studies identified three mutants, r786a, r826a, and h961a, that result in multiple glutamylations of the nisa substrate. glutamylation was observed during both escherichia coli coexpression of nisa with these mutants and in vitro assays. treatment of the glutamylated substrate with wt nisb results in dehydrated nisa, suggesting that the glutamylated peptide is an intermediate in dehydration. collectively, these studies suggest that dehydration involves glutamylation of the side chains of ser and thr followed by  elimination. the latter step has precedent in the virginiamycin resistance protein virginiamycin b lyase. these studies will facilitate investigation of other lanb proteins involved in the biosynthesis of lantibiotics, thiopeptides, and goadsporin.

TI  == electron beam fabrication of a microfluidic device for studying submicron-scale bacteria.
AB  == background: controlled restriction of cellular movement using microfluidics allows one to study individual cells to gain insight into aspects of their physiology and behaviour. for example, the use of micron-sized growth channels that confine individual escherichia coli has yielded novel insights into cell growth and death. to extend this approach to other species of bacteria, many of whom have dimensions in the sub-micron range, or to a larger range of growth conditions, a readily-fabricated device containing sub-micron features is required. results: here we detail the fabrication of a versatile device with growth channels whose widths range from 0.3 mum to 0.8 mum. the device is fabricated using electron beam lithography, which provides excellent control over the shape and size of different growth channels and facilitates the rapid-prototyping of new designs. features are successfully transferred first into silicon, and subsequently into the polydimethylsiloxane that forms the basis of the working microfluidic device. we demonstrate that the growth of sub-micron  scale bacteria such as lactococcus lactis or escherichia coli cultured in minimal medium can be followed in such a device over several generations. conclusions: we have presented a detailed protocol based on electron beam fabrication together with specific dry etching procedures for the fabrication of a microfluidic device suited to study submicron-sized bacteria. we have demonstrated that both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria can be successfully loaded and imaged over a number of generations in this device. similar devices could potentially be used to study other submicron-sized organisms under conditions in which the height and shape of the growth channels are crucial to the experimental design.

TI  == repetitive, marker-free, site-specific integration as a novel tool for multiple chromosomal integration of dna.
AB  == we present a tool for repetitive, marker-free, site-specific integration in lactococcus lactis, in which a nonreplicating plasmid vector (pkv6) carrying a phage attachment site (attp) can be integrated into a bacterial attachment site (attb). the novelty of the tool described here is the inclusion of a minimal bacterial attachment site (attb(min)), two mutated loxp sequences (lox66 and lox71) allowing for removal of undesirable vector elements (antibiotic resistance marker), and a counterselection marker (orop) for selection of loxp recombination on the pkv6 vector. when transformed into l. lactis expressing the phage tp901-1  integrase, pkv6 integrates with high frequency into the chromosome, where it is flanked by attl and attr hybrid attachment sites. after expression of cre recombinase from a plasmid that is not able to replicate in l. lactis, loxp recombinants can be selected for by using 5-fluoroorotic acid. the introduced attb(min) site can subsequently be used for a second round of integration. to examine if attp recombination was specific to the attb site, integration was performed in strains containing the attb, attl, and attr sites or the attl and attr sites only. only attp-attb recombination was observed when all three sites were present. in the absence of the attb site, a low frequency of attp-attl recombination was observed. to demonstrate the functionality of the system, the xylose utilization genes (xylabr and xylt) from l. lactis strain kf147 were integrated into the chromosome of l. lactis strain mg1363 in two steps.

TI  == induction of specific immune responses in piglets by intramuscular immunization with fimbrial adhesin faeg expressed in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == fimbrial adhesin plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec)-induced piglet diarrhoea. lactococcus lactis is an attractive food-grade host for the production of heterologous antigens. we previously demonstrated that fimbrial adhesin faeg was expressed in l. lactis and that oral immunization in mice with recombinant l. lactis expressing faeg induced f4-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses. in the present study, we explored the immune responses of piglets induced by intramuscular vaccination with recombinant l. lactis expressing rfaeg. intramuscular vaccination resulted in significantly elevated serum igg level and modest increases in serum iga and igm levels. in addition, igg, iga, and igm antibody secreting cells were induced  in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and jejunum. the growth performance of piglets was not influenced by intramuscular vaccination. the results suggest that l. lactis expressing faeg is a promising candidate vaccine against etec.

TI  == propionyl-coa dependent biosynthesis of 2-hydroxybutyrate containing polyhydroxyalkanoates in metabolically engineered escherichia coli.
AB  == we have previously reported in vivo biosynthesis of 2-hydroxyacid containing polyesters including polylactic acid (pla), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [p(3hb-co-la)], and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-2-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [p(3hb-co-2hb-co-la)] employing metabolically engineered escherichia coli strains by the introduction of evolved clostridium propionicum propionyl-coa transferase  (pct(cp)) and pseudomonas sp. mbel 6-19 polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthase 1 (phac1(ps6-19)). in this study, we further engineered in vivo pla biosynthesis system in e. coli to synthesize 2hb-containing pha, in which propionyl-coa was used as precursor for 2-ketobutyrate that was converted into 2hb-coa by the sequential actions of lactococcus lactis (d)-2-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (pane) and pct(cp) and then 2hb-coa was polymerized by phac1(ps6-19). the recombinant e. coli xl1-blue expressing the phac1437 gene, the pct540 gene, and the ralstonia eutropha prpe gene together with the pane gene could be grown to 0.66 g/l and successfully produced p(70 mol%3hb-co-18 mol%2hb-co-12 mol%la) up to the pha content of 66 wt% from 20 g/l of glucose, 2 g/l of 3hb and 1 g/l of sodium propionate. removal of the prpc gene in the chromosome of e. coli xl1-blue could increase the mole fraction of 2hb in copolymer, but the pha content was decreased. the metabolic engineering strategy reported here suggests that propionyl-coa can be successfully used as the precursor to provide pha synthase with 2hb-coa for the production of phas containing 2hb monomer.

TI  == secretory expression of lacticin q fused with sumo in bacillus subtilis.
AB  == lacticin q is a 53-amino acid class ii bacteriocin produced by lactococcus lactis qu 5. it shows antibacterial activity comparable to that of nisin a in terms of both spectrum and intensity. moreover, it remains stable at alkaline ph values, while nisin a was inactivated. it may possibly be employed as an alternative to or in combination with nisin a. the objective of this study was to express lacticin q extracellularly with small ubiquitin-related modifier (sumo) fusion technology in bacillus subtilis. secretory sumo-lacticin q fusion protein was efficiently produced in b. subtilis wb600 transformed with the recombinant expression plasmid and accounted for 19% of the culture supernatant proteins. fusion sumo-lacticin q was purified by nickel nitrilotriacetate (ni-nta) affinity chromatography and digested with sumo protease to release lacticin q. lacticin q  was further purified by ni-nta chromatography to yield about 2.5 mg of lacticin q with more than 93% purity from 1l of supernatant of fermentation culture. an activity assay indicated that the recombinant bacteriocin exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity against indicator strains. the results obtained suggest that the secretory lacticin q was efficiently expressed using sumo fusion technology in b. subtilis. the expression and purification system could promote the application of lacticin q in food and medicine.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria convert glucosinolates to nitriles efficiently yet differently from enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == glucosinolates from the genus brassica can be converted into bioactive compounds  known to induce phase ii enzymes, which may decrease the risk of cancers. conversion via hydrolysis is usually by the brassica enzyme myrosinase, which can be inactivated by cooking or storage. we examined the potential of three beneficial bacteria, lactobacillus plantarum kw30, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis kf147, and escherichia coli nissle 1917, and known myrosinase-producer enterobacter cloacae to catalyze the conversion of glucosinolates in broccoli extract. enterobacteriaceae consumed on average 65% glucoiberin and 78% glucoraphanin, transforming them into glucoiberverin and glucoerucin, respectively, and small amounts of iberverin nitrile and erucin nitrile. the lactic acid bacteria did not accumulate reduced glucosinolates, consuming all at  30-33% and transforming these into iberverin nitrile, erucin nitrile, sulforaphane nitrile, and further unidentified metabolites. adding beneficial bacteria to a glucosinolate-rich diet may increase glucosinolate transformation,  thereby increasing host exposure to bioactives.

AB  == recently, high interest has been attracted to the research of inflammatory bowel  diseases (ibd). recombinant probiotic bacteria may represent an interesting way to influence the course of ibd. their benefits include cheap and simple production and easy manipulation of the genetic material. several gene therapy and probiotic approaches already showed promising results in the past. the aim of this study was to test the probiotic potential of il-10-expressing escherichia coli nissle 1917 in a mouse model of ibd and to compare it with control bacterial strains. the dextran sulphate sodium (dss) model of colitis was examined for this purpose. animals received control probiotic bacteria or modified probiotics (expressing il-10) via gastric gavage. body weight, stool consistency, food and water consumption were monitored. at the end of the experiment, the parameters of inflammation, oxidative stress and carbonyl stress were analysed in the samples and statistical analysis was performed. we prepared an anti-inflammatory probiotic escherichia coli strain that we designated nissle 1917/pmec-il10 and proved its anti-inflammatory properties, which are similar to those of the control probiotic strains nissle 1917 and lactococcus lactis/pmec-il10 in vivo. the probiotic therapy was successful according to several parameters, including colon length, and oxidative and carbonyl stress. bacterially produced il-10 was detected in the plasma. the potential of bacterial anti-inflammatory therapy of ibd using modified probiotics was outlined. the results opened a way for upcoming studies using modified probiotics for therapy of systemic diseases.

TI  == subcutaneous or oral immunization of mice with lactococcus lactis expressing f4 fimbrial adhesin faeg.
AB  == enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) is one of the most common causes of diarrhea in neonatal and postweaning piglets. fimbrial adhesion of etec has been  considered an important colonization factor with antigenicity. to safely and effectively deliver the f4 (k88) fimbrial adhesin faeg to the immune system, we have previously constructed the secretory expression vector pnz8112-faeg, and faeg was produced in cytoplasmic form in lactococcus lactis. in this work, balb/c mice were immunized with recombinant l. lactis to further determine the immunogenicity of recombinant faeg (rfaeg) via the subcutaneous or oral route. subcutaneous immunization in mice with recombinant l. lactis induced a significant increase in the f4-specific serum igg titer and the number of antibody-secreting cells (ascs) in the spleen. oral immunization of mice with recombinant l. lactis induced mucosal and systemic f4-specific immune responses and increased the number of ascs in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and peyer's patches. high-dose (2.8 x 10(11) cfu) recombinant strains and adjuvant cholera toxin b subunit enhanced specific mucosal immune responses. the results suggest the feasibility of delivering rfaeg expressed in l. lactis to the immune  system in order to induce an f4-specific immune response.

AB  == an epidemic shift in hepatitis a virus (hav) infection has been observed in recent years in rapidly developing countries, with increasing numbers of severe adult cases which has led to renewed interest in vaccination. our approach in vaccine development uses recombinant expression of the highly immunogenic hav antigen vp1-p2a in food-grade lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis and in escherichia coli. we used genetic constructs that enable nisin-controlled expression of the antigen in l. lactis in three different forms: (a) intracellularly, (b) on the bacterial surface and (c) on the bacterial surface fused with the fragment of the e. coli flagellin molecule that can act as a molecular adjuvant. expression of the two surface forms of the antigen was achieved in l. lactis, and the resulting antigen-displaying bacteria were administered orally to mice. half the animals in each of the two groups developed specific iggs, with titers increasing over time and reaching 1:422 without flagellin and 1:320 with flagellin. a much higher titer 1:25,803 was observed with the parenterally administered antigen, which was purified from e. coli. with the latter, a significant mucosal iga response was also observed. despite significant titers, the iggs elicited with oral or parenteral administration could not prevent hav from infecting cells in a virus neutralization assay, suggesting that the antibodies cannot recognize viral surface epitopes. nevertheless, orally administered hav antigen expressed in l. lactis elicited significant systemic humoral immune response showing the feasibility for development of effective hav vaccine for mucosal delivery.

AB  == l-histidinol phosphate phosphatase (hpp) catalyzes the hydrolysis of l-histidinol phosphate to l-histidinol and inorganic phosphate, the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of l-histidine. hpp from the polymerase and histidinol phosphatase (php) family of proteins possesses a trinuclear active site and a distorted (beta/alpha)(7)-barrel protein fold. this group of enzymes is closely related to  the amidohydrolase superfamily of enzymes. the mechanism of phosphomonoester bond hydrolysis by the php family of hpp enzymes was addressed. recombinant hpp from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis that was expressed in escherichia coli contained a mixture of iron and zinc in the active site and had a catalytic efficiency of ~10(3) m(-1) s(-1). expression of the protein under iron-free conditions resulted in the production of an enzyme with a 2 order of magnitude improvement in catalytic efficiency and a mixture of zinc and manganese in the active site. solvent isotope and viscosity effects demonstrated that proton transfer steps and product dissociation steps are not rate-limiting. x-ray structures of hpp were determined with sulfate, l-histidinol phosphate, and a complex of l-histidinol and arsenate bound in the active site. these crystal structures and the catalytic properties of variants were used to identify the structural elements required for catalysis and substrate recognition by the hpp family of enzymes within the amidohydrolase superfamily.

TI  == three-component lysine/ornithine decarboxylation system in lactobacillus saerimneri 30a.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria play a pivotal role in many food fermentations and sometimes represent a health threat due to the ability of some strains to produce biogenic  amines that accumulate in foods and cause trouble following ingestion. these strains carry specific enzymatic systems catalyzing the uptake of amino acid precursors (e.g., ornithine and lysine), the decarboxylation inside the cell, and the release of the resulting biogenic amines (e.g., putrescine and cadaverine). this study aimed to identify the system involved in production of cadaverine from lysine, which has not been described to date for lactic acid bacteria. strain lactobacillus saerimneri 30a (formerly called lactobacillus sp. 30a) produces both putrescine and cadaverine. the sequencing of its genome showed that the previously described ornithine decarboxylase gene was not associated with the gene encoding an ornithine/putrescine exchanger as in other bacteria. a new hypothetical decarboxylation system was detected in the proximity of the ornithine decarboxylase gene. it consisted of two genes encoding a putative decarboxylase sharing sequence similarities with ornithine decarboxylases and a putative amino acid transporter resembling the ornithine/putrescine exchangers. the two decarboxylases were produced in escherichia coli, purified, and characterized in vitro, whereas the transporter was heterologously expressed in lactococcus lactis and functionally characterized in vivo. the overall data led to the conclusion that the two decarboxylases and the transporter form a three-component decarboxylation system, with the new decarboxylase being a specific lysine decarboxylase and the transporter catalyzing both lysine/cadaverine and ornithine/putrescine exchange. to our knowledge, this is an unprecedented observation of a bacterial three-component decarboxylation system.

TI  == overexpressing 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase (hmgr) in the lactococcal mevalonate pathway for heterologous plant sesquiterpene production.
AB  == isoprenoids are a large and diverse group of metabolites with interesting properties such as flavour, fragrance and therapeutic properties. they are produced via two pathways, the mevalonate pathway or the 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (mep) pathway. while plants are the richest source of isoprenoids, they are not the most efficient producers. escherichia coli and yeasts have been extensively studied as heterologous hosts for plant isoprenoids production. in the current study, we describe the usage of the food grade lactococcus lactis as a potential heterologous host for the production of sesquiterpenes from a local herbaceous malaysian plant, persicaria minor (synonym polygonum minus). a sesquiterpene synthase gene from p. minor was successfully cloned and expressed in l. lactis. the expressed protein was identified to be a beta-sesquiphellandrene synthase as it was demonstrated to be functional in producing beta-sesquiphellandrene at 85.4% of the total sesquiterpenes produced based on in vitro enzymatic assays. the recombinant l. lactis strain developed in this study was also capable of producing beta-sesquiphellandrene in vivo without  exogenous substrates supplementation. in addition, overexpression of the strain's endogenous 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-a reductase (hmgr), an established rate-limiting enzyme in the eukaryotic mevalonate pathway, increased the production level of beta-sesquiphellandrene by 1.25-1.60 fold. the highest amount achieved was 33 nm at 2 h post-induction.

AB  == background: the microbial synthesis of fuels, commodity chemicals, and bioactive  compounds necessitates the assemblage of multiple enzyme activities to carry out  sequential chemical reactions, often via substrate channeling by means of multi-domain or multi-enzyme complexes. engineering the controlled incorporation  of enzymes in recombinant protein complexes is therefore of interest. the cellulosome of clostridium thermocellum is an extracellular enzyme complex that efficiently hydrolyzes crystalline cellulose. enzymes interact with protein scaffolds via type 1 dockerin/cohesin interactions, while scaffolds in turn bind  surface anchor proteins by means of type 2 dockerin/cohesin interactions, which demonstrate a different binding specificity than their type 1 counterparts. recombinant chimeric scaffold proteins containing cohesins of different specificity allow binding of multiple enzymes to specific sites within an engineered complex. results: we report the successful display of engineered chimeric scaffold proteins containing both type 1 and type 2 cohesins on the surface of lactococcus lactis cells. the chimeric scaffold proteins were able to  form complexes with the escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase fused to either type  1 or type 2 dockerin, and differences in binding efficiencies were correlated with scaffold architecture. we used e. coli beta-galactosidase, also fused to type 1 or type 2 dockerins, to demonstrate the targeted incorporation of two enzymes into the complexes. the simultaneous binding of enzyme pairs each containing a different dockerin resulted in bi-enzymatic complexes tethered to the cell surface. the sequential binding of the two enzymes yielded insights into parameters affecting assembly of the complex such as protein size and position within the scaffold. conclusions: the spatial organization of enzymes into complexes is an important strategy for increasing the efficiency of biochemical pathways. in this study, chimeric protein scaffolds consisting of type 1 and type 2 cohesins anchored on the surface of l. lactis allowed for the controlled positioning of dockerin-fused reporter enzymes onto the scaffolds. by binding single enzymes or enzyme pairs to the scaffolds, our data also suggest that the size and relative positions of enzymes can affect the catalytic profiles of the resulting complexes. these insights will be of great value as we engineer more advanced scaffold-guided protein complexes to optimize biochemical pathways.

TI  == the acid tolerant and cold-active beta-galactosidase from lactococcus lactis strain is an attractive biocatalyst for lactose hydrolysis.
AB  == the gene encoding the beta-galactosidase from the dairy lactococcus lactis il1403 strain was cloned, sequenced and overexpressed in escherichia coli. the purified  enzyme has a tetrameric arrangement composed of four identical 120 kda subunits.  biochemical characterization showed that it is optimally active within a wide range of temperatures from 15 to 55 degrees c and of ph from 6.0 to 7.5. for its  maximal activity this enzyme requires only 0.8 mm fe(2+) and 1.6 mm mg(2+). purified protein displayed a high catalytic efficiency of 102 s(-1) mm(-1) for lactose. the enzyme stability was increased by immobilization mainly at low ph (from 4.0 to 5.5) and high temperatures (55 and 60 degrees c). the bioconversion  of lactose using the l. lactis beta-galactosidase allows the production of lactose with a high bioconversion rate (98 %) within a wide range of ph and temperature.

TI  == the substrate specificity of the human adp/atp carrier aac1.
AB  == the mitochondrial adp/atp carrier imports adp from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix for its conversion to atp by atp synthase and exports atp out of the mitochondrion to replenish the eukaryotic cell with chemical energy. here the substrate specificity of the human mitochondrial adp/atp carrier aac1 was determined by two different approaches. in the first the protein was functionally expressed in escherichia coli membranes as a fusion protein with maltose binding protein and the effect of excess of unlabeled compounds on the uptake of [(32)p]-atp was measured. in the second approach the protein was expressed in the cytoplasmic membrane of lactococcus lactis. the uptake of [(14)c]-adp in whole cells was measured in the presence of excess of unlabeled compounds and in fused membrane vesicles loaded with unlabeled compounds to demonstrate their transport. a large number of nucleotides were tested, but only  adp and atp are suitable substrates for human aac1, demonstrating a very narrow specificity. next we tried to understand the molecular basis of this specificity  by carrying out molecular-dynamics simulations with selected nucleotides, which were placed at the entrance of the central cavity. the binding of the phosphate groups of guanine and adenine nucleotides is similar, yet there is a low probability for the base moiety to be bound, likely to be rooted in the greater polarity of guanine compared to adenine. amp is unlikely to engage fully with all contact points of the substrate binding site, suggesting that it cannot trigger translocation.

TI  == structural aspects of the interaction of dairy phages with their host bacteria.
AB  == knowledge of phage-host interactions at a fundamental level is central to the design of rational strategies for the development of phage-resistant strains that may be applied in industrial settings. phages infecting lactic acid bacteria, in  particular lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus, negatively impact on dairy fermentation processes with serious economic implications. in recent years a wealth of information on structural protein assembly and topology has become available relating to phages infecting escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and lactococcus lactis, which act as models for structural analyses of dairy phages. in this review, we explore the role of model tailed phages, such as t4 and spp1, in advancing our knowledge regarding interactions between dairy phages  and their hosts. furthermore, the potential of currently investigated dairy phages to in turn serve as model systems for this particular group of phages is discussed.

TI  == first ever isolation of bacterial prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase in single step from lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the unique bacterial enzyme phosphatidylglycerol: prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (lgt) is the least studied enzyme of the ubiquitous bacterial lipoprotein synthetic pathway, mostly due to the low abundance of the enzyme. so  far, lgt has been studied to a limited extent in gram-negative bacteria, mainly in escherichia coli. we, for the first time, report the isolation of an adequate  amount of lgt from the gram-positive lactic acid bacteria, lactococcus lactis and compare this wild-type bacterial enzyme with the e. coli enzyme. the l. lactis lgt, when purified by cationic-exchange chromatography, showed a 20-fold increase in the specific activity compared to that of the load, and 75% of the total lgt activity loaded was recovered. kinetically, l. lactis lgt was found to be similar to the e. coli enzyme with matching k(m) and v(max), whereas the specific activity of the l. lactis enzyme was about 20 times less than that of the e. coli enzyme. comparative bioinformatic analysis of l. lactis, e. coli and staphylococcus aureus lgt revealed that the conserved and catalytically important his-103 residue in e. coli lgt, was altered to tyr in l. lactis. investigations showed that other bacteria where this alteration is visible, form a diversion within the gram-positive bacteria in evolution. further analysis revealed mycobacterium smegmatis to be the species which evolved with the alteration of his to tyr.

TI  == circuit architecture explains functional similarity of bacterial heat shock responses.
AB  == heat shock response is a stress response to temperature changes and a consecutive increase in amounts of unfolded proteins. to restore homeostasis, cells upregulate chaperones facilitating protein folding by means of transcription factors (tfs). we here investigate two heat shock systems: one characteristic to  gram negative bacteria, mediated by transcriptional activator sigma(32) in e. coli, and another characteristic to gram positive bacteria, mediated by transcriptional repressor hrca in l. lactis. we construct simple mathematical models of the two systems focusing on the negative feedbacks, where free chaperones suppress sigma(32) activation in the former, while they activate hrca  repression in the latter. we demonstrate that both systems, in spite of the difference at the tf regulation level, are capable of showing very similar heat shock dynamics. we find that differences in regulation impose distinct constraints on chaperone-tf binding affinities: the binding constant of free sigma(32) to chaperone dnak, known to be in 100 nm range, set the lower limit of  amount of free chaperone that the system can sense the change at the heat shock,  while the binding affinity of hrca to chaperone groe set the upper limit and have to be rather large extending into the micromolar range.

TI  == mucosal priming of the murine immune system against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 using lactococcus lactis expressing the type iii secretion system protein espb.
AB  == enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec), particularly e. coli serotype o157:h7, has been responsible for multiple human outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome worldwide. humans become infected by direct or indirect contact with faeces of asymptomatic ehec shedding ruminants. currently there is no human or animal vaccine available against ehec infection. ehec use a type iii  secretion system (t3ss) to colonize the intestine and therefore eliciting mucosal immunity against t3ss proteins could be a potential vaccination strategy. to develop such a mucosal vaccine, espb - a significant member of the t3ss - was intracellularly expressed in lactococcus lactis (ll-espb) and this strain was used to immunize balb/c mice orally. ten days post-immunization, no specific antibody response was detected in serum or faeces of immunized mice. however, statistically significant (p<0.0001) levels of specific serum ig and faecal iga were detected after intraperitoneal boosting of the orally immunized mice with recombinant espb. our results show that oral administration of ll-espb resulted in mucosal priming of balb/c mice against the ehec t3ss protein, espb. nevertheless, an optimized espb expression in l. lactis may be required to improve the mucosal immune response.

TI  == computational codon optimization of synthetic gene for protein expression.
AB  == background: the construction of customized nucleic acid sequences allows us to have greater flexibility in gene design for recombinant protein expression. among the various parameters considered for such dna sequence design, individual codon  usage (icu) has been implicated as one of the most crucial factors affecting mrna translational efficiency. however, previous works have also reported the significant influence of codon pair usage, also known as codon context (cc), on the level of protein expression. results: in this study, we have developed novel  computational procedures for evaluating the relative importance of optimizing icu and cc for enhancing protein expression. by formulating appropriate mathematical  expressions to quantify the icu and cc fitness of a coding sequence, optimization procedures based on genetic algorithm were employed to maximize its icu and/or cc fitness. surprisingly, the in silico validation of the resultant optimized dna sequences for escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, pichia pastoris and saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests that cc is a more relevant design criterion than the commonly considered icu. conclusions: the proposed cc optimization framework can complement and enhance the capabilities of current gene design tools, with potential applications to heterologous protein production and even vaccine development in synthetic biotechnology.

TI  == crustin, a wap domain containing antimicrobial peptide from freshwater prawn macrobrachium rosenbergii: immune characterization.
AB  == crustin (mrcrs) was sequenced from a freshwater prawn macrobrachium rosenbergii.  the mrcrs protein contains a signal peptide region at n-terminus between 1 and 22 and a long whey acidic protein domain (wap domain) at c-terminus between 57 and 110 along with a wap-type 'four-disulfide core' motif. phylogenetic results show  that mrcrs is clustered together with other crustacean crustin groups. mrcrs showed high sequence similarity (77%) with crustin from pacific white shrimp litopenaeus vannamei and japanese spiny lobster panulirus japonicas. i-tasser uses the best structure templates to predict the possible structures of mrcrs along with pdb ids such as 2rela and 1flei. the gene expressions of mrcrs in both healthy m. rosenbergii and those infected with virus including infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (ihhnv) and white spot syndrome virus (wssv) and bacteria aeromonas hydrophila (gram-negative) and enterococcus faecium (gram-positive) were examined using quantitative real time pcr. to understand its biological activity, the recombinant mrcrs gene was constructed and expressed in  escherichia coli bl21 (de3). the recombinant mrcrs protein agglutinated with the  bacteria considered for analysis at a concentration of 25 mug/ml, except lactococcus lactis. the bactericidal results showed that the recombinant mrcrs protein destroyed all the bacteria after incubation, even less than 6 h. these results suggest that mrcrs is a potential antimicrobial peptide, which is involved in the defense system of m. rosenbergii against viral and bacterial infections.

TI  == airborne microorganisms from waste containers.
AB  == in physician's offices and biomedical labs, biological waste is handled every day. this waste is disposed of in waste containers designed for holding red autoclave bags. the containers used in these environments are closed hands-free containers, often with a step pedal. while these containers protect the user from surface-borne microorganisms, the containers may allow airborne microorganisms to escape via the open/close mechanism because of the air current produced upon open/close cycles. in this study, the air current was shown to be sufficient to allow airborne escape of microorganisms held in the container, including aspergillus niger. however, bacterial cultures, such as escherichia coli and lactococcus lactis did not escape. this may be due to the choice of bacterial cultures and the absence of solid waste, such as dust or other particulate matter in the waste containers, that such strains of bacteria could travel on during aerosolization. we compared these results to those obtained using a re-designed receptacle, which mimimizes air currents, and detected no escaping microorganisms. this study highlights one potential source of airborne contamination in labs, hospitals, and other environments that dispose of biological waste.

TI  == glutamate decarboxylase-dependent acid resistance in orally acquired bacteria: function, distribution and biomedical implications of the gadbc operon.
AB  == for successful colonization of the mammalian host, orally acquired bacteria must  overcome the extreme acidic stress (ph < 2.5) encountered during transit through  the host stomach. the glutamate-dependent acid resistance (gdar) system is by far the most potent acid resistance system in commensal and pathogenic escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, listeria monocytogenes and lactococcus lactis. gdar requires the activity of glutamate decarboxylase (gadb), an intracellular plp-dependent enzyme which performs a proton-consuming decarboxylation reaction,  and of the cognate antiporter (gadc), which performs the glutamatein /gamma-aminobutyrateout (gaba) electrogenic antiport. herein we review recent findings on the structural determinants responsible for ph-dependent intracellular activation of e. coli gadb and gadc. a survey of genomes of bacteria (pathogenic and non-pathogenic), having in common the ability to colonize or to transit through the host gut, shows that the gadb and gadc genes frequently lie next or near each other. this gene arrangement is likely to be important to ensure timely co-regulation of the decarboxylase and the antiporter. besides the involvement in acid resistance, gaba production and release were found to occur at very high levels in lactic acid bacteria originally isolated from traditionally fermented foods, supporting the evidence that gaba-enriched foods possess health-promoting properties.

TI  == structure-guided engineering of lactococcus lactis alcohol dehydrogenase lladha for improved conversion of isobutyraldehyde to isobutanol.

TI  == non-proteinogenic amino acids in lacticin 481 analogues result in more potent inhibition of peptidoglycan transglycosylation.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide natural products that contain the thioether structures lanthionine and methyllanthionine and exert potent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria. at present, detailed modes-of-action are only known for a small subset  of family members. lacticin 481, a tricyclic lantibiotic, contains a lipid ii binding motif present in related compounds such as mersacidin and nukacin isk-1.  here, we show that lacticin 481 inhibits pbp1b-catalyzed peptidoglycan formation. furthermore, we show that changes in potency of analogues of lacticin 481 containing non-proteinogenic amino acids correlate positively with the potency of inhibition of the transglycosylase activity of pbp1b. thus, lipid ii is the likely target of lacticin 481, and use of non-proteinogenic amino acids resulted  in stronger inhibition of the target. additionally, we demonstrate that lacticin  481 does not form pores in the membranes of susceptible bacteria, a common mode-of-action of other lantibiotics.

TI  == exploring optimization parameters to increase ssdna recombineering in lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == single-stranded dna (ssdna) recombineering is a technology which is used to make  subtle changes in the chromosome of several bacterial genera. cells which express a single-stranded dna binding protein (rect or bet) are transformed with an oligonucleotide which is incorporated via an annealing and replication-dependent  mechanism. by in silico analysis we identified ssdna binding protein homologs in  the genus lactobacillus and lactococcus lactis. to assess whether we could further improve the recombineering efficiency in lactobacillus reuteri atcc pta 6475 we expressed several rect homologs in this strain. rect derived from enterococcus faecalis crmen 19 yielded comparable efficiencies compared with a native rect protein, but none of the other proteins further increased the recombineering efficiency. we successfully improved recombineering efficiency 10-fold in l. lactis by increasing oligonucleotide concentration combined with the use of oligonucleotides containing phosphorothioate-linkages (ptos). surprisingly, neither increased oligonucleotide concentration nor pto linkages enhanced recombineering in l. reuteri 6475. to emphasize the utility of this technology in improving probiotic features we modified six bases in a transcriptional regulatory element region of the pdu-operon of l. reuteri 6475, yielding a 3-fold increase in the production of the antimicrobial compound reuterin. directed genetic modification of lactic acid bacteria through ssdna recombineering will simplify strain improvement in a way that, when mutating a single base, is genetically indistinguishable from strains obtained through directed evolution.

TI  == molecular characterization of a novel mosaic tet(s/m) gene encoding tetracycline  resistance in foodborne strains of streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the presence of antibiotic-resistance (ar) genes in foodborne bacteria of enteric origin represents a relevant threat to human health in the case of opportunistic  pathogens, which can reach the human gut through the food chain. streptococcus bovis is a human opportunistic pathogen often associated with infections in immune-compromised or cancer patients, and it can also be detected in the environment, including fermented foods. we have focused on the molecular characterization of a tetracycline (tet)-resistance gene present in 39 foodborne  isolates of s. bovis phenotypically resistant to this drug. the gene was identified as a novel tet(s/m) fusion, encoding a mosaic protein composed of the  n-terminal 33 amino acids of tet(s), in-frame with the tet(m) coding sequence. heterologous expression of the mosaic gene was found to confer tet resistance upon escherichia coli recipients. moreover, the tet(s/m) gene was found to be transcriptionally inducible by tet under the endogenous tet(s) promoter in both s. bovis and e. coli. nucleotide sequencing of the surrounding genomic region of  16.2 kb revealed large blocks of homology with the genomes of streptococcus infantarius and lactococcus lactis. a subregion of about 4 kb containing mosaic tet(s/m) was flanked by two copies of the is1216 mobile element. pcr amplification with primers directed outwards from the tet(s/m) gene identified the presence of a 4.3 kb circular form corresponding to the intervening chromosomal region between the two is1216 elements, but lacking a replication origin. the circular element shared extensive overall homology with a region of the multidrug-resistance plasmid pk214 from lc. lactis, containing tet(s), as well as the is1216 transposase-containing element and intervening non-coding sequences. linear reconstruction of the insertion events likely to have occurred  within this genomic region, inferred from sequence homology, provides further evidence of the chromosomal rearrangements that drive genomic evolution in complex bacterial communities such as the gut and food microbiota.

AB  == background: bacillus subtilis is a favorable host for the production of industrially relevant proteins because of its capacity of secreting proteins into the medium to high levels, its gras (generally recognized as safe) status, its genetic accessibility and its capacity to grow in large fermentations. however, production of heterologous proteins still faces limitations. results: this study  aimed at the identification of bottlenecks in secretory protein production by analyzing the response of b. subtilis at the transcriptome level to overproduction of eight secretory proteins of endogenous and heterologous origin  and with different subcellular or extracellular destination: secreted proteins (npre and xyna of b. subtilis, usp45 of lactococcus lactis, tem-1 beta-lactamase  of escherichia coli), membrane proteins (lmra of l. lactis and xylp of lactobacillus pentosus) and lipoproteins (mnta and ycdh of b. subtilis). responses specific for proteins with a common localization as well as more general stress responses were observed. the latter include upregulation of genes  encoding intracellular stress proteins (groes/el, ctsr regulated genes). specific responses include upregulation of the liaihgfsr operon under usp45 and tem-1 beta-lactamase overproduction; cssrs, htra and htrb under all secreted proteins overproduction; sigw and sigw-regulated genes mainly under membrane proteins overproduction; and ykrl (encoding an htpx homologue) specifically under membrane proteins overproduction. conclusions: the results give better insights into b. subtilis responses to protein overproduction stress and provide potential targets for genetic engineering in order to further improve b. subtilis as a protein production host.

AB  == the bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria have considerable potential for biopreservation. the lactococcus lactis strain psy2 (genbank account no. jf703669) isolated from the surface of marine perch perca flavescens produced antibacterial activity against pathogenic and spoilage-causing gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria viz. arthrobacter sp., acinetobacter sp., bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and possessed broad inhibitory spectrum. the biopreservative efficacy of the bacteriocin psy2 was evaluated using fillets of reef cod, epinephelus diacanthus. the fillets (10 g) were sprayed with 2.0 ml of  1,600 au/ml bacteriocin, wrapped and kept under different storage temperatures viz., 4, 0 and -18 degrees c. the biopreservative extended the shelf-life of fillets stored at 4 degrees c to >21 days as against <14 days observed in the untreated samples. the total count of spoilage bacteria was reduced by 2.5 logarithmic units in the treated sample during the 14th day of storage as against the control. chemical analysis revealed a significant change (p < 0.05) in the ph value, free fatty acid (as % oleic acid), total volatile base nitrogen and total  methyl amine content in the treated samples. the overall acceptability in terms of sensory attributes was significantly higher in the bacteriocin-treated samples stored for 21 days at 4 degrees c while the untreated samples became unacceptable by the 14th day. the biopreservative gave no significant effect at -18 degrees c. thus, the bacteriocin derived from l. lactis psy2 gave increased protection against spoilage bacteria and offers an alternative for the preservation of high-value sea foods.

TI  == recent advances in engineering the central carbon metabolism of industrially important bacteria.
AB  == this paper gives an overview of the recent advances in engineering the central carbon metabolism of the industrially important bacteria escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, corynobacterium glutamicum, streptomyces spp., lactococcus lactis and other lactic acid bacteria. all of them are established producers of important classes of products, e.g. proteins, amino acids, organic acids, antibiotics, high-value metabolites for the food industry and also, promising producers of a large number of industrially or therapeutically important chemicals. optimization of existing or introduction of new cellular processes in  these microorganisms is often achieved through manipulation of targets that reside at major points of central metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic acid cycle with the glyoxylate shunt. based on the huge progress made in recent years in biochemical, genetic and regulatory studies, new fascinating engineering approaches aim at ensuring an optimal carbon and energy flow within central metabolism in order to achieve optimized metabolite production.

TI  == expression and purification of lacticin q by small ubiquitin-related modifier fusion in escherichia coli.
AB  == lacticin q is a broad-spectrum class ii bacteriocin with potential as an alternative to conventional antibiotics. the objective of this study was to produce recombinant lacticin q using a small ubiquitin-related modifier (sumo) fusion protein expression system. the 168-bp lacticin q gene was cloned into the  expression vector pet sumo and transformed into escherichia coli bl21(de3). the soluble fusion protein was recovered with a ni-nta sepharose column (95% purity); 130 mg protein was obtained per liter of fermentation culture. the sumo tag was then proteolytically cleaved from the protein, which was re-applied to the column. finally, about 32 mg lacticin q (>/=96% purity) was obtained. the recombinant protein exhibited antimicrobial properties similar to that of the native protein, demonstrating that lacticin q had been successfully expressed by  the sumo fusion system.

TI  == redox balance is key to explaining full vs. partial switching to low-yield metabolism.
AB  == background: low-yield metabolism is a puzzling phenomenon in many unicellular and multicellular organisms. in abundance of glucose, many cells use a highly wasteful fermentation pathway despite the availability of a high-yield pathway, producing many atp molecules per glucose, e.g., oxidative phosphorylation. some of these organisms, including the lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis, downregulate their high-yield pathway in favor of the low-yield pathway. other organisms, including escherichia coli do not reduce the flux through the high-yield pathway, employing the low-yield pathway in parallel with a fully active high-yield pathway. for what reasons do some species use the high-yield and low-yield pathways concurrently and what makes others downregulate the high-yield pathway? a classic rationale for metabolic fermentation is overflow metabolism. because the throughput of metabolic pathways is limited, influx of glucose exceeding the pathway's throughput capacity is thought to be redirected into an alternative, low-yield pathway. this overflow metabolism rationale suggests that cells would only use fermentation once the high-yield pathway runs  at maximum rate, but it cannot explain why cells would decrease the flux through  the high-yield pathway. results: using flux balance analysis with molecular crowding (fbawmc), a recent extension to flux balance analysis (fba) that assumes that the total flux through the metabolic network is limited, we investigate the  differences between saccharomyces cerevisiae and l. lactis that downregulate the  high-yield pathway at increasing glucose concentrations, and e. coli, which keeps the high-yield pathway functioning at maximal rate. fbawmc correctly predicts the metabolic switching mode in these three organisms, suggesting that metabolic network architecture is responsible for differences in metabolic switching mode.  based on our analysis, we expect gradual, "overflow-like" switching behavior in organisms that have an additional energy-yielding pathway that does not consume nadh (e.g., acetate production in e. coli). flux decrease through the high-yield  pathway is expected in organisms in which the high-yield and low-yield pathways compete for nadh. in support of this analysis, a simplified model of metabolic switching suggests that the extra energy generated during acetate production produces an additional optimal growth mode that smoothens the metabolic switch in e. coli. conclusions: maintaining redox balance is key to explaining why some microbes decrease the flux through the high-yield pathway, while other microbes use "overflow-like" low-yield metabolism.

TI  == co-evolution of segregation guide dna motifs and the ftsk translocase in bacteria: identification of the atypical lactococcus lactis kops motif.
AB  == bacteria use the global bipolarization of their chromosomes into replichores to control the dynamics and segregation of their genome during the cell cycle. this  involves the control of protein activities by recognition of specific short dna motifs whose orientation along the chromosome is highly skewed. the kops motifs act in chromosome segregation by orienting the activity of the ftsk dna translocase towards the terminal replichore junction. kops motifs have been identified in gamma-proteobacteria and in bacillus subtilis as closely related g-rich octamers. we have identified the kops motif of lactococcus lactis, a model bacteria of the streptococcaceae family harbouring a compact and low gc% genome.  this motif, 5'-gaagaag-3, was predicted in silico using the occurrence and skew characteristics of known kops motifs. we show that it is specifically recognized  by l. lactis ftsk in vitro and controls its activity in vivo. l. lactis kops is thus an a-rich heptamer motif. our results show that kops-controlled chromosome segregation is conserved in streptococcaceae but that kops may show important variation in sequence and length between bacterial families. this suggests that ftsk adapts to its host genome by selecting motifs with convenient occurrence frequencies and orientation skews to orient its activity.

TI  == heterologous expression and characterization of an n-acetyl-beta-d-hexosaminidase from lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis il1403.
AB  == the lnba gene of lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis il1403 encodes a polypeptide with similarity to lacto-n-biosidases and n-acetyl-beta-d-hexosaminidases. the gene was cloned into the expression vector pet-21d and overexpressed in escherichia coli bl21* (de3). the recombinant purified enzyme (lnba) was a monomer with a molecular weight of approximately 37 kda. studies with chromogenic substrates including p-nitrophenyl n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosamine (pnp-glcnac) and p-nitrophenyl n-acetyl-beta-d-galactosamine (pnp-galnac) showed that the enzyme had both n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and n-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase activity, thus indicating that the enzyme is an n-acetyl-beta-d-hexosaminidase. k(m) and k(cat) for pnp-glcnac were 2.56 mm and 26.7 s(-1), respectively, whereas kinetic parameters for pnp-galnac could not be determined due to the k(m) being very high (>10 mm). the optimal temperature and ph of the enzyme were 37 degrees  c and 5.5, respectively, for both substrates. the half-life of activity at 37 degrees c and ph 6.0 was 53 h, but activity was completely abolished after 30 min at 50 degrees c, meaning that the enzyme has relatively low temperature stability. the enzyme was stable in the ph 5.5-8 range and was unstable at ph below 5.5. studies with natural substrates showed hydrolytic activity on chito-oligosaccharides but not on colloidal chitin or chitosan. transglycosylation products were not detected. in all, the data suggest that lnba's role may be to degrade chito-oligosaccharides that are produced by the previously described chitinolytic system of l. lactis.

TI  == high efficiency recombineering in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the ability to efficiently generate targeted point mutations in the chromosome without the need for antibiotics, or other means of selection, is a powerful strategy for genome engineering. although oligonucleotide-mediated recombineering (ssdna recombineering) has been utilized in escherichia coli for over a decade, the successful adaptation of ssdna recombineering to gram-positive bacteria has not been reported. here we describe the development and application of ssdna recombineering in lactic acid bacteria. mutations were incorporated in the chromosome of lactobacillus reuteri and lactococcus lactis without selection at frequencies ranging between 0.4% and 19%. whole genome sequence analysis showed that ssdna recombineering is specific and not hypermutagenic. to highlight the utility of ssdna recombineering we reduced the intrinsic vancomymycin resistance  of l. reuteri >100-fold. by creating a single amino acid change in the d-ala-d-ala ligase enzyme we reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration for vancomycin from >256 to 1.5 microg/ml, well below the clinically relevant minimum inhibitory concentration. recombineering thus allows high efficiency mutagenesis  in lactobacilli and lactococci, and may be used to further enhance beneficial properties and safety of strains used in medicine and industry. we expect that this work will serve as a blueprint for the adaptation of ssdna recombineering to other gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == autoregulation of the synthesis of the mobm relaxase encoded by the promiscuous plasmid pmv158.
AB  == the streptococcal promiscuous plasmid pmv158 (5,540 bp) replicates by the rolling-circle mechanism and can be mobilized among a wide number of gram-positive and -negative bacteria. the plasmid region involved in its conjugative transfer includes the mobm gene, which encodes the mobm relaxase, and the cis-acting origin of transfer (orit). mobm initiates transfer by cleavage of  supercoiled pmv158 dna at a specific dinucleotide within orit. in the present work, we have performed a detailed transcriptional analysis to assess the role of mobm in the control of its own gene expression. by in vivo and in vitro approaches, we demonstrated that mobm transcription in escherichia coli was mostly initiated from a promoter (pmob2) different from the one (pmob1) used in lactococcus lactis. whereas promoter pmob1 was embedded within the orit sequence, promoter pmob2 was placed apart from but adjacent to orit. further, mobm was able to repress the expression of its own gene from both promoters. given the promiscuity of pmv158, the organization of the mobm promoter region suggests a strategy of the plasmid to cope with different transcription machineries of the hosts it colonizes.

TI  == lactococcus lactis hemw (hemn) is a haem-binding protein with a putative role in  haem trafficking.
AB  == lactococcus lactis cannot synthesize haem, but when supplied with haem, expresses a cytochrome bd oxidase. apart from the cydab structural genes for this oxidase,  l. lactis features two additional genes, hemh and hemw (hemn), with conjectured functions in haem metabolism. while it appears clear that hemh encodes a ferrochelatase, no function is known for hemw. hemw-like proteins occur in bacteria, plants and animals, and are usually annotated as cpdhs (coproporphyrinogen iii dehydrogenases). however, such a function has never been  demonstrated for a hemw-like protein. we here studied hemw of l. lactis and showed that it is devoid of cpdh activity in vivo and in vitro. recombinantly produced, purified hemw contained an fe-s (iron-sulfur) cluster and was dimeric;  upon loss of the iron, the protein became monomeric. both forms of the protein covalently bound haem b in vitro, with a stoichiometry of one haem per monomer and a kd of 8 mum. in vivo, hemw occurred as a haem-free cytosolic form, as well  as a haem-containing membrane-associated form. addition of l. lactis membranes to haem-containing hemw triggered the release of haem from hemw in vitro. on the basis of these findings, we propose a role of hemw in haem trafficking. hemw-like proteins form a distinct phylogenetic clade that has not previously been recognized.

AB  == the pcb42 plasmid from leuconostoc citreum cb2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (lab) was constructed. the pcb42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low g+c content, and no single-stranded dna intermediates during replication, which indicates that pcb42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. in silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 dna-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. the fragment encompassing orf5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. this plasmid was capable of replicating in various lab, including l. citreum, l.  mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, lb. reuteri, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, weissella confusa, and oenococcus oeni. the lab-e. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pcb42 and pek104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pleucm42, showed a high segregational stability in l. citreum cb2567 after 100 generations of cell division. by using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, l. citreum cb2567. the pleucm42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering  of various strains of lab.

TI  == vaccines displaying mycobacterial proteins on biopolyester beads stimulate cellular immunity and induce protection against tuberculosis.
AB  == new improved vaccines are needed for control of both bovine and human tuberculosis. tuberculosis protein vaccines have advantages with regard to safety and ease of manufacture, but efficacy against tuberculosis has been difficult to  achieve. protective cellular immune responses can be preferentially induced when  antigens are displayed on small particles. in this study, escherichia coli and lactococcus lactis were engineered to produce spherical polyhydroxybutyrate (phb) inclusions which displayed a fusion protein of mycobacterium tuberculosis, antigen 85a (ag85a)-early secreted antigenic target 6-kda protein (esat-6). l. lactis was chosen as a possible production host due its extensive use in the food industry and reduced risk of lipopolysaccharide contamination. mice were vaccinated with phb bead vaccines with or without displaying ag85a-esat-6, recombinant ag85a-esat-6, or m. bovis bcg. separate groups of mice were used to measure immune responses and assess protection against an aerosol m. bovis challenge. increased amounts of antigen-specific gamma interferon, interleukin-17a (il-17a), il-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were produced from splenocytes postvaccination, but no or minimal il-4, il-5, or il-10 was produced, indicating th1- and th17-biased t cell responses. decreased lung bacterial counts and less extensive foci of inflammation were observed in lungs of mice receiving bcg or phb bead vaccines displaying ag85a-esat-6 produced in either e. coli or l. lactis compared to those observed in the lungs of phosphate-buffered saline-treated control mice. no differences between those receiving wild-type phb beads and those receiving recombinant ag85a-esat-6 were observed. this versatile particulate vaccine delivery system incorporates a relatively simple production process using safe bacteria, and the results show that it is an effective delivery system for a tuberculosis protein vaccine.

AB  == the lysin gene (lysa2) of the lactobacillus casei bacteriophage a2 was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. lysa2 is an endopeptidase that hydrolyzes the bond between the terminal d: -alanine of the peptidoglycan tetrapeptide and the aspartic acid residue that forms the bridge with the l: -lysine of a neighboring  peptidoglycan chain, characteristic of gram-positive bacteria included into the a4 peptidoglycan subgroup. this includes most lactobacilli, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus acidilactici, and pediococcus pentosaceus, the walls of all of which  were substrates for the enzyme. specific binding of lysa2 to the wall of these bacteria is mediated by its c-terminal moiety, does not need the n-terminal catalytic domain for recognition, and is stable: at least 88% of the molecules were still bound to l. casei after 3 days in phosphate buffer at 4 degrees c. the enzyme acts as a monomer, is active at ph values between 4 and 6, and at temperatures ranging between 18 degrees c and 50 degrees c while being independent of divalent cation addition. the enzyme showed strong resistance to incubation at high and low ph values but became progressively inactivated at 50 degrees c and above. lysa2 is bactericidal, the viability of l. casei cultures dropping to 1% in 10 min, under the standard conditions used for the enzymatic assay.

TI  == cystathionine beta-synthase (cbs) domains 1 and 2 fulfill different roles in ionic strength sensing of the atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter opua.
AB  == the cystathionine beta-synthase module of opua in conjunction with an anionic membrane surface acts as a sensor of internal ionic strength, which allows the protein to respond to osmotic stress. we now show by chemical modification and cross-linking studies that cbs2-cbs2 interface residues are critical for transport activity and/or ionic regulation of transport, whereas cbs1 serves no functional role. we establish that cys residues in cbs1, cbs2, and the nucleotide-binding domain are more accessible for cross-linking at high than low  ionic strength, indicating that these domains undergo conformational changes when transiting between the active and inactive state. structural analyses suggest that the cystathionine beta-synthase module is largely unstructured. moreover, we could substitute cbs1 by a linker and preserve ionic regulation of transport. these data suggest that cbs1 serves as a linker and the structured cbs2-cbs2 interface forms a hinge point for ionic strength-dependent rearrangements that are transmitted to the nucleotide-binding domain and thereby affect translocation activity.

AB  == we have previously reported in vivo biosynthesis of polylactic acid (pla) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [p(3hb-co-la)] employing metabolically engineered escherichia coli strains by the introduction of evolved clostridium propionicum propionyl-coa transferase (pct(cp)) and pseudomonas sp. mbel 6-19 polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthase 1 (phac1(ps6-19)). using this in vivo pla biosynthesis system, we presently report the biosynthesis of phas containing 2-hydroxybutyrate (2hb) monomer by direct fermentation of a metabolically engineered e. coli strain. the recombinant e. coli ldha mutant xldh strain expressing phac1( ps6-19) and pct(cp) was developed and cultured in a chemically  defined medium containing 20 g/l of glucose and varying concentrations of 2hb and 3hb. phas consisting of 2hb, 3hb, and a small fraction of lactate were synthesized. their monomer compositions were dependent on the concentrations of 2hb and 3hb added to the culture medium. even though the ldha gene was completely deleted in the chromosome of e. coli, up to 6 mol% of lactate was found to be incorporated into the polymer depending on the culture condition. in order to synthesize phas containing 2hb monomer without feeding 2hb into the culture medium, a heterologous metabolic pathway for the generation of 2hb from glucose was constructed via the citramalate pathway, in which 2-ketobutyrate is synthesized directly from pyruvate and acetyl-coa. introduction of the lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 2hb dehydrogenase gene (pane) into e. coli allowed in vivo conversion of 2-ketobutyrate to 2hb. the metabolically engineered e. coli xldh strain expressing the phac1437, pct540, cima3.7, and leubcd genes together with the l. lactis il1403 pane gene successfully produced phas consisting of 2hb, 3hb, and a small fraction of lactate by varying the 3hb concentration in the culture medium. as the 3hb concentration in the medium increased the 3hb monomer fraction in the polymer, the polymer content increased. when ralstonia eutropha phaab genes were additionally expressed in this recombinant e. coli xldh strain, p(2hb-co-3hb-co-la) having small amounts of 2hb  and la monomers could also be produced from glucose as a sole carbon source. the  metabolic engineering strategy reported here should be useful for the production  of phas containing 2hb monomer.

AB  == biochemical and biophysical characterization of cftr (the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is thwarted by difficulties to obtain sufficient quantities of correctly folded and functional protein. here we have produced human cftr in the prokaryotic expression host lactococcus lactis. the full-length protein was detected in the membrane of the bacterium, but the yields were too low (< 0.1% of membrane proteins) for in vitro functional and structural characterization, and induction of the expression of cftr resulted in growth arrest. we used isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation based quantitative proteomics to find out why production of cftr in l. lactis was problematic. protein abundances in membrane and soluble fractions were monitored  as a function of induction time, both in cftr expression cells and in control cells that did not express cftr. eight hundred and forty six proteins were identified and quantified (35% of the predicted proteome), including 163 integral membrane proteins. expression of cftr resulted in an increase in abundance of stress-related proteins (e.g. heat-shock and cell envelope stress), indicating the presence of misfolded proteins in the membrane. in contrast to the reported consequences of membrane protein overexpression in escherichia coli, there were no indications that the membrane protein insertion machinery (sec) became overloaded upon cftr production in l. lactis. nutrients and atp became limiting in the control cells as the culture entered the late exponential and stationary growth phases but this did not happen in the cftr expressing cells, which had stopped growing upon induction. the different stress responses elicited in e. coli and l. lactis upon membrane protein production indicate that different strategies are needed to overcome low expression yields and toxicity.

TI  == succinate production from sucrose by metabolic engineered escherichia coli strains under aerobic conditions.
AB  == two metabolically engineered e. coli strains hl2765k and hl27659k, while capable  of producing succinate from glucose with high yields, are not able to grow and produce succinate on sucrose. consequently, the pur400 plasmid containing scrk, y, a, b, and r genes was introduced into hl2765k and hl27659k, respectively. shake flask culture studies showed that the resulting strains can utilize sucrose; the strain hl2765k pur400 and hl27659k pur400 can produce succinate aerobically with a molar yield of 0.78 +/- 0.02 mol/mol and 1.35 +/- 0.13 mol/mol, respectively. on introduction of the plasmid phl413, which encodes the heterologous pyruvate carboxylase (pyc) from lactococcus lactis, the molar succinate yield increased to 1.60 +/- 0.01 mol of succinate per mole of sucrose by the hl2765k pur400 phl413 strain and to 1.84 +/- 0.10 by the hl27659k pur400 phl413 strain. in aerobic batch bioreactor studies, the succinate production rate was faster, and succinate production reached 101.83 mm with a yield of 1.90 when  dissolved oxygen (do) was controlled at 40 +/- 7%. in addition, the results showed that do had an important effect on succinate production by influencing pyc activity. this work demonstrates the possibility of producing succinate aerobically using sucrose as the carbon source.

TI  == heterologous pyc gene expression under various natural and engineered promoters in escherichia coli for improved succinate production.
AB  == in this study, the expression level of the pyc gene from lactococcus lactis was fine tuned to improve succinate production in escherichia coli sbs550mg. iptg induction in the cultures of sbs550mg with phl413, a positive control plasmid previously constructed (sanchez et al., 2005), gave drastically decreased pyc activity and succinate yield. we constructed several plasmids for the expression  of pyc to change copy number and variant promoters. among the constructs, as compared to phl413, the pyc activity dropped significantly with the plac, ptac, ptrc or native ppyc promoters in medium or high copy vectors, which resulted in a decrease in succinate yield. three constructs pthio12, phl413-km, and phl413-km(laciq-)n showed considerable pyc activity and improved succinate production in e. coli sbs550mg. the native ppyc promoter was also modified in order to vary pyc expression levels by site-directed mutagenesis of the -10, -35, -44 regions, and the spacer regions between -10 to -35 and -35 to -44 regions. out of 9 native promoter variants, the miii variant resulted in a 20% increase in pyc activity, and improved succinate yield in sbs550mg. we also determined the copy number and stability of phl413 and phl413-km. the two plasmids showed roughly the same copy number, but the phl413-km plasmid was relatively more stable. this study provides more understanding of the plasmid characteristics and fine tuning of the expression level of pyc for optimization of the succinate production processes.

TI  == short communication: characterization of microflora in mexican chihuahua cheese.
AB  == this work was performed to identify the bacterial species present in 10 chihuahua cheeses obtained from commercial producers in mexico using 16s rrna gene analysis. as expected, some of the agar media initially used for isolation were not very selective, supporting the growth of several unrelated bacterial species. sequence analysis identified potential pathogens, including escherichia coli and  staphylococcus aureus, in all raw milk samples and 2 pasteurized milk samples. streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis were identified in  9 and 6 samples, respectively, and would serve as acidifying agents during cheese production. lactobacilli were identified in all cheeses, with the most prevalent  being lactobacillus plantarum identified in 7 raw milk and 1 pasteurized milk cheeses. leuconostoc mesenteroides and streptococcus macedonicus were identified  in 4 raw milk cheeses and both were present in all pasteurized milk samples, suggesting that they may play a role in the development of traditional chihuahua  cheese attributes.

TI  == typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr to assess genetic diversity.
AB  == the recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. the current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified dna, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. we have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis, escherichia coli, streptococcus thermophilus, bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. initially, purified dna and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. the conditions that were found to be optimal 8 mum of 10-mer primers, 3 mum magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. the rapd genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) pfu ml(-1) were highly reproducible. clustering by the pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar dna restriction pattern were indistinguishable. the results support the use of rapd-pcr for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of  their genetic diversity bypassing tedious dna purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.

TI  == culture conditions' impact on succinate production by a high succinate producing  escherichia coli strain.
AB  == this work aimed to identify the key operational factors that significantly affect succinate production by the high succinate producing escherichia coli strain sbs550mg (phl413), which bears mutations inactivating genes adhe ldha iclr ackpta::cm(r) and overexpresses the pyruvate carboxylase from lactococcus lactis. the considered factors included glucose concentration, cell density, co(2) concentration in the gas stream, ph, and temperature. the results showed that high glucose concentrations inhibited succinate production and that there is a compromise between the total succinate productivity and succinate specific productivity, where the total productivity increased with the increase in cell density and the specific productivity decreased with cell density, probably due to mass transfer limitation. on the other hand, a co(2) concentration of 100% in  the gas stream showed the highest specific succinate productivity, probably by favoring pyruvate carboxylation, increasing the oaa pool that later is converted  into succinate. a full factorial design of experiments was applied to analyze the ph and temperature effects on succinate production in batch bioreactors, where succinate yield was not significantly affected by either temperature (37 to 43 degrees c) or ph (6.5 to 7.5). additionally, the temperature effect on succinate  productivity and titer was not significant, in the range tested. on the other hand, a ph of 6.5 showed very low productivity, whereas ph values of 7.0 and 7.5  resulted in significantly higher specific productivities and higher titers. the increase on ph value from 7.0 to 7.5 did not show significant improvement. then,  ph 7.0 should be chosen because it involves a lower cost in base addition.

TI  == influence of detergents on the activity of the abc transporter lmra.
AB  == the abc transporter lmra from lactococcus lactis has been intensively studied and a role in multidrug resistance was proposed. here, we performed a comprehensive detergent screen to analyze the impact of detergents for a successful solubilization, purification and retention of functional properties of this abc transporter. our screen revealed the preference of lmra for zwitterionic detergents. in detergent solution, lmra purified with fc-16 was highly active with respect to atpase activity, which could be stimulated by a substrate (rhodamine 123) of lmra. both, high atpase activity and substrate stimulation were not detected for lmra solubilized in ddm. interestingly, reconstituted lmra  showed an opposite behavior, with a high basal atpase activity and stimulation by rhodamine 123 for a ddm-reconstituted, but only low atpase activity and no substrate stimulation for a fc-16 reconstituted sample.

TI  == unraveling lactococcal phage baseplate assembly by mass spectrometry.
AB  == bacteriophages belonging to the caudovirales order possess a tail acting as a molecular machine used during infection to recognize the host and ensure high-efficiency genome delivery to the cell cytoplasm. they bear a large and sophisticated multiprotein organelle at their distal tail end, either a baseplate or a tail-tip, which is the control center for infectivity. we report here insights into the baseplate assembly pathways of two lactoccocal phages (p2 and tp901-1) using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. based on our "block cloning" strategy we have expressed large complexes of their baseplates as well as several significant structural subcomplexes. previous biophysical characterization using size-exclusion chromatography coupled with on-line light scattering and refractometry demonstrated that the overproduced recombinant proteins interact with each other to form large (up to 1.9 mda) and stable assemblies. the structures of several of these complexes have been determined by  x-ray diffraction or by electron microscopy. in this contribution, we demonstrate that electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry yields accurate mass measurements  for the different baseplate complexes studied from which their stoichiometries can be discerned, and that the subspecies observed in the spectra provide valuable information on the assembly mechanisms of these large organelles.

AB  == seventy-six lactococci isolates from 2 protected designation of origin (pdo) cheeses were studied for their acidification ability, proteolytic activity, and inhibitory activities as well as their intraspecies characterization by randomly  amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr). fifty-two of them were characterized as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by the sds-page of whole-cell proteins. the test strains increased the amount of acid in milk from 6 to 24 h as well as the quantities of amino acids on incubation for 4 d. the majority of the isolates degraded preferentially alphas-casein. the isolates from feta differed from those of graviera kritis in respect of beta-casein degradation. this fragment was either not degraded or underwent a small degradation by lactococci from feta. a stronger intensity of acidification for the isolates from feta and a higher casein breakdown ability for those from graviera kritis were also recorded. lactococci from feta and graviera kritis inhibited, preferentially, the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7, and yersinia enterocolitica, respectively. a high heterogeneity among the isolates according to rapd-pcr was determined, as well as grouping of the isolates according to their source of isolation. selected isolates from each cheese could be used as starters to make either feta or graviera kritis.

AB  == the importance of environment in immune response is identified and the increase in prevalence of allergic, autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases reviewed. in particular, altered opportunity to acquire evolutionarily anticipated commensal microbiota is associated through the "hygiene hypothesis" with defective developmental and response signals to the innate and adaptive immune systems. evidence of the detrimental effects of such environments is reviewed as  is evidence for remediation using controlled exposure to bacteria or their active components such as lps or peptidoglycan ligands for tlr and nod-like receptors. occurrence of major environmentally associated changes in porcine immune response phenotype are described. the prophylactic effects of heat-killed escherichia coli given intramuscularly or of oral lactococcus lactis on experimental ovomucoid-induced allergy in piglets are described in the context of altered immune response bias favouring reduced type-2 phenotypes. the high frequency of clinical tolerance to developing allergic signs even in the face of classical sensitization indicates possible function in this pig model of regulatory effectors such as treg cells.

TI  == corynebacterium glutamicum tailored for efficient isobutanol production.
AB  == we recently engineered corynebacterium glutamicum for aerobic production of 2-ketoisovalerate by inactivation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, pyruvate:quinone oxidoreductase, transaminase b, and additional overexpression of the ilvbncd genes, encoding acetohydroxyacid synthase, acetohydroxyacid isomeroreductase, and dihydroxyacid dehydratase. based on this strain, we engineered c. glutamicum for the production of isobutanol from glucose under oxygen deprivation conditions by inactivation of l-lactate and malate dehydrogenases, implementation of ketoacid decarboxylase from lactococcus lactis, alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (adh2) from saccharomyces cerevisiae, and expression of the pntab transhydrogenase genes from escherichia coli. the resulting strain produced isobutanol with a substrate-specific yield (y(p/s)) of 0.60 +/- 0.02 mol per mol of glucose. interestingly, a chromosomally encoded alcohol dehydrogenase  rather than the plasmid-encoded adh2 from s. cerevisiae was involved in isobutanol formation with c. glutamicum, and overexpression of the corresponding  adha gene increased the y(p/s) to 0.77 +/- 0.01 mol of isobutanol per mol of glucose. inactivation of the malic enzyme significantly reduced the y(p/s), indicating that the metabolic cycle consisting of pyruvate and/or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, malate dehydrogenase, and malic enzyme is responsible for the conversion of nadh + h+ to nadph + h+. in fed-batch fermentations with an aerobic growth phase and an oxygen-depleted production phase, the most promising strain, c. glutamicum deltaacee deltapqo deltailve deltaldha deltamdh(pjc4ilvbncd-pntab)(pbb1kivd-adha), produced about 175 mm isobutanol, with a volumetric productivity of 4.4 mm h(-)(1), and showed an overall y(p/s) of about 0.48 mol per mol of glucose in the production phase.

TI  == succinate production from different carbon sources under anaerobic conditions by  metabolic engineered escherichia coli strains.
AB  == succinic acid has drawn much interest as a precursor of many industrially important chemicals. using a variety of feedstocks for the bio-production of succinic acid would be economically beneficial to future industrial processes. escherichia coli sbs550mg is able to grow on both glucose and fructose, but not on sucrose. therefore, we derived a sbs550mg strain bearing both the phl413 plasmid, which contains lactococcus lactis pyca gene, and the pur400 plasmid, which contains the scrk, y, a, b, and r genes for sucrose uptake and catalyzation. succinic acid production by this modified strain and the sbs550phl413 strain was tested on fructose, sucrose, a mixture of glucose and fructose, a mixture of glucose, fructose and sucrose, and sucrose hydrolysis solution. the modified strain can produce succinic acid efficiently from all combinations of different carbon sources tested with minimal byproduct formation  and with high molar succinate yields close to that of the maximum theoretic values. the molar succinic acid yield from fructose was the highest among the carbon sources tested. using the mixture of glucose and fructose as the carbon source resulted in slightly lower yields and much higher productivity than using  fructose alone. fermenting sucrose mixed with fructose and glucose gave a 1.76-fold higher productivity than that when sucrose was used as the sole carbon  source. using sucrose pretreated with sulfuric acid as carbon source resulted in  a similar succinic acid yield and productivity as that when using the mixture of  sucrose, fructose, and glucose. the results of the effect of agitation rate in aerobic phase on succinate production showed that supplying large amount of oxygen in aerobic phase resulted in higher productions of formate and acetate, and therefore lower succinate yield. this study suggests that fructose, sucrose,  mixture of glucose and fructose, mixture of glucose, fructose and sucrose, or sucrose hydrolysis solution could be used for the economical and efficient production of succinic acid by our metabolic engineered e. coli strain.

AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni,  listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the  inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.

TI  == lactococcal phage p2 orf35-sak3 is an atpase involved in dna recombination and abik mechanism.
AB  == virulent phages of the siphoviridae family are responsible for milk fermentation  failures worldwide. here, we report the characterization of the product of the early expressed gene orf35 from lactococcus lactis phage p2 (936 group). orf35(p2), also named sak3, is involved in the sensitivity of phage p2 to the antiviral abortive infection mechanism abik. the localization of its gene upstream of a gene coding for a single-strand binding protein as well as its membership to a superfamily of single-strand annealing proteins (ssaps) suggested a possible role in homologous recombination. electron microscopy showed that purified orf35(p2) form a hexameric ring-like structure that is often found in proteins with a conserved reca nucleotide-binding core. gel shift assays and surface plasmon resonance data demonstrated that orf35(p2) interacts preferentially with single-stranded dna with nanomolar affinity. atomic force microscopy showed also that it preferentially binds to sticky dna substrates over blunt ends. in addition, in vitro assays demonstrated that orf35(p2) is able to anneal complementary strands. sak3 also stimulates escherichia coli reca-mediated homologous recombination. remarkably, sak3 was shown to possess an atpase activity that is required for reca stimulation. collectively, our results demonstrate that orf35(p2) is a novel ssap stimulating homologous recombination.

AB  == pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylases are produced as proenzymes that mature by cleavage followed by formation of the pyruvoyl prosthetic group. the histidine decarboxylation pathway of streptococcus thermophilus chcc1524 that consists of the pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase hdca and the histidine/histamine exchanger hdcp was functionally expressed in lactococcus lactis. the operon encoding the pathway contains in addition to the hdca and hdcp genes a third gene hdcb. expression of different combinations of the genes in l.  lactis and escherichia coli followed by analysis of the protein products demonstrated the involvement of hdcb in the cleavage of the hdca proenzyme. the hdca proenzyme and hdcb protein were purified to homogeneity and cleavage and activation of the histidine decarboxylase activity was demonstrated in vitro. substoichiometric amounts of hdcb were required to cleave hdca showing that hdcb  functions as an enzyme. in agreement, expression levels of hdcb in the cells were low relative to those of hdca. the turnover number of hdcb in vitro was extremely low (0.05 min(-)(1)) which was due to a very slow association/dissociation of the enzyme/substrate complex. in fact, hdcb was shown to co-purify both with the hdca s82a mutant that mimics the proenzyme and with the mature hdca complex.

TI  == expression of lactobacillus reuteri pg4 collagen-binding protein gene in lactobacillus casei atcc 393 increases its adhesion ability to caco-2 cells.
AB  == the collagen-binding protein gene cnb was cloned from the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri strain pg4. the dna sequence of the cnb gene (792 bp) has an open reading frame encoding 263 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 28.5 kda. the cnb gene was constructed so as to constitutively express under the control of the lactococcus lactis laca promoter and was transformed into lactobacillus casei atcc 393, a strain isolated from dairy products with poor ability to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells. confocal immunofluorescence microscopic and flow cytometric analysis of the transformed strain lb. casei pnz-cnb indicated that cnb was displayed on its cell surface. lb. casei pnz-cnb not only showed a higher ability to adhere to caco-2 cells but also exhibited a higher competition ability against escherichia coli o157:h7 and listeria monocytogenes adhesion to caco-2 cells than lb. casei atcc 393.

TI  == investigation of the mechanisms by which listeria monocytogenes grows in porcine  gallbladder bile.
AB  == the food-borne pathogen listeria monocytogenes is known to colonize the lumen of  the gallbladder in infected mice and to grow rapidly in this environment (j. hardy et al., science 303:851-853, 2004). however, relatively little is known about the mechanisms utilized by the pathogen to survive and grow in this location. we utilized gallbladder bile (gb bile) isolated directly from porcine gallbladders as an ex vivo model of gallbladder growth. we demonstrate that gb bile is generally nontoxic for bacteria and can readily support growth of a variety of bacterial species including l. monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and escherichia coli. significantly, l.  monocytogenes grew at the same rate as the nonpathogenic species listeria innocua, indicating that the pathogen does not possess specialized mechanisms that enable growth in this environment. however, when we reduced the ph of gb bile to ph 5.5 in order to mimic the release of bile within the small intestine,  the toxicity of gb bile increased significantly and specific resistance mechanisms (sigma b, bsh, and bile) were essential for survival of the pathogen under these conditions. in order to identify genetic loci that are necessary for  growth of l. monocytogenes in the gallbladder, a mariner transposon bank was created and screened for mutants unable to replicate in gb bile. this led to the  identification of mutants in six loci, including genes encoding enzymes involved  in purine metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, and biotin uptake. although gb bile does not represent a significant impediment to bacterial growth, specific metabolic processes are required by l. monocytogenes in order to grow in this environment.

TI  == construction and expression of food-grade beta-galactosidase gene in lactococcus  lactis.
AB  == recombinant lactococcus lactis mg1363/pmg36e-lacz exhibiting high beta-galactosidase activities were constructed by us in the previous study. however, erythromycin resistance present in these recombinants restricted their practical application in food preparation. this study was conducted to delete the gene coding for erythromycin resistance present in recombinant l. lactis, as a result of which these bacteria express food-grade beta-galactosidase. in this study, the recombinant plasmid pmg36e-lacz was digested with restriction enzymes  bcli and hpai and the food-grade plasmid fgzw was rebuilt. fgzw was transformed into escherichia coli jm109 and l. lactis mg1363. erythromycin resistance, enzyme activity determination, gene sequencing and sds-page analysis indicated that these new recombinant bacteria lost erythromycin resistance and its relevant gene but still expressed beta-galactosidase activities, although a decrease in the expression of beta-galactosidase of these new strains was observed. the beta-galactosidase food-grade expression system was successfully constructed and  it could provide a new solution for the management of lactose intolerance. these  results might promote the usage of gene-modified microorganisms and related technology in the food sector, which has the highest priority for food safety.

TI  == a novel plasmid for delivering genes into mammalian cells with noninvasive food and commensal lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == using food and commensal lactic acid bacteria (lab) as vehicles for dna delivery  into epithelial cells is a new strategy for vaccine delivery or gene therapy. however, present methods for dna delivery with lab have suffered low efficiency.  our goal was to develop a new system to deliver dna into epithelial cells with high efficiency using food and commensal lab. an escherichia coli-lab shuttle plasmid, plkv1, for dna delivery into eukaryotic cells was constructed. two reporter plasmids with green and red fluorescent protein genes were also constructed to monitor the uptake of protein and dna, respectively. bacteria delivering these reporter plasmids into caco-2 cells were monitored by fluorescence microscopy. several methods that weaken the bacterial cell wall prior to co-culture with caco-2 cells were evaluated for their role in the improvement of gene transfer efficiency. treating streptococcus gordonii with penicillin and lysozyme greatly increased its rate of gene delivery to mammalian  cells compared to untreated control bacteria, while glycine pretreatment promoted the highest gene transfer rate for lactococcus lactis. uptake of green fluorescent bacteria by caco-2 cells showed that the cell wall-weakening treatment promoted the internalization of the noninvasive bacteria into caco-2 cells. in conclusion, we have developed a noninvasive system using lab as a vehicle for vaccine delivery or gene therapy, and tested this system in vitro with caco-2 cells.

TI  == role of surface protein sasg in biofilm formation by staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the sasg surface protein of staphylococcus aureus has been shown to promote the formation of biofilm. sasg comprises an n-terminal a domain and repeated b domains. here we demonstrate that sasg is involved in the accumulation phase of biofilm, a process that requires a physiological concentration of zn(2+). the b domains, but not the a domain, are required. purified recombinant b domain protein can form dimers in vitro in a zn(2+)-dependent fashion. furthermore, the  protein can bind to cells that have b domains anchored to their surface and block biofilm formation. the full-length sasg protein exposed on the cell surface is processed within the b domains to a limited degree, resulting in cleaved proteins of various lengths being released into the supernatant. some of the released molecules associate with the surface-exposed b domains that remain attached to the cell. studies using inhibitors and mutants failed to identify any protease that could cause the observed cleavage within the b domains. extensively purified recombinant b domain protein is very labile, and we propose that cleavage occurs  spontaneously at labile peptide bonds and that this is necessary for biofilm formation.

AB  == quantitative fatty acid composition of microorganisms at various growth space points is required for understanding membrane associated processes of cells, but  the majority of the relevant publications still restrict to the relative compositions. in the current study, a simple and reliable method for quantitative measurement of fatty acid content in bacterial biomass without prior derivatization using ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was developed. the method was applied for investigating the influence of specific growth rate and ph on the fatty acid profiles of two biotechnologically important microorganisms - gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and gram-positive bacteria lactococcus lactis grown in  controlled physiological states. it was found that the membranes of slowly growing cells are more rigid and that the fatty acid fraction of the cells of l.  lactis diminishes considerably with increasing growth rate.

TI  == metabolic engineering of escherichia coli for the production of succinate from glycerol.
AB  == glycerol has become an ideal feedstock for the microbial production of bio-based  chemicals due to its abundance, low cost, and high degree of reduction. we have previously reported the pathways and mechanisms for the utilization of glycerol by escherichia coli in minimal salts medium under microaerobic conditions. here we capitalize on such results to engineer e. coli for the production of value-added succinate from glycerol. through metabolic engineering of e. coli metabolism, succinate production was greatly elevated by (1) blocking pathways for the synthesis of competing by-products lactate, ethanol, and acetate and (2)  expressing lactococcus lactis pyruvate carboxylase to drive the generation of succinate from the pyruvate node (as opposed to that of phosphoenolpyruvate). as  such, these metabolic engineering strategies coupled cell growth to succinate production because the synthesis of succinate remained as the primary route of nad+ regeneration. this feature enabled the operation of the succinate pathway in the absence of selective pressure (e.g. antibiotics). our biocatalysts demonstrated a maximum specific productivity of approximately 400 mg succinate/g  cell/h and a yield of 0.69 g succinate/g glycerol, on par with the use of glucose as a feedstock.

TI  == origin of the putrescine-producing ability of the coagulase-negative bacterium staphylococcus epidermidis 2015b.
AB  == a multiplex pcr method, aimed at the detection of genes associated with biogenic  amine production, identified the odc gene encoding ornithine decarboxylase in 1 of 15 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis. the ability of the positive strain,  s. epidermidis 2015b, to produce putrescine in vitro was demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). in this strain, the odc gene was detected on plasmid dna, suggesting that the ability to form putrescine is carried by a mobile element, which explains the fact that the trait is strain dependent within the s. epidermidis species. a 6,292-bp nucleotide sequence harboring the putative odc gene was determined. s. epidermidis ornithine decarboxylase (odc) showed 60 to 65% sequence identity with known odcs of gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. downstream of the odc gene, a gene encoding a putative amino acid transporter was found that shared 59% sequence identity with the ornithine/putrescine exchanger (pote) of escherichia coli. cloning and expression of the pote gene of s. epidermis 2015b in lactococcus lactis demonstrated that the gene product transported ornithine and putrescine into the cells and efficiently exchanged putrescine for ornithine. analysis of the flanking regions showed high identity levels with different s. epidermidis plasmid sequences, which would confirm the plasmidic location of the  odc operon. it follows that the odc and pote gene pair encodes a putrescine-producing pathway in s. epidermis 2015b that was acquired through horizontal gene transfer.

TI  == are two better than one? analysis of an ftsk/xer recombination system that uses a single recombinase.
AB  == bacteria harbouring circular chromosomes have a xer site-specific recombination system that resolves chromosome dimers at division. in escherichia coli, the activity of the xercd/dif system is controlled and coupled with cell division by  the ftsk dna translocase. most xer systems, as xercd/dif, include two different recombinases. however, some, as the lactococcus lactis xers/dif(sl) system, include only one recombinase. we investigated the functional effects of this difference by studying the xers/dif(sl) system. xers bound and recombined dif(sl) sites in vitro, both activities displaying asymmetric characteristics. resolution of chromosome dimers by xers/dif(sl) required translocation by division septum-borne ftsk. the translocase domain of l. lactis ftsk supported recombination by xercd/dif, just as e. coli ftsk supports recombination by xers/dif(sl). thus, the ftsk-dependent coupling of chromosome segregation with cell division extends to non-rod-shaped bacteria and outside the phylum proteobacteria. both the xercd/dif and xers/dif(sl) recombination systems require the control activities of the ftskgamma subdomain. however, ftskgamma activates recombination through different mechanisms in these two xer systems. we show that ftskgamma alone activates xercd/dif recombination. in contrast, both ftskgamma and the translocation motor are required to activate xers/dif(sl) recombination.  these findings have implications for the mechanisms by which ftsk activates recombination.

AB  == enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) is a major pathogenic agent causing piglet diarrhea. the major subunit and adhesin faeg of f4(+) etec is an important virulence factor with strong immunogenicity. to determine whether lactococcus lactis (l. lactis) could effectively deliver faeg to the mucosal immune system, recombinant l. lactis expressing faeg was constructed, and immune responses in mice following oral route delivery of recombinant l. lactis were explored. the production of faeg expressed in l. lactis was up to approximately 10% of soluble  whole-cell proteins, and recombinant faeg (rfaeg) possessed good immunoreactivity by western blot analysis. oral immunization with recombinant l. lactis expressing faeg induced f4-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses in the mice. in addition, high dose recombinant l. lactis or co-administration of high dose recombinant l. lactis with ctb enhanced the immune responses. these results suggested that l. lactis expressing faeg was a promising candidate vaccine against etec.

TI  == improvement of multiple-stress tolerance and lactic acid production in lactococcus lactis nz9000 under conditions of thermal stress by heterologous expression of escherichia coli dnak.
AB  == the effects of nisin-induced dnak expression in lactococcus lactis were examined, and this expression was shown to improve stress tolerance and lactic acid fermentation efficiency. using a nisin-inducible expression system, dnak proteins from l. lactis (dnak(lla)) and escherichia coli (dnak(eco)) were produced in l. lactis nz9000. in comparison to a strain harboring the empty vector pnz8048 (designated nz-vector) and one expressing dnak(lla) (designated nz-ldnak), the dnak(eco)-expressing strain, named nz-ednak, exhibited more tolerance to heat stress at 40 degrees c in gm17 liquid medium. the cell viability of nz-vector was reduced 4.6-fold after 6 h of heat treatment. however, nz-ednak showed 13.5-fold  increased viability under these conditions, with a very low concentration of dnak(eco) production. although the heterologous expression of dnak(eco) did not effect dnak(lla) production, heat treatment increased the dnak(lla) level 3.5- and 3.6-fold in nz-vector and nz-ednak, respectively. moreover, nz-ednak showed tolerance to multiple stresses, including 3% nacl, 5% ethanol, and 0.5% lactic acid (ph 5.47). in cmg medium, the lactate yield and the maximum lactate productivity of nz-ednak were higher than the corresponding values for nz-vector  at 30 degrees c. interestingly, at 40 degrees c, these values of nz-ednak were not significantly different from the corresponding values for the control strain  at 30 degrees c. lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) activity was also found to be stable at 40 degrees c in the presence of dnak(eco). these findings suggest that the heterologous expression of dnak(eco) enhances the quality control of proteins and enzymes, resulting in improved growth and lactic acid fermentation at high temperature.

TI  == engineering corynebacterium glutamicum for isobutanol production.
AB  == the production of isobutanol in microorganisms has recently been achieved by harnessing the highly active 2-keto acid pathways. since these 2-keto acids are precursors of amino acids, we aimed to construct an isobutanol production platform in corynebacterium glutamicum, a well-known amino-acid-producing microorganism. analysis of this host's sensitivity to isobutanol toxicity revealed that c. glutamicum shows an increased tolerance to isobutanol relative to escherichia coli. overexpression of alss of bacillus subtilis, ilvc and ilvd of c. glutamicum, kivd of lactococcus lactis, and a native alcohol dehydrogenase, adha, led to the production of 2.6 g/l isobutanol and 0.4 g/l 3-methyl-1-butanol  in 48 h. in addition, other higher chain alcohols such as 1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 1-butanol, and 2-phenylethanol were also detected as byproducts. using longer-term batch cultures, isobutanol titers reached 4.0 g/l after 96 h with wild-type c. glutamicum as a host. upon the inactivation of several genes to direct more carbon through the isobutanol pathway, we increased  production by approximately 25% to 4.9 g/l isobutanol in a pycldh background. these results show promise in engineering c. glutamicum for higher chain alcohol  production using the 2-keto acid pathways.

AB  == the first step of the butanol pathway involves an acetyl-coa acetyltransferase (acoaat), which controls the key branching point from acetyl-coa to butanol. acoaat, also known as thiolase (ec 2.3.1.9), is encoded by the thl gene and catalyzes ligation of two acetyl-coa into acetoacetyl-coa. bioinformatics analyses suggest there are no thl in the genomes of lactic acid bacteria (lab), in this study we aimed to introduce the thl gene into selected lab strains and analyze the fermentation products. the thl gene from clostridium beijerinckii p260 was amplified by genomic pcr using gene-specific primers designed from the published genome sequences of c. beijerinckii ncimb 8025. the 1.2 kb thl gene was cloned into the petblue vector and overexpressed in escherichia coli tuner (de3)  placi cells. functional enzyme activity was detected spectrophotometrically by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 303 nm, which reflects the change in acetoacetyl-coa concentrations. the thl gene was subsequently introduced into lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus buchneri strains, and gc analysis indicated  about 28 mg/l and 66 mg/l of butanol was produced in the recombinant strains, respectively. this study reports the first step toward developing a butanolgenic  lab through the introduction of the butanol pathway into butanol-tolerant strains of lab.

TI  == structure of lactococcal phage p2 baseplate and its mechanism of activation.
AB  == siphoviridae is the most abundant viral family on earth which infects bacteria as well as archaea. all known siphophages infecting gram+ lactococcus lactis possess a baseplate at the tip of their tail involved in host recognition and attachment. here, we report analysis of the p2 phage baseplate structure by x-ray crystallography and electron microscopy and propose a mechanism for the baseplate activation during attachment to the host cell. this approximately 1 mda, escherichia coli-expressed baseplate is composed of three protein species, including six trimers of the receptor-binding protein (rbp). rbps host-recognition domains point upwards, towards the capsid, in agreement with the electron-microscopy map of the free virion. in the presence of ca(2+), a cation mandatory for infection, the rbps rotated 200 degrees downwards, presenting their binding sites to the host, and a channel opens at the bottom of the baseplate for dna passage. these conformational changes reveal a novel siphophage activation and host-recognition mechanism leading ultimately to dna ejection.

TI  == role of antioxidant enzymes in bacterial resistance to organic acids.
AB  == growth in aerobic environments has been shown to generate reactive oxygen species (ros) and to cause oxidative stress in most organisms. antioxidant enzymes (i.e., superoxide dismutases and hydroperoxidases) and dna repair mechanisms provide protection against ros. acid stress has been shown to be associated with the induction of mn superoxide dismutase (mnsod) in lactococcus lactis and staphylococcus aureus. however, the relationship between acid stress and oxidative stress is not well understood. in the present study, we showed that mutations in the gene coding for mnsod (soda) increased the toxicity of lactic acid at ph 3.5 in streptococcus thermophilus. the inclusion of the iron chelators 2,2'-dipyridyl (dip), diethienetriamine-pentaacetic acid (dtpa), and o-phenanthroline (o-phe) provided partial protection against 330 mm lactic acid at ph 3.5. the results suggested that acid stress triggers an iron-mediated oxidative stress that can be ameliorated by mnsod and iron chelators. these findings were further validated in escherichia coli strains lacking both mnsod and iron sod (fesod) but expressing a heterologous mnsod from s. thermophilus. we also found that, in e. coli, fesod did not provide the same protection afforded by mnsod and that hydroperoxidases are equally important in protecting the cells  against acid stress. these findings may explain the ability of some microorganisms to survive better in acidified environments, as in acid foods, during fermentation and accumulation of lactic acid or during passage through the low ph of the stomach.

TI  == genetic identification of potential rna-binding regions in a group ii intron-encoded reverse transcriptase.
AB  == mobile group ii introns encode a reverse transcriptase that binds the intron rna  to promote rna splicing and intron mobility, the latter via reverse splicing of the excised intron into dna sites, followed by reverse transcription. previous work showed that the lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb intron reverse transcriptase, denoted ltra protein, binds with high affinity to diva, a stem-loop structure at  the beginning of the ltra open reading frame and makes additional contacts with intron core regions that stabilize the active rna structure for forward and reverse splicing. ltra's binding to diva down-regulates its translation and is critical for initiation of reverse transcription. here, by using high-throughput  unigenic evolution analysis with a genetic assay in which ltra binding to diva down-regulates translation of gfp, we identified regions at ltra's n terminus that are required for diva binding. then, by similar analysis with a reciprocal genetic assay, we confirmed that residual splicing of a mutant intron lacking diva does not require these n-terminal regions, but does require other reverse transcriptase (rt) and x/thumb domain regions that bind the intron core. we also  show that n-terminal fragments of ltra by themselves bind specifically to diva in vivo and in vitro. our results suggest a model in which the n terminus of nascent ltra binds diva of the intron rna that encoded it and nucleates further interactions with core regions that promote rnp assembly for rna splicing and intron mobility. features of this model may be relevant to evolutionarily related non-long-terminal-repeat (non-ltr)-retrotransposon rts.

TI  == a foreign protein incorporated on the tip of t3 pili in lactococcus lactis elicits systemic and mucosal immunity.
AB  == the use of lactococcus lactis to deliver a chosen antigen to the mucosal surface  has been shown to elicit an immune response in mice and is a possible method of vaccination in humans. the recent discovery on gram-positive bacteria of pili that are covalently attached to the bacterial surface and the elucidation of the  residues linking the major and minor subunits of such pili suggests that the presentation of an antigen on the tip of pili external to the surface of l. lactis might constitute a successful vaccine strategy. as a proof of principle, we have fused a foreign protein (the escherichia coli maltose-binding protein) to the c-terminal region of the native tip protein (cpa) of the t3 pilus derived from streptococcus pyogenes and expressed this fusion protein (mbp*) in l. lactis. we find that mbp* is incorporated into pili in this foreign host, as shown by western blot analyses of cell wall proteins and by immunogold electron microscopy. furthermore, since the mbp* on these pili retains its native biological activity, it appears to retain its native structure. mucosal immunization of mice with this l. lactis strain expressing pilus-linked mbp* results in production of both a systemic and a mucosal response (igg and iga antibodies) against the mbp antigen. we suggest that this type of mucosal vaccine delivery system, which we term uptop (for unhindered presentation on tips of pili), may provide an inexpensive and stable alternative to current mechanisms of immunization for many serious human pathogens.

AB  == in cells, mrna and protein levels are fine-regulated to adjust continuously to cellular needs. recently, several large-scale studies in prokaryotes showed weak  correlations between mrna and protein abundances highlighting the significant importance of post-transcriptional regulations. post-transcriptional regulations  involve dynamic adaptation of mrna and protein turnover and also modulation of the efficiency of mrna translation into protein. mrna and protein stabilities are function of both sequence determinants and decay processes. translation efficiency is mainly dependent on ribosome synthesis and activity. conciliation through an integrative biology approach of large-scale data obtained for each level of regulation is now required to better understand global cell response to  different environmental growth conditions. in this review, we report mechanisms involved in mrna and protein stability and translation regulation in prokaryotes, and their dependence on growth phase and environmental growth conditions is particularly highlighted.

TI  == bacterial dynamics in model cheese systems, aiming at safety and quality of portuguese-style traditional ewe's cheeses.
AB  == an experiment using model ewe's milk cheeses was designed to characterize microbial interactions that arise in actual raw milk cheese environments. these model cheeses were manufactured according to portuguese artisanal practices, except that the microbial load and biodiversity were fully controlled: single potential pathogens and spoilage bacteria, or a combination thereof, were combined at various initial inoculum levels in sterilized raw ewe's milk with several lactic acid bacteria (lab) normally found in traditional cheeses. viable  microbial counts were monitored throughout a 60-day ripening period. two alternative mathematical approaches were used to fit the experimental data generated in terms of population dynamics: percent of inhibition and d-values. these were able to explain the complex competitive interactions between the contaminant microorganisms and the lab adventitious populations. in general, the  tested lab were less able to inhibit contaminants present in combination and in higher concentrations. lactococcus lactis, with its strong acidifying potential,  was the most effective factor in controlling the unwanted bacterial population, especially single staphylococcus aureus. the two lactobacilli studied, especially lactobacillus brevis, were shown to be less effective; escherichia coli and listeria innocua were the contaminants least inhibited by the lab.

TI  == phosphoproteomic analysis reveals the multiple roles of phosphorylation in pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == recent phosphoproteomic characterizations of bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, pseudomonas putida, and pseudomonas aeruginosa have suggested that protein phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is a major regulatory post-translational modification in bacteria. in this study, we carried out a global and site-specific phosphoproteomic analysis on the gram-positive pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae. one hundred and two  unique phosphopeptides and 163 phosphorylation sites with distributions of 47%/44%/9% for ser/thr/tyr phosphorylations from 84 s. pneumoniae proteins were identified through the combined use of tio(2) enrichment and lc-ms/ms determination. the identified phosphoproteins were found to be involved in various biological processes including carbon/protein/nucleotide metabolisms, cell cycle and division regulation. a striking characteristic of s. pneumoniae phosphoproteome is the large number of multiple species-specific phosphorylated sites, indicating that high level of protein phosphorylation may play important roles in regulating many metabolic pathways and bacterial virulence.

TI  == oral administration of lactococcus lactis expressing helicobacter pylori cag7-ct383 protein induces systemic anti-cag7 immune response in mice.
AB  == to express the 3'-region (1152 bp) of the cag7 gene of helicobacter pylori 51 strain, encoding the c-terminal 383 amino acid (ct383 aa) region of cag7 protein  that is known to cover the needle region of t4ss, in a live delivery vehicle lactococcus lactis, the cag7-ct383 gene was amplified by pcr. dna sequence analysis revealed that the amino acid sequence of cag7-ct383 of h. pylori 51 shared 98.4% and 97.4% identity with h. pylori 26695 and j99, respectively. intramuscular injection of the gst-cag7-ct383 fusion protein into a rat could raise the anti-cag7 antibody, indicating the immunogenicity of the cag7-ct383 protein. when the cag7-ct383 gene was cloned in escherichia coli-l. lactis shuttle vector (pmg36e) and transformed into l. lactis, the transformant could produce the cag7-ct383 protein, as evidenced by western blot analysis. the cag7-ct383 protein level in the l. lactis transformant reached a maximum at the early stationary phase without extracellular secretion. the oral administration of the l. lactis transformant into mice generated anti-cag7 antibody in serum in  five of five mice. these results suggest that l. lactis transformant expressing cag7-ct383 protein may be applicable as an oral vaccine to induce mucosal and systemic immunity to h. pylori.

TI  == assessment of antimicrobial resistance transfer between lactic acid bacteria and  potential foodborne pathogens using in vitro methods and mating in a food matrix.
AB  == the transferability of antimicrobial resistance from lactic acid bacteria (lab) to potential pathogenic strains was studied using in vitro methods and mating in  a food matrix. five lab donors containing either erythromycin or tetracycline resistance markers on transferable elements were conjugally mated with lab (enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis) and pathogenic strains (listeria spp., salmonella ssp., staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli). in vitro transfer experiments were carried out with the donors and recipients using both the filter and plate mating methods. the food matrix consisted of fermented whole milk (fermented with the lab donors) with the pathogenic recipients added as contaminants during the production process. all transconjugants were confirmed by phenotypic and molecular methods. erythromycin resistance transfer from lab strains to listeria spp. was observed using both in vitro mating methods at high  transfer frequencies of up to 5.1 x 10(-4) transconjugants per recipient. also, high frequency transfer (ranging from 2.7 x 10(-8) up to 1.1 x 10(-3) transconjugants per recipient) of both erythromycin and tetracycline-resistance was observed between lab species using in vitro methods. no resistance transfer was observed to salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, and e. coli. the only conjugal transfer observed in the fermented milk matrix was for tetracycline resistance between two lab strains (at a transfer frequency of 2.6 x 10(-7) transconjugants per recipients). this study demonstrates the transfer of antimicrobial resistance from lab to listeria spp. using in vitro methods and also the transfer of resistance between lab species in a food matrix. it highlights the involvement of lab as a potential source of resistance determinants that may be disseminated between lab and pathogenic strains including listeria spp. furthermore, it indicates that food matrices such as fermented milks may provide a suitable environment to support gene exchange.

AB  == the major objective of the present study is to change the alanine production of lactic acid bacteria by expression of bacillus subtilis (natto) alanine dehydrogenase (aladh), the gene that is not present in lactic acid. b. subtilis aladh gene (ald) was cloned into a pgex6p-1 and expressed in e. coli jm109. its enzyme activity was 48.3u/mg at 30 degrees c and 45.2u/mg at 42 degrees c. this ald gene was then cloned into a vector pnz8148 to generate a vector pnz8148/ald.  the same ald gene was placed downstream of the ldh promoter from streptococcus thermophilus to generate pnz273/ldhp/ald. the pnz8148/ald and pnz273/ldhp/ald were introduced separately in lactococcus lactis nz9000. as a result of over-expressed ald, the production of alanine detected by hplc in l. lactis nz9000 carrying pnz273/ldhp/ald reached 52mug/ml, an approximately 26-fold increase compared to the parent strain l. lactis nz9000, but not in l. lactis nz9000 carrying pnz8148/ald. this study would help strain improvement to be used  in dairy fermentation for developing healthy yogurts with sweet taste or other fermented dairy foods.

TI  == structure and function of phage p2 orf34(p2), a new type of single-stranded dna binding protein.
AB  == lactococcus lactis, a gram-positive bacterium widely used by the dairy industry,  is subject to infection by a diverse population of virulent phages, predominantly by those of the 936 group, including the siphovirus phage p2. confronted with the negative impact of phage infection on milk fermentation, the study of the biology of lactococcal provides insight from applied and fundamental perspectives. we decided to characterize the product of the orf34 gene from lactococcus phage p2,  which was considered as a candidate single-stranded dna binding protein (ssb) due to its localization downstream of a gene coding for a single-strand annealing protein. two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that orf34(p2) is expressed in large amounts during the early phases of phage infection, suggesting an important role in this process. gel-shift assays, surface plasmon resonance and atomic force microscopy demonstrated that orf34(p2) interacts with single-strand  dna with nanomolar affinity. we also determined the crystal structure of orf34(p2) and showed that it bears a variation of the typical oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding-fold of ssbs. finally, we found that orf34(p2) is able to stimulate escherichia coli reca-mediated homologous recombination. the specific structural and biochemical properties that distinguish orf34(p2) from other ssb proteins are discussed.

TI  == molecular properties of the glucosaminidase acma from lactococcus lactis mg1363:  mutational and biochemical analyses.
AB  == the major autolysin acma of lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris mg1363 is a modular  protein consisting of an n-terminal signal sequence, a central enzymatic region (glu(acma) as a glucosaminidase), and a c-terminal cell-recognition domain (lysm123). glu(acma) (about 160 amino acids) belongs to the glycoside hydrolase (gh) 73 family, and the two acidic residues e128 and d153 have been thought to be catalytically important. in this study, amino-acid substitution analysis of acma  was first carried out in the escherichia coli system. point mutations e94a, e94q, e128a, d153a, and y191a markedly reduced cell-lytic activity (3.8%, 1.1%, 4.2%, 4.8%, and 2.4%, respectively), whereas e128q and d153n retained significant residual activities (32.1% and 44.0%, respectively). on the other hand, y191f and y191w mutations retained high activities (66.2% and 46.0%, respectively). these results showed that e94 (rather than e128 and d153) and the aromatic residue y191 probably play important roles in catalysis of acma. together with mutational analysis of another gh73 glucoaminidase glu(atlwm) from the staphylococcus warneri m autolysin atl(wm), these results suggested that the gh73 members cleave a glycosidic bond via a substrate-assisted mechanism, as postulated in the gh20 members. acma and glu(atlwm) were purified from e. coli recombinant cells, and their enzymatic properties were studied.

TI  == acetolactate synthase from bacillus subtilis serves as a 2-ketoisovalerate decarboxylase for isobutanol biosynthesis in escherichia coli.
AB  == a pathway toward isobutanol production previously constructed in escherichia coli involves 2-ketoacid decarboxylase (kdc) from lactococcus lactis that decarboxylates 2-ketoisovalerate (kiv) to isobutyraldehyde. here, we showed that  a strain lacking kdc is still capable of producing isobutanol. we found that acetolactate synthase from bacillus subtilis (alss), which originally catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of pyruvate to form 2-acetolactate, is able to  catalyze the decarboxylation of kiv like kdc both in vivo and in vitro. mutational studies revealed that the replacement of q487 with amino acids with small side chains (ala, ser, and gly) diminished only the decarboxylase activity  but maintained the synthase activity.

TI  == intra- and interspecies conjugal transfer of tn916-like elements from lactococcus lactis in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == tetracycline-resistant lactococcus lactis strains originally isolated from polish raw milk were analyzed for the ability to transfer their antibiotic resistance genes in vitro, using filter mating experiments, and in vivo, using germfree rats. four of six analyzed l. lactis isolates were able to transfer tetracycline  resistance determinants in vitro to l. lactis bu2-60, at frequencies ranging from 10(-5) to 10(-7) transconjugants per recipient. three of these four strains could also transfer resistance in vitro to enterococcus faecalis jh2-2, whereas no transfer to bacillus subtilis ybe01, pseudomonas putida kt2442, agrobacterium tumefaciens ubapf2, or escherichia coli je2571 was observed. rats were initially  inoculated with the recipient e. faecalis strain jh2-2, and after a week, the l.  lactis ibb477 and ibb487 donor strains were introduced. the first transconjugants were detected in fecal samples 3 days after introduction of the donors. a subtherapeutic concentration of tetracycline did not have any significant effect  on the number of transconjugants, but transconjugants were observed earlier in animals dosed with this antibiotic. molecular analysis of in vivo transconjugants containing the tet(m) gene showed that this gene was identical to tet(m) localized on the conjugative transposon tn916. primer-specific pcr confirmed that the tn916 transposon was complete in all analyzed transconjugants and donors. this is the first study showing in vivo transfer of a tn916-like antibiotic resistance transposon from l. lactis to e. faecalis. these data suggest that in certain cases food lactococci might be involved in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes to other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == establishment of a novel anabolism-based addiction system with an artificially introduced mevalonate pathway: complete stabilization of plasmids as universal application in white biotechnology.
AB  == plasmid stability in recombinant microorganisms is a very important requirement for highly efficient plasmid-based production processes in biotechnology. to stably maintain plasmids, we developed in this study an efficient and stringent novel anabolism-based addiction system, which can be widely used. this novel addiction system is based on two components: (i) an escherichia coli hms174(de3)  knockout mutant of the isph gene coding for 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (ec 1.17.1.2) of the deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (dxp) pathway, impairing the synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (ipp) and (ii) a completely synthetic and episomal mevalonate (mva) pathway as an alternative supplier of essential ipp. the latter is encoded by a plasmid that contains the genes for hmg-coa reductases from lactococcus lactis and staphylococcus aureus plus hmg-coa-synthase, mva kinase, mvp kinase and mvpp decarboxylase from s. aureus. this plasmid should then also harbor the genes for the protein or for the pathway that will be produced or that will be utilized for production of a chemical. to demonstrate the functionality of this addiction system, a mutated cyanophycin synthetase gene (cpha(6308)c595s) was used. to determine plasmid stabilities, flasks experiments in media supplied or not supplied with antibiotics were carried out with the knockout mutant and two control strains, one harboring plasmid pcoladuet-1::mva1-5::cpha(6308) and the other harboring a conventional expression plasmid pet-23a::cpha(6308). as revealed by measuring the colony-forming units of aliquots spread on solid media with or without antibiotics, the knockout mutant revealed a plasmid stability of 100% whereas the control strains exhibited plasmid stabilities of only 64% and 2%, respectively. radiometric enzyme activity measurements for cpha revealed only 95% and 12.5% of  the activity in the control strains harboring pcoladuet-1::mva1-5::cpha(6308) and pet-23a::cpha(6308), respectively, in comparison to the activity measured in the  knockout mutant. the knockout mutant synthesized 9.5% (w/w of cell dry weight (cdw)) of cyanophycin, and the control strain harboring pcoladuet-1::mva1-5::cpha(6308) synthesized 13.6% (w/w of cdw) after growth without antibiotics.

AB  == a total of 96 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from african indigenous fermented products and cow's intestines to study their inhibitory capability against multi-drug-resistant uropathogens. escherichia coli accounted for approximately 45% of isolated uropathogens, followed by staphylococcus spp. (20%). the gram negative uropathogens were highly resistant to quinolones, co-trimoxazole, teicoplanin and some beta-lactams, while the staphylococcus spp.  showed high resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and macrolides. twenty-four lab isolates were selected based on their antimicrobial activity against two uropathogenic staphylococcus aureus strains and bacteriocin production. lab strains showing antimicrobial activity were grouped into smaller  groups through amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). representative strains were identified as weissella spp., enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus brevis through sequencing of 16s rdna. the weissella spp. and l. brevis strains demonstrated remarkable inhibitory activity  against seven strains of gram negative uropathogens. two strains of l. lactis produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance active against lactobacillus sakei. in this study, an unusual high rate of co-trimoxazole, quinolones and macrolides resistance among uropathogens from south west nigeria was discovered.  based on their sensitivity to weissella spp., there is a potential for using these lab as a natural approach for the protection against the uropathogens assayed.

AB  == the food-grade status and probiotic activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) make them attractive hosts for production and oral delivery of therapeutic heterologous vaccines and other proteins, yet these bacteria currently do not achieve recombinant protein expression at levels comparable to those seen in escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae. limited levels of expressed recombinant protein per cell most likely constrain the vaccine's immunogenic potential with respect to the magnitude and specificity of the immune response. with the goal of increasing recombinant protein expression per cell in lactococcus lactis il1403, a model lab, we have constructed and evaluated a new vector that permits simultaneously-induced expression of gfp, a model recombinant protein, and antisense rna inhibition of the clpp-encoded intracellular protease. while silencing of the rational target clpp does not lead to increased gfp per cell, the new dual-expression system provides an efficient and potentially high-throughput metabolic engineering tool for strain improvement.

TI  == nmr and epr studies of membrane transporters.
AB  == in order to fulfill their function, membrane transport proteins have to cycle through a number of conformational and/or energetic states. thus, understanding the role of conformational dynamics seems to be the key for elucidation of the functional mechanism of these proteins. however, membrane proteins in general are often difficult to express heterologously and in sufficient amounts for structural studies. it is especially challenging to trap a stable energy minimum, e.g., for crystallographic analysis. furthermore, crystallization is often only possible by subjecting the protein to conditions that do not resemble its native  environment and crystals can only be snapshots of selected conformational states. nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) and electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) spectroscopy are complementary methods that offer unique possibilities for studying membrane proteins in their natural membrane environment and for investigating functional conformational changes, lipid interactions, substrate-lipid and substrate-protein interactions, oligomerization states and overall dynamics of membrane transporters. here, we review recent progress in the field including studies from primary and secondary active transporters.

AB  == aims: to evaluate brazzein production in lactococcus lactis using the nisin-controlled expression (nice) system. the approach is through analysis of different plasmid/strain combinations. methods and results: two plasmid/strain combinations of the nice system were used in brazzein expression: l. lactis nz9000 harbouring plasmid pnz8148, and l. lactis il1403 harbouring plasmid pmsp3545. the former combination proved superior, with a >800-fold increase in his-tagged brazzein expression (to 1.65 mg l(-1) of fermentation broth), comparable to expression levels in escherichia coli. improved expression resulted in a minor increase in secretion to the medium with the use of the usp45 signal peptide. the yield of wild-type brazzein corresponded to that of his-tagged brazzein. wild-type brazzein was partially soluble and low-intensity sweetness was detected. conclusions: the plasmid/strain combination of the nice system has  a significant impact on the expression of brazzein where a >800-fold increase was achieved. the greatly increased expression of brazzein resulted in minor improvement in secretion and low-intensity sweetness. significance and impact of  the study: the choice of the plasmid/strain combination of the nice system was shown to be of extreme importance in brazzein expression.

TI  == characterization of rhamnosidases from lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus  acidophilus.
AB  == lactobacilli are known to use plant materials as a food source. many such materials are rich in rhamnose-containing polyphenols, and thus it can be anticipated that lactobacilli will contain rhamnosidases. therefore, genome sequences of food-grade lactobacilli were screened for putative rhamnosidases. in the genome of lactobacillus plantarum, two putative rhamnosidase genes (ram1(lp)  and ram2(lp)) were identified, while in lactobacillus acidophilus, one rhamnosidase gene was found (rama(la)). gene products from all three genes were produced after introduction into escherichia coli and were then tested for their  enzymatic properties. ram1(lp), ram2(lp), and rama(la) were able to efficiently hydrolyze rutin and other rutinosides, while rama(la) was, in addition, able to cleave naringin, a neohesperidoside. subsequently, the potential application of lactobacillus rhamnosidases in food processing was investigated using a single matrix, tomato pulp. recombinant ram1(lp) and rama(la) enzymes were shown to remove the rhamnose from rutinosides in this material, but efficient conversion required adjustment of the tomato pulp to ph 6. the potential of ram1(lp) for fermentation of plant flavonoids was further investigated by expression in the food-grade bacterium lactococcus lactis. this system was used for fermentation of tomato pulp, with the aim of improving the bioavailability of flavonoids in processed tomato products. while import of flavonoids into l. lactis appeared to  be a limiting factor, rhamnose removal was confirmed, indicating that rhamnosidase-producing bacteria may find commercial application, depending on the technological properties of the strains and enzymes.

AB  == objective: to construct recombinant lactococcus lactis strains exhibiting high beta-galactosidase activity in non-fusion way, and study their enzyme activities  and enzyme secretion rates. methods: the recombinant plasmids pmg36e-lacz 1.1480  and pmg36e-lacz wch9901 which could express beta-galactosidase from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in non-fusion way in escherichia coli were obtained and transformed into lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis mg1363. the beta-galactosidase activity of resulting recombinant l. lactis in different incubation periods and lactose concentrations, and their enzyme secretion rates in different culture conditions were examined. results: recombinant l. lactis carrying pmg36e-lacz wch9901 (mg1363/pmg36e-lacz wch9901) exhibited the highest beta-galactosidase activity. its enzyme activity was (16.95 +/- 0.09) u/mg pro, which was 2.75 folds of that of the native counterpart; recombinant l. lactis reached its enzyme producing peak after grown for 24 h; decreased enzyme activity of recombinant l. lactis were observed when incubated in medium containing lactose; the beta-galactosidase expressed by recombinant strains could be secreted into the culture medium, and the highest secretion rate (27.09 +/- 0.05)% was observed when the culture medium contained 20 g/l of lactose and without erythromycin. conclusion: high level expression of non-fusion beta-galactosidase with secretion in recombinant l. lactis strains was obtained.  this will be very helpful for the further developing of live delivery bacteria of beta-galactosidase.

TI  == secretory expression of k88 (f4) fimbrial adhesin faeg by recombinant lactococcus lactis for oral vaccination and its protective immune response in mice.
AB  == k88 (f4) fimbrial adhesin, faeg, was expressed extracellularly in lactococcus lactis using a nisin-controlled gene expression system. the antibody response and protective efficacy of the recombinant bacteria (l. lactis [spnz8048-faeg]) against live enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) c(83549) challenge were evaluated in  icr mice. mice vaccinated with l. lactis [spnz8048-faeg] had a significantly increased antigen-specific igg level in the serum and decreased mortality rate (p < 0.05) compared with the control. this indicates that oral immunization of l. lactis [spnz8048-faeg] can induce an immune-response protection upon challenge with live etec in icr mice.

TI  == identification and characterization of the phage gene sav, involved in sensitivity to the lactococcal abortive infection mechanism abiv.
AB  == lactococcus lactis phage mutants that are insensitive to the recently characterized abortive infection mechanism abiv were isolated and analyzed in an  effort to elucidate factors involved in the sensitivity to abiv. whole-genome sequencing of the phage mutants p2.1 and p2.2 revealed mutations in an orf that is transcribed early, indicating that this orf was responsible for abiv sensitivity. sequencing of the homologous regions in the genomes of other abiv-insensitive mutants derived from p2 and six other lactococcal wild-type phages revealed point mutations in the homologous orf sequences. the orf was named sav (for sensitivity to abiv), and the encoded polypeptide was named sav. the purification of a his-tagged sav polypeptide by gel filtration suggested that the polypeptide formed a dimer in its native form. the overexpression of sav in l. lactis and escherichia coli led to a rapid toxic effect. conserved, evolutionarily related regions in sav polypeptides of different phage groups are  likely to be responsible for the abiv-sensitive phenotype and the toxicity.

TI  == gene cloning and characterization of efma, a multidrug efflux pump, from enterococcus faecium.
AB  == a dna fragment responsible for resistance to antimicrobial agents was cloned from chromosomal dna of enterococcus faecium fn-1, a clinically isolated strain. escherichia coli kam32, a drug-hypersusceptible mutant, was used as a host for gene cloning. cells of e. coli kam32 harboring a recombinant plasmid (ptfm8) carrying the dna fragment became resistant to fluoroquinolones, macrolides, ethidium bromide, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi) and tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (tppcl). three complete open reading frames (orfs) were found in the dna insert of ptfm8, and the deduced amino acid sequences of one of the orfs showed high similarity to mdt(a) from lactococcus lactis. mdt(a) is a multidrug efflux pump belonging to a major facilitator superfamily. we designated the orf efma. e. coli kam32 cells harboring the efma showed energy-dependent efflux of dapi and tpp(+). we also observed norfloxacin/h(+) antiport due to efma. the mrna expression of efma was observed in e. faecium fn-1 grown without any exogenously  added antimicrobial agents. thus, we conclude that efma is constitutively expressed under laboratory growth conditions and would contribute to intrinsic resistance against multiple antimicrobial agents in e. faecium fn-1.

TI  == optimized expression of helicobacter pylori ureb gene in the lactococcus lactis nisin-controlled gene expression (nice) system and experimental study of its immunoreactivity.
AB  == in the development of an oral vaccine against helicobacter pylori, h. pylori urease subunit b (ureb) was expressed in a food-grade delivery vehicle, lactococcus lactis nz3900. the ureb gene (genbank accession no. fj436980) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from mel-hp27. the pcr-amplified ureb gene was cloned in the e. coli-l. lactis shuttle vector pnz8110 and transformed into e. coli mc1061. after the transformant had been identified, the  recombinant plasmid was purified and electrotransformed into l. lactis nz3900. the conditions of ureb expression in the l. lactis transformant were optimized by orthogonal experiment. the maltose binding protein (mbp)-ureb fusion protein expressed by tb(1)/pmal-c2x-ureb was used to cultivate mice polyclonal anti-ureb  serum after purification by the amylose prepacked column. the western blot method was adopted to confirm whether the ureb expressed by l. lactis transformant had immunoreactivity. the optimized conditions for ureb expression were as follows. nisin 40 ng/ml was added to the medium when the recombinant grew to od(600) approximately 0.30-0.40 and the induction time lasted 5 h. as a result, the maximum yield of ureb was 27.26 microg/ml of medium, and the maximum percentage of ureb in cell extracts of the l. lactis transformant reached its peak at 20.19%. western blot analysis showed that the ureb protein expressed by l. lactis transformant had favorable immunoreactivity. all these results make an appealing  case for construction of the food-grade vaccine for h. pylori.

TI  == activation of mrna translation by phage protein and low temperature: the case of  lactococcus lactis abortive infection system abid1.
AB  == background: abortive infection (abi) mechanisms comprise numerous strategies developed by bacteria to avoid being killed by bacteriophage (phage). escherichia coli abis are considered as mediators of programmed cell death, which is induced  by infecting phage. abis were also proposed to be stress response elements, but no environmental activation signals have yet been identified. abis are widespread in lactococcus lactis, but regulation of their expression remains an open question. we previously showed that development of abid1 abortive infection against phage bil66 depends on orf1, which is expressed in mid-infection. however, molecular basis for this activation remains unclear. results: in non-infected abid1+ cells, specific abid1 mrna is unstable and present in low amounts. it does not increase during abortive infection of sensitive phage. protein synthesis directed by the abid1 translation initiation region is also inefficient. the presence of the phage orf1 gene, but not its mutant abid1r allele, strongly increases abid1 translation efficiency. interestingly, cell growth at low temperature also activates translation of abid1 mrna and consequently the abid1 phenotype, and occurs independently of phage infection. there is no synergism between the two abid1 inducers. purified orf1 protein binds mrnas containing a secondary structure motif, identified within the translation initiation regions of abid1, the mid-infection phage bil66 m-operon, and the l. lactis osmc gene. conclusion: expression of the abid1 gene and consequently abid1 phenotype is specifically translationally activated by the phage orf1 protein. the loss of ability to activate translation of abid1 mrna determines the molecular basis for phage resistance to abid1. we show for the first time that temperature downshift also activates abortive infection by activation of abid1 mrna translation.

TI  == eci5, a group iib intron with high retrohoming frequency: dna target site recognition and use in gene targeting.
AB  == we find that group ii intron eci5, a subclass cl/iib1 intron from an escherichia  coli virulence plasmid, is highly active in retrohoming in e. coli. both full-length eci5 and an eci5-deltaorf intron with the intron-encoded protein expressed separately from the same donor plasmid retrohome into a recipient plasmid target site at substantially higher frequencies than do similarly configured lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb introns. a comprehensive view of dna target site recognition by eci5 was obtained from selection experiments with donor and recipient plasmid libraries in which different recognition elements were randomized. these experiments suggest that eci5, like other mobile group ii introns, recognizes dna target sequences by using both the intron-encoded protein and base-pairing of the intron rna, with the latter involving ebs1, ebs2, and ebs3 sequences characteristic of class iib introns. the intron-encoded protein appears to recognize a small number of bases flanking those recognized by the intron rna, but their identity is different than in previously characterized group ii introns. a computer algorithm based on the empirically determined dna recognition rules enabled retargeting of eci5 to integrate specifically at 10 different sites in the chromosomal lacz gene at frequencies up to 98% without selection. our findings provide insight into modes of dna target site recognition used by mobile group ii introns. more generally, they show how the diversity of mobile group ii introns can be exploited to provide a large variety of different  target specificities and potentially other useful properties for gene targeting.

TI  == incorporation of nisi-mediated nisin immunity improves vector-based nisin-controlled gene expression in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been used successfully to express a wide variety  of recombinant proteins, ranging from flavor-active proteins to antibiotic peptides and oral vaccines. the nisin-controlled expression (nice) system is the  most prevalent of the systems for production of heterologous proteins in lab. previous optimization of the nice system has revealed a strong limit on the concentration of the inducer nisin that can be tolerated by the culture of host cells. in this work, the nisin immunity gene, nisi, has been inserted into the recently reported pmsp3535h2 vector that contains the complete nice system on a high-copy escherichia coli-lab shuttle vector. fed-batch fermentation data show that lactococcus lactis il1403 cells transformed with the new vector, pmsp3535h3, tolerate a 5-fold increase in the concentration of the inducer nisin, and, at this elevated concentration, produce a 1.8-fold increased level of green fluorescent protein (gfp), a model recombinant protein. therefore, the incorporation of nisi in the pmsp3535h3 nice system described here unveils new ranges of induction parameters to be studied in the course of optimizing recombinant protein expression in lab.

TI  == non-fusion and fusion expression of beta-galactosidase from lactobacillus bulgaricus in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == objective: to construct four recombinant lactococcus lactis strains exhibiting high beta-galactosidase activity in fusion or non-fusion ways, and to study the influence factors for their protein expression and secretion. methods: the gene fragments encoding beta-galactosidase from two strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, wch9901 isolated from yogurt and 1.1480 purchased from the chinese academy of sciences, were amplified and inserted into lactococcal expression vector pmg36e. for fusion expression, the open reading frame of the beta-galactosidase gene was amplified, while for non-fusion expression, the open  reading frame of the beta-galactosidase gene was amplified with its native shine-dalgarno sequence upstream. the start codon of the beta-galactosidase gene  partially overlapped with the stop codon of vector origin open reading frame. then, the recombinant plasmids were transformed into escherichia coli dh5 alpha and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis mg1363 and confirmed by determining beta-galactosidase activities. results: the non-fusion expression plasmids showed a significantly higher beta-galactosidase activity in transformed strains than the fusion expression plasmids. the highest enzyme activity was observed in lactococcus lactis transformed with the non-fusion expression plasmids which were inserted into the beta-galactosidase gene from lactobacillus bulgaricus wch9901.  the beta-galactosidase activity was 2.75 times as high as that of the native counterpart. in addition, beta-galactosidase expressed by recombinant plasmids in lactococcus lactis could be secreted into the culture medium. the highest secretion rate (27.1%) was observed when the culture medium contained 20 g/l of lactose. conclusion: different properties of the native bacteria may have some effects on the protein expression of recombinant plasmids. non-fusion expression  shows a higher enzyme activity in host bacteria. there may be a host-related weak secretion signal peptide gene within the structure gene of lb. bulgaricus beta-galactosidase, and its translation product may introduce the enzyme secretion out of cells in special hosts.

TI  == introduction of an nadh regeneration system into klebsiella oxytoca leads to an enhanced oxidative and reductive metabolism of glycerol.
AB  == redox cofactors play crucial roles in the metabolic and regulatory network of living organisms. we reported here the effect of introducing a heterogeneous nadh regeneration system into klebsiella oxytoca on cell growth and glycerol metabolism. expression of fdh gene from candida boidinii in k. oxytoca resulted in higher intracellular concentrations of both nadh and nad(+) during the fermentation metaphase, with the ratio of nadh to nad(+) unaltered and cell growth unaffected, interestingly different from that in engineered escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, and others. metabolic flux analysis revealed that fluxes to 1,3-propanediol, ethanol, and lactate were all increased, suggesting both the oxidative and reductive metabolisms of glycerol were enhanced. it demonstrates that in certain microbial system nadh availability can be increased  with nadh to nad(+) ratio unaltered, providing a new strategy to improve the metabolic flux in those microorganisms where glycolysis is not the only central metabolic pathways.

TI  == the d-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase incorrectly annotated pane is the sole reduction system for branched-chain 2-keto acids in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == hydroxyacid dehydrogenases of lactic acid bacteria, which catalyze the stereospecific reduction of branched-chain 2-keto acids to 2-hydroxyacids, are of interest in a variety of fields, including cheese flavor formation via amino acid catabolism. in this study, we used both targeted and random mutagenesis to identify the genes responsible for the reduction of 2-keto acids derived from amino acids in lactococcus lactis. the gene pane, whose inactivation suppressed hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase activity, was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant his-tagged fusion protein was purified and  characterized. the gene annotated pane was the sole gene responsible for the reduction of the 2-keto acids derived from leucine, isoleucine, and valine, while ldh, encoding l-lactate dehydrogenase, was responsible for the reduction of the 2-keto acids derived from phenylalanine and methionine. the kinetic parameters of the his-tagged pane showed the highest catalytic efficiencies with 2-ketoisocaproate, 2-ketomethylvalerate, 2-ketoisovalerate, and benzoylformate (v(max)/k(m) ratios of 6,640, 4,180, 3,300, and 2,050 u/mg/mm, respectively), with nadh as the exclusive coenzyme. for the reverse reaction, the enzyme accepted d-2-hydroxyacids but not l-2-hydroxyacids. although pane showed the highest degrees of identity to putative nadp-dependent 2-ketopantoate reductases  (kprs), it did not exhibit kpr activity. sequence homology analysis revealed that, together with the d-mandelate dehydrogenase of enterococcus faecium and probably other putative kprs, pane belongs to a new family of d-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases which is unrelated to the well-described d-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase family. its probable physiological role is to regenerate the nad(+) necessary to catabolize branched-chain amino acids, leading to the production of  atp and aroma compounds.

AB  == aims: strain lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis bv. diacetylactis s50 harbours five theta-replicating plasmids (ps6, ps7a, ps7b, ps80 and ps140). the aim of this study was to characterize domains involved in the replication and conjugative mobilization of the small plasmids ps7a and ps7b, which are structurally very similar. methods and results: complete nucleotide sequences of ps7a and ps7b were determined by cloning dna fragments of different sizes into escherichia coli vectors. linearized plasmids and four ecori fragments of the ps7a and ps7b were cloned into an origin probe vector. constructed plasmids (psev10, psk10, pise1a and pise1b) were able to replicate in the strain l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363. in addition, experiments showed that plasmids ps7a and ps7b contained orit sequences and their conjugative transfer directly depended on the presence of ps80 in donor cells. conclusions: plasmids ps7a and ps7b contained typical lactococcal theta replication origin and repb gene that enable them to replicate  in the strain l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363. plasmid ps80 plays a key role in  the conjugative transfer of small plasmids. significance and impact of the study: plasmids ps7a and ps7b-based derivatives could be valuable tools for genetic manipulation, studying processes of plasmid maintenance and horizontal gene transfer in lactococci.

TI  == improvement of bacterial transformation efficiency using plasmid artificial modification.
AB  == we have developed a method to improve the transformation efficiency in genome-sequenced bacteria, using 'plasmid artificial modification' (pam), using the host's own restriction system. in this method, a shuttle vector was pre-methylated in escherichia coli cells, which carry all the putative genes encoding the dna modification enzymes of the target microorganism, before electroporation was performed. in the case of bifidobacterium adolescentis atcc15703 and pkkt427 (3.9 kb e. coli-bifidobacterium shuttle vector), introducing two type ii dna methyltransferase genes lead to an enhancement in the transformation efficiency by five orders of magnitude. this concept was also applicable to a type i restriction system. in the case of lactococcus lactis io-1, by using pam with a putative type i methyltransferase system, hsdms1, the transformation efficiency was improved by a factor of seven over that without pam.

TI  == a mutant screen reveals rnase e as a silencer of group ii intron retromobility in escherichia coli.
AB  == group ii introns are mobile retroelements that invade their hosts. the lactococcus lactis group ii intron recruits cellular polymerases, nucleases, and  dna ligase to complete the retromobility process in escherichia coli. here we describe a genetic screen with a tn5 transposon library to identify other e. coli functions involved in retromobility of the l. lactis ltrb intron. thirteen disruptions that reproducibly resulted in increased or decreased retrohoming levels into the e. coli chromosome were isolated. these functions were classified as factors involved in rna processing, dna replication, energy metabolism, and global regulation. here we characterize a novel mutant in the rne promoter region, which regulates rnase e expression. retrohoming and retrotransposition levels are elevated in the rnetn5 mutant. the stimulatory effect of the mutation  on retromobility results from intron rna accumulation in the rnase e mutant. these results suggest that rnase e, which is the central component of the rna degradosome, could regulate retrohoming levels in response to cellular physiology.

TI  == production of biologically active cxc chemokines by lactococcus lactis: evaluation of its potential as a novel mucosal vaccine adjuvant.
AB  == chemokines have been described as essential mediators in leukocytes migration to  inflammatory sites and to secondary lymphoid organs. mig and ip-10 are two cxc chemokines that recruit mononuclear cells in vivo and inhibit angiogenesis. in addition to their chemotactic roles, mig and ip-10 have also an important role in the adaptative immune response. in this study, we asked whether a food-grade bacterium, lactococcus lactis, is able to produce a fusion protein comprising mig and ip-10 (mig::ip-10). the activity of the recombinant mig::ip-10 produced by the genetically engineered l. lactis (ll-mig::ip-10) was confirmed in a murine spleen cells chemotaxis assay. moreover, the adjuvant properties of ll-mig::ip-10 strain were evaluated in mice by the co-expression of a model antigen, the human  papillomavirus type 16 e7 protein. our data show that ll-mig::ip-10 can produce a genetic fusion of mig::ip-10 biologically active. this recombinant strain represents a potential candidate for the development of new strategies for mucosal vaccination.

AB  == clostridium difficile infection is increasing in both frequency and severity, with the emergence of new highly virulent strains highlighting the need for more  rapid and effective methods of control. here, we show that bacteriophage endolysin can be used to inhibit and kill c. difficile. the genome sequence of a  novel bacteriophage that is active against c. difficile was determined, and the bacteriophage endolysin gene was subcloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the partially purified endolysin was active against 30 diverse strains of c. difficile, and importantly, this group included strains of the major epidemic ribotype 027 (b1/nap1). in contrast, a range of commensal species that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract, including several representatives of the clostridium-like firmicutes, were insensitive to the endolysin. this endolysin provides a platform for the generation of both therapeutic and detection systems  to combat the c. difficile problem. to investigate a method for the protected delivery and production of the lysin in the gastrointestinal tract, we demonstrated the expression of active cd27l endolysin in the lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis mg1363.

AB  == the microbial diversity within alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the alpujarra mountains (granada, south-east spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community dna. a collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analyses. isolates on man-rogosa and sharpe-agar (mrs), m17-glucose agar and kenner fecal (kf)-agar medium were identified by specific pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. the predominant genus was lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of lb. plantarum and lb. brevis. other lactic-acid bacteria identified were pediococcus urinaequi, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuc. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci enterococcus faecium and e. devriesei. cluster analyses of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. the gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to hafnia alvei species. the microbes occurring in alberquilla cheese were also studied by pcr temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) of the 16s rrna v3 region and partial 16s rrna sequencing of the ttge bands. the results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to lc. lactis, lb. paracasei, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. acidophilus and enterococcus sp. the non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as escherichia coli. all the enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaafm.  on the basis of their antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin b105 and mesenterocin y105, as revealed by pcr techniques.

TI  == the ser/thr/tyr phosphoproteome of lactococcus lactis il1403 reveals multiply phosphorylated proteins.
AB  == recent phosphoproteomics studies of several bacterial species have firmly established protein phosphorylation on ser/thr/tyr residues as a ptm in bacteria. in particular, our recent reports on the ser/thr/tyr phosphoproteomes of bacterial model organisms bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli detected over 100 phosphorylation events in each of the bacterial species. here we extend our analyses to lactococcus lactis, a lactic acid bacterium widely employed by the food industry, in which protein phosphorylation at ser/thr/tyr residues was barely studied at all. despite the lack of almost any prior evidence of ser/thr/tyr protein phosphorylation in l. lactis, we identified a phosphoproteome of a size comparable to that of e. coli and b. subtilis, with 73 phosphorylation  sites distributed over 63 different proteins. the presence of several multiply phosphorylated proteins, as well as over-representation of phosphothreonines seems to be the distinguishing features of the l. lactis phosphoproteome. evolutionary comparison and the conservation of phosphorylation sites in different bacterial organisms indicate that a majority of the detected phosphorylation sites are species-specific, and therefore have probably co-evolved with the adaptation of the bacterial species to their present-day ecological niches.

TI  == group ii intron protein localization and insertion sites are affected by polyphosphate.
AB  == mobile group ii introns consist of a catalytic intron rna and an intron-encoded protein with reverse transcriptase activity, which act together in a ribonucleoprotein particle to promote dna integration during intron mobility. previously, we found that the lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb intron-encoded protein (ltra) expressed alone or with the intron rna to form ribonucleoprotein particles localizes to bacterial cellular poles, potentially accounting for the intron's preferential insertion in the oric and ter regions of the escherichia coli chromosome. here, by using cell microarrays and automated fluorescence microscopy to screen a transposon-insertion library, we identified five e. coli genes (gppa, uhpt, wcak, ynbc, and zntr) whose disruption results in both an increased proportion of cells with more diffuse ltra localization and a more uniform genomic distribution of ll.ltrb-insertion sites. surprisingly, we find that a common factor affecting ltra localization in these and other disruptants is the accumulation of intracellular polyphosphate, which appears to bind ltra and other basic proteins and delocalize them away from the poles. our findings show that the intracellular localization of a group ii intron-encoded protein is a major determinant of insertion-site preference. more generally, our results suggest that polyphosphate accumulation may provide a means of localizing proteins to different sites of action during cellular stress or entry into stationary phase,  with potentially wide physiological consequences.

AB  == this study reports the development of several cloning vectors for bifidobacteria  based on the replicon of pbc1, a cryptic plasmid from bifidobacterium catenulatum l48 thought to replicate via the theta mode. these vectors, in which antibiotic resistance genes encoding either erythromycin or tetracycline resistance acted as selection markers, were able to replicate in a series of eight bifidobacterium species at frequencies ranging from 4.0 x 10(1) to 1.0 x 10(5) transformants microg(-1) but not in lactococcus lactis or lactobacillus casei. they showed a relative copy number of around 30 molecules per chromosome equivalent and a good  segregational stability, with more than 95% of the cells retaining the vectors after 80 to 100 generations in the absence of selection. vectors contain multiple cloning sites of different lengths, and the laczalpha peptide gene was introduced into one of the molecules, thus allowing the easy selection of colonies harboring recombinant plasmids in escherichia coli. the functionality of the vectors for engineering bifidobacterium strains was assessed by cloning and examining the expression of an alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase gene belonging to bifidobacterium longum. e. coli and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum recombinant clones were stable and showed an increase in alpha-arabinofuranosidase activity of over 100-fold compared to that of the untransformed hosts.

TI  == plasmid pcs1966, a new selection/counterselection tool for lactic acid bacterium  strain construction based on the orop gene, encoding an orotate transporter from  lactococcus lactis.
AB  == in this paper we describe the new selection/counterselection vector pcs1966, which is suitable for both sequence-specific integration based on homologous recombination and integration in a bacteriophage attachment site. this plasmid harbors orop, which encodes a dedicated orotate transporter, and can replicate only in escherichia coli. selection for integration is performed primarily by resistance to erythromycin; alternatively, the ability to utilize orotate as a pyrimidine source in a pyrimidine auxotrophic mutant could be utilized. besides allowing the cell to utilize orotate, the transporter renders the cell sensitive  to 5-fluoroorotate. this sensitivity is used to select for loss of the plasmid. when expressed from its own promoter, orop was toxic to e. coli, whereas in lactococcus lactis the level of expression of orop from a chromosomal copy was too low to confer 5-fluoroorotate sensitivity. in order to obtain a plasmid that  confers 5-fluoroorotate sensitivity when it is integrated into the chromosome of  l. lactis and at the same time can be stably maintained in e. coli, the expression of the orop gene was controlled from a synthetic promoter conferring these traits. to demonstrate its use, a number of l. lactis strains expressing triosephosphate isomerase (tpia) at different levels were constructed.

TI  == the lactococcus lactis fabf fatty acid synthetic enzyme can functionally replace  both the fabb and fabf proteins of escherichia coli and the fabh protein of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the genome of lactococcus lactis encodes a single long chain 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase. this is in contrast to its close relative, enterococcus faecalis, and to escherichia coli, both of which have two such enzymes. in e. faecalis and e. coli, one of the two long chain synthases (fabo and fabb, respectively) has a role in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis that cannot be satisfied by fabf, the other long chain synthase. since l. lactis has only a single long chain 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (annotated as fabf), it seemed likely that this enzyme must function both in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis and in elongation of short chain acyl carrier protein substrates to the c18 fatty acids found in the cellular phospholipids. we report that this is the case. expression of l. lactis fabf can functionally replace both fabb and fabf in e. coli, although it does not restore thermal regulation of phospholipid fatty acid composition to e. coli fabf mutant strains. the lack of thermal regulation was predictable because wild-type l. lactis was found not to show any significant change in fatty acid composition with growth temperature. we also report that overproduction of l. lactis fabf allows growth of an l. lactis mutant strain that lacks the fabh short chain 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase. the strain tested was a derivative (called the fabh bypass strain) of the original fabh deletion strain that had acquired the ability to grow when supplemented with octanoate. upon introduction of a fabf overexpression plasmid into this strain, growth proceeded normally in the absence of fatty acid supplementation. moreover, this strain had a normal rate of fatty acid synthesis and a normal fatty acid composition. both the fabh bypass strain that overproduced fabf and the wild type strain incorporated much less exogenous octanoate into long chain phospholipid fatty acids than did the fabh bypass strain. incorporation of octanoate and decanoate labeled with deuterium showed that these acids were incorporated intact as the distal methyl and methylene groups of the long chain fatty acids.

TI  == listeria monocytogenes and salmonella spp. in raw milk produced in brazil: occurrence and interference of indigenous microbiota in their isolation and development.
AB  == this study aimed to verify the occurrence of listeria monocytogenes and salmonella spp. in raw milk produced in brazil. on account of the poor microbiological quality of this product, possible interference from the indigenous microbiota in these pathogens was also evaluated. two-hundred and ten  raw milk samples were collected in four important milk-producing areas in brazil, tested for l. monocytogenes and salmonella spp. presence, and for enumeration of  indicator microorganisms: mesophilic aerobes, total coliforms and escherichia coli. the interference of the indigenous microbiota in the isolation procedures was also tested, as well the frequency of naturally occurring raw milk strains with antagonistic activity against both pathogens. the pathogens were not isolated in any raw milk sample, but poor microbiological quality was confirmed by the high levels of indicator microorganisms. when present at high levels, the  indigenous microbiota generated an evident interference in the methodologies of l. monocytogenes and salmonella spp. isolation, mainly when the pathogens appeared at low levels. three-hundred and sixty raw milk strains were tested for  antagonistic activity against both pathogens, and 91 (25.3%) showed inhibitory activity against l. monocytogenes and 33 (9.2%) against salmonella spp. the majority of the antagonistic strains were identified as lactic acid bacteria species, mainly lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and enterococcus faecium, known  by antimicrobial substance production.

TI  == innate inflammatory responses to the gram-positive bacterium lactococcus lactis.
AB  == lactococcus lactis is a non-pathogenic and non-colonizing gram-positive bacterium commonly used in the dairy industry. to support the potential applications of this bacterium, such as use as an oral live vaccine, it is of interest to investigate the adjuvant properties of l. lactis. we compared the proinflammatory effects of l. lactis with two non-pathogenic gram-negative bacteria: escherichia  coli and salmonella typhi, a widely studied live vaccine. the gene expression profiles of chemokines induced by the three bacteria were examined in macrophages in vitro and in cells recruited into murine air-pouches in vivo. in addition, we  studied the effect of co-incubating bacteria with dendritic cells (dcs) generated from mice bone marrow. we demonstrate that l. lactis exhibits proinflammatory effects, which indicates a capacity for adjuvanticity by this bacterium.

AB  == diseases associated with porcine circovirus type 2 (pcv2) infections are becoming a major problem for the swine industry worldwide. the capsid protein (cap) of pcv2 is an antigen important for both early diagnosis and development of vaccines. in this study, lactococcus lactis was used as vehicle to deliver the pcv2 antigen in an attempt to develop oral vaccine. a cap gene with a deleted nuclear localization signal sequence (dcap) was cloned into an escherichia coli/l. lactis shuttle vector psec: leiss under the control of a nisin promoter.  intracellular and extracellular expression of the dcap was confirmed by western blot analysis. significantly higher levels of pcv2-specific igg in the sera of mice were observed upon oral administration of strain cultures expressing the pcv2 antigen. these results suggest that it is feasible to use l. lactis as an antigen delivery vehicle for developing oral vaccines against pcv2 infection.

TI  == expression of c-terminal repeat region of peptidoglycan hydrolase of lactococcus  lactis il1403 in methylotrophic yeast pichia pastoris.
AB  == the c-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (cph) of lactococcus lactis  il1403 produced intracellularly in escherichia coli was able to attach to the surface of cells of lactobacillus casei nrrl b-441, bacillus subtilis 168, e. coli xl1-blue and saccharomyces cerevisiae ifo0216. therefore, this domain is a suitable fusion partner for the adhesion of proteins to cell surfaces. the production of cell-surface adhesive proteins using this domain in pichia pastoris is particularly attractive, because this organism has better capability to allow  the correct folding of the recombinant proteins than prokaryotic hosts. however,  when this domain is produced in this yeast, its cell-surface binding activity may be limited by glycosylation. in this study, therefore, we constructed a cph mutant (cphm) devoid of the potential n-glycosylation sites by site-directed mutagenesis. cphm was successfully expressed extracellularly in p. pastoris (gs115) using the methanol inducible aox1 promoter with an alpha-mating factor signal sequence, whereas the native cph was not produced in this host. western blot analysis revealed that the apparent molecular size of cphm was 18 kda greater than that of cph produced in e. coli (32 kda), which is attributed to o-glycosylation. however, cphm produced in p. pastoris was capable of binding to  the cell surfaces despite its modification by the yeast, and its dissociation rate constant from the surface of l. casei nrrl b-441 cells was 3.5-fold lower than that of cph produced in e. coli. these results demonstrate the applicability of the constructed domain (cphm) for the production of cell-surface adhesive proteins in p. pastoris.

TI  == bidirectional cell-surface anchoring function of c-terminal repeat region of peptidoglycan hydrolase of lactococcus lactis il1403.
AB  == with the aim of constructing an efficient protein display system for lactic acid  bacteria (labs), the effect of fusion direction on the cell-surface binding activity of the c-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (cph) of lactococcus lactis il1403 was studied. cph fused to the alpha-amylase (amy) of streptococcus bovis 148 either at its c-terminus (cph-amy) or at its n-terminus (amy-cph) was expressed intracellularly in escherichia coli. this domain was able to direct binding of amy to the surface of l. lactis atcc 19435 in both constructs. however, the number of bound molecules per cell and the specific activity for starch digestion in the case of cph-amy were 3 and 14 times greater  than those in the case of amy-cph, respectively. of the labs tested, l. lactis atcc 19435 showed the highest binding capability for cph-amy, up to 6 x 10(4) molecules per cell, with a dissociation rate constant of 5.00 x 10(-5) s(-1). the binding of cph-amy to the surface of lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc 9649 cells was very stable with a dissociation rate constant of 6.96 x 10(-6) s(-1). the production of cph-amy in the soluble form increased 3-fold as a result of coexpression with a molecular chaperone, trigger factor. the results of this study suggest the usefulness of cph as a bidirectional anchor protein for the production of cell-surface adhesive enzymes in e. coli. furthermore, the importance of the fusion direction of cph in determining cell-surface binding and enzymatic activities was shown.

TI  == microbiological quality of fermented milk produced by repeated-batch culture.
AB  == using a starter culture containing lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and acetobacter orientalis, repeated-batch culture for fermented-milk production was  carried out for 14 d. the ph decreased to approximately 4.3 and the milk solidified stably when the mixing ratio of fermented-milk to fresh milk was set at a level as high as 10%. the microbial population gradually changed as the culture progressed, and the cell densities of lactic and acetic acid bacteria finally leveled off to constant values. the quality of the fermented-milk became  almost constant with respect to the changes in the cell densities of the lactic and acetic acid bacteria. escherichia coli was then inoculated into the fermented-milk to simulate household contamination. e. coli was washed out with the progress of the repeated-batch culture, and thus showed no adverse effects on the fermented-milk production.

TI  == nisin-controlled extracellular production of apidaecin in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == apidaecins are heat-stable, nonhelical antibacterial peptides isolated from lymph fluid of the honeybee (apis mellifera). these peptides are active against a wide  range of gram-negative bacteria and they are the most prominent components of the honeybee humoral defense against microbial invasion. in the present study, one isoform of apidaecin, apidaecin ho, was expressed extracellularly in the food-grade bacterium lactococcus lactis. results showed that expression driven by the lactococcal nisa promoter and usp45 signal peptide resulted in efficient secretion of apidaecin in l. lactis subsp. cremoris nz9000. recombinant apidaecin was purified by gel filtration and semipreparative rp-hplc, and about 10 mg active recombinant apidaecin was obtained from 1,000 ml culture. this is the first report on the nisin-controlled extracellular production of active apidaecin in l. lacits. the expression and delivery of apidaecin in the food-grade l. lactis may provide a clue to facilitate the widespread application of apidaecin in the control and prevention of gram-negative bacteria infections of human and animals.

TI  == the inhibitory spectrum of thermophilin 9 from streptococcus thermophilus lmd-9 depends on the production of multiple peptides and the activity of blpg(st), a thiol-disulfide oxidase.
AB  == the blp(st) cluster of streptococcus thermophilus lmd-9 was recently shown to contain all the genetic information required for the production of bacteriocins active against other s. thermophilus strains. in this study, we further investigated the antimicrobial activity of s. thermophilus lmd-9 by testing the susceptibility of 31 bacterial species (87 strains). we showed that lmd-9 displays an inhibitory spectrum targeted toward related gram-positive bacteria, including pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes. using deletion mutants, we investigated the contribution of the three putative bacteriocin-encoding operons  blpd(st)-orf2, blpu(st)-orf3, and blpe(st)-blpf(st) (bac(st) operons) and of the  blpg(st) gene, which encodes a putative modification protein, to the inhibitory spectrum and immunity of strain lmd-9. our results present evidence that the blp(st) locus encodes a multipeptide bacteriocin system called thermophilin 9. among the four class ii bacteriocin-like peptides encoded within the bac(st) operons, blpd(st) alone was sufficient to inhibit the growth of most thermophilin 9-sensitive species. the blpd(st) gene forms an operon with its associated immunity gene(s), and this functional bacteriocin/immunity module could easily be transferred to lactococcus lactis. the remaining three bac(st) peptides, blpu(st), blpe(st), and blpf(st), confer poor antimicrobial activity but act as enhancers of the antagonistic activity of thermophilin 9 by an unknown mechanism. the blpg(st) gene was also shown to be specifically required for the antilisteria activity of thermophilin 9, since its deletion abolished the sensitivities of most listeria species. by complementation of the motility deficiency of escherichia coli dsba, we showed that blpg(st) encodes a functional thiol-disulfide oxidase, suggesting an important role for disulfide bridges within thermophilin 9.

TI  == crystal structure of the major periplasmic domain of the bacterial membrane protein assembly facilitator yidc.
AB  == the essential bacterial membrane protein yidc facilitates insertion and assembly  of proteins destined for integration into the inner membrane. it has homologues in both mitochondria and chloroplasts. here we report the crystal structure of the escherichia coli yidc major periplasmic domain (yidcecp1) at 2.5a resolution. this domain is present in yidc from gram-negative bacteria and is more than half  the size of the full-length protein. the structure reveals that yidcecp1 is made  up of a large twisted beta-sandwich protein fold with a c-terminal alpha-helix that packs against one face of the beta-sandwich. our structure and sequence analysis reveals that the c-terminal alpha-helix and the beta-sheet that it lays  against are the most conserved regions of the domain. the region corresponding to the c-terminal alpha-helix was previously shown to be important for the protein insertase function of yidc and is conserved in other yidc-like proteins. the structure reveals that a region of yidc that was previously shown to be involved  in binding to secf maps to one edge of the beta-sandwich. electrostatic analysis  of the molecular surface for this region of yidc reveals a predominantly charged  surface and suggests that the secf-yidc interaction may be electrostatic in nature. interestingly, yidcecp1 has significant structural similarity to galactose mutarotase from lactococcus lactis, suggesting that this domain may have another function besides its role in membrane protein assembly.

TI  == structure of the branched-chain keto acid decarboxylase (kdca) from lactococcus lactis provides insights into the structural basis for the chemoselective and enantioselective carboligation reaction.
AB  == the thiamin diphosphate (thdp) dependent branched-chain keto acid decarboxylase (kdca) from lactococcus lactis catalyzes the decarboxylation of 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid to 3-methylpropanal (isobutyraldehyde) and co2. the enzyme is also able to catalyze carboligation reactions with an exceptionally broad substrate range, a feature that makes kdca a potentially valuable biocatalyst for c-c bond formation, in particular for the enzymatic synthesis of  diversely substituted 2-hydroxyketones with high enantioselectivity. the crystal  structures of recombinant holo-kdca and of a complex with an inhibitory thdp analogue mimicking a reaction intermediate have been determined to resolutions of 1.6 and 1.8 a, respectively. kdca shows the fold and cofactor-protein interactions typical of thiamin-dependent enzymes. in contrast to the tetrameric  assembly displayed by most other thdp-dependent decarboxylases of known structure, kdca is a homodimer. the crystal structures provide insights into the  structural basis of substrate selectivity and stereoselectivity of the enzyme and thus are suitable as a framework for the redesign of the substrate profile in carboligation reactions.

AB  == the lactococcus lactis nrrl b-1821 prolidase gene was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli. under suboptimum growth conditions, recombinant soluble and active prolidase was produced; in contrast, inclusion bodies were formed under conditions preferred for cell growth. recombinant prolidase retained more than half its full activity between 30 and 60 degrees c, and was completely inactivated after 30 min at 70 degrees c. cd analysis confirmed that prolidase was inactivated at 67 degrees c. the enzyme was active under weak alkali to weak  acidic conditions, and showed maximum activity at ph 7.0. although these characteristics are similar to those for other reported prolidases, this prolidase was distinctive for two kinetic characteristics. firstly, different substrate specificity was observed for its two preferred metal cations, zinc and  manganese: leu-pro was preferred with zinc, whereas arg-pro was preferred with manganese. secondly, the enzyme showed an allosteric response to changes in substrate concentrations, with hill constants of 1.53 for leu-pro and 1.57 for arg-pro. molecular modeling of this prolidase suggests that these unique characteristics may be attributed to a loop structure near the active site.

TI  == on the energy-dependence of hoechst 33342 transport by the abc transporter lmra.
AB  == lmra is an atp-binding cassette (abc) multidrug transporter from lactococcus lactis, and is a structural homologue of the human multidrug resistance p-glycoprotein (abcb1), the overexpression of which is associated with multidrug  resistance in tumours. we recently observed that a truncated version of lmra lacking the nucleotide-binding domain mediates a proton motive force-dependent ethidium transport reaction by catalyzing proton-ethidium symport. this finding raised the question whether proton motive force-dependent transport can also be observed for other drugs, and whether this reaction is also relevant for full-length lmra. furthermore, the observations on lmra-md raised the question whether atp-dependent transport by lmra in intact cells could be due to the activity of independent abc transporters that might become upregulated in the lactococcal cells due to the overexpression of lmra; the recently identified abc  multidrug transporter lmrcd was put forward as a possible candidate. here, we investigated the energy coupling to the transport of the amphiphilic dye hoechst  33342 in proteoliposomes containing purified lmra. for this purpose, lmra was obtained from lactococcal cells lacking the genomic lmra and lmrcd genes, in which lmra was expressed from a plasmid. to separate atp-dependence from proton motive force-dependence, we also used mutant lmra proteins, which were affected in their ability to hydrolyse atp. our studies in proteoliposomes demonstrate that lmra can catalyze hoechst 33342 transport independent of auxiliary proteins, in an atp-dependent fashion and a transmembrane chemical proton gradient (interior acidic)-dependent fashion.

TI  == characterization of the copr regulon of lactococcus lactis il1403.
AB  == to identify components of the copper homeostatic mechanism of lactococcus lactis, we employed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to detect changes in the proteome in response to copper. three proteins upregulated by copper were identified: glyoxylase i (yaia), a nitroreductase (ytjd), and lactate oxidase (lcto). the promoter regions of these genes feature cop boxes of consensus tacanntgta, which  are the binding site of copy-type copper-responsive repressors. a genome-wide search for cop boxes revealed 28 such sequence motifs. they were tested by electrophoretic mobility shift assays for the interaction with purified copr, the copy-type repressor of l. lactis. seven of the cop boxes interacted with copr in  a copper-sensitive manner. they were present in the promoter region of five genes, lcto, ytjd, copb, ydid, and yahc; and two polycistronic operons, yahcd-yaiab and coprza. induction of these genes by copper was confirmed by real-time quantitative pcr. the coprza operon encodes the copr repressor of the regulon; a copper chaperone, copz; and a putative copper atpase, copa. when expressed in escherichia coli, the coprza operon conferred copper resistance, suggesting that it functions in copper export from the cytoplasm. other member genes of the copr regulon may similarly be involved in copper metabolism.

TI  == manipulation for plasmid elimination by transforming synthetic competitors diversifies lactococcus lactis starters applicable to food products.
AB  == this study was designed selectively to eliminate a theta-plasmid from lactococcus lactis strains by transforming synthetic competitors. a shuttle vector for escherichia coli and l. lactis, pdb1, was constructed by ligating a partial replicon of pdr1-1b, which is a 7.3 kb theta-plasmid in l. lactis drc1, with an erythromycin resistance gene into pbluescript ii ks(+). this versatile vector was used to construct competitors to common lactococcal theta-plasmids. pdb1 contains the 5' half of the replication origin and the 3' region of repb of pdr1-1b, but lacks the 1.1-kb region normally found between these two segments. a set of primers, pv3 and pv4, was designed to amplify the 1.1-kb middle parts of the general theta-replicons of lactococcal plasmids. when the pcr products were cloned into the nru i and xho i sites of pdb1, synthetic replicons were constructed and replication activity was restored. a number of theta-plasmids in  l. lactis ssp. lactis and cremoris were eliminated selectively by transforming the synthetic competitors. these competitors were easily eliminated by subculture for a short time in the absence of selection. the resulting variants contained no exogenous dna and are suitable for food products, since part of the phenotype was altered without altering other plasmids indispensable for fermentation.

TI  == the orotate transporter encoded by orop from lactococcus lactis is required for orotate utilization and has utility as a food-grade selectable marker.
AB  == a new lactococcal plasmid, pdboro, was isolated from the lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis strain db0410. this plasmid is responsible for the sensitivity of db0410 to the toxic pyrimidine analogue 5-fluoroorotate. the complete nucleotide sequence has been determined and amounts to 16 404 bp. of 15  orfs encountered, three were found to be insertion sequence (is) elements, identified as two is946 and one is982. two orfs are incomplete due to the insertion of an is element in their c-terminal region. homologues for four orfs were found in the il1403 sequence: the copb gene, coding for a copper-potassium-transporting atpase b, and the ysba, ysbb and ysbc genes. the structural organization of the pdboro replication region is highly similar to other theta-replicating plasmids in both the cis- (repa) and trans-acting (repb and orfx) sequences. by plasmid deletion analysis and molecular cloning, a single locus on pdboro was found to confer sensitivity to 5-fluoroorotate. it was identified as ysbc, but renamed orop in order to reflect its function. the orop gene was found to be essential for the utilization of orotate as the sole pyrimidine source in a strain deficient in pyrimidine de novo synthesis. the amino acid sequence encoded by the orf showed the characteristic features of a membrane protein. therefore, orop most probably encodes an orotate transporter. surprisingly, homologues of orop could be identified in the genomes of both l. lactis mg1363 and l. lactis il1403 despite the fact that these strains were unable to significantly utilize orotate. cloning of orop in escherichia coli and  bacillus subtilis showed that the orotate transport phenotype could be transformed to both organisms. the findings presented indicate that orop can be used as a powerful, food-grade selection/counterselection marker in many different organisms.

TI  == nisc, the cyclase of the lantibiotic nisin, can catalyze cyclization of designed  nonlantibiotic peptides.
AB  == nisin is a pentacyclic peptide antibiotic active against gram-positive bacteria.  its thioether rings are formed by two enzymatic steps: nisin dehydratase (nisb)-mediated dehydration of serines and threonines followed by nisin cyclase (nisc)-catalyzed enantioselective coupling of cysteines to the formed dehydroresidues. here, we report the in vivo activity of nisc to cyclize a wide array of unrelated and designed peptides that were fused to the nisin leader peptide. to assess the role of nisc, leader peptide fusions, secreted by lactococcus lactis cells containing nisbt with or without nisc were compared. in  hexapeptides, a dehydroalanine could spontaneously react with a more c-terminally located cysteine. in contrast, peptides containing dehydrobutyrines require nisc  for cyclization. in agreement with in silico predictions nisc could efficiently cyclize the hexapeptides adhbveck and idhbpgck, but adhbvwce was not cyclized. interestingly, nisc could efficiently catalyze the synthesis of peptides with intertwined rings and of a designed polyhexapeptide containing four thioether rings. taken together the data demonstrate that nisc can be widely applied for the cyclization and stabilization of nonlantibiotic peptides.

AB  == the lys(gay) of lactobacillus gasseri jcm 1131(t) phage phigay endolysin was purified to homogeneity using the escherichia coli/his.tag system. zymographic and spectrophotometric assays showed that lys(gay) lysed over 20 heated gram-positive bacterial species as the substrates, including lactobacilli, lactococci, enterococci, micrococci, and staphylococci. the enzymatic activity had the ph and temperature optima of about 6.5 and 37 degrees c, respectively. amino-acid substitution analysis revealed that 13 residues of lys(gay) were involved in cell-lytic activity: in the beta/alpha(gay) domain, g10, d12, e33, d36, h60, y61, d96, e98, v124, l132, and d198; in the sh3b(gay) domain, y272 and  w284. in addition, deletion analysis demonstrated that the beta/alpha(gay) domain of n-terminal 216 residues is the core enzyme portion, although the cell-lytic ability is lower than that of lys(gay). these mutational experiments suggested that beta/alpha(gay) (in which two acidic residues of d12 and e98 likely act as catalytic residues) is responsible for cell-lytic activity, and sh3b(gay) promotes beta/alpha(gay) possibly through cell-wall binding function. the purified his-tagged sh3b(gay) domain containing 94 residues from s217 to k310 (i) bound to gram-positive bacteria susceptible to lys(gay), (ii) induced aggregation of exponentially growing cells of l. gasseri jcm 1131(t), l. casei iam 1045, lactococcus lactis c2, l. lactis mg 1363, and enterococcus hirae iam 1262 by forming thread-like chained cells, (iii) inhibited lytic activity of lys(gay), and (iv) impeded autolysis of l. gasseri jcm 1131(t) in buffer systems. a truncated protein hdeltash3b(gay) lacking in n-terminal 21 residues (from s217 to e237) of sh3b(gay) and an amino-acid substituted protein hsh3b(gay)g (w284g) lost the activities of hsh3b(gay), showing that the n-terminal region and w284 probably play important roles in the sh3b(gay) function(s).

TI  == lactococcus lactis as expression host for the biosynthetic incorporation of tryptophan analogues into recombinant proteins.
AB  == incorporation of trp (tryptophan) analogues into a protein may facilitate its structural analysis by spectroscopic techniques. development of a biological system for the biosynthetic incorpor-ation of such analogues into proteins is of  considerable importance. the gram-negative escherichia coli is the only prokaryotic expression host regularly used for the incorporation of trp analogues into recombinant proteins. here, we present the use of the versatile gram-positive expression host lactococcus lactis for the incorporation of trp analogues. the availability of a tightly regulated expression system for this organism, the potential to secrete modified proteins into the growth medium and the construction of the trp-synthetase deletion strain pa1002 of l. lactis rendered this organism potentially an efficient tool for the incorporation of trp analogues into recombinant proteins. the trp analogues 7-azatryptophan, 5-fluorotryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan were incorporated with efficiencies of >97, >97 and 89% respectively. interestingly, 5-methyltrp (5-methyltryptophan) could be incorporated with 92% efficiency. successful biosynthetical incorporation of 5-methyltrp into recombinant proteins has not been reported previously.

TI  == characterization of n-deoxyribosyltransferase from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  == a nucleoside n-deoxyribosyltransferase-homologous gene was detected by homological search in the genomic dna of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. the gene yejd is composed of 477 nucleotides encoding 159 amino acids with only 25% identity, which is low in comparison to the amino acid sequences of the n-deoxyribosyltransferases from other lactic acid bacteria, i.e. lactobacillus leichmannii and lactobacillus helveticus. the residues responsible for catalytic  and substrate-binding sites in known enzymes are conserved at gln49, asp73, asp93 (or asp95), and glu101, respectively. the recombinant yejd expressed in escherichia coli shows a 2-deoxyribosyl transfer activity to and from both bases  of purine and pyrimidine, showing that yejd should be categorized as a class ii n-deoxyribosyltransferase. interestingly, the base-exchange activity as well as the heat stability of yejd was enhanced by the presence of monovalent cations such as k(+), nh(4)(+), and rb(+), indicating that the lactococcus enzyme is a k(+)-activated type ii enzyme. however, divalent cations including mg(2+) and ca(2+) significantly inhibit the activity. whether or not the yejd gene product actually participates in the nucleoside salvage pathway of lc. lactis remains unclear, but the lactic acid bacterium possesses the gene coding for the nucleoside n-deoxyribosyltransferase activated by k(+) on its genome.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of divercin rv41 produced and secreted by lactococcus lactis.
AB  == divercin v41 is a class iia bacteriocin produced by carnobacterium divergens v41  with a strong anti-listeria activity. we have previously produced a recombinant form of divercin v41 (dvnrv41) in escherichia coli strain origami, by cloning a synthetic gene that codes for a mature divercin rv41 peptide. in this work we describe the inducible expression and secretion of dvnrv41 in the food-grade lactic acid bacterium, lactococcus lactis. the production of dvnrv41 by recombinant l. lactis was confirmed and quantified by western blot and elisa assays. in addition, anti-listeria activity of dvnrv41 was determined using an agar diffusion test. although the levels of dvnrv41 produced by recombinant l. lactis were similar to those produced by the natural host, c. divergens v41, the  specific activities were lower. in conclusion, our data show that the bacteriocin dvnrv41 is produced and secreted in an active form by l. lactis and that this approach may have important applications in the preservation of foods.

TI  == nisin biosynthesis in vitro.
AB  == the lantibiotic nisin is produced by lactococcus lactis. in the biosynthesis of nisin, the enzyme nisb dehydrates nisin precursor, and the enzyme nisc is needed  for lanthionine formation. in this study, the nisa gene encoding the nisin precursor, and the genes nisb and nisc of the lantibiotic modification machinery  were expressed together in vitro by the rapid translation system (rts). analysis  of the rts mixture showed that fully modified nisin precursor was formed. by treating the mixture with trypsin, active nisin was obtained. however, no nisin could be detected in the mixture without zinc supplementation, explained by the fact that nisc requires zinc for its function. the results revealed that the modification of nisin precursor, which is supposed to occur at the inner side of  the membrane by an enzyme complex consisting of nisb, nisc, and the transporter nist, can take place without membrane association and without nist. this in vitro production system for nisin opens up the possibility to produce nisin variants that cannot be producedin vivo. moreover, the system is a promising tool for utilizing the nisb and nisc enzymes for incorporation of thioether rings into medical peptides and hormones for increased stability.

AB  == the microflora of a kefir grain was identified using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy combined with 16s rrna gene sequencing. dna was extracted from the kefir grain and amplified in its 16s rdna v1 and v2 regions. to guarantee a good representation of the overall lactic acid bacteria populations,  dna amplification was performed separately with primers specific either to the dominant or to the less abundant bacterial groups. the amplified fragments were cloned in escherichia coli and then sequenced. sequences of the v1 region were gathered into 5 groups of similarity and identified by aligning with the sequences of a public library. the v1 region allowed the identification of lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, l. kefir, l. parakefir, and lactococcus lactis but was inappropriate for the identification of leuconostocs at species level. among  16s rdna variable regions, the v2 region showed the highest variability between leuconostoc species. nevertheless, even in the v2 region, differences were too tenuous for effective identification of l. mesenteroides. the methodology described here allowed detection of the dominant species within each targeted microbial group.

TI  == heterologous expression of linoleic acid isomerase from propionibacterium acnes and anti-proliferative activity of recombinant trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  == the linoleic acid isomerase enzyme from propionibacterium acnes responsible for bioconversion of linoleic acid to trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10, c12 cla) was cloned and overexpressed in lactococcus lactis and escherichia coli, resulting in between 30 and 50 % conversion rates of the substrate linoleic acid  to t10, c12 cla. the anti-proliferative activities of the fatty acids produced following isomerization of linoleic acid by l. lactis and e. coli were assessed using the human sw480 colon cancer cell line. fatty acids generated from both l.  lactis and e. coli contained a mixture of linoleic acid and t10, c12 cla at a ratio of approximately 1.35 : 1. following 5 days of incubation of sw480 cells with 5-20 microg ml(-1) (17.8-71.3 microm) of the t10, c12 cla, there was a significant (p<0.001) reduction in growth of the sw480 cancer cells compared with the linoleic acid control. cell viability after treatment with the highest concentration (20 microg ml(-1)) of the t10, c12 cla was reduced to 7.9 % (l. lactis cla) and 19.6 % (e. coli cla), compared with 95.4 % (control linoleic acid) and 31.7 % (pure t10, c12 cla). in conclusion, this is believed to represent the first report in which recombinant strains are capable of producing  cla with an anti-proliferative potential.

TI  == the unconventional xer recombination machinery of streptococci/lactococci.
AB  == homologous recombination between circular sister chromosomes during dna replication in bacteria can generate chromosome dimers that must be resolved into monomers prior to cell division. in escherichia coli, dimer resolution is achieved by site-specific recombination, xer recombination, involving two paralogous tyrosine recombinases, xerc and xerd, and a 28-bp recombination site (dif) located at the junction of the two replication arms. xer recombination is tightly controlled by the septal protein ftsk. xercd recombinases and ftsk are found on most sequenced eubacterial genomes, suggesting that the xer recombination system as described in e. coli is highly conserved among prokaryotes. we show here that streptococci and lactococci carry an alternative xer recombination machinery, organized in a single recombination module. this corresponds to an atypical 31-bp recombination site (dif(sl)) associated with a dedicated tyrosine recombinase (xers). in contrast to the e. coli xer system, only a single recombinase is required to recombine dif(sl), suggesting a different mechanism in the recombination process. despite this important difference, xers can only perform efficient recombination when dif(sl) sites are  located on chromosome dimers. moreover, the xers/dif(sl) recombination requires the streptococcal protein ftsk(sl), probably without the need for direct protein-protein interaction, which we demonstrated to be located at the division  septum of lactococcus lactis. acquisition of the xers recombination module can be considered as a landmark of the separation of streptococci/lactococci from other  firmicutes and support the view that xer recombination is a conserved cellular function in bacteria, but that can be achieved by functional analogs.

TI  == role of a qnr-like gene in the intrinsic resistance of enterococcus faecalis to fluoroquinolones.
AB  == fluoroquinolones are poorly active against enterococci. recently, plasmid-borne resistance to fluoroquinolones due to the qnr gene was reported in members of the enterobacteriaceae family. the gene encodes a pentapeptide repeat protein that protects dna gyrase from inhibition by fluoroquinolones. we have identified in the genome of enterococcus faecalis v583 a qnr-like gene, named e. faecalis qnr (qnr(e. faecalis)), encoding a putative pentapeptide repeat protein that shares 25% identity with qnr. to assess its potential role in the intrinsic resistance of e. faecalis to fluoroquinolones, qnr(e. faecalis) was inactivated in e. faecalis jh2-2 by insertion of the thermosensitive vector pg1kt. this strain was  then complemented with qnr(e. faecalis) cloned in the multicopy plasmid pori23. the effects of its overexpression were also studied. inactivation of the qnr(e. faecalis) gene resulted in twofold decreases in the mics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. when the gene was complemented or overexpressed, mics of fluoroquinolones increased four- to nine-fold, leading to mics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin equal to 32 mug/ml and 8 mug/ml, respectively. the e. faecalis qnr  (qnr(e. faecalis)) protein was produced and purified. qnr(e. faecalis) protein protected escherichia coli dna gyrase from inhibition by ofloxacin. the qnr(e. faecalis) gene was then introduced into e. coli dh10b, staphylococcus aureus rn4220, and lactococcus lactis il-1419 to study its heterologous expression. mics of the various fluoroquinolones tested increased 4- to 16-fold, showing that qnr(e. faecalis) conferred resistance to fluoroquinolones in various bacterial backgrounds. overexpression of qnr(e. faecalis) in enterococci or mobilization of the gene to other bacterial species may be anticipated as a possible new mechanism for fluoroquinolone resistance.

TI  == osmotic regulation of transcription in lactococcus lactis: ionic strength-dependent binding of the busr repressor to the busa promoter.
AB  == the busa locus of lactococcus lactis encodes a glycine betaine uptake system. at  low osmolarity, the transcription of busa is repressed by the busr protein, which is responsible for the osmotic inducibility of the busa promoter (busap). in this work, we investigated the mechanism of the osmo-dependent repression by busr. we  found that busr binding to the busa promoter is dependent on the ionic strength in vitro. using a busr derivative carrying a phosphorylation site and the escherichia coli rna polymerase holoenzyme, we showed that these proteins are able to form a stable ternary complex by both binding to the same busap fragment. the association/dissociation of busr to the rna polymerase-busap complex is strictly correlated to the surrounding ionic strength. together, these results suggest that during growth at low osmolarity busr represses transcription from busap at a step further the recruitment of the rna polymerase. at high osmolarity, an elevated cytoplasmic ionic strength would dissociate busr from busap, resulting in the osmotic induction of the busa operon.

TI  == two proton translocation pathways in a secondary active multidrug transporter.
AB  == lmrp is a secondary active multidrug transporter from lactococcus lactis. the protein belongs to the major facilitator superfamily and utilizes the electrochemical proton gradient (inside negative and alkaline) to extrude a wide  range of lipophilic cations from the cell. previous work has indicated that ethidium, a monovalent cationic substrate, is exported by lmrp by electrogenic antiport with two (or more) protons. this observation raised the question whether these protons are translocated sequentially along the same pathway, or through different routes. to address this question, we constructed a 3-d homology model of lmrp based on the high-resolution structure of the glycerol-3p/pi antiporter glpt from escherichia coli, and we tested by mutagenesis the possible proton conduction points suggested by this model. similar to the template, lmrp is predicted to contain an internal cavity formed at the interface between the two halves of the transporter. on the surface of this cavity lie two clusters of polar, aromatic and carboxylate residues with potentially important function in proton shuttling. cluster 1 in the c-terminal half contains d235 and e327 in immediate proximity of each other, and is located near the apex of the cavity. cluster 2 in the n-terminal half contains d142. analyses of lmrp mutants containing charge-conservative or carboxyl-to-amide replacements at positions 142, 235 and 327 suggest that d142 is part of a dedicated proton translocation pathway in the ethidium translocation reaction. in contrast, d235 and e327 are part of an independent pathway, in which d235 interacts with protons. e327 appears to modulate the pka of d235 and plays a role in the interaction with ethidium. these results are consistent with the proposal that major facilitator superfamily proteins consist of two membrane domains, one of which is involved in substrate binding and the other in ion coupling, and they indicate that there are two proton conduction pathways at play in the transport mechanism.

AB  == while plasmids are very commonly associated with the majority of the lactic acid  bacteria, they are only very rarely associated with lactobacillus delbrueckii, with only four characterized to date. in this study, the complete sequence of a native plasmid, pdoj1, from a strain of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was determined. it consisted of a circular dna molecule of 6,220 bp with a g+c content of 44.6% and a characteristic ori and encoded six open reading frames (orfs), of which functions could be predicted for three-a mobilization (mob) protein, a transposase, and a fused primase-helicase replication protein. comparative analysis of pdoj1 and the other available l. delbrueckii plasmids (plbb1, pjbl2, pn42, and pll1212) revealed a very similar organization and amino  acid identities between 85 and 98% for the putative proteins of all six predicted orfs from pdoj1, reflecting a common origin for l. delbrueckii plasmids. analysis of the fused primase-helicase replication gene found a similar fused organization only in the theta replicating group b plasmids from streptococcus thermophilus. this observation and the ability of the replicon to function in s. thermophilus support the idea that the origin of plasmids in l. delbrueckii was likely from s. thermophilus. this may reflect the close association of these two species in dairy fermentations, particularly yogurt production. as no vector based on plasmid replicons from l. delbrueckii has previously been constructed, an escherichia coli-l. delbrueckii shuttle cloning vector, pdoj4, was constructed from pdoj1, the p15a ori, the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pci372, and the  lacz polylinker from puc18. this cloning vector was successfully introduced into  e. coli, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, s. thermophilus, and lactococcus lactis. this shuttle cloning vector provides a new tool for molecular analysis of lactobacillus delbrueckii and other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == in vivo functional analyses of the type ii acyl carrier proteins of fatty acid biosynthesis.
AB  == acyl carrier protein (acp) is a key component of the fatty acid synthesis pathways of both type i and type ii synthesis systems. a large number of structure-function studies of various type ii acps have been reported, but all are in vitro studies that assayed function or interaction of mutant acps with various enzymes of fatty acid synthesis or transfer. hence in these studies functional properties of various mutant acps were assayed with only a subset of the many acp-interacting proteins, which may not give an accurate overall view of the function of these proteins in vivo. this is especially so because escherichia coli acp has been reported to interact with several proteins that have no known roles in lipid metabolism. we therefore tested a large number of mutant derivatives of e. coli acp carrying single amino acid substitutions for their abilities to restore growth to an e. coli strain carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in acpp, the gene that encodes acp. many of these mutant proteins had previously been tested in vitro thus providing data for comparison with our results. we found that several mutant acps containing substitutions of acp residues reported previously to be required for acp function in vitro support normal growth of the acpp mutant strain. however, several mutant proteins reported to be severely defective in vitro failed to support growth of the acpp strain in vivo (or supported only weak growth). a collection of acps from diverse bacteria and from three eukaryotic organelles was also tested. all of the bacterial acps tested restored growth to the e. coli acpp mutant strain except those from two related bacteria, enterococcus faecalis and lactococcus lactis. only one of the three eukaryotic organellar acps allowed growth. strikingly the acp is that of the apicoplast of plasmodium falciparum (the protozoan that causes malaria). the fact that an acp from a such diverse organism can replace acpp function in e. coli suggests that some of the protein-protein interactions detected for acpp may be not be essential for growth of e. coli.

AB  == the essential bacillus anthracis nrde gene carries a self-splicing group i intron with a putative homing endonuclease belonging to the giy-yig family. here, we show that the nrde pre-mrna is spliced and that the homing endonuclease cleaves an intronless nrde gene 5 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the intron insertion site, producing 2-nt 3' extensions. we also show that the sequence required for efficient cleavage spans at least 4 bp upstream and 31 bp downstream of the cleaved coding strand. the position of the recognition sequence in relation to the cleavage position is as expected for a giy-yig homing endonuclease. interestingly, nrde genes from several other bacillaceae were also susceptible to cleavage, with those of bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis (nrde1), b. anthracis, and bacillus thuringiensis serovar konkukian being better substrates than those of bacillus subtilis, bacillus lichenformis, and s. epidermidis (nrde2). on the other hand, nrde genes from lactococcus lactis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and corynebacterium ammoniagenes were not cleaved. intervening sequences (ivss) residing in protein-coding genes are often found in enzymes involved in dna metabolism, and the ribonucleotide reductase nrde gene is a frequent target for self-splicing ivss. a comparison of  nrde genes from seven gram-positive low-g+c bacteria, two bacteriophages, and nocardia farcinica showed five different insertion sites for self-splicing ivss within the coding region of the nrde gene.

TI  == toward the automated generation of genome-scale metabolic networks in the seed.
AB  == background: current methods for the automated generation of genome-scale metabolic networks focus on genome annotation and preliminary biochemical reaction network assembly, but do not adequately address the process of identifying and filling gaps in the reaction network, and verifying that the network is suitable for systems level analysis. thus, current methods are only sufficient for generating draft-quality networks, and refinement of the reaction  network is still largely a manual, labor-intensive process. results: we have developed a method for generating genome-scale metabolic networks that produces substantially complete reaction networks, suitable for systems level analysis. our method partitions the reaction space of central and intermediary metabolism into discrete, interconnected components that can be assembled and verified in isolation from each other, and then integrated and verified at the level of their interconnectivity. we have developed a database of components that are common across organisms, and have created tools for automatically assembling appropriate components for a particular organism based on the metabolic pathways encoded in the organism's genome. this focuses manual efforts on that portion of an organism's metabolism that is not yet represented in the database. we have demonstrated the efficacy of our method by reverse-engineering and automatically  regenerating the reaction network from a published genome-scale metabolic model for staphylococcus aureus. additionally, we have verified that our method capitalizes on the database of common reaction network components created for s.  aureus, by using these components to generate substantially complete reconstructions of the reaction networks from three other published metabolic models (escherichia coli, helicobacter pylori, and lactococcus lactis). we have implemented our tools and database within the seed, an open-source software environment for comparative genome annotation and analysis. conclusion: our method sets the stage for the automated generation of substantially complete metabolic networks for over 400 complete genome sequences currently in the seed.  with each genome that is processed using our tools, the database of common components grows to cover more of the diversity of metabolic pathways. this increases the likelihood that components of reaction networks for subsequently processed genomes can be retrieved from the database, rather than assembled and verified manually.

TI  == characterization of the lactococcal group ii intron target site in its native host.
AB  == the lactococcus lactis group ii intron (ll.ltrb) retrohomes into the ltrb gene at high efficiency. to date, the critical dna bases recognized in vivo by the ll.ltrb ribonucleoprotein (rnp) have been exclusively elucidated in escherichia coli. however, recent evidence indicates host-dependant differences in ll.ltrb mobility, raising the possibility of limitations of the current model for rnp-homing site recognition in the native l. lactis host. in this work, intron retargeting experiments in l. lactis have demonstrated that adherence to specific target site critical bases is not sufficient to predict success or failure of chromosomal invasion, as in e. coli. accordingly, a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay was developed to test target site nucleotides previously demonstrated as critical for homing in e. coli, for relevance in its native host. this two-plasmid qpcr homing assay is highly sensitive and, unlike previous e. coli-based assays, resolves differential homing efficiencies in the absence of selection. as in e. coli, deviation from wild type at target site positions -23,  -21, -20, -19, and +5 resulted in lower homing efficiencies in l. lactis. furthermore, the same trends are observed when assaying select variants in enterococcus faecalis. our results suggest that these target site positions are critical in both e. coli and l. lactis.

AB  == for reasons of efficiency escherichia coli is used today as the microbial factory for production of plasmid dna vaccines. to avoid hazardous antibiotic resistance  genes and endotoxins from plasmid systems used nowadays, we have developed a system based on the food-grade lactococcus lactis and a plasmid without antibiotic resistance genes. we compared the l. lactis system to a traditional one in e. coli using identical vaccine constructs encoding the gp120 of hiv-1. transfection studies showed comparable gp120 expression levels using both vector  systems. intramuscular immunization of mice with l. lactis vectors developed comparable gp120 antibody titers as mice receiving e. coli vectors. in contrast,  the induction of the cytolytic response was lower using the l. lactis vector. inclusion of cpg motifs in the plasmids increased t-cell activation more when the e. coli rather than the l. lactis vector was used. this could be due to the different dna content of the vector backbones. interestingly, stimulation of splenocytes showed higher adjuvant effect of the l. lactis plasmid. the study suggests the developed l. lactis plasmid system as new alternative dna vaccine system with improved safety features. the different immune inducing properties using similar gene expression units, but different vector backbones and production hosts give information of the adjuvant role of the silent plasmid backbone. the results also show that correlation between the in vitro adjuvanticity of plasmid dna and its capacity to induce cellular and humoral immune responses in mice is not straight forward.

AB  == formation of specific complexes between proteins and their cognate dna modulates  the yields and the location of radiation damage on both partners of the complex.  the radiolysis of dna-protein complexes is studied for: (1) the escherichia coli  lactose operator-repressor complex, (2) the complex between dna bearing an analogue of an abasic site and the repair protein fpg of lactococcus lactis. experimental patterns of dna damages are presented and compared to predicted damage distribution obtained using an improved version of the stochastic model radack. the same method is used for predicting the location of damages on the proteins. at doses lower than a threshold that depends on the system, proteins protect their specific binding site on dna while at high doses, the studied complexes are disrupted mainly through protein damage. the loss of binding ability is the functional consequence of the amino-acids modification by oh* radicals. many of the most probably damaged amino acids are essential for the dna-protein interaction and within a complex are protected by dna.

TI  == expression, purification, and characterization of arginine deiminase from lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis atcc 7962 in escherichia coli bl21.
AB  == the arca gene that encodes arginine deiminase (adi, ec 3.5.3.6)--a key enzyme of  the adi pathway--was cloned from lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis atcc 7962. the deduced amino acid sequence of the arca gene showed high homology with the arca gene from lactobacillus plantarum (99%) and from lactobacillus sakei (60%), respectively. the arca gene from lc. lactis spp. lactis atcc 7962 was expressed in soluble fraction of recombinant escherichia coli bl21. adi produced from lc. lactis spp. lactis atcc 7962 (ladi) in e. coli bl21 (de3) was purified using sequential q-sepharose anion exchange and sephacryl s-200 gel filtration column chromatography. the final yield of ladi in the purification procedure was 63.5%,  and the specific activity was 140.27 u/mg. the presence of purified ladi was confirmed by n-terminal sequencing and determination of the molecular mass. the ladi had a molecular mass of about 140 kda, and comprised a homotrimer of 46 kda  in the native condition. ladi exhibited only 35% amino acid sequence homology with adi from mycoplasma arginini. however, ladi shared a similar three dimensional structure. the k(m) and v(max) values for arginine were 8.67+/-0.045  mm (mean+/-sd) and 344.83+/-1.79 micromol/min/mg, respectively, and the optimum temperature and ph for the production of ladi were 60 degrees c and 7.2.

TI  == human lysozyme expressed in the mammary gland of transgenic dairy goats can inhibit the growth of bacteria that cause mastitis and the cold-spoilage of milk.
AB  == the addition of human milk components with intrinsic antimicrobial activity to livestock milk by genetic engineering has the potential to benefit milk safety and production as well as the health of the lactating animal. as a model for the  dairy cow, we generated transgenic goats that expressed human lysozyme in their milk at 68% of the levels found in human milk. milk from these transgenic animals had a bacteriostatic effect on both in vitro and in vivo growth of several microorganisms important to the dairy industry. in vitro, milk from transgenic animals was capable of slowing the growth of mastitis-causing strains of escherichia coli (p < 0.02) and staphylococcus aureus (p < 0.05) as well as the cold-spoilage organism pseudomonas fragi (p < 0.02). the growth of an organism involved in cheese-making, lactococcus lactis, was not affected by the presence of lysozyme in milk. the supplementation of control milk with purified lysozyme did not achieve the same inhibitory effect as milk from transgenic animals. in vivo, milk from transgenic animals supported less bacterial growth than control milk. this transgenic model demonstrates the possibilities offered by genetic engineering to enhance the antimicrobial nature of milk and the udder.

TI  == universal method for synthesis of artificial gel antibodies by the imprinting approach combined with a unique electrophoresis technique for detection of minute structural differences of proteins, viruses, and cells (bacteria). iii: gel antibodies against cells (bacteria).
AB  == artificial antibodies in the form of gel granules were synthesized from the monomers acrylamide and n,n'-methylenebisacrylamide by the imprinting method in the presence of echerichia coli bacteria as template. the electrophoretic migration velocities of the gel antibodies (i) saturated with the antigen (escherichia coli mre-600), (ii) freed of the antigen, and (iii) resaturated with bacteria, were determinated by electrophoresis in a rotating narrow-bore tube of  245 mm length and the 2.5 and 9.6 mm inner and outer diameters, respectively. removal of bacteria from the gel antibodies was made by treatment with enzymes, followed by washing with sds and buffer. gel granules becoming charged by adsorption of bacteria move in an electrical field. we obtained a significant selectivity of gel antibodies for e. coli mre-600, since the granules did not interact with lactococcus lactis; and when e. coli bl21 bacteria were added to the gels selective for e. coli mre-600, a significant difference in the migration rate of the complexes formed with the two strains was observed indicating the ability of differentiation between the two strains. the gel antibodies can be used repeatedly. the new imprinting method for the synthesis of artificial gel antibodies against bioparticles described herein, and the classical electrophoretic analysis technique employed, thus represent - when combined - a new approach to distinguish between different types and strains of bacteria. the  application area can certainly be extended to cover other classes of cells.

TI  == osmosensing by bacteria.
AB  == osmosensors are proteins that sense environmental osmotic pressure. they mediate  or direct osmoregulatory responses that allow cells to survive osmotic changes and extremes. bacterial osmosensing transporters sense high external osmotic pressure and respond by mediating organic osmolyte uptake, hence cellular rehydration. detailed studies of osmosensing transporters opua, betp, and prop suggest that they sense and respond to different osmotic pressure-dependent cellular properties. these studies also suggest that each protein has a cytoplasmic osmosensory or osmoregulatory domain, but that these domains differ in structure and function. it is not yet clear whether each transporter represents a distinct osmosensory mechanism or whether different research groups  are approaching the same mechanism by way of different paths. principles emerging from this research will apply to other osmosensors, including those that initiate signal transduction cascades in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

TI  == lex marks the spot: the virulent side of sos and a closer look at the lexa regulon.
AB  == the sos response that responds to dna damage induces many genes that are under lexa repression. a detailed examination of lexa regulons using genome-wide techniques has recently been undertaken in both escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. these extensive and elegant studies have now charted the extent of the  lexa regulons, uncovered many new genes, and exposed a limited overlap in the lexa regulon between the two bacteria. as more bacterial genomes are analysed, more curiosities in lexa regulons arise. several notable examples include the discovery of a lexa-like protein, hdir, in lactococcus lactis, organisms with two lexa genes, and small dna damage-inducible cassettes under lexa control. in the cyanobacterium synechocystis, genetic and microarray studies demonstrated that a  lexa paralogue exerts control over an entirely different set of carbon-controlled genes and is crucial to cells facing carbon starvation. an examination of sos induction evoked by common therapeutic drugs has shed new light on unsuspected consequences of drug exposure. certain antibiotics, most notably fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin, can induce an sos response and can modulate the spread of  virulence factors and drug resistance. sos induction by beta-lactams in e. coli triggers a novel form of antibiotic defence that involves cell wall stress and signal transduction by the dpiab two-component system. in this review, we provide an overview of these new directions in sos and lexa research with emphasis on a few themes: identification of genes under lexa control, the identification of new endogenous triggers, and antibiotic-induced sos response and its consequences.

TI  == atomic force microscopy reveals dna bending during group ii intron ribonucleoprotein particle integration into double-stranded dna.
AB  == the mobile lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb group ii intron integrates into dna target  sites by a mechanism in which the intron rna reverse splices into one dna strand  while the intron-encoded protein uses a c-terminal dna endonuclease domain to cleave the opposite strand and then uses the cleaved 3' end to prime reverse transcription of the inserted intron rna. these reactions are mediated by an rnp  particle that contains the intron-encoded protein and the excised intron lariat rna, with both the protein and base pairing of the intron rna used to recognize dna target sequences. here, computational analysis indicates that escherichia coli dna target sequences that support ll.ltrb integration have greater predicted bendability than do random e. coli genomic sequences, and atomic force microscopy shows that target dna is bent during the reaction with ll.ltrb rnps. time course  and mutational analyses show that dna bending occurs after reverse splicing and requires subsequent interactions between the intron-encoded protein and the 3' exon, which lead to two progressively larger bend angles. our results suggest a model in which rnps bend the target dna by maintaining initial contacts with the  5' exon while engaging in subsequent 3' exon interactions that successively position the scissile phosphate for bottom-strand cleavage at the dna endonuclease active site and then reposition the 3' end of the cleaved bottom strand to the reverse transcriptase active site for initiation of cdna synthesis. our findings indicate that bendability of the dna target site is a significant factor for ll.ltrb rnp integration.

TI  == intracellular accumulation of trehalose protects lactococcus lactis from freeze-drying damage and bile toxicity and increases gastric acid resistance.
AB  == interleukin-10 (il-10) is a promising candidate for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. intragastric administration of lactococcus lactis genetically modified to secrete il-10 in situ in the intestine was shown to be effective in healing and preventing chronic colitis in mice. however, its use in humans is hindered by the sensitivity of l. lactis to freeze-drying and its poor survival in the gastrointestinal tract. we expressed the trehalose synthesizing genes from escherichia coli under control of the nisin-inducible promoter in l. lactis. induced cells accumulated intracellular trehalose and retained nearly 100% viability after freeze-drying, together with a markedly prolonged shelf life. remarkably, cells producing trehalose were resistant to bile, and their viability in human gastric juice was enhanced. none of these effects were seen with exogenously added trehalose. trehalose accumulation did not interfere with il-10  secretion or with therapeutic efficacy in murine colitis. the newly acquired properties should enable a larger proportion of the administered bacteria to reach the gastrointestinal tract in a bioactive form, providing a means for more  effective mucosal delivery of therapeutics.

TI  == bipolar localization of the group ii intron ll.ltrb is maintained in escherichia  coli deficient in nucleoid condensation, chromosome partitioning and dna replication.
AB  == group ii introns are mobile genetic elements that invade their cognate intron-minus alleles via an rna intermediate, in a process known as retrohoming.  they can also retrotranspose to ectopic sites at low frequency. in escherichia coli, retrotransposition of the lactococcal group ii intron, ll.ltrb, occurs preferentially within the ori and ter macrodomains of the e. coli chromosome. these macrodomains migrate towards the poles of the cell, where the intron-encoded protein, ltra, localizes. here we investigate whether alteration of nucleoid condensation, chromosome partitioning and replication affect retrotransposition frequencies, as well as bipolar localization of the ll.ltrb intron integration and ltra distribution in e. coli. we thus examined these properties in the absence of the nucleoid-associated proteins h-ns, stpa and mukb, in variants of partitioning functions including the centromere-like sequence migs and the actin homologue mreb, as well as in the replication mutants deltaoric, seqa, tus and topoiv (ts). although there were some dramatic fluctuations in retrotransposition levels in these hosts, bipolar localization of integration events was maintained. ltra was consistently found in nucleoid-free regions, with its localization to the cellular poles being largely preserved in these hosts. together, these results suggest that bipolar localization of group ii intron retrotransposition results from the residence of the intron-encoded protein at the poles of the cell.

TI  == restriction for gene insertion within the lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb group ii intron.
AB  == the ll.ltrb intron, from the low g+c gram-positive bacterium lactococcus lactis,  was the first bacterial group ii intron shown to splice and mobilize in vivo. the detailed retrohoming and retrotransposition pathways of ll.ltrb were studied in both l. lactis and escherichia coli. this bacterial retroelement has many features that would make it a good gene delivery vector. here we report that the  mobility efficiency of ll.ltrb expressing ltra in trans is only slightly affected by the insertion of fragments <100 nucleotides within the loop region of domain iv. in contrast, ll.ltrb mobility efficiency is drastically decreased by the insertion of foreign sequences >1 kb. we demonstrate that the inhibitory effect caused by the addition of expression cassettes on ll.ltrb mobility efficiency is  not sequence specific, and not due to the expression, or the toxicity, of the cargo genes. using genetic screens, we demonstrate that in order to maintain intron mobility, the loop region of domain iv, more specifically domain ivb, is by far the best region to insert foreign sequences within ll.ltrb. poisoned primer extension and northern blot analyses reveal that ll.ltrb constructs harboring cargo sequences splice less efficiently, and show a significant reduction in lariat accumulation in l. lactis. this suggests that cargo-containing ll.ltrb variants are less stable. these results reveal the potential, yet limitations, of the ll.ltrb group ii intron to be used as a gene delivery vector, and validate the random insertion approach described in this study to create cargo-containing ll.ltrb variants that are mobile.

TI  == use of native lactococci as vehicles for delivery of dna into mammalian epithelial cells.
AB  == the use of the food-grade bacterium lactococcus lactis as a dna delivery vehicle  at the mucosal level is an attractive dna vaccination strategy. previous experiments showed that recombinant l. lactis expressing the listeria monocytogenes inla gene can deliver a functional gene into mammalian cells. here, we explored the potential use of noninvasive l. lactis strains as a dna delivery  vehicle. we constructed two escherichia coli-l. lactis shuttle plasmids, plig:blg1 and plig:blg2, containing a eukaryotic expression cassette with the cdna of bovine beta-lactoglobulin (blg). the greatest blg expression after transfection of cos-7 cells was obtained with plig:blg1, which was then used to transform l. lactis mg1363. the resulting l. lactis strain mg1363(plig:blg1) was  not able to express blg. the potential of l. lactis as a dna delivery vehicle was analyzed by detection of blg in caco-2 human colon carcinoma cells after 3 h of coincubation with (i) purified plig:blg1, (ii) mg1363(plig:blg1), (iii) a mix of  mg1363(plig) and purified plig:blg1, and (iv) mg1363. both blg cdna and blg expression were detected only in caco-2 cells coincubated with mg1363(plig:blg1). there was a decrease in the blg cdna level in caco-2 cells between 24 and 48 h after coincubation. blg expression by caco-2 cells started at 24 h and increased  between 24 and 72 h. blg secretion by caco-2 cells started 48 h after coincubation with mg1363(plig:blg1). we conclude that lactococci can deliver blg  cdna into mammalian epithelial cells, demonstrating their potential to deliver in vivo a dna vaccine.

TI  == comparative analysis and "expression space" coverage of the production of prokaryotic membrane proteins for structural genomics.
AB  == membrane proteins comprise up to one-third of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, but only a very small number of membrane protein structures are known. membrane proteins are challenging targets for structural biology, primarily due to the difficulty in producing and purifying milligram quantities of these proteins. we  are evaluating different methods to produce and purify large numbers of prokaryotic membrane proteins for subsequent structural and functional analysis.  here, we present the comparative expression data for 37 target proteins, all of them secondary transporters, from the mesophilic organism salmonella typhimurium  and the two hyperthermophilic organisms aquifex aeolicus and pyrococcus furiosus  in three different escherichia coli expression vectors. in addition, we study the use of lactococcus lactis as a host for integral membrane protein expression. overall, 78% of the targets were successfully produced under at least one set of  conditions. analysis of these results allows us to assess the role of different variables in increasing "expression space" coverage for our set of targets. this  analysis implies that to maximize the number of nonhomologous targets that are expressed, orthologous targets should be chosen and tested in two vectors with different types of promoters, using c-terminal tags. in addition, e. coli is shown to be a robust host for the expression of prokaryotic transporters, and is  superior to l. lactis. these results therefore suggest appropriate strategies for high-throughput heterologous overproduction of membrane proteins.

TI  == accelerating the reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic networks.
AB  == background: the genomic information of a species allows for the genome-scale reconstruction of its metabolic capacity. such a metabolic reconstruction gives support to metabolic engineering, but also to integrative bioinformatics and visualization. sequence-based automatic reconstructions require extensive manual  curation, which can be very time-consuming. therefore, we present a method to accelerate the time-consuming process of network reconstruction for a query species. the method exploits the availability of well-curated metabolic networks  and uses high-resolution predictions of gene equivalency between species, allowing the transfer of gene-reaction associations from curated networks. results: we have evaluated the method using lactococcus lactis il1403, for which  a genome-scale metabolic network was published recently. we recovered most of the gene-reaction associations (i.e. 74 - 85%) which are incorporated in the published network. moreover, we predicted over 200 additional genes to be associated to reactions, including genes with unknown function, genes for transporters and genes with specific metabolic reactions, which are good candidates for an extension to the previously published network. in a comparison  of our developed method with the well-established approach pathologic, we predicted 186 additional genes to be associated to reactions. we also predicted a relatively high number of complete conserved protein complexes, which are derived from curated metabolic networks, illustrating the potential predictive power of our method for protein complexes. conclusion: we show that our methodology can be applied to accelerate the reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic networks by taking optimal advantage of existing, manually curated networks. as orthology detection is the first step in the method, only the translated open reading frames (orfs) of a newly sequenced genome are necessary to reconstruct a metabolic network. when more manually curated metabolic networks will become available in the near future, the usefulness of our method in network prediction  is likely to increase.

TI  == use of targetrons to disrupt essential and nonessential genes in staphylococcus aureus reveals temperature sensitivity of ll.ltrb group ii intron splicing.
AB  == we show that a targetron based on the lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb group ii intron  can be used for efficient chromosomal gene disruption in the human pathogen staphylococcus aureus. targetrons expressed from derivatives of vector pcn37, which uses a cadmium-inducible promoter, or pcn39, a derivative of pcn37 with a temperature-sensitive replicon, gave site-specific disruptants of the hsa and seb genes in 37%-100% of plated colonies without selection. to disrupt hsa, an essential gene, we used a group ii intron that integrates in the sense orientation relative to target gene transcription and thus could be removed by rna splicing, enabling the production of functional hsa protein. we show that because splicing of the ll.ltrb intron by the intron-encoded protein is temperature-sensitive, this method yields a conditional hsa disruptant that grows at 32 degrees c but not 43 degrees c. the temperature sensitivity of the splicing reaction suggests a general means of obtaining one-step conditional disruptions in any organism. in nature, temperature sensitivity of group ii intron splicing could limit the temperature range of an organism containing a group ii intron inserted in an essential gene.

AB  == in order to determine the role of multidrug resistance proteins in mercury and zinc resistance, human mdr1, lactococcus lactis lmra, and oenococcus oeni omra genes were expressed in an escherichia coli tolc mutant which is hypersensitive to metals. the three transporters conferred an increased mercury and zinc resistance to e. coli as compared to the control bacteria. this improved resistance correlated with a decreased zinc and mercury bioaccumulation. indeed,  quantification of intracellular metal concentrations by atomic absorption spectrometry (aas) showed a 2.1-, 3-, and 5.1-fold decrease in zinc in cells expressing hmdr1, omra, and lmra, respectively, and a 2.7-, 7.5-, and 7.7-fold decrease in mercury in cells expressing omra, lmra, and hmdr1, respectively, as compared to the control bacteria. this means that hmdr1, lmra, and omra proteins  which are specialised in xenobiotic scavenging, their main known function, are nevertheless able to confer some resistance against metals. our results show that the tolc mutated strain is well adapted to the study of mdr transporter activity  and could be used to screen substrates and competitive hmdr1 inhibitors.

AB  == the nisin-controlled gene expression (nice) system, which was discovered in lactococcus lactis, was adapted to lactobacillus reuteri by ligating nisa promoter (pnisa) and nisrk dna fragments into the escherichia coli-lb. reuteri shuttle vector pste32. this chimerical plasmid (pnice) was capable of expressing  the heterologous amylase gene (amyl) under nisin induction. optimization of induction factors for this lb. reuteri/pnice system, including nisin concentration (viz. 50 ng/ml), growth phase of culture at which nisin be added (viz. at the early exponential phase), and the best time for analyzing the gene product after inoculation (viz. at the 3rd h), allowed the amylase product to be  expressed in high amounts, constituting up to about 18% of the total intracellular protein. furthermore, the signal peptide (sp) of amyl gene (spamyl) from bacillus licheniformis was ligated to the downstream of pnisa in pnice, upgrading this vector to a nice-secretion (nies) level, which was then designated pnies (sec+, secretion positive). characterization of pnies using an amyl-spdelta gene (amyl gene lacking its sp) as a reporter revealed the 3rd h after induction  as the secretion peak of this system, at which the secretion efficiency and the amount of alpha-amylase being secreted into the culture supernatant were estimated to reach 77.6% and 27.75 mg/l. expression and secretion of amyl products by pnies in lb. reuteri was also confirmed by sds-page and immunoblotting analysis.

TI  == expression of helicobacter pylori cag12 gene in lactococcus lactis mg1363 and its oral administration to induce systemic anti-cag12 immune response in mice.
AB  == to develop an oral vaccine against helicobacter pylori infection, we have expressed the h. pylori cag12 (hp0532) gene, encoding the outer membrane protein  cag12 (31 kda), in a live delivery vehicle lactococcus lactis. the cag12 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using the genomic dna of h. pylori k51 isolated from korean patients. dna sequence analysis revealed that the cag12  gene of h. pylori k51 has 98.1 and 97.4% identity with individual cag12 genes of  the h. pylori 26695 and j99, respectively. the gst-cag12 fusion protein, produced using the escherichia coli expression system, was used to raise a rat polyclonal  anti-cag12 antibody. the pcr-amplified cag12 gene of h. pylori k51 was cloned in  the e. coli-l. lactis shuttle vector (pmg36e) and transformed into l. lactis. western blot analysis demonstrated that the cag12 protein was expressed in the l. lactis transformant, with a maximum level at the log phase without extracellular  secretion. the oral administration of the transformant into mice resulted in the  generation of the anti-cag12 antibody in serum in two out of five cases. these results suggest that the recombinant l. lactis, which expresses cag12, may be applicable as an oral vaccine to induce protective immunity against h. pylori.

AB  == this study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as enterococcus durans. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling  and pfge were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. species recognition by means of rapd-pcr was in agreement with  the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. one strain was characterized as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by rapd-pcr and four strains were grouped with the enterococcus faecium reference strain. all strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority  of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. all strains exhibited  antagonistic activity against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited enterococcus faecalis. isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. however, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk  for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.

TI  == complementation of the lactococcus lactis secretion machinery with bacillus subtilis secdf improves secretion of staphylococcal nuclease.
AB  == unlike bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli, the gram-positive lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis does not possess the secdf protein, a component of the secretion (sec) machinery involved in late secretion stages and required for  the high-capacity protein secretion in b. subtilis. in this study, we complemented the l. lactis sec machinery with secdf from b. subtilis and evaluated the effect on the secretion of two forms of staphylococcal nuclease, nucb and nuct, which are efficiently and poorly secreted, respectively. the b. subtilis secdf-encoding gene was tested in l. lactis at different levels. increased quantities of the precursor and mature forms were observed only at low  levels of secdf and at high nuct production levels. this secdf secretion enhancement was observed at the optimal growth temperature (30 degrees c) and was even greater at 15 degrees c. furthermore, the introduction of b. subtilis secdf  into l. lactis was shown to have a positive effect on a secreted form of brucella abortus l7/l12 antigen.

AB  == aims: the aim of the study is to evaluate whether xylanase can be used as a potential reporter gene for cloning and expression studies in lactococcus. methods and results: the 750 bp xylanase gene was amplified and subcloned into the unique nhei restriction enzyme site of pmg36e and subsequently transformed into competent escherichia coli xli-blue mrf cells and lactococcus lactis cells.  bacterial culture containing pmg36e-xy has an enzyme activity of 390 microg xylose ml(-1) culture 30 min(-1), respectively, when compared with 40 microg xylose ml(-1) culture 30 min(-1) for the negative control (plasmidless strain). conclusions: the thermostable xylanase gene was successfully expressed in both e. coli and l. lactis. the activity of xylanase can be easily detected by the formation of visible clearing zones around the transformed colonies on remazol brilliant blue-xylan (rbb-xylan) agar media. however, there were some significant differences in the optimum growth temperature and plasmid stability in the new clones. significance and impact of the study: the constructed reporter vector has the potential to be used as a reporter system for lactococcus as well as e. coli, and it is an addition to the pool of lactococcal vector systems.

TI  == batch culture characterization and metabolic flux analysis of succinate-producing escherichia coli strains.
AB  == this study presents an in-depth analysis of the anaerobic metabolic fluxes of various mutant strains of escherichia coli overexpressing the lactococcus lactis  pyruvate carboxylase (pyc) for the production of succinate. previously, a metabolic network design that includes an active glyoxylate pathway implemented in vivo increased succinate yield from glucose in an e. coli mutant to 1.6 mol/mol under fully anaerobic conditions. the design consists of a dual succinate synthesis route, which diverts required quantities of nadh through the traditional fermentative pathway and maximizes the carbon converted to succinate  by balancing the carbon flux through the fermentative pathway and the glyoxylate  pathway (which has a lower nadh requirement). mutant strains previously constructed during the development of high-yield succinate-producing strains were selected for further characterization to understand their metabolic response as a result of several genetic manipulations and to determine the significance of the  fermentative and the glyoxylate pathways in the production of succinate. measured fluxes obtained under batch cultivation conditions were used to estimate intracellular fluxes and identify critical branch point flux split ratios. the comparison of changes in branch point flux split ratios to the glyoxylate pathway and the fermentative pathway at the oxaloacetate (oaa) node as a result of different mutations revealed the sensitivity of succinate yield to these manipulations. the most favorable split ratio to obtain the highest succinate yield was the fractional partition of oaa to glyoxylate of 0.32 and 0.68 to the fermentative pathway obtained in strains sbs550mg (phl413) and sbs990mg (phl413). the succinate yields achieved in these two strains were 1.6 and 1.7 mol/mol, respectively. in addition, an active glyoxylate pathway in an ldha, adhe, ack-pta mutant strain is shown to be responsible for the high succinate yields achieved anaerobically. furthermore, in vitro activity measurements of seven crucial enzymes involved in the pathways studied and intracellular measurements of key intermediate metabolite pools provided additional insights on the physiological perturbations caused by these mutations. the characterization of these recombinant mutant strains in terms of flux distribution pattern, in vitro enzyme activity and intracellular metabolite pools provides useful information for the rational modification of metabolic fluxes to improve succinate production.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of lactic acid bacteria and yeast-lab cultures isolated  from traditional fermented milk against pathogenic escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis strains.
AB  == the survival and growth of escherichia coli 3339 and salmonella enteritidis 949575 isolated from human clinical samples, in milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeast strains previously isolated from zimbabwean naturally fermented milk (nfm) was studied. the lab starter cultures used were lactococcus  lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis c1 alone (c1) or in combination with candida kefyr 23 (c1/23), l. lactis subsp. lactis lc261 alone (lc261) or in combination with c. kefyr 23 (lc261/23). the growth of the same pathogens in milk fermented with a commercial dl culture (ch-n 22) and spontaneously fermented raw  milk was also monitored. the c1 and c1/23 cultures significantly (p<0.05) inhibited the growth of both pathogens. when inoculated at the beginning of the fermentation, both e. coli 3339 and s. enteritidis 949575 counts were significantly (p<0.05) reduced by about two log cycles in c1 and c1/23 cultured milk. however, in naturally fermented milk and the dl cultured milk, both e. coli 3339 and s. enteritidis 949575 grew and reached high populations of about 9 and 8.8 log cfu ml(-1), respectively, after 18 h. when e. coli 3339 was inoculated into previously fermented milk, the viable counts were significantly (p<0.05) reduced in the presence of c1 and c1/23 from 7 log cfu ml(-1) to 3 log cfu ml(-1) after 48 h. s. enteritidis 949575 could not be recovered from these cultures after 48 h. the addition of the yeast did not enhance or diminish the inhibitory  capacity of the lab cultures. the pathogens survived in high numbers when inoculated into pre-fermented nfm and the commercial dl- (ch-n 22) cultured milk. the c1 strain, therefore, offered the best protection against the pathogens. its  inhibitory effect was mainly related to fast acid production.

TI  == effect of heterologous expression of molecular chaperone dnak from tetragenococcus halophilus on salinity adaptation of escherichia coli.
AB  == molecular chaperone dnak of halophilic tetragenococcus halophilus jcm5888 was characterized under salinity conditions both in vitro and in vivo. the dnak gene  was cloned into an expression vector and transformed into escherichia coli. the dnak protein obtained from the recombinant e. coli showed a significantly higher  refolding activity of denatured lactate dehydrogenase than that from non-halophilic lactococcus lactis under nacl concentrations higher than 1 m. e. coli without the overexpression of dnak exhibited a growth profile with a prolonged lag phase and suppressed maximum cell density in luria-bertani medium containing 5% (0.86 m) nacl. on the contrary, the overexpression of t. halophilus dnak greatly shortened this prolonged lag phase with no effect on maximum growth, while that of l. lactis dnak decreased maximum growth. the amount of protein aggregates was increased by salt stress in the e. coli cells, while this aggregation was greatly suppressed by the overexpression of t, halophilus dnak. these results suggest that heterologous overexpression of t. halophilus dnak, via its chaperone activity, promotes salinity adaptation of e. coli.

TI  == molecular characterization and regulatory analysis of dnak operon of halophilic lactic acid bacterium tetragenococcus halophila.
AB  == we have cloned and characterized the dnak operon of tetragenococcus halophila jcm5888. nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned fragments showed that the dnak operon consists of four open reading frames with the organization hrca-grpe-dnak-dnaj. two regulatory circe (controlling inverted repeat of chaperone expression) elements were identified in the region up-stream of hrca. the t. halophila dnak encoded a protein of 618 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 67 kda. the deduced amino acid sequence of t. halophila dnak showed high similarities with those of the corresponding dnak homologues of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus sakei and bacillus subtilis. using a pet expression system, the t. halophila dnak was overexpressed in escherichia coli and the purified dnak was found to exhibit atpase and refolding activities. northern hybridization analysis revealed that the transcription of the dnak gene  was induced by heat shock, and several transcripts were detected including a tetra-cistronic mrna with a maximum size of 4.9-kb which corresponds to the transcript of the complete dnak operon. the amount of dnak transcripts increased  about 3.5-fold at high nacl concentration of 3-4 m, but not at the same kcl concentrations. these results suggest that the cloned dnak acts as a functional molecular chaperone and plays an important role in salinity adaptation.

TI  == recruitment of host functions suggests a repair pathway for late steps in group ii intron retrohoming.
AB  == retrohoming of group ii introns occurs by a mechanism in which the intron rna reverse splices directly into one strand of a dna target site and is then reverse transcribed by the associated intron-encoded protein. host repair enzymes are predicted to complete this process. here, we screened a battery of escherichia coli mutants defective in host functions that are potentially involved in retrohoming of the lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb intron. we found strong (greater than threefold) effects for several enzymes, including nucleases directed against rna and dna, replicative and repair polymerases, and dna ligase. a model including the presumptive roles of these enzymes in resection of dna, degradation of the intron rna template, traversion of rna-dna junctions, and second-strand dna synthesis is described. the completion of retrohoming is viewed as a dna repair process, with features that may be shared by other non-ltr retroelements.

TI  == dual antibacterial mechanisms of nisin z against gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  == nisin, an amphipathic antibiotic peptide, is produced by a number of strains of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. it has been employed as a food preservative as  it has a high antibacterial activity with a relatively low toxicity for humans. nisin is known to exert a high antibacterial activity against gram-positive but not gram-negative bacteria. however, purified nisin z was found to show an antibacterial activity both against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. to  clarify the mechanisms of activity, nisin z and purified nisin z were tested for  their antibacterial activities in a high-salt environment. the activity of nisin  z against staphylococcus aureus was stable even in the presence of nacl at 100 mm, showing ca. 2log colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction. in contrast, the activity of nisin z against escherichia coli was highly sensitive to the same concentration of nacl, and cfu reduction was not observed. furthermore, purified  nisin z caused the permeabilisation both of s. aureus and e. coli cytoplasmic membranes. the permeabilisation of e. coli but not s. aureus cytoplasmic membranes was remarkably reduced in a high-salt environment. moreover, vancomycin inhibited the nisin z-induced permeabilisation of the s. aureus cytoplasmic membrane. these results suggest that nisin z utilises two distinct mechanisms of  antibacterial activity: a high-salt-sensitive mechanism for e. coli and a high-salt-insensitive mechanism for s. aureus.

TI  == a bacterial group ii intron-encoded reverse transcriptase localizes to cellular poles.
AB  == the lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb group ii intron encodes a reverse transcriptase (ltra protein) that binds the intron rna to promote rna splicing and intron mobility. here, we used ltra-gfp fusions and immunofluorescence microscopy to show that ltra localizes to cellular poles in escherichia coli and lactococcus lactis. this polar localization occurs with or without coexpression of ll.ltrb intron rna, is observed over a wide range of cellular growth rates and expression levels, and is independent of replication origin function. the same localization  pattern was found for three nonoverlapping ltra subsegments, possibly reflecting  dependence on common redundant signals and/or protein physical properties. when coexpressed in e. coli, ltra interferes with the polar localization of the shigella icsa protein, which mediates polarized actin tail assembly, suggesting competition for a common localization determinant. the polar localization of ltra could account for the preferential insertion of the ll.ltrb intron in the origin  and terminus regions of the e. coli chromosome, may facilitate access to exposed  dna in these regions, and could potentially link group ii intron mobility to the  host dna replication and/or cell division machinery.

TI  == drug-lipid a interactions on the escherichia coli abc transporter msba.
AB  == msba is an essential atp-binding cassette half-transporter in the cytoplasmic membrane of the gram-negative escherichia coli and is required for the export of  lipopolysaccharides (lps) to the outer membrane, most likely by transporting the  lipid a core moiety. consistent with the homology of msba to the multidrug transporter lmra in the gram-positive lactococcus lactis, our recent work in e. coli suggested that msba might interact with multiple drugs. to enable a more detailed analysis of multidrug transport by msba in an environment deficient in lps, we functionally expressed msba in l. lactis. msba expression conferred an 86-fold increase in resistance to the macrolide erythromycin. a kinetic characterization of msba-mediated ethidium and hoechst 33342 transport revealed apparent single-site kinetics and competitive inhibition of these transport reactions by vinblastine with k(i) values of 16 and 11 microm, respectively. we also detected a simple noncompetitive inhibition of hoechst 33342 transport by free lipid a with a k(i) of 57 microm, in a similar range as the k(i) for vinblastine, underscoring the relevance of our lps-less lactococcal model for studies on msba-mediated drug transport. these observations demonstrate the ability of heterologously expressed msba to interact with free lipid a and multiple drugs in the absence of auxiliary e. coli proteins. our transport data provide further functional support for direct lps-msba interactions as observed in a recent crystal structure for msba from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (c. l. reyes and g. chang, science 308:1028-1031, 2005).

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == the crystal structures of lactococcus lactis mg1363 dps proteins reveal the presence of an n-terminal helix that is required for dna binding.
AB  == dps proteins play a major role in the protection of bacterial dna from damage by  reactive oxygen species. previous studies have implicated the extended lysine-containing n-terminal regions of dps subunits in dna binding, but this part of the structure has not previously been observed crystallographically. here the structures of two dps proteins (dpsa and dpsb) from lactococcus lactis mg1363 reveal for the first time the presence of an n-terminal alpha helix that extends  from the core of the dps subunit. consequently, the n-terminal helices are displayed in parallel pairs on the exterior of the dodecameric dps assemblies. both dpsa and dpsb bind dna. deletion of the dpsa n-terminal helix impaired dna binding. the n-terminal lys residues of escherichia coli dps have been implicated in dna binding. replacement of the lactococcal dpsa lys residues 9, 15 and 16 by  glu did not inhibit dna binding. however, dna binding was inhibited by edta, suggesting a role for cations in dna binding. in contrast to e. coli, bacillus brevis and mycobacterium smegmatis dps:dna complexes, in which dna interacts with crystalline dps phases, l. lactis dna:dps complexes appeared as non-crystalline aggregates of protein and dna in electron micrographs.

TI  == phage abortive infection in lactococci: variations on a theme.
AB  == abortive infection (abi) systems, also called phage exclusion, block phage multiplication and cause premature bacterial cell death upon phage infection. this decreases the number of progeny particles and limits their spread to other cells allowing the bacterial population to survive. twenty abi systems have been  isolated in lactococcus lactis, a bacterium used in cheese-making fermentation processes, where phage attacks are of economical importance. recent insights in their expression and mode of action indicate that, behind diverse phenotypic and  molecular effects, lactococcal abis share common traits with the well-studied escherichia coli systems lit and prr. abis are widespread in bacteria, and recent analysis indicates that abis might have additional roles other than conferring phage resistance.

TI  == [study of the genetic stability of expression plasmid vector pmg36e in host bacteria].
AB  == objective: to study the genetic stability of expression plasmid vector pmg36e in  escherichia coli jm109 and lactococcus lactis mg1363/36e and observe the effect of erythomycin for its stability. methods: we used classical method to determine  the genetic stable rates of pmg36e in e. coli jm109 and lactococcus lactis mg1363/36e with or without erythomycin selective pressure. results: when e. coli  jm109 were continuously incubated to 120 generations, its pmg36e genetic stable rates were 100% and 96% respectively with or without erythomycin selective pressure. when lactococcus lactis mg1363/36e were continuously incubated to 100 generations, its pmg36e genetic stable rates were the same 98%, with or without erythomycin selective pressure. conclusion: pmg36e had good genetic stability in  this two hosts. erythromycin selective pressure had no significant effect for the genetic stability of pmg36e.

TI  == gene targeting using randomly inserted group ii introns (targetrons) recovered from an escherichia coli gene disruption library.
AB  == the lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb group ii intron retrohomes by reverse-splicing into one strand of a double-stranded dna target site, while the intron-encoded protein cleaves the opposite strand and uses it to prime reverse transcription of the inserted intron rna. the protein and intron rna function in a ribonucleoprotein particle, with much of the dna target sequence recognized by base-pairing of the intron rna. consequently, group ii introns can be reprogrammed to insert into specific or random dna sites by substituting specific or random nucleotide residues in the intron rna. here, we show that an escherichia coli gene disruption library obtained using such randomly inserting ll.ltrb introns contains most viable e.coli gene disruptions. further, each inserted intron is targeted to a specific site by its unique base-pairing regions, and in most cases, could be recovered by pcr and used unmodified to obtain the desired single disruptant. additionally, we identified a subset of introns that insert at sites lacking t+5, a nucleotide residue critical for second-strand cleavage. all such introns tested individually gave the desired specific disruption, some by switching to an alternate retrohoming mechanism targeting single-stranded dna and using a nascent lagging dna strand to prime reverse transcription.

TI  == identification of endopeptidase genes from the genomic sequence of lactobacillus  helveticus cnrz32 and the role of these genes in hydrolysis of model bitter peptides.
AB  == genes encoding three putative endopeptidases were identified from a draft-quality genome sequence of lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32 and designated pepo3, pepf, and pepe2. the ability of cell extracts from escherichia coli dh5alpha derivatives expressing cnrz32 endopeptidases pepe, pepe2, pepf, pepo, pepo2, and  pepo3 to hydrolyze the model bitter peptides, beta-casein (beta-cn) (f193-209) and alpha(s1)-casein (alpha(s1)-cn) (f1-9), under cheese-ripening conditions (ph  5.1, 4% nacl, and 10 degrees c) was examined. cnrz32 pepo3 was determined to be a functional paralog of pepo2 and hydrolyzed both peptides, while pepe and pepf had unique specificities towards alpha(s1)-cn (f1-9) and beta-cn (f193-209), respectively. cnrz32 pepe2 and pepo did not hydrolyze either peptide under these  conditions. to demonstrate the utility of these peptidases in cheese, pepe, pepo2, and pepo3 were expressed in lactococcus lactis, a common cheese starter, using a high-copy vector ptrkh2 and under the control of the pepo3 promoter. cell extracts of l. lactis derivatives expressing these peptidases were used to hydrolyze beta-cn (f193-209) and alpha(s1)-cn (f1-9) under cheese-ripening conditions in single-peptide reactions, in a defined peptide mix, and in cheddar  cheese serum. peptides alpha(s1)-cn (f1-9), alpha(s1)-cn (f1-13), and alpha(s1)-cn (f1-16) were identified from cheddar cheese serum and included in the defined peptide mix. our results demonstrate that in all systems examined, pepo2 and pepo3 had the highest activity with beta-cn (f193-209) and alpha(s1)-cn (f1-9). cheese-derived peptides were observed to affect the activity of some of the enzymes examined, underscoring the importance of incorporating such peptides  in model systems. these data indicate that l. helveticus cnrz32 endopeptidases pepo2 and pepo3 are likely to play a key role in this strain's ability to reduce  bitterness in cheese.

TI  == structural insights into the monosaccharide specificity of escherichia coli rhamnose mutarotase.
AB  == the crystal structure of escherichia coli rhamnose mutarotase (yiil) is completely different from the previously reported structures of the lactococcus lactis galactose mutarotase and the bacillus subtilis rbsd (pyranase). yiil exists as a locally asymmetric dimer, which is stabilized by an intermolecular beta-sheet, various hydrophobic interactions, and a cation-pi interaction with a  salt-bridge. the protein folds of yiil are similar to those of a streptomyces coelicolor mono-oxygenase and a hypothetical arabidopsis thaliana protein at3g17210. by assaying the enzymatic activity of six active-site mutants and by comparing the crystal structure-derived active site conformations of yiil, rbsd,  and a galactose mutarotase, we were able to define the amino acid residues required for catalysis and suggest a possible catalytic mechanism for yiil. although the active-site amino acid residues of yiil (his, tyr, and trp) differ greatly from those of galactose mutarotase (his, glu, and asp), their geometries, which determine the structures of the preferred monosaccharide substrates, are conserved. in addition, the in vivo function of yiil was assessed by constructing a mutant e.coli strain that carries a yiil deletion. the presence of the yiil gene is critical for efficient cell growth only when concentrations of l-rhamnose are limited.

TI  == pore selectivity analysis of an aquaglyceroporin by stopped-flow spectrophotometry on bacterial cell suspensions.
AB  == background information. transport of water and small neutral solutes across plasma membranes is facilitated by aqp (aquaporin) and aquaglyceroporin channels, which belong to the mip (major intrinsic protein) family. so far, more than 800 mip proteins have been identified on the basis of sequence homology, but only less than 10% of them have been functionally characterized. in most studies, the  channel properties of mip proteins have been determined by using xenopus oocyte swelling assays or stopped-flow spectrophotometry on proteoliposomes. as both methods sometimes present disadvantages, we developed an alternative method for analysing mip function.results. the kinetics of plasmolysis or deplasmolysis of escherichia coli cells in suspension, in response to osmotic challenges, was analysed by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. cytoplasmic volume variations were monitored either by gfp (green fluorescent protein) fluorescence quenching or by  90 degrees scattered light. the single exponential response to up-shocks in the impermeant solute mannitol was strongly accelerated when the cells expressed the  native e. coli aqp aqpz (rate constant 37.24 versus 3.05 s(-1) for control cells). the responses to hyperosmotic shocks realized with glycerol were biphasic. first, a light-scattering increase corresponded to cell plasmolysis. secondly, deplasmolysis occurred when glycerol entered into the cell. both phases were accelerated when the aquaglyceroporin glpf was present in cell membranes. we concluded that the behaviour of mip-expressing bacteria in the stopped-flow system was qualitatively identical with that reported for mip-expressing oocytes  or mip-containing proteoliposomes. we then used this system to analyse the effects of mutations in the pore constriction of gla(llac), the aquaglyceroporin  from lactococcus lactis. in the present study, we show that gla(llac) loses its ability to transport glycerol but retains its ability to transport water when val(223) was replaced by a histidine, the residue at the equivalent position in strict aqps.conclusions. these results show that stopped-flow spectrophotometry performed on e. coli cell suspensions is a useful experimental system to analyse  the selectivity of wild-type or mutant mip proteins and that a bifunctional aquaglyceroporin switches to an aqp by a single amino acid mutation in the pore constriction.

TI  == heterologously expressed bacterial and human multidrug resistance proteins confer cadmium resistance to escherichia coli.
AB  == the human mdr1 gene is induced by cadmium exposure although no resistance to this metal is observed in human cells overexpressing hmdr1. to access the role of mdr  proteins in cadmium resistance, human mdr1, lactococcus lactis lmra, and oenococcus oeni omra were expressed in an escherichia coli tolc mutant strain which proved to be hypersensitive to cadmium. both the human and bacterial mdr genes conferred cadmium resistance to e. coli up to 0.4 mm concentration. protection was abolished by 100 microm verapamil. quantification of intracellular cadmium concentration by atomic absorption spectrometry showed a reduced cadmium  accumulation in cells expressing the mdr genes. inside-out membrane vesicles of l. lactis overexpressing lmra displayed an atp-dependent (109)cd(2+) uptake that  was stimulated by glutathione. an evolutionary model is discussed in which mdr proteins have evolved independently from an ancestor protein displaying both organic xenobiotic- and divalent metal-extrusion abilities.

TI  == retrotransposition strategies of the lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb group ii intron are dictated by host identity and cellular environment.
AB  == group ii introns are mobile retroelements that invade their cognate intron-minus  gene in a process known as retrohoming. they can also retrotranspose to ectopic sites at low frequency. previous studies of the lactococcus lactis intron ll.ltrb indicated that in its native host, as in escherichia coli, retrohoming occurs by  the intron rna reverse splicing into double-stranded dna (dsdna) through an endonuclease-dependent pathway. however, in retrotransposition in l. lactis, the  intron inserts predominantly into single-stranded dna (ssdna), in an endonuclease-independent manner. this work describes the retrotransposition of the ll.ltrb intron in e. coli, using a retrotransposition indicator gene previously employed in our l. lactis studies. unlike in l. lactis, in e. coli, ll.ltrb retrotransposed frequently into dsdna, and the process was dependent on the endonuclease activity of the intron-encoded protein. further, the endonuclease-dependent insertions preferentially occurred around the origin and terminus of chromosomal dna replication. insertions in e. coli can also occur through an endonuclease-independent pathway, and, as in l. lactis, such events have a more random integration pattern. together these findings show that ll.ltrb can retrotranspose through at least two distinct mechanisms and that the host environment influences the choice of integration pathway. additionally, growth conditions affect the insertion pattern. we propose a model in which dna replication, compactness of the nucleoid and chromosomal localization influence target site preference.

TI  == efficient succinic acid production from glucose through overexpression of pyruvate carboxylase in an escherichia coli alcohol dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase mutant.
AB  == an adhe, ldha double mutant escherichia coli strain, sbs110mg, has been constructed to produce succinic acid in the presence of heterologous pyruvate carboxylase (pyc). the strategic design aims at diverting maximum quantities of nadh for succinate synthesis by inactivation of nadh competing pathways to increase succinate yield and productivity. additionally an operational pfl enzyme allows formation of acetyl-coa for biosynthesis and formate as a potential source of reducing equivalents. furthermore, pyc diverts pyruvate toward oaa to favor succinate generation. sbs110mg harboring plasmid phl413, which encodes the heterologous pyruvate carboxylase from lactococcus lactis, produced 15.6 g/l (132 mm) of succinate from 18.7 g/l (104 mm) of glucose after 24 h of culture in an atmosphere of co(2) yielding 1.3 mol of succinate per mole of glucose. this molar yield exceeded the maximum theoretical yield of succinate that can be achieved from glucose (1 mol/mol) under anaerobic conditions in terms of nadh balance. the current work further explores the importance of the presence of formate as a source of reducing equivalents in sbs110mg(phl413). inactivation of the native formate dehydrogenase pathway (fdh) in this strain significantly reduced succinate yield, suggesting that reducing power was lost in the form of formate.  additionally we investigated the effect of ptsg inactivation in sbs110mg(phl413)  to evaluate the possibility of a further increase in succinate yield. elimination of the ptsg system increased the succinate yield to 1.4 mol/mol at the expense of a reduction in glucose consumption of 33%. in the presence of pyc and an efficient conversion of glucose to products, the ptsg mutation is not indispensable since pep converted to pyruvate as a result of glucose phosphorylation by the glucose specific pts permease eiicb(glu) can be rediverted toward oaa favoring succinate production.

TI  == function of prokaryotic and eukaryotic abc proteins in lipid transport.
AB  == atp binding cassette (abc) proteins of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic origins are implicated in the transport of lipids. in humans, members of the abc protein  families a, b, c, d and g are mutated in a number of lipid transport and metabolism disorders, such as tangier disease, stargardt syndrome, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, adrenoleukodystrophy or sitosterolemia. studies employing transfection, overexpression, reconstitution, deletion and inhibition indicate the transbilayer transport of endogenous lipids and their analogs by some of these proteins, modulating lipid transbilayer asymmetry. other proteins appear to be involved in the exposure of specific lipids on the exoplasmic leaflet, allowing their uptake by acceptors and further transport to specific sites. additionally, lipid transport by abc proteins is currently being studied in non-human eukaryotes, e.g. in sea urchin,  trypanosomatides, arabidopsis and yeast, as well as in prokaryotes such as escherichia coli and lactococcus lactis. here, we review current information about the (putative) role of both pro- and eukaryotic abc proteins in the various phenomena associated with lipid transport. besides providing a better understanding of phenomena like lipid metabolism, circulation, multidrug resistance, hormonal processes, fertilization, vision and signalling, studies on  pro- and eukaryotic abc proteins might eventually enable us to put a name on some of the proteins mediating transbilayer lipid transport in various membranes of cells and organelles. it must be emphasized, however, that there are still many uncertainties concerning the functions and mechanisms of abc proteins interacting with lipids. in particular, further purification and reconstitution experiments with an unambiguous role of atp hydrolysis are needed to demonstrate a clear involvement of abc proteins in lipid transbilayer asymmetry.

TI  == characterization of the cro-ori region of the streptococcus thermophilus virulent bacteriophage dt1.
AB  == the virulent cos-type streptococcus thermophilus phage dt1 was previously isolated from a mozzarella whey sample, and its complete genomic sequence is available. the putative ori of phage dt1 is characterized by three inverted and two direct repeats located in a noncoding region between orf36 and orf37. as the  replication ability of the putative ori and flanking genes could not be established, its ability to confer phage resistance was tested. when ori is cloned on a high-copy-number plasmid, it provides protection to s. thermophilus strains against phage infection during milk fermentation. this protection is phage specific and strain dependent. then, a detailed transcriptional map was established for the region located between the cro-like gene (orf29) and the ori. the results of the northern blots indicated that the transcription of this region started 5 min after the onset of phage infection. comparative analysis of the expression of the cro-ori region in the three s. thermophilus cos-type phages dt1, sfi19 (virulent), and sfi21 (temperate) reveals significant differences in the number and size of transcripts. the promoter upstream of orf29 was further investigated by primer extension analysis, and its activity was confirmed by a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay, which showed that the phage promoter is  more efficient than the constitutive bacterial promoter of the s. thermophilus operon encoding the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. however, the phage promoter is less efficient than the pts promoter in lactococcus lactis and in escherichia coli.

TI  == evolution of a phage ruvc endonuclease for resolution of both holliday and branched dna junctions.
AB  == resolution of holliday junction recombination intermediates in most gram-negative bacteria is accomplished by the ruvc endonuclease acting in concert with the ruvab branch migration machinery. gram-positive species, however, lack ruvc, with the exception of distantly related orthologues from bacteriophages infecting lactococci and streptococci. we have purified one of these proteins, 67ruvc, from lactococcus lactis phage bil67 and demonstrated that it functions as a holliday structure resolvase. differences in the sequence selectivity of resolution between 67ruvc and escherichia coli ruvc were noted, although both enzymes prefer to cleave 3' of thymidine residues. however, unlike its cellular counterpart, 67ruvc readily binds and cleaves a variety of branched dna substrates in addition to holliday junctions. plasmids expressing 67ruvc induce chromosomal breaks, probably as a consequence of replication fork cleavage, and cannot be recovered from recombination-defective e. coli strains. despite these deleterious effects,  67ruvc constructs suppress the uv light sensitivity of ruva, ruvab and ruvabc mutant strains confirming that the phage protein mediates holliday junction resolution in vivo. the characterization of 67ruvc offers a unique insight into how a holliday junction-specific resolvase can evolve into a debranching endonuclease tailored to the requirements of phage recombination.

TI  == lid l11 of the glutamine amidotransferase domain of ctp synthase mediates allosteric gtp activation of glutaminase activity.
AB  == gtp is an allosteric activator of ctp synthase and acts to increase the k(cat) for the glutamine-dependent ctp synthesis reaction. gtp is suggested, in part, to optimally orient the oxy-anion hole for hydrolysis of glutamine that takes place  in the glutamine amidotransferase class i (gatase) domain of ctp synthase. in the gatase domain of the recently published structures of the escherichia coli and thermus thermophilus ctp synthases a loop region immediately proceeding amino acid residues forming the oxy-anion hole and named lid l11 is shown for the latter enzyme to be flexible and change position depending on the presence or absence of glutamine in the glutamine binding site. displacement or rearrangement of this loop may provide a means for the suggested role of allosteric activation  by gtp to optimize the oxy-anion hole for glutamine hydrolysis. arg359, gly360 and glu362 of the lactococcus lactis enzyme are highly conserved residues in lid  l11 and we have analyzed their possible role in gtp activation. characterization  of the mutant enzymes r359m, r359p, g360a and g360p indicated that both arg359 and gly360 are involved in the allosteric response to gtp binding whereas the e362q enzyme behaved like wild-type enzyme. apart from the g360a enzyme, the results from kinetic analysis of the enzymes altered at position 359 and 360 showed a 10- to 50-fold decrease in gtp activation of glutamine dependent ctp synthesis and concomitant four- to 10-fold increases in k(a) for gtp. the r359m,  r359p and g360p also showed no gtp activation of the uncoupled glutaminase reaction whereas the g360a enzyme was about twofold more active than wild-type enzyme. the elevated k(a) for gtp and reduced gtp activation of ctp synthesis of  the mutant enzymes are in agreement with a predicted interaction of bound gtp with lid l11 and indicate that the gtp activation of glutamine dependent ctp synthesis may be explained by structural rearrangements around the oxy-anion hole of the gatase domain.

TI  == cell surface display system for lactococcus lactis: a novel development for oral  vaccine.
AB  == the food-grade lactococcus lactis is a potential vector to be used as a live vehicle for the delivery of heterologous proteins for vaccine and pharmaceutical  purposes. we constructed a plasmid vector psvac that harbors a 255-bp single-repeat sequence of the cell wall-binding protein region of the acma protein. the recombinant plasmid was transformed into escherichia coli and expression of the gene fragment was driven by the t7 promoter of the plasmid. sds-page showed the presence of the putative acma' fragment and this was confirmed by western blot analysis. the protein was isolated and purified using a his-tag affinity column. when mixed with a culture of l. lactis mg1363, elisa and immunofluorescence assays showed that the cell wall-binding fragment was anchored onto the outer surface of the bacteria. this indicated that the acma' repeat unit retained the active site for binding onto the cell wall surface of the l. lactis  cells. stability assays showed that the fusion proteins (acma/a1, acma/a3) were stably docked onto the surface for at least 5 days. the acma' fragment was also shown to be able to strongly bind onto the cell surface of naturally occurring lactococcal strains and lactobacillus and, with less strength, the cell surface of bacillus sphericus. the new system designed for cell surface display of recombinant proteins on l. lactis was evaluated for the expression and display of a1 and a3 regions of the vp1 protein of enterovirus 71 (ev71). the a1 and a3 regions of the vp1 protein of ev71 were cloned upstream to the cell wall-binding  domains of acma protein and successfully expressed as acma/a1 and acma/a3. whole-cell elisa showed the successful display of vp1 protein epitopes of ev71 on the surface of l. lactis. the success of the anchoring system developed in this study for docking the a1 and a3 epitopes of vp1 onto the surface of l. lactis cells opens up the possibilities of peptide and protein display for not only lactococcus but also for other gram-positive bacteria. this novel way of displaying epitopes on the cell surface of l. lactis and other related organisms  should be very useful in the delivery of vaccines and other useful proteins.

TI  == a nudix enzyme removes pyrophosphate from dihydroneopterin triphosphate in the folate synthesis pathway of bacteria and plants.
AB  == removal of pyrophosphate from dihydroneopterin triphosphate (dhntp) is the second step in the pterin branch of the folate synthesis pathway. there has been controversy over whether this reaction requires a specific pyrophosphohydrolase or is a metal ion-dependent chemical process. the genome of lactococcus lactis has a multicistronic folate synthesis operon that includes an open reading frame  (ylgg) specifying a putative nudix hydrolase. because many nudix enzymes are pyrophosphohydrolases, ylgg was expressed in escherichia coli and characterized.  the recombinant protein showed high dhntp pyrophosphohydrolase activity with a k(m) value of 2 microm, had no detectable activity against deoxynucleoside triphosphates or other typical nudix hydrolase substrates, required a physiological level (approximately 1 mm) of mg(2+), and was active as a monomer.  essentially no reaction occurred without enzyme at 1 mm mg(2+). inactivation of ylgg in l. lactis resulted in dhntp accumulation and folate depletion, confirming that ylgg functions in folate biosynthesis. we therefore propose that ylgg be redesignated as folq. the closest arabidopsis homolog of ylgg (encoded by nudix gene at1g68760) was expressed in e. coli and shown to have mg(2+)-dependent dhntp pyrophosphohydrolase activity. this protein (atnudt1) was reported previously to  have nadh pyrophosphatase activity in the presence of 5 mm mn(2+) (dobrzanska, m., szurmak, b., wyslouch-cieszynska, a., and kraszewska, e. (2002) j. biol. chem. 277, 50482-50486). however, we found that this activity is negligible at physiological levels of mn(2+) and that, with 1 mm mg(2+), atnudt1 prefers dhntp  and (deoxy) nucleoside triphosphates.

TI  == distribution, lateral mobility and function of membrane proteins incorporated into giant unilamellar vesicles.
AB  == guvs have been widely used for studies on lipid mobility, membrane dynamics and lipid domain (raft) formation, using single molecule techniques like fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. reports on membrane protein dynamics in these types of  model membranes are by far less advanced due to the difficulty of incorporating proteins into guvs in a functional state. we have used sucrose to prevent four distinct membrane protein(s) (complexes) from inactivating during the dehydration step of the guv-formation process. the amount of sucrose was optimized such that  the proteins retained 100% biological activity, and many proteo-guvs were obtained. although guvs could be formed by hydration of lipid mixtures composed of neutral and anionic lipids, an alternate current electric field was required for guv formation from neutral lipids. distribution, lateral mobility, and function of an atp-binding cassette transport system, an ion-linked transporter,  and a mechanosensitive channel in guvs were determined by confocal imaging, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, patch-clamp measurements, and biochemical  techniques. in addition, we show that sucrose slows down the lateral mobility of  fluorescent lipid analogs, possibly due to hydrogen-bonding with the lipid headgroups, leading to larger complexes with reduced mobility.

TI  == effect of sorghum vulgare phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and lactococcus lactis  pyruvate carboxylase coexpression on succinate production in mutant strains of escherichia coli.
AB  == sorghum vulgare phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (pepc) and lactococcus lactis pyruvate carboxylase (pyc) were overexpressed in escherichia coli concurrently to improve the production of succinate, a valuable industrial specialty chemical. this coexpression system was also applied to e. coli mutant strains strategically designed by inactivating the competing pathways of succinate formation. the highest level of succinate production was observed in e. coli strains coexpressing both pepc and pyc when compared with e. coli strains individually overexpressing either pepc or pyc. lactate production was also significantly reduced with pepc and pyc coexpression. lactate and acetate pathways were inactivated to eliminate the competing pathways of succinate formation. results showed that inactivation of both the lactate and acetate pathways with the coexpression of pepc and pyc was most effective in improving succinate production. inactivating the lactate or acetate pathway alone only caused a majority of the carbon flux to shift to other metabolites rather than succinate.  coexpression of pepc and pyc was also applied to an e. coli mutant strain deficient in lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate:formate lyase that accumulated a  substantial amount of the intermediate metabolite pyruvate during growth. results showed that pepc and pyc coexpression was effective in depleting pyruvate accumulation and increasing the production of metabolites.

TI  == using lactococcus lactis for glutathione overproduction.
AB  == glutathione and gamma-glutamylcysteine were produced in lactococcus lactis using  a controlled expression system and the genes gsha and gshb from escherichia coli  encoding the enzymes gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase. high levels of gamma-glutamylcysteine were found in strains growing on chemically defined medium and expressing either gsha alone or both gsha and gshb. as anticipated, glutathione was found in a strain expressing gsha and gshb. the level of glutathione production could be increased by addition of the precursor amino acid cysteine to the medium. the addition of cysteine led to an increased activity of glutathione synthetase, which is remarkable because the amino acid is not a substrate of this enzyme. the final intracellular glutathione concentration attained was 358 nmol mg(-1) protein, which is the highest concentration reported for a bacterium, demonstrating the suitability of engineered l. lactis for fine-chemical production and as a model for studies of the impact of glutathione on flavour formation and other properties of food.

TI  == glutathione: a review on biotechnological production.
AB  == this mini-review summarizes the historic developments and technological achievements in the biotechnological production of glutathione in the past 30 years. glutathione is the most abundant non-protein thiol compound present in living organisms. it is used as a pharmaceutical compound and can be used in food additives and the cosmetic industries. glutathione can be produced using enzymatic methods in the presence of atp and its three precursor amino acids (l-glutamic acid, l-cysteine, glycine). alternatively, glutathione can be produced by direct fermentative methods using sugar as a starting material. in the latter method, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida utilis are currently used to produce glutathione on an industrial scale. at the molecular level, the genes  gsha and gshb, which encode the enzymes gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase, respectively, have been cloned from escherichia coli and  over-expressed in e. coli, s. cerevisiae, and lactococcus lactis. it is anticipated that, with the design and/or discovery of novel producers, the biotechnological production of glutathione will be further improved to expand the application range of this physiologically and medically important tripeptide.

AB  == this study describes the genetic analysis of the riboflavin (vitamin b(2)) biosynthetic (rib) operon in the lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis subsp.  cremoris strain nz9000. functional analysis of the genes of the l. lactis rib operon was performed by using complementation studies, as well as by deletion analysis. in addition, gene-specific genetic engineering was used to examine which genes of the rib operon need to be overexpressed in order to effect riboflavin overproduction. transcriptional regulation of the l. lactis riboflavin biosynthetic process was investigated by using northern hybridization and primer  extension, as well as the analysis of roseoflavin-induced riboflavin-overproducing l. lactis isolates. the latter analysis revealed the presence of both nucleotide replacements and deletions in the regulatory region of the rib operon. the results presented here are an important step toward the development of fermented foods containing increased levels of riboflavin, produced in situ, thus negating the need for vitamin fortification.

TI  == homologous and heterologous expression of rnase iii from lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the endoribonuclease iii (rnase iii), encoded by the rnc gene, is an important enzyme for rna metabolism. in this report a chromosomal fragment containing the rnc gene from lactococcus lactis was cloned and its expression was analyzed. complementation assays performed in escherichia coli demonstrate that the lactococcal rnase iii (lac-rnase iii) is able to process rrnas and to regulate the levels of polynucleotide phosphorylase (pnpase). these results demonstrate that the lactococcal enzyme is able to substitute the ec-rnase iii not only in the rrna processing, but also in the processing of mrnas. the amount of lactococcal rnc transcript in an e. coli deltarnc strain was 3.3-fold higher than in the wild type strain, suggesting that the e. coli rnase iii triggers the degradation of the heterologous rnc mrna. lac-rnase iii is able to cleave an in vitro synthesized mrna substrate specific for the bacillus subtilis homolog. using this substrate, we standardized an enzymatic assay which allows the specific detection of the endonucleolytic activity of lac-rnase iii in l. lactis  and e. coli crude extracts.

TI  == quorum sensing control of lantibiotic production; nisin and subtilin autoregulate their own biosynthesis.
AB  == lantibiotics are produced by a variety of gram-positive bacteria. the production  of these peptides appears to be regulated at the transcriptional level in a cell-density-dependent manner in various bacteria. this phenomenon has been studied in detail for the production of nisin by lactococcus lactis, and the production of the structurally similar subtilin by bacillus subtilis. in this paper, the molecular mechanism underlying regulation of nisin and subtilin production is reviewed. this quorum sensing, autoregulatory module includes the lantibiotics themselves as peptide pheromones, the signal transduction by the corresponding two-component regulatory systems, and the lantibiotic-responsive promoter elements in the biosynthesis gene clusters. finally, the exploitation of these regulatory characteristics for the development of highly effective controlled gene expression systems in gram-positive bacteria is discussed.

TI  == only one of the two annotated lactococcus lactis fabg genes encodes a functional  beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein reductase.
AB  == the small genome of the gram-positive bacterium lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis il1403 contains two genes that encode proteins annotated as homologues of escherichia coli beta-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein (acp) reductase. e. coli fabg encodes beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (acp) reductase, the enzyme responsible for the first reductive step of the fatty acid synthetic cycle. both  of the l. lactis genes are adjacent to (and predicted to be cotranscribed with) other genes that encode proteins having homology to known fatty acid synthetic enzymes. such relationships have often been used to strengthen annotations based  on sequence alignments. annotation in the case of beta-ketoacyl-acp reductase is  particularly problematic because the protein is a member of a vast protein family, the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase (sdr) family. the recent  isolation of an e. coli fabg mutant strain encoding a conditionally active beta-ketoacyl-acp reductase allowed physiological and biochemical testing of the  putative l. lactishomologues. we report that expression of only one of the two l. lactis proteins (that annotated as fabg1) allows growth of the e. coli fabg strain under nonpermissive conditions and restores in vitro fatty acid synthetic  ability to extracts of the mutant strain. therefore, like e. coli, l. lactis has  a single beta-ketoacyl-acp reductase active with substrates of all fatty acid chain lengths. the second protein (annotated as fabg2), although inactive in fatty acid synthesis both in vivo and in vitro, was highly active in reduction of the model substrate, beta-ketobutyryl-coa. as expected from work on the e. coli enzyme, the fabg1 beta-ketobutyryl-coa reductase activity was inhibited by acp (which blocks access to the active site) whereas the activity of fabg2 was unaffected by the presence of acp. these results seem to be an example of a gene  duplication event followed by divergence of one copy of the gene to encode a protein having a new function.

TI  == ferrihydrite reduction by geobacter species is stimulated by secondary bacteria.
AB  == geobacter species such as g. bremensis, g. pelophilus, and g. sulfurreducens are  obligately anaerobic and grow in anoxic, non-reduced medium by fast reduction of  soluble ferric citrate. in contrast, insoluble ferrihydrite was either only slowly or not reduced when supplied as electron acceptor in similar growth experiments. ferrihydrite reduction was stimulated by addition of a reducing agent or by concomitant growth of secondary bacteria that were physiologically and phylogenetically as diverse as escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, or pseudomonas stutzeri. in control experiments with heat-inactivated geobacter cells and viable secondary bacteria, no ( e. coli, p. stutzeri) or only little (  l. lactis) ferrihydrite was reduced. redox indicator dyes showed that growing e.  coli, p. stutzeri, or l. lactis cells lowered the redox potential of the medium in a similar way as a reducing agent did. the lowered redox potential was presumably the key factor that stimulated ferrihydrite reduction by all three geobacter species. the observed differences in anoxic non-reduced medium with ferric citrate versus ferrihydrite as electron acceptor indicated that reduction  of these electron acceptors involved different cellular components or different biochemical strategies. furthermore, it appears that redox-sensitive components are involved, and/or that gene expression of components needed for ferrihydrite reduction is controlled by the redox state.

AB  == screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole lactobacillus fermentum br11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kda protein. analysis of the 3010-bp dna insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (orfs). one orf encodes lysa,  a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages lj928 and lj965 from lactobacillus johnsonii and lp1 and lp2 from  lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phiadh. the immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated orf downstream of lysa which has similarity to glutamyl-trna synthetases. the n-terminus of lysa has sequence similarity with n-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the c-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial sh3b domains. c-terminal bacterial  sh3b domains were identified in the majority of lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. lysa was expressed in escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different lactobacillus species and against lactococcus lactis, streptococci and  staphylococcus aureus. it was found that lysa is 2 and 8000 times more active against l. fermentum than l. lactis and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.

TI  == a group ii intron-encoded maturase functions preferentially in cis and requires both the reverse transcriptase and x domains to promote rna splicing.
AB  == mobile group ii introns encode proteins with both reverse transcriptase activity, which functions in intron mobility, and maturase activity, which promotes rna splicing by stabilizing the catalytically active structure of the intron rna. previous studies with the lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb intron suggested a model in  which the intron-encoded protein binds first to a high-affinity binding site in intron subdomain diva, an idiosyncratic structure at the beginning of its own coding region, and then makes additional contacts with conserved catalytic core regions to stabilize the active rna structure. here, we developed an escherichia  coli genetic assay that links the splicing of the ll.ltrb intron to the expression of green fluorescent protein and used it to study the in vivo splicing of wild-type and mutant introns and to delineate regions of the maturase required for splicing. our results show that the maturase functions most efficiently when  expressed in cis from the same transcript as the intron rna. in agreement with previous in vitro assays, we find that the high-affinity binding site in diva is  required for efficient splicing of the ll.ltrb intron in vivo, but in the absence of diva, 6-10% residual splicing occurs by the direct binding of the maturase to  the catalytic core. critical regions of the maturase were identified by statistically analyzing ratios of missense to silent mutations in functional ltra variants isolated from a library generated by mutagenic pcr ("unigenic evolution"). this analysis shows that both the reverse transcriptase domain and domain x, which likely corresponds to the reverse transcriptase thumb, are required for rna splicing, while the c-terminal dna-binding and dna endonuclease  domains are not required. within the reverse transcriptase domain, the most critical regions for maturase activity include parts of the fingers and palm that function in template and primer binding in hiv-1 reverse transcriptase, but the integrity of the reverse transcriptase active site is not required. biochemical analysis of ltra mutants indicates that the n terminus of the reverse transcriptase domain is required for high-affinity binding of the intron rna, possibly via direct interaction with diva, while parts of domain x interact with  conserved regions of the catalytic core. our results support the hypothesis that  the intron-encoded protein adapted to function in splicing by using, at least in  part, interactions used initially to recognize the intron rna as a template for reverse transcription.

AB  == several studies have investigated the control of pathogens on alfalfa sprouts, and some treatments have been shown to be effective in reducing pathogen populations. however, control methods investigated thus far only provide pathogen control at a given point in the sprouting process and can affect germination. competitive inhibition of pathogens with lactic acid bacteria might provide pathogen control throughout the sprouting process and up to consumption. the purpose of this study was to isolate and identify lactic acid bacteria from alfalfa sprouts to inhibit the growth of foodborne pathogens. fifty-eight lactic  acid bacteria isolates were obtained from alfalfa seeds and sprouts. these isolates were evaluated for inhibitory action against salmonella enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, and listeria monocytogenes by agar spot tests. all pathogens were inhibited by 32 (55%) of the isolates, s. enterica by 56 (97%), e. coli o157:h7 by 49 (84%), and l. monocytogenes by 41 (71%). the isolates were identified by the analytical profile index evaluation of carbohydrate utilization. isolates obtained from a sample of alfalfa seeds and identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis showed zones of inhibition of 4.0 mm or greater  for all pathogens. one of these isolates, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (l7),  and an isolate previously obtained, pediococcus acidilactici (d3), were evaluated for competitive inhibition of s. enterica, e. coli o157:h7, and l. monocytogenes  in deman rogosa sharpe agar and broth. pathogen populations were significantly reduced by day 5. the selected isolates will be further evaluated in future studies for inhibitory action toward s. enterica, e. coli o157:h7, and l. monocytogenes during sprouting.

AB  == candidate attenuators were identified that regulate operons responsible for biosynthesis of branched amino acids, histidine, threonine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine in gamma- and alpha-proteobacteria, and in some cases in low-gc gram-positive bacteria, thermotogales and bacteroidetes/chlorobi. this allowed us not only to describe the evolutionary dynamics of regulation by attenuation of transcription, but also to annotate a number of hypothetical genes. in particular, orthologs of ygea of escherichia coli were assigned the branched chain amino acid racemase function. three new families of histidine transporters  were predicted, orthologs of yuif and yvsh of bacillus subtilis, and lysq of lactococcus lactis. in pasteurellales, the single bifunctional aspartate kinase/homoserine dehydrogenase gene thra was predicted to be regulated not only  by threonine and isoleucine, as in e. coli, but also by methionine. in alpha-proteobacteria, the single acetolactate synthase operon ilvih was predicted to be regulated by branched amino acids-dependent attenuators. histidine biosynthetic operons his were predicted to be regulated by histidine-dependent attenuators in bacillus cereus and clostridium difficile, and by histidine t-boxes in l. lactis and streptococcus mutans.

TI  == general and specialized vectors derived from pbm02, a new rolling circle replicating plasmid of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == this paper reports the construction of several general cloning vectors and a specialized depurative vector based on a new lactococcal plasmid that replicates  by the rolling circle mechanism [pbm02; plasmid 49 (2003) 118]. most vectors are  shuttle vectors for escherichia coli-lactococcus lactis and carry replicons of both cole1 and pbm02 plasmids (cole1 is used even though the pbm02 replicon is fully active in both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms). segregational and structural studies indicated that the new vectors were stable enough for the  majority of applications. further, since the basic replicon is compatible with plasmid derivatives of pwv01 and psh71, they can be maintained in the same cell with members of the two largest vector series for l. lactis and other lactic acid bacteria, the pgk, and the pnz series.

AB  == the hrca gene codes for a transcriptional repressor protein interacting with the  circe operator thereby reducing expression of the groe operon of more than 120 bacterial species. at least in bacillus subtilis, the activity of the hrca protein is modulated by the groe chaperonin system. we amplified the hrca gene from five different bacterial species and analyzed its activity in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. while those from clostridium acetobutylicum and staphylococcus aureus turned out to be active, those of helicobacter pylori, lactococcus lactis and thermotoga maritima were inactive in e. coli, but that of  t. maritima turned out to repress expression of the reporter gene in b. subtilis. all these results strongly suggest to us a specific recognition of hrca by the groe chaperonin system.

TI  == deciphering the function of an orf: salmonella enterica deom protein is a new mutarotase specific for deoxyribose.
AB  == we identified in salmonella enterica serovar typhi a cluster of four genes encoding a deoxyribokinase (deok), a putative permease (deop), a repressor (deoq), and an open reading frame encoding a 337 amino acid residues protein of unknown function. we show that the latter protein, called deom, is a hexamer whose synthesis is increased by a factor over 5 after induction with deoxyribose. the cd spectrum of the purified recombinant protein indicated a dominant contribution of betatype secondary structure and a small content of alpha-helix.  temperature and guanidinium hydrochloride induced denaturation of deom indicated  that the hexamer dissociation and monomer unfolding are coupled processes. deom exhibits 12.5% and 15% sequence identity with galactose mutarotase from lactococcus lactis and respectively escherichia coli, which suggested that these  three proteins share similar functions. polarimetric experiments demonstrated that deom is a mutarotase with high specificity for deoxyribose. site-directed mutagenesis of his183 in deom, corresponding to a catalytically active residue in galm, yielded an almost inactive deoxyribose mutarotase. deom was crystallized and diffraction data collected for two crystal systems, confirmed its hexameric state. the possible role of the protein and of the entire gene cluster is discussed in connection with the energy metabolism of s. enterica under particular growth conditions.

TI  == receptor binding domain of escherichia coli f18 fimbrial adhesin fedf can be both efficiently secreted and surface displayed in a functional form in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == adherence of f18 fimbrial escherichia coli to porcine intestinal epithelial cells is mediated by the adhesin (fedf) of f18 fimbriae. in a previous study, we demonstrated the specificity of the amino acid residues between 60 and 109 as the receptor binding domain of fedf. in this study, different expression, secretion,  and anchoring systems for the receptor binding domain of the fedf adhesin in lactococcus lactis were evaluated. two partially overlapping receptor binding domains (42 and 62 amino acid residues) were expressed as fusions with l. lactis  subsp. cremoris protein prtp for evaluation of secretion efficiency. to evaluate  the cell surface display of these fedf-prtp fusions, they were further combined with different lengths of prtp spacers fused with either the l. lactis acma anchor or the prtp cell wall binding domain. an htra-defective l. lactis nz9000 mutant was constructed to determine its effect on the level of secreted or anchored fusion proteins. recombinant l. lactis clones secreting the receptor binding domain of f18 fimbriae as a fusion with the h domains of l. lactis protein prtp were first constructed by using two different signal peptides. fedf-prtp fusions, directed by the signal sequence of l. brevis slpa, were throughout found to be secreted at significantly higher quantities than corresponding fusions with the signal peptide of l. lactis usp45. in the surface  display systems tested, the l. lactis acma anchor performed significantly better, particularly in the l. lactis nz9000deltahtra strain, compared to the l. lactis prtp anchor region. of the cell surface display constructs with the acma anchor,  only those with the longest prtp spacer regions resulted in efficient binding of  recombinant l. lactis cells to porcine intestinal epithelial cells. these results confirmed that it is possible to efficiently produce the receptor binding domain  of the f18 adhesin in a functionally active form in l. lactis.

TI  == a bacterial gene homologous to abc transporters protect oenococcus oeni from ethanol and other stress factors in wine.
AB  == the wine lactic acid bacteria oenococcus oeni has to cope with harsh environmental conditions including an acidic ph, a high alcoholic content, non-optimal growth temperatures, and growth inhibitory compounds such as fatty acids, phenolic acids and tannins. we here describe characterisation and cloning  of the o. oeni omra gene encoding a protein belonging to the atp-binding cassette superfamily of transporters. the omra protein displays the highest sequence similarity with the subfamily of atp-dependent multidrug resistance (mdr) proteins, most notably the bacterial lactococcus lactis lmra homologue of the human mdr1 p-glycoprotein. the omra gene proved to be a stress-responsive gene since its expression was increased at high temperature or under osmotic shock. the omra protein function was tested in escherichia coli, and consistent with the omra gene expression pattern, omra conferred protection to bacteria grown on a high salt medium. omra also triggered bacterial resistance to sodium laurate, wine and ethanol toxicity. the homologous lmra protein featured the same stress-protective pattern than omra when expressed in e. coli, and the contribution to resistance of both omra and lmra transporters was decreased by verapamil, a well-known inhibitor of the human mdr1 protein. genes homologous to  omra were detected in other wine lactic acid bacteria, suggesting that this type  of genes might constitute a well-conserved stress-protective molecular device.

TI  == engineering lactococcus lactis for production of mannitol: high yields from food-grade strains deficient in lactate dehydrogenase and the mannitol transport  system.
AB  == mannitol is a sugar polyol claimed to have health-promoting properties. a mannitol-producing strain of lactococcus lactis was obtained by disruption of two genes of the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep)-mannitol phosphotransferase system (pts(mtl)). genes mtla and mtlf were independently deleted by double-crossover recombination in strain l. lactis fi9630 (a food-grade lactate dehydrogenase-deficient strain derived from mg1363), yielding two mutant (delta ldh delta mtla and delta ldh delta mtlf) strains. the new strains, fi10091 and fi10089, respectively, do not possess any selection marker and are suitable for use in the food industry. the metabolism of glucose in nongrowing cell suspensions of the mutant strains was characterized by in vivo (13)c-nuclear magnetic resonance. the intermediate metabolite, mannitol-1-phosphate, accumulated intracellularly to high levels (up to 76 mm). mannitol was a major end product, one-third of glucose being converted to this hexitol. the double mutants, in contrast to the parent strain, were unable to utilize mannitol even after glucose depletion, showing that mannitol was taken up exclusively by pep-pts(mtl). disruption of this system completely blocked mannitol transport in  l. lactis, as intended. in addition to mannitol, approximately equimolar amounts  of ethanol, 2,3-butanediol, and lactate were produced. a mixed-acid fermentation  (formate, ethanol, and acetate) was also observed during growth under controlled  conditions of ph and temperature, but mannitol production was low. the reasons for the alteration in the pattern of end products under nongrowing and growing conditions are discussed, and strategies to improve mannitol production during growth are proposed.

TI  == identification and functional characterization of the lactococcus lactis rfb operon, required for dtdp-rhamnose biosynthesis.
AB  == dtdp-rhamnose is an important precursor of cell wall polysaccharides and rhamnose-containing exopolysaccharides (eps) in lactococcus lactis. we cloned the rfbacbd operon from l. lactis mg1363, which comprises four genes involved in dtdp-rhamnose biosynthesis. when expressed in escherichia coli, the lactococcal rfbacbd genes could sustain heterologous production of the shigella flexneri o antigen, providing evidence of their functionality. overproduction of the rfbac proteins in l. lactis resulted in doubled dtdp-rhamnose levels, indicating that the endogenous rfbac activities control the intracellular dtdp-rhamnose biosynthesis rate. however, rfbac overproduction did not affect rhamnose-containing b40-eps production levels. a nisin-controlled conditional rfbbd mutant was unable to grow in media lacking the inducer nisin, indicating that the rfb genes have an essential role in l. lactis. limitation of rfbbd activities resulted in the production of altered eps. the monomeric sugar of the  altered eps consisted of glucose, galactose, and rhamnose at a molar ratio of 1:0.3:0.2, which is clearly different from the ratio in the native sugar. biophysical analysis revealed a fourfold-greater molecular mass and a twofold-smaller radius of gyration for the altered eps, indicating that these eps are more flexible polymers with changed viscosifying properties. this is the first indication that enzyme activity at the level of central carbohydrate metabolism affects eps composition.

TI  == argr and ahrc are both required for regulation of arginine metabolism in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the dna binding proteins argr and ahrc are essential for regulation of arginine metabolism in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, respectively. a unique property of these regulators is that they form hexameric protein complexes, mediating repression of arginine biosynthetic pathways as well as activation of arginine catabolic pathways. the glts-arge operon of lactococcus lactis encodes a putative glutamate or arginine transport protein and acetylornithine deacetylase, which catalyzes an important step in the arginine biosynthesis pathway. by random integration knockout screening we found that derepression mutants had iss1 integrations in, among others, argr and ahrc. single as well as double regulator  deletion mutants were constructed from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363. the three arginine biosynthetic operons argcjdbf, arggh, and glts-arge were shown to be repressed by the products of argr and ahrc. furthermore, the arginine catabolic arcabd1c1c2td2 operon was activated by the product of ahrc but not by that of argr. expression from the promoter of the argcjdbf operon reached similar levels in the single mutants and in the double mutant, suggesting that the regulators are interdependent and not able to complement each other. at the same  time they also appear to have different functions, as only ahrc is involved in activation of arginine catabolism. this is the first study where two homologous arginine regulators are shown to be involved in arginine regulation in a prokaryote, representing an unusual mechanism of regulation.

TI  == use of computer-designed group ii introns to disrupt escherichia coli dexh/d-box  protein and dna helicase genes.
AB  == mobile group ii introns are site-specific retroelements that use a novel mobility mechanism in which the excised intron rna inserts directly into a dna target site and is then reverse transcribed by the associated intron-encoded protein. because the dna target site is recognized primarily by base-pairing of the intron rna with only a small number of positions recognized by the protein, it has been possible to develop group ii introns into a new type of gene targeting vector ("targetron"), which can be reprogrammed to insert into desired dna targets simply by modifying the intron rna. here, we used databases of retargeted lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb group ii introns and a compilation of nucleotide frequencies at active target sites to develop an algorithm that predicts optimal  ll.ltrb intron-insertion sites and designs primers for modifying the intron to insert into those sites. in a test of the algorithm, we designed one or two targetrons to disrupt each of 28 escherichia coli genes encoding dexh/d-box and dna helicase-related proteins and tested for the desired disruptants by pcr screening of 100 colonies. in 21 cases, we obtained disruptions at frequencies of 1-80% without selection, and in six other cases, where disruptants were not identified in the initial pcr screen, we readily obtained specific disruptions by using the same targetrons with a retrotransposition-activated selectable marker.  only one dexh/d-box protein gene, seca, which was known to be essential, did not  give viable disruptants. the apparent dispensability of dexh/d-box proteins in e.coli contrasts with the situation in yeast, where the majority of such proteins are essential. the methods developed here should permit the rapid and efficient disruption of any bacterial gene, the computational analysis provides new insight into group ii intron target site recognition, and the set of e.coli dexh/d-box protein and dna helicase disruptants should be useful for analyzing the function  of these proteins.

TI  == horizontal gene transfer of "prototype" nramp in bacteria.
AB  == eukaryotic nramp genes encode divalent metal ion permeases important for nutrition and resistance to microbial infection. bacterial homologs encode proton-dependent transporters of manganese (mnth), and other divalent metal ions. bacterial mnth were classified in three homology groups (a, b, c) and mnth c further subdivided in calpha, cbeta, cgamma. the proteins from c. tepidum (mnth b) and e. faecalis (mnth cbeta1, 2), divergent in sequence and hydropathy profile, conferred increased metal sensitivity when expressed in e. coli, suggesting conservation of divalent metal transport function in mnth b and c. several genomic evidence suggest horizontal gene transfer (hgt) of mnth c genes:  (i) the enterobacteria wigglesworthia mnth cbeta gene is linked to an asn t-rna,  and its sequence most conserved with gram positive bacteria homologs; (ii) all the cbeta genes identified in oral streptococcaceae are associated with different potentially mobile dna elements; (iii) lactococcus lactis and burkholderia mallei genomes contain an mnth gene prematurely terminated and a novel full-length mnth  c gene; (iv) remarkable sequence relatedness between the unicellular alga c. reinhardtii "prototype" nramp and some mnth calpha (e.g., nostoc spp., listeria spp.) suggests hgt between eukarya and bacteria. other "prototype" nramp genes (intronless, encoding proteins strongly conserved with mnth a and b proteins) identified in invertebrates represent a possible source for transfer of nramp genes toward opportunistic bacteria. this study demonstrates complex evolution of mnth in bacteria. it is proposed that "prototype" nramp are ancestors of bacterial mnth c proteins, which could facilitate bacterial infection.

TI  == a bacterial group ii intron favors retrotransposition into plasmid targets.
AB  == group ii introns, widely believed to be the ancestors of nuclear pre-mrna introns, are catalytic rnas found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. they are  mobile genetic elements that move via an rna intermediate. they retrohome to intronless alleles and retrotranspose to ectopic sites, aided by an intron-encoded protein with reverse transcriptase, maturase, and endonuclease activities. many group ii introns identified in bacteria reside on plasmid genomes rather than bacterial chromosomes, implying that plasmids are havens for  these retroelements. this study demonstrates that almost one-fourth of retrotransposition events of the ll.ltrb intron in lactococcus lactis are into the plasmid donor. this level is more than twice that predicted based on target size and plasmid copy number relative to the chromosome. in particular, the fraction of such plasmid targeting events was elevated to more than one-third of  retrotransposition events by mutation of the intron-encoded endonuclease, a situation that may resemble most bacterial group ii introns, which lack the endonuclease. target-site sequences on the plasmid are more relaxed than those on the chromosome, likely accounting for preferred integration into plasmid replicons. furthermore, the direction of integration relative to promoters and origins of replication is consistent with group ii intron retrotransposition into single-stranded dna at replication forks. this work provides mechanistic rationales for the prevalence of group ii introns in natural plasmid populations  and underscores that targeting to plasmids, which are themselves mobile elements, could promote intron spread.

TI  == creation of the first anomeric d/l-sugar kinase by means of directed evolution.
AB  == chemoenzymatic routes toward complex glycoconjugates often depend on the availability of sugar-1-phosphates. yet the chemical synthesis of these vital components is often tedious, whereas natural enzymes capable of anomeric phosphorylation are known to be specific for one or only a few monosaccharides. herein we describe the application of directed evolution and a high-throughput multisugar colorimetric screen to enhance the catalytic capabilities of the escherichia coli galactokinase galk. from this approach, one particular galk mutant carrying a single amino acid exchange (y371h) displayed a surprisingly substantial degree of kinase activity toward sugars as diverse as d-galacturonic  acid, d-talose, l-altrose, and l-glucose, all of which failed as wild-type galk substrates. furthermore, this mutant provides enhanced turnover of the small pool of sugars converted by the wild-type enzyme. comparison of this mutation to the recently solved structure of lactococcus lactis galk begins to provide a blueprint for further engineering of this vital class of enzyme. in addition, the rapid access to such promiscuous sugar c-1 kinases will significantly enhance accessibility to natural and unnatural sugar-1-phosphates and thereby impact both in vitro and in vivo glycosylation methodologies, such as natural product glycorandomization.

TI  == characterization of the llaci methyltransferase from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris w15 provides new insights into the biology of type ii restriction-modification systems.
AB  == the gene encoding the llaci methyltransferase (m.llaci) from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris w15 was overexpressed in escherichia coli. the enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity using three consecutive steps of chromatography  on phosphocellulose, blue-agarose and superose 12hr, yielding a protein of m(r) 31 300+/-1000 under denaturing conditions. the exact position of the start codon  aug was determined by protein microsequencing. this enzyme recognizes the specific palindromic sequence 5'-aagctt-3'. purified m.llaci was characterized. unlike many other methyltransferases, m.llaci exists in solution predominantly as a dimer. it modifies the first adenine residue at the 5' end of the specific sequence to n(6)-methyladenine and thus is functionally identical to the corresponding methyltransferases of the hindiii (haemophilus influenzae rd) and ecoviii (escherichia coli e1585-68) restriction-modification systems. this is reflected in the identity of m.llaci with m.hindiii and m.ecoviii noted at the amino acid sequence level (50 % and 62 %, respectively) and in the presence of nine sequence motifs conserved among n(6)-adenine beta-class methyltransferases.  however, polyclonal antibodies raised against m.ecoviii cross-reacted with m.llaci but not with m.hindiii. restriction endonucleases require mg(2+) for phosphodiester bond cleavage. mg(2+) was shown to be a strong inhibitor of the m.llaci enzyme and its isospecific homologues. this observation suggests that sensitivity of the m.llaci to mg(2+) may strengthen the restriction activity of the cognate endonuclease in the bacterial cell. other biological implications of  this finding are also discussed.

AB  == the gram-positive bacterium lactococcus lactis is of major importance to the dairy industry due to its conversion of lactose to lactic acid leading to the acidification of milk. to investigate which proteins are induced when l. lactis is exposed to conditions of low ph, we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to follow how protein expression changes with the degree of acidification. we found that reducing the ph of the growth medium with hydrochloric acid induced the synthesis of a small subset of proteins. the majority of these proteins were  induced both after a minor (ph 5.5) and a major (ph 4.5) reduction in ph. among the most strongly induced proteins, we identified the oxidative stress proteins superoxide dismutase and alkylhydroperoxidase as well as the autoinducer synthesis protein, luxs. we also observed a differential induction of heat shock  proteins by low ph as members of the ctsr regulon, clpe and clpp were induced at  both ph 5.5 and 4.5, while hrca-regulated chaperones, groel, groes, dnak and grpe were induced only at ph 4.5. in addition, we identified two proteins repressed by low ph that proved to be the l. lactis hpr protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate sugar phosphotransferase system and the trigger factor known to participate in the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides.

TI  == beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase iii (fabh) is essential for bacterial fatty acid synthesis.
AB  == beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (acp) synthase iii (kas iii, also called acetoacetyl-acp synthase) encoded by the fabh gene is thought to catalyze the first elongation reaction (claisen condensation) of type ii fatty acid synthesis  in bacteria and plant plastids. however, direct in vivo evidence that kas iii catalyzes an essential reaction is lacking, because no mutant organism deficient  in this activity has been isolated. we report the first bacterial strain lacking  kas iii, a fabh mutant constructed in the gram-positive bacterium lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis il1403. the mutant strain carries an in-frame deletion of the kas iii active site region and was isolated by gene replacement using a medium supplemented with a source of saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids. the mutant strain is devoid of kas iii activity and fails to grow in the absence of supplementation with exogenous long-chain fatty acids demonstrating that kas iii plays an essential role in cellular metabolism. however, the l. lactis fabh deletion mutant requires only long-chain unsaturated fatty acids for  growth, a source of long-chain saturated fatty acids is not required. because both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are required for growth when fatty acid synthesis is blocked by biotin starvation (which prevents the synthesis of malonyl-coa), another pathway for saturated fatty acid synthesis must remain in the fabh deletion strain. indeed, incorporation of [1-14c]acetate into fatty acids in vivo showed that the fabh mutant retained about 10% of the fatty acid synthetic ability of the wild-type strain and that this residual synthetic capacity was preferentially diverted to the saturated branch of the pathway. moreover, mass spectrometry showed that the fabh mutant retained low levels of palmitic acid upon fatty acid starvation. derivatives of the fabh deletion mutant strain were isolated that were octanoic acid auxotrophs consistent with biochemical studies indicating that the major role of fabh is production of short-chain fatty acid primers. we also confirmed the essentiality of fabh in escherichia coli by use of a plasmid-based gene insertion/deletion system. together these results provide the first genetic evidence demonstrating that fabh conducts the major condensation reaction in the initiation of type ii fatty acid  biosynthesis in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == lmra is an atp binding cassette (abc) multidrug transporter in lactococcus lactis that is a structural and functional homologue of the human multidrug resistance p-glycoprotein mdr1 (abcb1). lmra is also homologous to msba, an essential abc transporter in escherichia coli involved in the trafficking of lipids, including  lipid a. we have compared the substrate specificities of lmra and msba in detail. surprisingly, lmra was able to functionally substitute for a temperature-sensitive mutant msba in e. coli wd2 at non-permissive temperatures,  suggesting that lmra could transport lipid a. lmra also exhibited a lipid a-stimulated, vanadate-sensitive atpase activity. reciprocally, the expression of msba conferred multidrug resistance on e. coli. similar to lmra, msba interacted  with photoactivatable substrate [3h]azidopine, displayed a daunomycin, vinblastine, and hoechst 33342-stimulated vanadate-sensitive atpase activity, and mediated the transport of ethidium from cells and hoechst 33342 in proteoliposomes containing purified and functionally reconstituted protein. taken together, these data demonstrate that msba and lmra have overlapping substrate specificities. our observations imply the presence of structural elements in the  recently published crystal structures of msba in e. coli and vibrio cholera (chang, g., and roth, c. b. (2001) science 293, 1793-1800; chang, g. (2003) j. mol. biol. 330, 419-430) that support drug-protein interactions and suggest a possible role for lmra in lipid trafficking in l. lactis.

TI  == molecular structure of galactokinase.
AB  == galactokinase plays a key role in normal galactose metabolism by catalyzing the atp-dependent phosphorylation of alpha-d-galactose to galactose 1-phosphate. in humans, mutations in the galactokinase gene can lead to the diseased state referred to as type ii galactosemia. here we describe the three-dimensional structure of galactokinase from lactococcus lactis determined to 2.1-a resolution. as expected from amino acid sequence alignments, galactokinase adopts a similar topology to that observed for members of the ghmp superfamily. the n-terminal domain is characterized by a five-stranded mixed beta-sheet while the  c-terminal motif is dominated by two distinct four-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheets. the structure was solved in the presence of alpha-d-galactose and inorganic phosphate. these ligands are wedged between the n- and c-terminal domains. amino acid side chains responsible for anchoring the sugar ligand to the protein include arg36, glu42, asp45, asp183, and tyr233. both arg36 and asp183 are strictly conserved in the amino acid sequences available in the literature thus far for galactokinases. interestingly, the carboxylate side chain of asp183  is positioned within 3.5 a of the c-1 hydroxyl group of galactose, whereas the guanidinium group of arg36 is situated between both the c-1 hydroxyl group and the inorganic phosphate. most likely these residues play key roles in catalysis.  the structure of galactokinase described here serves as a model for understanding the functional consequences of point mutations known to result in type ii galactosemia in humans.

TI  == engineering lactic acid bacteria with pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase genes for ethanol production from zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria are candidates for engineered production of ethanol from biomass because they are food-grade microorganisms that can, in many cases, metabolize a variety of sugars and grow under harsh conditions. in an effort to divert fermentation from production of lactic acid to ethanol, plasmids were constructed to express pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase (adh), encoded by the pdc and adhb genes of zymomonas mobilis, in lactic acid bacteria. several strains were transformed with the plasmids, and transcription of pdc and adhb was confirmed by northern hybridization analysis of transformants. pdc and adh enzyme activities were at least 5- to 10-fold lower in these bacteria compared to escherichia coli transformed with the same plasmid. glucose fermentations were carried out, and some, but not all, of the transformed strains produced more ethanol than the untransformed parent strains. however, lactic acid was the primary fermentation product formed by all of the transformants, indicating that adh and pdc activities were insufficient to divert significant carbon flow towards ethanol.

TI  == proteome analysis of the purine stimulon from lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a comparative expression proteome analysis was carried out by analyzing differential expression patterns of pulse-labelled proteins on two-dimensional gels under standard conditions and during purine nucleotide starvation, followed  by mass spectrometric identification of regulated proteins. based upon the expression patterns, three stimulons could be identified in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. the psu proteins (purine starvation up-regulated) had increased  synthesis during purine depletion in a purine auxotroph. among these proteins were enzymes of the purine biosynthesis pathways (pure, purs, purm, purl), and enzymes involved in the generation of c1 units (glya, fhs). c1 units are primarily required for purine biosynthesis. upon analysis of the nucleotide sequence preceding the structural genes for these proteins in the l. lactis il1403 genome sequence showed that all contained purbox-pribnov box structures resembling the purr activated promoters for the purdek and purcsqlf operons. most, and possibly all members of the psu stimulon are thus members of the purr regulon. five psu proteins could not be identified. the second stimulon, the psd  stimulon (purine starvation decreased), whose members are down-regulated during purine depletion, contained proteins related to protein synthesis (ppsb, ef-ts, trigger factor), or to gtpases (ftsz, ef-ts); or are involved in energy metabolism (gapb, ccpa). no common regulatory elements could be found for members of this stimulon. two psd proteins escaped identification. the last, dcu (decoynine up-regulated), stimulon contained proteins whose synthesis escaped the severe general depression during inhibition of the gmp synthetase by decoynine. this regulon was comprised of mostly glycolytic enzymes (fructose bisphosphate aldolase, enolase, pyruvate kinase) and translation elongation factors (gtpases:  ef-tu, ef-g). two dcu proteins could not be identified. out of 28 proteins subjected to mass spectrometry, 19 could be readily identified despite the fact that only the genome sequence of a strain of l. lactis subsp. lactis was available. the two subspecies share about 85% sequence identity, comparable to the genetic distance between escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. a success rate of 68% indicates that it may be feasible to perform proteomics based upon genomic sequences of relatives outside the genus.

TI  == genetic organization and molecular analysis of the ecoviii restriction-modification system of escherichia coli e1585-68 and its comparison with isospecific homologs.
AB  == the ecoviii restriction-modification (r-m) system is carried by the escherichia coli e1585-68 natural plasmid pec156 (4,312 bp). the two genes were cloned and characterized. the g+c content of the ecoviii r-m system is 36.1%, which is significantly lower than the average g+c content of either plasmid pec156 (43.6%) or e. coli genomic dna (50.8%). the difference suggests that there is a possibility that the ecoviii r-m system was recently acquired by the genome. the  921-bp ecoviii endonuclease (r. ecoviii) gene (ecoviiir) encodes a 307-amino-acid protein with an m(r) of 35,554. the convergently oriented ecoviii methyltransferase (m. ecoviii) gene (ecoviiim) consists of 912 bp that code for a 304-amino-acid protein with an m(r) of 33,930. the exact positions of the start codon aug were determined by protein microsequencing. both enzymes recognize the  specific palindromic sequence 5'-aagctt-3'. preparations of ecoviii r-m enzymes purified to homogeneity were characterized. r. ecoviii acts as a dimer and cleaves a specific sequence between two adenine residues, leaving 4-nucleotide 5' protruding ends. m. ecoviii functions as a monomer and modifies the first adenine residue at the 5' end of the specific sequence to n(6)-methyladenine. these enzymes are thus functionally identical to the corresponding enzymes of the hindiii (haemophilus influenzae rd) and llaci (lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris w15) r-m systems. this finding is reflected by the levels of homology of m. ecoviii with m. hindiii and m. llaci at the amino acid sequence level (50 and 62%, respectively) and by the presence of nine sequence motifs conserved among m(6) n-adenine beta-class methyltransferases. the deduced amino acid sequence of  r. ecoviii shows weak homology with its two isoschizomers, r. hindiii (26%) and r. llaci (17%). a catalytic sequence motif characteristic of restriction endonucleases was found in the primary structure of r. ecoviii (d(108)x(12)dxk(123)), as well as in the primary structures of r. llaci and r. hindiii. polyclonal antibodies raised against r. ecoviii did not react with r. hindiii, while anti-m. ecoviii antibodies cross-reacted with m. llaci but not with m. hindiii. r. ecoviii requires mg(ii) ions for phosphodiester bond cleavage. we found that the same ions are strong inhibitors of the m. ecoviii enzyme. the biological implications of this finding are discussed.

TI  == substrate inhibition of lactococcus lactis cytidine 5'-triphosphate synthase by ammonium chloride is enhanced by salt-dependent tetramer dissociation.
AB  == cytidine 5(')-triphosphate (ctp) synthase (ec 6.4.3.2) catalyzes the transfer of  an amino group to the 4 position of uridine 5(')-triphosphate (utp) to yield ctp. the reaction proceeds by activation of the base moiety of utp by adenosine 5(')-triphosphate (atp)-dependent phosphorylation. the activated intermediate reacts with nh(3) in the solution or is obtained by hydrolysis of glutamine. the  lactococcus lactis ctp synthase shows significant differences from the enzymes from escherichia coli, yeast, and mammals. one is the apparent stability of the l. lactis ctp synthase tetramer in the absence of the nucleotides atp and utp. this condition causes the e. coli, yeast, and mammal enzymes to dissociate into dimers. however, the l. lactis ctp synthase shows substrate inhibition by nh(4)cl that coincides with the range of nh(4)cl concentrations that apparently dissociates tetrameric enzyme into dimers. even though regular substrate inhibition was observed with nh(4)cl when the ionic strength was held constant, a significant part of the inhibition could be shown to be due to the increase in ionic strength with increasing substrate concentration. since the substrate inhibition by nh(4)cl was relieved by increasing the equimolar atp and utp concentrations, it appeared that the substrate nucleotides stabilized the tetramer in a manner similar to that found in the absence of salt for other ctp synthases. in contrast to the suggested hydrophobic nature of the tetramer interactions in e. coli ctp synthase, the dissociation of the l. lactis ctp synthase tetramer in response to an increase in ionic strength suggests that the  tetramer is stabilized by ionic interactions.

AB  == a gene encoding a putative peptidoglycan hydrolase, named acmb, which is a paralogue of the major autolysin acma gene, was identified in the lactococcus lactis genome sequence. the acmb gene is transcribed in l. lactis mg1363 and its  expression is modulated during cellular growth. the encoded acmb protein has a modular structure with three domains: an n-terminal domain, especially rich in ser, thr, pro and asn residues, resembling a cell-wall-associated domain; a central domain homologous to the enterococcus hirae muramidase catalytic domain;  and a c-terminal domain of unknown function. a recombinant acmb derivative, devoid of its n-terminal domain, was expressed in escherichia coli. it exhibited  hydrolysing activity on the peptidoglycan of several gram-positive bacteria, including l. lactis. though showing sequence similarity with enterococcal muramidase, acmb has n-acetylglucosaminidase specificity. the acmb gene was inactivated in order to evaluate the role of the enzyme. acmb does not appear to  be involved in cell separation but contributes to cellular autolysis.

TI  == active lipoprotein precursors in the gram-positive eubacterium lactococcus lactis.
AB  == lipid-modified proteins play important roles at the interface between eubacterial cells and their environment. the importance of lipoprotein processing by signal peptidase ii (spase ii) is underscored by the fact that this enzyme is essential  for viability of the gram-negative eubacterium escherichia coli. in contrast, spase ii is not essential for growth and viability of the gram-positive eubacterium bacillus subtilis. this could be due to alternative amino-terminal lipoprotein processing, which was shown previously to occur in spase ii mutants of b. subtilis. alternatively, uncleaved lipoprotein precursors might be functional. to explore further the importance of lipoprotein processing in gram-positive eubacteria, an spase ii mutant strain of lactococcus lactis was constructed. although some of the 39 (predicted) lactococcal lipoproteins, such as prtm and oppa, are essential for growth in milk, the growth of spase ii mutant l. lactis cells in this medium was not affected. furthermore, the activity of the strictly prtm-dependent extracellular protease prtp, which is required for casein degradation, was not impaired in the absence of spase ii. importantly, no alternative processing of pre-prtm and pre-oppa was observed in cells lacking spase ii. taken together, these findings show for the first time that authentic lipoprotein precursors retain biological activity.

TI  == osmoregulation in lactococcus lactis: busr, a transcriptional repressor of the glycine betaine uptake system busa.
AB  == the busa (opua) locus of lactococcus lactis encodes a glycine betaine uptake system. transcription of busa is osmotically inducible and its induction after an osmotic stress is reduced in the presence of glycine betaine. using a genetic screen in clg802, an escherichia coli strain carrying a lacz transcriptional fusion expressed under the control of the busa promoter, we isolated a genomic fragment from the l. lactis subsp. cremoris strain mg1363, which represses transcription from busap. the cloned locus responsible for this repression was identified as a gene present upstream from the busa operon, encoding a putative dna binding protein. this gene was named busr. electrophoretic mobility shift and footprinting experiments showed that busr is able to bind a site that overlaps the busa promoter. overexpression of busr in l. lactis reduced expression of busa. its disruption led to increased and essentially constitutive transcription  of busa at low osmolarity. therefore, busr is a major actor of the osmotic regulation of busa in l. lactis.

AB  == we describe the effects of modulating the activities of glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, and phosphoglucomutase on the branching point between sugar  degradation and the biosynthesis of sugar nucleotides involved in the production  of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis by lactococcus lactis. this was realized by using a described isogenic l. lactis mutant with reduced enzyme activities or by  controlled expression of the well-characterized genes for phosphoglucomutase or glucokinase from escherichia coli or bacillus subtilis, respectively. the role of decreased metabolic flux was studied in l. lactis strains with decreased phosphofructokinase activities. the concomitant reduction of the activities of phosphofructokinase and other enzymes encoded by the las operon (lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase) resulted in significant changes in the concentrations of sugar-phosphates. in contrast, a >25-fold overproduction of glucokinase resulted in 7-fold-increased fructose-6-phosphate levels and 2-fold-reduced glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate levels. however, these increased sugar-phosphate concentrations did not affect the levels of sugar nucleotides. finally, an approximately 100-fold overproduction of phosphoglucomutase resulted in 5-fold-increased levels of both udp-glucose and udp-galactose. while the increased concentrations of sugar-phosphates or sugar nucleotides did not significantly affect the production of exopolysaccharides, they demonstrate the metabolic flexibility of l. lactis.

TI  == dna target site requirements for homing in vivo of a bacterial group ii intron encoding a protein lacking the dna endonuclease domain.
AB  == group ii intron-encoded proteins (ieps), which have maturase and reverse transcriptase activities, form a ribonucleoprotein (rnp) complex with the intron  rna. some ieps also have a c-terminal dna-binding region and conserved dna endonuclease domain involved in the recognition and cleavage of specific dna target sites used for intron homing. rmint1 is a mobile group ii intron of sinorhizobium meliloti, the iep of which lacks the endonuclease domain, as do over half of their bacterial counterparts. here, we analyzed the dna target sequence requirements for homing in vivo of intron rmint1 and compared these requirements to those established for the lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb intron, a representative of mobile subgroup iia introns encoding proteins with functional c-terminal dna endonuclease domains. as for ll.ltrb, rmint1 homing requires modifiable base-pairing interactions between the intron rna and the dna target, involving 13 nucleotides. however, instead of the delta-delta' interaction, typical of subgroup iia introns, we demonstrate that rmint1 recognizes the first  nucleotide within the 3' exon of the target site by a new ebs3/ibs3 pairing predicted for subgroup iib self-splicing introns. unlike ll.ltrb, there are less  stringent requirements for rmint1 recognition of distal 5' and 3' exon regions, where only single nucleotide positions are fixed constraints for intron homing. our results predict differences in the dna target-site requirements among group ii introns, which may have mechanistic and evolutionary implications.

AB  == a cluster containing five similarly oriented genes involved in the metabolism of  galactose via the leloir pathway in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363 was cloned and characterized. the order of the genes is galpmkte, and these genes encode a galactose permease (galp), an aldose 1-epimerase (galm), a galactokinase (galk), a hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (galt), and a udp-glucose 4-epimerase (gale), respectively. this genetic organization reflects the order of the metabolic conversions during galactose utilization via the leloir pathway. the functionality of the galp, galk, galt, and gale genes was shown by complementation studies performed with both escherichia coli and l. lactis mutants. the galp permease is a new member of the galactoside-pentose-hexuronide  family of transporters. the capacity of galp to transport galactose was demonstrated by using galp disruption mutant strains of l. lactis mg1363. a galk  deletion was constructed by replacement recombination, and the mutant strain was  not able to ferment galactose. disruption of the gale gene resulted in a deficiency in cell separation along with the appearance of a long-chain phenotype when cells were grown on glucose as the sole carbon source. recovery of the wild-type phenotype for the gale mutant was obtained either by genetic complementation or by addition of galactose to the growth medium.

AB  == walker and klaenhammer (2001) developed a novel expression system in lactococcus  lactis that facilitated the release of beta-galactosidase (117 kda monomer) without the need for secretion or export signals. the system is based on the controlled expression of integrated prophage holin and lysin cassettes via a lactococcal bacteriophage phi31 transcriptional activator (tac31a) that resides on a high-copy plasmid. approximately 85% of beta-galactosidase activity was detected in the supernatant of leaky lactococci without evidence of hindered growth, cell lysis, or membrane damage. the objective of this study was to determine if intracellular peptidases were externalized from leaky lactococci. five l. lactis peptidases (pepa, pepc, pepn, pepo and pepxp) and two lactobacillus helveticus peptidases (pepn and pepo) were cloned and overexpressed on two high-copy vectors. the lactococcal peptidases were also cloned into the high-copy vector that contained the tac31a transcriptional activator to determine if they were externalized from the leaky prophage-containing l. lactis subsp. lactis strain nck203. two of the lactococcal peptidases (pepa and pepo) required  an additional strong promoter (lactobacillus paracasei p144) and optimized assay  conditions to detect enzyme activity. results showed different levels of enzymatic overexpression associated with the cellular fraction (2 to 250-fold increases in activity) and negligible amounts of activity present within the supernatant fraction (0 to 6% of total peptidase activity). the lactococcal phage-based protein release mechanism did not facilitate the externalization of the lactococcal peptidases investigated in this study.

AB  == ctp synthase catalyzes the reaction glutamine + utp + atp --> glutamate + ctp + adp + pi. the rate of the reaction is greatly enhanced by the allosteric activator gtp. we have studied the glutaminase half-reaction of ctp synthase from lactococcus lactis and its response to the allosteric activator gtp and nucleotides that bind to the active site. in contrast to what has been found for  the escherichia coli enzyme, gtp activation of the l. lactis enzyme did not result in similar kcat values for the glutaminase activity and glutamine hydrolysis coupled to ctp synthesis. gtp activation of the glutaminase reaction never reached the levels of gtp-activated ctp synthesis, not even when the active site was saturated with utp and the nonhydrolyzeable atp-binding analog adenosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate. furthermore, under conditions where the rate of glutamine hydrolysis exceeded that of ctp synthesis, gtp would stimulate ctp synthesis. these results indicate that the l. lactis enzyme differs significantly from the e. coli enzyme. for the e. coli enzyme, activation by gtp was found to stimulate glutamine hydrolysis and ctp synthesis to the same extent, suggesting that the major function of gtp binding is to activate the chemical steps of glutamine hydrolysis. an alternative mechanism for the action of gtp on l. lactis ctp synthase is suggested. here the binding of gtp to the allosteric site promotes coordination of the phosphorylation of utp and hydrolysis of glutamine for optimal efficiency in ctp synthesis rather than just acting to increase the rate of glutamine hydrolysis itself.

TI  == a pcr-based method for identification of lactobacilli at the genus level.
AB  == we developed a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method for the identification of lactobacilli at the genus level. one specific primer, lblma1-rev, was designed by analysing similarities between the nucleotide sequence of the spacer between the 16s and 23s rrna genes in a number of lactobacillus strains. amplification with lblma1-rev and r16-1, a universal primer, generated a pcr product for 23 lactobacillus species. electrophoresis did not reveal any discrete bands when escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus, carnobacterium pissicola,  pediococcus pentosaceus, bifidobacterium bifidum, weissella confusa, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus aureus or listeria monocytogenes dna were used as template.

TI  == physiological function of the maltose operon regulator, malr, in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == background: maltose metabolism is initiated by an atp-dependent permease system in lactococcus lactis. the subsequent degradation of intracellular maltose is performed by the concerted action of pi-dependent maltose phosphorylase and beta-phosphoglucomutase. in some gram-positive bacteria, maltose metabolism is regulated by a maltose operon regulator (malr), belonging to the laci-galr family of transcriptional regulators. a gene presumed to encode malr has been found directly downstream the maltose phosphorylase-encoding gene, malp in l. lactis. the purpose of this study was to investigate the physiological role of the malr protein in maltose metabolism in l. lactis. results: a l. lactis ssp. lactis mutant, tmb5004, deficient in the putative malr protein, was physiologically characterised. the mutant was not able to ferment maltose, while its capability to grow on glucose as well as trehalose was not affected. the activity of maltose phosphorylase and beta-phosphoglucomutase was not affected in the mutant. however, the specific maltose uptake rate in the wild type was, at its lowest, five times higher than in the mutant. this difference in maltose uptake increased as the maltose concentration in the assay was increased. conclusion: according to amino acid sequence similarities, the presumed malr is a member of the laci-galr  family of transcriptional regulators. due to the suggested activating effect on maltose transport and absence of effect on the activities of maltose phosphorylase and beta-phosphoglucomutase, malr of l. lactis is considered rather as an activator than a repressor.

TI  == the quaternary structure of the hisz-hisg n-1-(5'-phosphoribosyl)-atp transferase from lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the n-1-(5'-phosphoribosyl)-atp transferase (atp-prtase) encoded by the hisg locus catalyzes the condensation of atp with prpp, the first reaction in the biosynthesis of histidine. unlike the homohexameric forms of the enzyme found in  escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, the atp-prtase from lactococcus lactis and a number of other bacterial species consists of two different polypeptides, both of which are required for catalytic activity (sissler et al. (1999) proc. natl. acad. sci. 96, 8985-8990). the first of these is a truncated version of hisg that is approximately 100 amino acids shorter than the canonical  versions. the second, hisz, is a 328-residue version of a class ii aminoacyl-trna synthetase catalytic domain that possesses no aminoacylation function. here, the  molecular mass and subunit composition of the l. lactis hisz-hisg heteromeric atp-prtase is investigated using liquid chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, and quantitative protein sequencing. individually, hisz and  hisg form inactive but stable dimers with association constants in the range of 2.5-3.3 x 10(5) m(-1). when both types of subunits are present, a quaternary octamer complex is formed with a sedimentation coefficient of 10.1 s. incubation  of this complex with atp promotes a shift to 10.7 s. by contrast, incubation with the allosteric modulators amp and histidine destabilizes the complex, resulting in a shift to multiple species in equilibrium with an average of 9.3 s. while this octameric structure is unique to both the phosphoribosyl transferases and the aminoacyl-trna synthetases, the change in sedimentation behavior elicited by  substrates and inhibitors suggests the presence of allosteric regulatory mechanisms reminiscent of other multisubunit enzymes of metabolic importance.

TI  == the extent to which atp demand controls the glycolytic flux depends strongly on the organism and conditions for growth.
AB  == using molecular genetics we have introduced uncoupled atpase activity in two different bacterial species, escherichia coli and lactococcus lactis, and determined the elasticities of the growth rate and glycolytic flux towards the intracellular [atp]/[adp] ratio. during balanced growth in batch cultures of e. coli the atp demand was found to have almost full control on the glycolytic flux  (fcc=0.96) and the flux could be stimulated by 70%. in contrast to this, in l. lactis the control by atp demand on the glycolytic flux was close to zero. however, when we used non-growing cells of l. lactis (which have a low glycolytic flux) the atp demand had a high flux control and the flux could be stimulated more than two fold. we suggest that the extent to which atp demand controls the glycolytic flux depends on how much excess capacity of glycolysis is present in the cells.

TI  == binding of clostridium difficile surface layer proteins to gastrointestinal tissues.
AB  == clostridium difficile is the etiological agent of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, a potentially serious condition frequently affecting elderly hospitalized patients. while tissue damage is primarily induced by two toxins, the mechanism of gut colonization, and particularly the role of bacterial adherence to the mucosa, remains to be clarified. previous studies have shown binding of c. difficile whole cells to cultured cell lines and suggested the existence of multiple adhesins, only one of which has been molecularly characterized. in this  paper, we have investigated tissue binding of c. difficile surface layer proteins (slps), which are the predominant outer surface components and are encoded by the slpa gene. the adherence of c. difficile to hep-2 cells was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, which showed that antibodies to the high-molecular-weight (mw) slp inhibited adherence. immunohistochemical analysis of human gastrointestinal tissue sections revealed strong binding both to the surface epithelium lining the digestive cavities and to the subjacent lamina propria, while glands were negative. a similar pattern was observed in the mouse. by using purified recombinant slps, we show that binding is largely mediated by the high-mw slp. by western blotting analysis, we have identified two potential ligands of the c. difficile slps, one of which may be specific to the gut. by using purified extracellular matrix components immobilized on nitrocellulose, we also show slp binding to collagen i, thrombospondin, and vitronectin, but not to collagen iv, fibronectin, or laminin. these results raise the possibility that the slps play a role both in the initial colonization of the gut by c. difficile and in the subsequent inflammatory reaction.

TI  == aquaglyceroporins, one channel for two molecules.
AB  == in the light of the recently published structure of glpf and aqp1, we have analysed the nature of the residues which could be involved in the formation of the selectivity filter of aquaporins, glycerol facilitators and aquaglyceroporins. we demonstrate that the functional specificity for major intrinsic protein (mip) channels can be explained on one side by analysing the polar environment of the residues that form the selective filter. on the other side, we show that the channel selectivity could be associated with the oligomeric state of the membrane protein. we conclude that a non-polar environment in the vicinity of the top of helix 5 could allow aquaglyceroporins and glpf to exist as monomers within the hydrophobic environment of the membrane.

TI  == effect of reducing agents on the acidification capacity and the proton motive force of lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris resting cells.
AB  == reducing agents are potential inhibitors of the microbial growth. we have shown recently that dithiothreitol (dtt), nabh(4) and h(2) can modify the proton motive force of resting cells of escherichia coli by increasing the membrane protons permeability [eur. j. biochem. 262 (1999) 595]. in the present work, the effect of reducing agents on the resting cells of lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, a species widely employed in dairy processes was investigated. dtt did not affect the acidification nor the deltaph, in contrast to the effect previously reported  on e. coli. the deltapsi was slightly increased (30 mv) at low ph (ph 4) in the presence of 31 mm dtt or 2.6 mm nabh(4). in the case of na(2)s(2)o(4), small amounts (0.9 mm) drastically decreased the acidification range and this product was shown to abolish the deltaph. these results are discussed in terms of the diversity of action of the chemical reagents and strain sensitivity.

TI  == bacterial multidrug resistance mediated by a homologue of the human multidrug transporter p-glycoprotein.
AB  == most atp-binding cassette (abc) multidrug transporters known to date are of eukaryotic origin, such as the p-glycoproteins (pgps) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (mrps). only one well-characterized abc multidrug  transporter, lmra, is of bacterial origin. on the basis of its structural and functional characteristics, this bacterial protein is classified as a member of the p-glycoprotein cluster of the abc transporter superfamily. lmra can even substitute for p-glycoprotein in human lung fibroblast cells, suggesting that this type of transporter is conserved from bacteria to man. the functional similarity between bacterial lmra and human p-glycoprotein is further exemplified by their currently known spectrum of substrates, consisting mainly of hydrophobic cationic compounds. in addition, lmra was found to confer resistance to eight classes of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and homologs of lmra have been found in pathogenic bacteria, supporting the clinical and academic value of studying this  bacterial protein. current studies are focused on unraveling the mechanism by which abc multidrug transporters, such as lmra, couple the hydrolysis of atp to the translocation of drugs across the membrane. recent evidence indicates that lmra mediates drug transport by an alternating two-site transport mechanism.

TI  == modulation of gene expression from the arabinose-inducible arabad promoter.
AB  == the arabinose-inducible p(bad) promoter suffers from all-or-none gene expression  in which cells harboring the natively controlled arabinose transport gene (arae)  are either induced or uninduced, the relative fraction of which is controlled by  the concentration of arabinose. the population-averaged variation in expression from p(bad) as a function of inducer concentration is proportional to the percentage of cells that are fully induced (vs. uninduced) rather than the level  of expression in individual cells. because of its undesirable effects on the expression of heterologous genes, the all-or-none phenomenon was eliminated in escherichia coli by expression of arae from arabinose-independent (either the lactococcus lactis constitutive or iptg-inducible lac) promoters. in these arabinose-transport engineered cells, variation in p(bad) expression with arabinose concentration was a result of variation of the expression level in individual cells with all cells in the population having approximately the same induction level.

AB  == the protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica is an ancient eukaryotic cell that shows morphologically atypical organelles and differs metabolically from higher eukaryotic cells. the aim of this study was to determine the subcellular localization of ameba nad+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (adh2). the enzyme activity was present in soluble and mainly in particulate material whose density  was 1.105 in a sucrose gradient. by differential centrifugation, most of the adh  activity sedimented at 160,000 g (160,000-g pellet), similar to the escherichia coli polymeric adhe. in the coomassie staining of the 160,000-g pellet analyzed by electrophoresis, a 96-kda protein was more prominent than in other fractions;  this band was recognized by antibodies against lactococcus lactis adhe. by gold labeling, the antibodies recognized the granular material that mainly constitutes the 160,000-g pellet and a material that sedimented along with the internal membrane vesicles. by negative staining, the 160,000-g fraction showed helical rodlike structures with an average length of 103 nm; almost no membrane vesicles  were observed in this pellet. in internal membrane fractions, no rodlike structures were found, but protomerlike round structures were observed. these results indicate that the main amebic nad+-dependent adh2 activity is naturally organized as rodlike helical particles, similar to bacterial adhe. detection of adh2 in membrane fractions might be explained by cosedimentation of the multimeric adh during membrane purification.

TI  == binding of a group ii intron-encoded reverse transcriptase/maturase to its high affinity intron rna binding site involves sequence-specific recognition and autoregulates translation.
AB  == mobile group ii introns encode reverse transcriptases that bind specifically to the intron rnas to promote both intron mobility and rna splicing (maturase activity). previous studies with the lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb intron suggested  a model in which the intron-encoded protein (ltra) binds first to a primary high-affinity binding site in intron subdomain diva, an idiosyncratic structure at the beginning of the ltra coding sequence, and then makes additional contacts  with conserved regions of the intron to fold the rna into the catalytically active structure. here, we analyzed the diva binding site by iterative in vitro selection and in vitro mutagenesis. our results show that ltra binds to a small region at the distal end of diva that contains the ribosome-binding site and initiation codon of the ltra open reading frame. the critical elements are in a small stem-loop structure emanating from a purine-rich internal loop, with both sequence and structure playing a role in ltra recognition. the ribosome-binding site falls squarely within the ltra-binding region and is sequestered directly by the binding of ltra or by stabilization of the small stem-loop or both. finally,  by using lacz fusions in escherichia coli, we show that the binding of ltra to diva down-regulates translation. this mode of regulation limits accumulation of the potentially deleterious intron-encoded protein and may facilitate splicing by halting ribosome entry into the intron. the recognition of the diva loop-stem-loop structure accounts, in part, for the intron specificity of group ii intron maturases and has parallels in template-recognition mechanisms used by  other reverse transcriptases.

AB  == a mycobacteriophage ms6 strong promoter region (p(lys)) was isolated by using transcriptional fusions with the lacz reporter gene. two tandem sigma(70)-like promoter sequences (p1 and p2) were found in this region. dna sequencing of the promoter downstream region revealed a 214-bp leader sequence followed by five adjacent coding regions of 231 bp (orf1), 1,152 bp (orf2), 996 bp (orf3), 231 bp  (orf4), and 372 (orf5). orf1 has the potential to encode a 77-amino-acid protein  which revealed similarity to mycobacteriophage tm4 gp90, a predicted protein with unknown function. orf2 encodes a 384-amino-acid protein which is related to several bacteriophage amidases. this protein induced cell lysis upon addition of  chloroform, confirming its mureinolytic activity. orf3 encodes a 332-amino-acid protein which is related to tm4 gp30, a protein with sequence similarity to amidases. orf4 encodes a 77-amino-acid holin-like protein with significant similarity to the holin of lactococcus lactis r1t bacteriophage. orf5 encodes a 124-amino-acid protein which is related to mycobacteriophage l5 gp30, a protein with unknown function. these data indicate that the promoter region p(lys) drives the transcription of the ms6 lysis genes. an intrinsic transcription termination  signal was identified in the leader sequence. experiments using lacz fusions showed that beta-galactosidase synthesis is inhibited when this transcription termination signal is present in the leader sequence. in conclusion, mycobacteriophage ms6 cell lysis genes are expressed by their own promoter region, independently of virion structure and assembly protein genes. moreover, an antitermination mechanism might be involved in their transcription regulation.

TI  == rusa proteins from the extreme thermophile aquifex aeolicus and lactococcal phage r1t resolve holliday junctions.
AB  == the rusa protein of escherichia coli is a dna structure-specific endonuclease that resolves holliday junction intermediates formed during dna replication, recombination and repair by introducing symmetrically paired incisions 5' to cc dinucleotides. it is encoded by the defective prophage dlp12, which raises the possibility that it may be of bacteriophage origin. we show that rusa-like sequences are indeed often associated with prophage sequences in the genomes of several bacterial species. they are also found in many bacteriophages, including  lactococcus lactis phage r1t. however, rusa is also present in the chromosome of  the hyperthermophilic bacterium aquifex aeolicus. in this case, there is no obvious association of rusa with prophage-like sequences. given the ancient lineage of aquifex aeolicus, this observation provides the first indication that  rusa may be of bacterial origin. the rusa proteins of a. aeolicus and bacteriophage r1t were purified and shown to resolve holliday junctions. the r1t  enzyme also promotes dna repair in strains lacking the ruvabc resolvase. both enzymes cleave junctions in a sequence-dependent manner, but the a. aeolicus rusa shows a different sequence preference (3' to tg) from the e. coli protein (5' to  cc), and the r1t rusa has relaxed sequence dependence, requiring only a single cytosine.

AB  == a novel pepx gene was cloned from isolated dna of lactococcus lactis by pcr. the  deduced amino acid sequence of the 89-kda protein showed 94, 93, 65, and 44% identity with the pepx protein from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbruecki subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus helveticus, respectively, and contained a serine protease g-k-s-y-l-g consensus motif. the pepx gene has been cloned into pet17b and was expressed at a high level in escherichia coli bl21 (de3) lyss. pepx was purified  to approximate homogeneity with ammonium sulfate precipitation and deae sephadex  a-50 chromatography. optimal pepx activity was observed at ph 8.0 and 37 degrees  c. according to sds-page analysis, pepx has a molecular mass of approximately 89  kda. the peptidase can remove completely the unwanted x-pro from the n-terminal of the target protein, releasing the naturally active protein and peptide, revealing a prospective application of pepx in large-scale production of pharmaceutical protein and peptide products.

TI  == osmosensing and osmoregulatory compatible solute accumulation by bacteria.
AB  == bacteria inhabit natural and artificial environments with diverse and fluctuating osmolalities, salinities and temperatures. many maintain cytoplasmic hydration, growth and survival most effectively by accumulating kosmotropic organic solutes  (compatible solutes) when medium osmolality is high or temperature is low (above  freezing). they release these solutes into their environment when the medium osmolality drops. solutes accumulate either by synthesis or by transport from the extracellular medium. responses to growth in high osmolality medium, including biosynthetic accumulation of trehalose, also protect salmonella typhimurium from  heat shock. osmotically regulated transporters and mechanosensitive channels modulate cytoplasmic solute levels in bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium glutamicum, escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium. each organism harbours multiple osmoregulatory transporters with overlapping substrate specificities. membrane proteins that can act as both osmosensors and osmoregulatory transporters have been identified (secondary transporters prop of e. coli and betp of c. glutamicum as well as abc transporter opua of l. lactis). the molecular bases for the modulation of gene expression and transport activity by temperature and medium osmolality are under intensive investigation with emphasis on the role of the membrane as an antenna for osmo- and/or thermosensors.

TI  == [cloning and structure analysis of a restriction and modification system, llabiii from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris w56].
AB  == a 22.4 kb naturally occurring plasmid pjw566, isolated from l. lactis w56, was found to encode an r/m system named llabiii. the llabiii r/m system was isolated  on a chloramphenicol resistant derivative of plasmid pjw566, resulting in a plasmid pjk1. subcloning analysis showed that the llabiii determinant was located on a 5 kb hindiii-sph i fragment. the fragment was sequenced. it contained a single open reading frame (orf), corresponding to a protein of 1584 or 1576 aa. in the deduced amino acid sequence seven helicase motifs characteristic of endonuclease type i and type iii and a conserved catalysis motif x in the r subunits of type i r/m systems were located in the n-terminus, followed by four conserved motifs found in dna n6-adenine methyltransferases. the c-terminus of the deduced amino acid sequence showed no homology to known r/m systems. therefore, this polypeptide encoded by llabiii is a multifunctional protein possessing putative dna recognition, methylation and restriction activities.

TI  == fish chromatophores as cytosensors in a microscale device: detection of environmental toxins and bacterial pathogens.
AB  == fish chromatophores from betta splendens are used as the cytosensor element in the development of a portable microscale device capable of detecting certain environmental toxins and bacterial pathogens by monitoring changes in pigment granule distribution. the adaptation of chromatophores to a microscale environment has required the development of enabling technologies to produce miniaturized culture chambers, to integrate microfluidics for sample delivery, to miniaturize image capture, and to design new statistical methods for image analyses. betta splendens chromatophores were selected as the cytosensor element  because of their moderate size, their toleration of close contact, and most importantly, for their responses to a broad range of chemicals and pathogenic bacteria. a miniaturized culture chamber has been designed that supports chromatophore viability for as long as 3 months, and that can be easily transported without damage to the cells. new statistical methods for image analyses have been developed that increase sensitivity and also decrease the time required for detection of significant changes in pigment granule distribution. betta chromatophores have been tested for their responses to selected pathogenic  bacteria and chemical agents. we discuss in detail the aggregation of pigment granules seen when chromatophores are incubated with bacillus cereus, a common cause of food poisoning. also described are the more subtle responses of chromatophores to a class of environmental chemical toxins, polynuclear aromatic  hydrocarbons. we show that the chromatophores are able to detect the presence of  certain polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons at concentrations lower than the environment protection agency (epa) 550.1 standards.

AB  == beta-phosphoglucomutase (beta-pgm), a 28 kda monomer, catalyzes the reversible conversion of beta-d-glucose-1-phosphate to beta-d-glucose-6-phosphate in maltose metabolism in a variety of organisms. sequence analysis of beta-pgm indicates that it is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (had) enzyme superfamily, which  evolved to cleave c-cl, c-p and c-op bonds in a variety of substrates. beta-pgm has been crystallized using the hanging-drop method. diffraction-quality crystals of the native protein have been obtained from two conditions, both belonging to space group p2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 53.67, b = 92.78, c = 111.60 and a = 53.21, b = 57.01, c = 76.11 a. to solve the phase problem, selenomethionine (semet) containing beta-pgm crystals have been grown. the semet-containing crystals diffract to high resolution only when grown by microseeding with native crystals. a three-wavelength data set has been collected to 2.3 a on crystals of the semet-substituted beta-pgm. the structure solution is currently being attempted by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (mad) phasing method.

AB  == the nosocomial pathogen enterococcus faecalis has a unique pheromone-inducible conjugative mating system. conjugative transfer of the e. faecalis plasmid pcf10  is specifically induced by the ccf10 peptide pheromone (lvtlvfv). genomic sequence information has recently allowed the identification of putative structural genes coding for the various enterococcal pheromones (d. b. clewell et al., mol. microbiol. 35:246-247, 2000). the ccf10 pheromone sequence lvtlvfv was  found within an open reading frame designated ccfa, encoding a putative lipoprotein precursor. several other pheromone sequences were found in similar locations within other predicted lipoproteins. ccfa shows significant sequence relatedness to the escherichia coli protein yidc, an inner membrane protein translocase, as well as to a large number of homologs identified in gram-positive and in gram-negative bacteria. analysis of the deduced ccfa amino acid sequence suggested that mature ccf10 peptide could be formed from the proteolytic degradation of its signal peptide. expression of the cloned ccfa gene with an inducible expression vector dramatically increased ccf10 production by e. faecalis and also resulted in ccf10 production by lactococcus lactis, a non-pheromone producer. site-directed mutagenesis of the ccfa sequence encoding the ccf10 peptide confirmed that ccfa was a functional genetic determinant for ccf10.

AB  == casitone added to chemically defined medium (cdm) specifically influenced the regulation of the proteinase activity in the natural isolate lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis bgis29. comparative analysis of the influence of casitone present in cdm on the proteolytic activity of strain bgis29 and of l. lactis subsp. cremoris strains sk11 and wg2 indicated that the proteolytic activity of strains  bgis29 and sk11 is casitone-dependent, whereas that of strain wg2 is not. the regulatory region of the prt genes of strain bgis29 was cloned and sequenced. the nucleotide sequence of the prt regulatory region of strain bgis29 was distinctly  different from that of l. lactis subsp. cremoris strains sk11 and wg2. transcriptional gene fusions with the escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase gene (  gusa) were used to study medium-dependent expression of two divergent prtp and prtm promoters of strain bgis29 (designated p (prtp) and p (prtm), respectively). beta-glucuronidase assays and northern blot analysis showed that the activities of p (prtp) and p (prtm) are controlled by casitone at the transcriptional level.

TI  == regulation of the metc-cysk operon, involved in sulfur metabolism in lactococcus  lactis.
AB  == sulfur metabolism in gram-positive bacteria is poorly characterized. information  on the molecular mechanisms of regulation of genes involved in sulfur metabolism  is limited, and no regulator genes have been identified. here we describe the regulation of the lactococcal metc-cysk operon, encoding a cystathionine beta-lyase (metc) and cysteine synthase (cysk). its expression was shown to be negatively affected by high concentrations of cysteine, methionine, and glutathione in the culture medium, while sulfur limitation resulted in a high level of expression. other sulfur sources tested showed no significant effect on  metc-cysk gene expression. in addition we found that o-acetyl-l-serine, the substrate of cysteine synthase, was an inducer of the metc-cysk operon. using a random mutagenesis approach, we identified two genes, cmbr and cmbt, involved in  regulation of metc-cysk expression. the cmbt gene is predicted to encode a transport protein, but its precise role in regulation remains unclear. disruption of cmbt resulted in a two- to threefold reduction of metc-cysk transcription. a 5.7-kb region containing the cmbr gene was cloned and sequenced. the encoded cmbr protein is homologous to the lysr family of regulator proteins and is an activator of the metc-cysk operon. in analogy to cysb from escherichia coli, we propose that cmbr requires acetylserine to be able to bind the activation sites and subsequently activate transcription of the metc-cysk operon.

TI  == trehalose-6-phosphate phosphorylase is part of a novel metabolic pathway for trehalose utilization in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == lactococcus lactis splits phosphorylated trehalose by the action of inorganic phosphate-dependent trehalose-6-phosphate phosphorylase (trepp) in a novel catabolic pathway. trepp was found to catalyze the reversible conversion of trehalose 6-phosphate into beta-glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate by measuring intermediate sugar phosphates in cell extracts from trehalose-cultivated lactococci. according to native page and sds-page, trepp was shown to be a monomeric enzyme with a molecular mass of 94 kda. reaction kinetics suggested that the enzyme follows a ternary complex mechanism with optimal phosphorolysis at 35 degrees c and ph 6.3. the equilibrium constants were found to be 0.026 and 0.032 at ph 6.3 and 7.0, respectively, favoring the formation of  trehalose 6-phosphate. the michaelis-menten constants of trepp for trehalose 6-phosphate, inorganic phosphate, beta-glucose 1-phosphate, and glucose 6-phosphate were determined to be 6, 32, 0.9, and 4 mm, respectively. the trepp-encoding gene, designated trepp, was localized in a putative trehalose operon of l. lactis. this operon includes the gene encoding beta-phosphoglucomutase in addition to three open reading frames believed to encode a transcriptional regulator and two trehalose-specific phosphotransferase  system components. the identity of trepp was confirmed by determining the n-terminal amino acid sequence of trepp and by its overexpression in escherichia  coli and l. lactis, as well as the construction of a lactococcal trepp knockout mutant. furthermore, both trepp and beta-phosphoglucomutase activity were detected in enterococcus faecalis cell extract, indicating that this bacterium exhibits the same trehalose assimilation route as l. lactis.

AB  == the pyrg gene of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, encoding ctp synthase, has been cloned and sequenced. it is flanked upstream by an open reading frame showing homology to several aminotransferases and downstream by an open reading frame of unknown function. l. lactis strains harboring disrupted pyrg alleles were constructed. these mutants required cytidine for growth, proving that in l.  lactis, the pyrg product is the only enzyme responsible for the amination of utp  to ctp. in contrast to the situation in escherichia coli, an l. lactis pyrg mutant could be constructed in the presence of a functional cdd gene encoding cytidine deaminase. a characterization of the enzyme revealed similar properties  as found for ctp synthases from other organisms. however, unlike the majority of  ctp synthases the lactococcal enzyme can convert dutp to dctp, although a half saturation concentration of 0.6 mm for dutp makes it unlikely that this reaction  plays a significant physiological role. as for other ctp synthases, the oligomeric structure of the lactococcal enzyme was found to be a tetramer, but unlike most of the other previously characterized enzymes, the tetramer was very  stable even at dilute enzyme concentrations.

TI  == resolvase-like recombination performed by the tp901-1 integrase.
AB  == the site-specific recombination system of temperate lactococcal bacteriophage tp901-1 is unusual in several respects. first, the integrase belongs to the family of extended resolvases rather than to the lambda integrase family and second, in the presence of this integrase, a 56 bp attp fragment is sufficient for efficient recombination with the chromosomal attb site in the host lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363. in the present work, this attb site was analysed and a 43 bp attb region was found to be the smallest fragment able to participate fully in recombination. in vitro studies showed that the tp901-1 integrase binds this 43 bp attb fragment, the 56 bp attp and a larger attp fragment with equal affinity. mutational analysis of the 5 bp common core region  (tcaat) showed that the tc dinucleotide is essential for recombination, but not for binding of the integrase, whereas none of the last three bases are important  for recombination. when a number of attl sites, obtained by recombination between an attb site containing a mutation in this tc dinucleotide and a wild-type attp site, were sequenced, a mix of sites with the wild-type or the mutated sequence was obtained. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the tc dinucleotide constitutes the tp901-1 overlap region. a 2 bp overlap region has been observed in recombination reactions catalysed by all other members of the resolvase/invertase family tested so far. by selecting for attb sites with a decreased ability to participate in recombination, two bases located outside the  core region of attb were shown to be involved in the in vitro binding of the tp901-1 integrase.

TI  == respiration capacity of the fermenting bacterium lactococcus lactis and its positive effects on growth and survival.
AB  == oxygen is a major determinant of both survival and mortality of aerobic organisms. for the facultative anaerobe lactococcus lactis, oxygen has negative effects on both growth and survival. we show here that oxygen can be beneficial to l. lactis if heme is present during aerated growth. the growth period is extended and long-term survival is markedly improved compared to results obtained under the usual fermentation conditions. we considered that improved growth and survival could be due to the capacity of l. lactis to undergo respiration. to test this idea, we confirmed that the metabolic behavior of lactococci in the presence of oxygen and hemin is consistent with respiration and is most pronounced late in growth. we then used a genetic approach to show the following. (i) the cyda gene, encoding cytochrome d oxidase, is required for respiration and plays a direct role in oxygen utilization. cyda expression is induced late in growth under respiration conditions. (ii) the hemz gene, encoding ferrochelatase, which converts protoporphyrin ix to heme, is needed for respiration if the precursor, rather than the final heme product, is present in the medium. surprisingly, survival improved by respiration is observed in a superoxide dismutase-deficient strain, a result which emphasizes the physiological differences between fermenting and respiring lactococci. these studies confirm respiratory metabolism in l. lactis and suggest that this organism may be better  adapted to respiration than to traditional fermentative metabolism.

TI  == dihydrooxonate is a substrate of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (dhod) providing evidence for involvement of cysteine and serine residues in base catalysis.
AB  == the flavoprotein dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (dhod) catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate. dihydrooxonate is an analogue of dihydroorotate in which the c5 carbon is substituted by a nitrogen atom. we have investigated dihydrooxonate as a substrate of three dhods, each representing a distinct evolutionary class of the enzyme, namely the two family 1 enzymes from lactococcus lactis, dhoda and dhodb, and the enzyme from escherichia coli, which, like the human enzyme, belongs to family 2. dihydrooxonate was accepted as a substrate although much less efficiently than dihydroorotate. the first half-reaction was rate limiting according to pre-steady-state and steady-state kinetics with different electron acceptors. cysteine and serine have been implicated as active site base residues, which promote substrate oxidation in family 1 and family 2 dhods, respectively. mutants of dhoda (c130a) and e. coli dhod (s175a) have extremely low activity in standard assays with dihydroorotate as substrate, but with dihydrooxonate the mutants display considerable and increasing activity above ph 8.0. thus, the absence of the active site base residue in the enzymes seems to be compensated for by a lower pk(a) of the 5-position in the substrate. oxonate, the oxidation product of dihydrooxonate, was a competitive inhibitor versus dihydroorotate, and dhoda was the most sensitive of the three enzymes. dhoda was reinvestigated with respect to product  inhibition by orotate. the results suggest a classical one-site ping-pong mechanism with fumarate as electron acceptor, while the kinetics with ferricyanide is highly dependent on the detailed reaction conditions.

TI  == functional analysis of the lactococcus lactis galu and gale genes and their impact on sugar nucleotide and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  == we studied the udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase (galu) and udp-galactose epimerase (gale) genes of lactococcus lactis mg1363 to investigate their involvement in biosynthesis of udp-glucose and udp-galactose, which are precursors of glucose- and galactose-containing exopolysaccharides (eps) in l. lactis. the lactococcal galu gene was identified by a pcr approach using degenerate primers and was found by northern blot analysis to be transcribed in a monocistronic rna. the l. lactis galu gene could complement an escherichia coli galu mutant, and overexpression of this gene in l. lactis under control of the inducible nisa promoter resulted in a 20-fold increase in galu activity. remarkably, this resulted in approximately eightfold increases in the levels of both udp-glucose and udp-galactose. this indicated that the endogenous gale activity is not limiting and that the galu activity level in wild-type cells controls the biosynthesis of intracellular udp-glucose and udp-galactose. the increased galu activity did not significantly  increase nizo b40 eps production. disruption of the gale gene resulted in poor growth, undetectable intracellular levels of udp-galactose, and elimination of eps production in strain nizo b40 when cells were grown in media with glucose as  the sole carbon source. addition of galactose restored wild-type growth in the gale disruption mutant, while the level of eps production was approximately one-half the wild-type level.

AB  == the genes encoding a binding-protein-dependent abc transporter for dipeptides (dpp) were identified in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363. two (dppa and dppp) of the six orfs (dppadpppbcdf) encode proteins that are homologous to peptide- and pheromone-binding proteins. the dppp gene contains a chain-terminating nonsense mutation and a frame-shift that may impair its function. the functionality of the dpp genes was proven by the construction of disruption mutants via homologous recombination. the expression of dppa and various other components of the proteolytic system was studied in synthetic and peptide-rich media and by using isogenic peptide-transport mutants that are defective in one or more systems (opp, dtpt, and/or dpp). in peptide-rich medium, dppa was maximally expressed in mutants lacking opp and dtpt. dppa expression also depended on the growth phase and was repressed by tri-leucine and tri-valine. the effect of tri-leucine on dppa expression was abolished when leucine was present in the medium. importantly, the dpp system also regulated the expression of other components of the proteolytic system. this regulation was achieved via the internalization of di-valine, which caused a 30-50% inhibition in the expression of the proteinase prtp and the peptidases pepn and pepc. similar to the regulation of dppa, the repressing effect was no longer observed when high concentrations of valine were present. the intricate regulation of the  components of the proteolytic system by peptides and amino acids is discussed in  the light of the new and published data.

TI  == in vivo evidence for two active nuclease motifs in the double-strand break repair enzyme rexab of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == in bacteria, double-strand dna break (dsb) repair involves an exonuclease/helicase (exo/hel) and a short regulatory dna sequence (chi) that attenuates exonuclease activity and stimulates dna repair. despite their key role in cell survival, these dsb repair components show surprisingly little conservation. the best-studied exo/hel, recbcd of escherichia coli, is composed of three subunits. in contrast, rexab of lactococcus lactis and exo/hel enzymes of other low-guanine-plus-cytosine branch gram-positive bacteria contain two subunits. we report that rexab functions via a novel mechanism compared to that of the recbcd model. two potential nuclease motifs are present in rexab compared  with a single nuclease in recbcd. site-specific mutagenesis of the rexa nuclease  motif abolished all nuclease activity. in contrast, the rexb nuclease motif mutants displayed strongly reduced nuclease activity but maintained chi recognition and had a chi-stimulated hyperrecombination phenotype. the distinct phenotypes resulting from rexa or rexb nuclease inactivation lead us to suggest that each of the identified active nuclease sites in rexab is involved in the degradation of one dna strand. in recbcd, the single recb nuclease degrades both  dna strands and is presumably positioned by recd. the presence of two nucleases would suggest that this recd function is dispensable in rexab.

AB  == maltose phosphorylase (mp) from lactococcus lactis was purified and the corresponding gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the isoelectric  point of the pure enzyme was determined to be 7.0. according to zymogram analysis and sds-page, the native mp was shown to be a monomeric enzyme with a molecular mass of 75 kda. a polyclonal antiserum was produced to assess the regulation of the gene encoding mp in lc: lactis. according to immunoblot analysis, synthesis of the enzyme was markedly repressed by both glucose and lactose in the growth medium. when the lactococci were cultivated in the presence of other sugars, including maltose, trehalose or galactose, there was a pronounced expression of the mp gene. in addition, when the cells were grown in media without any added sugar, there was also pronounced expression of the enzyme, according to immunoblot analysis and specific activity data. these results indicated that no particular sugar specifically induces the gene encoding mp. however, an effect of glucose on mp expression was demonstrated by performing fermentations in the presence of both maltose and glucose. when glucose was added to maltose-grown lactococci in the mid-exponential growth phase, both the specific activity and amount of mp per millilitre of cell extract decreased rapidly. the genetic locus  for the mp gene was found to be in the vicinity of the region encoding a possible regulator belonging to the laci-galr family of transcriptional regulators. furthermore, this genetic location was separated from the previously characterized maltose-inducible and glucose-repressible beta-phosphoglucomutase (beta-pgm) gene. the different genetic loci for the genes encoding mp and beta-pgm explains the different gene regulation behaviour.

TI  == distinctive features of homologous recombination in an 'old' microorganism, lactococcus lactis.
AB  == homologous recombination is needed to assure faithful inheritance of dna material, especially under stress conditions. the same enzymes that repair broken chromosomes via recombination also generate biodiversity. their activities may result in intrachromosomal rearrangements, assimilation of foreign dna, or a combination of these events. it is generally supposed that homologous recombination systems are conserved, and function the same way everywhere as they do in escherichia coli, the accepted paradigm. studies in an 'older' microorganism, the gram-positive bacterium of the low gc branch lactococcus lactis, confirm that many enzymes are conserved across species lines. however, the main components of the double strand break (dsb) repair system, an exonuclease/helicase (exo/hel) and a short dna modulator sequence chi, differ markedly between bacteria, especially when compared to the gram-negative analogues. based on our studies, a model is proposed for the functioning of the two-subunit exo/hel of l. lactis and other gram-positive bacteria, which differs  from that of the three-subunit e. coli enzyme. the differences between bacterial  dsb repair systems may underlie a selection for diversity when dealing with dsb.  these and other features of homologous recombination in l. lactis are discussed.

TI  == predicting the behavior of escherichia coli introduced as a postprocessing contaminant in shrikhand, a traditional sweetened lactic fermented milk product.
AB  == the increasing popularity of traditional milk-based foods has placed emphasis on  the need for microbial safety in food-chain establishments, as there are ample possibilities for foodborne pathogens to occur as postprocessing contaminants. the behavioral pattern of an enterotoxigenic strain of escherichia coli d 21 introduced as a postprocessing contaminant in shrikhand, a traditional sweetened  lactic fermented milk product, was studied with variables of initial inoculum (4.3, 5.3, and 6.3 log10 cfu/g), storage temperature (4, 10, and 16 degrees c), and storage period (4, 9, and 14 days). during storage of shrikhand prepared individually with lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus cfr 2028 and lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris b-634, there was a steady decrease in the viable count of e. coli that was proportional to the initial inoculum of e. coli introduced into shrikhand. the data were subjected to multivariate analysis, and  equations were derived to predict the behavior of e. coli in shrikhand. the predicted values for the probable survival of e. coli showed good agreement with  the experimental values with a majority of these predictions being fail-safe. the values of statistical indices showed that the model fits ranged between extremely good and satisfactory. response surface plots were generated to describe the behavioral pattern of e. coli. the derived models and response surface plots enabled prediction of the survival of e. coli in shrikhand as a function of initial inoculum levels, storage temperatures, and storage periods of shrikhand.  these predictions were valid within the limits of the experimental variables used to develop the model.

TI  == genetic evidence for a defective xylan degradation pathway in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == genetic and biochemical evidence for a defective xylan degradation pathway was found linked to the xylose operon in three lactococcal strains, lactococcus lactis 210, l. lactis io-1, and l. lactis nrrl b-4449. immediately downstream of  the xylulose kinase gene (xylb) (k. a. erlandson, j.-h. park, w. el khal, h.-h. kao, p. basaran, s. brydges, and c. a. batt, appl. environ. microbiol. 66:3974-3980, 1999) are two open reading frames encoding a mutarotase (xylm) and  a xyloside transporter (xynt) and a partial open reading frame encoding a beta-xylosidase (xynb). these are functions previously unreported for lactococci  or lactobacilli. the mutarotase activity of the putative xylm gene product was confirmed by overexpression of the l. lactis enzyme in escherichia coli and purification of recombinant xylm. we hypothesize that the mutarotase links xylan  degradation to xylose metabolism due to the anomeric preference of xylose isomerase. in addition, northern hybridization experiments suggested that the xylm and xyntb genes are cotranscribed with the xylrab genes, responsible for xylose metabolism. although none of the three strains appeared to metabolize xylan or xylobiose, they exhibited xylosidase activity, and l. lactis io-1 and l. lactis nrrl b-4449 had functional mutarotases.

TI  == bovine rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 produced by lactococcus lactis is antigenic and immunogenic.
AB  == rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) can induce diarrhea in mice. to get insight into the biological effects of nsp4, production of large quantities of this protein is necessary. we first tried to produce the protein in escherichia coli, but the nsp4 gene proved to be unstable. the capacity of the generally regarded as safe organism lactococcus lactis to produce nsp4 either intra- or extracellularly was then investigated by using the nisin-controlled expression system. production of recombinant nsp4 (rnsp4) was observed in l. lactis for both locations. in spite of a very low secretion efficiency, the highest level of production was obtained with the fusion between a lactococcal signal peptide and  rnsp4. cultures of the rnsp4-secreting strain were injected into rabbits, and a specific immune response was elicited. the anti-rnsp4 antibodies produced in these rabbits recognized nsp4 in ma104 cells infected by rotavirus. we showed that l. lactis is able to produce antigenic and immunogenic rnsp4 and thus is a good organism for producing viral antigens.

TI  == analysis of six prophages in lactococcus lactis il1403: different genetic structure of temperate and virulent phage populations.
AB  == we report the genetic organisation of six prophages present in the genome of lactococcus lactis il1403. the three larger prophages (36-42 kb), belong to the already described p335 group of temperate phages, whereas the three smaller ones  (13-15 kb) are most probably satellites relying on helper phage(s) for multiplication. these data give a new insight into the genetic structure of lactococcal phage populations. p335 temperate phages have variable genomes, sharing homology over only 10-33% of their length. in contrast, virulent phages have highly similar genomes sharing homology over >90% of their length. further analysis of genetic structure in all known groups of phages active on other bacterial hosts such as escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, mycobacterium: and streptococcus thermophilus confirmed the existence of two types of genetic structure related to the phage way of life. this might reflect different intensities of horizontal dna exchange: low among purely virulent phages and high among temperate phages and their lytic homologues. we suggest that the constraints on genetic exchange among purely virulent phages reflect their optimal genetic organisation, adapted to a more specialised and extreme form of parasitism than temperate/lytic phages.

TI  == lactococcus lactis lm0230 contains a single aminotransferase involved in aspartate biosynthesis, which is essential for growth in milk.
AB  == amino acid aminotransferases (atases), which catalyse the last biosynthetic step  of many amino acids, may have important physiological functions in lactococcus lactis during growth in milk. in this study, the aspartate atase gene (aspc) from l. lactis lm0230 was cloned by complementation into escherichia coli dl39. one chromosomal fragment putatively encoding aspc was partially sequenced. a 1179 bp  orf was identified which could encode for a 393 aa, 43.2 kda protein. the deduced amino acid sequence had high identity to other aspc sequences in genbank and is a member of the igamma family of atases. substrate-specificity studies suggested that the lactococcal aspc has atase activity only with aspartic acid (asp). an internal deletion was introduced into the l. lactis chromosomal copy of aspc by homologous recombination. the wild-type and mutant strain grew similarly in defined media containing all 20 amino acids and did not grow in minimal media unless supplemented with asparagine (asn). the mutant strain was also unable to grow in or significantly acidify milk unless supplemented with asp or asn. these  results suggest that only one lactococcal atase is involved in the conversion of  oxaloacetate to asp, and asp biosynthesis is required for the growth of l. lactis lm0230 in milk.

TI  == identification of mur, an atypical peptidoglycan hydrolase derived from leuconostoc citreum.
AB  == a gene encoding a protein homologous to known bacterial n-acetyl-muramidases has  been cloned from leuconostoc citreum by a pcr-based approach. the encoded protein, mur, consists of 209 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 23,821 da including a 31-amino-acid putative signal peptide. in contrast  to most of the other known peptidoglycan hydrolases, l. citreum mur protein does  not contain amino acid repeats involved in cell wall binding. the purified l. citreum mur protein was shown to exhibit peptidoglycan-hydrolyzing activity by renaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. an active chimeric protein was constructed by fusion of l. citreum mur to the c-terminal repeat-containing domain (ca) of acma, the major autolysin of lactococcus lactis. expression of the mur-ca fusion protein was able to complement an acma mutation in l. lactis; normal cell separation after cell division was restored by mur-ca expression.

TI  == characterization of the cryptic plasmid psbo2 isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1 and construction of a new shuttle vector.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid designated psbo2 (3582 bp) was isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1. the psbo2 contained putative sites for a double-strand origin (dso), a small transcriptional repressor protein (cop), countertranscribed rnas (ctrnas),  and a replication protein (rep), which were similar to those from pmv158 and pls1, which were isolated from s. agalactiae, and pwvo1, isolated from lactococcus lactis. the putative single-strand origin (sso) of psbo2 was similar  to per341 and pst1, which were isolated from s. thermophilus. recombinant plasmid designated psbe2 was constructed to bind pecm184 vector and the dna fragment containing sso, dso, cop, ctrnas, and rep of psbo2. when psbe2 was introduced into s. bovis 12-u-1 and no8, the plasmids in the transformants had deleted the 160-bp fragment between sso and dso. this plasmid, designated psbe2a, was capable of transforming escherichia coli and s. bovis strains 12-u-1 and no8 on high frequency; therefore, psbe2a is an effective shuttle vector.

TI  == evidence for horizontal transfer of ssudat1i restriction-modification genes to the streptococcus suis genome.
AB  == different strains of streptococcus suis serotypes 1 and 2 isolated from pigs either contained a restriction-modification (r-m) system or lacked it. the r-m system was an isoschizomer of streptococcus pneumoniae dpnii, which recognizes nucleotide sequence 5'-gatc-3'. the nucleotide sequencing of the genes encoding the r-m system in s. suis dat1, designated ssudat1i, showed that the ssudat1i gene region contained two methyltransferase genes, designated ssuma and ssumb, as does the dpnii system. the deduced amino acid sequences of m. ssuma and m.ssumb showed 70 and 90% identity to m.dpnii and m.dpna, respectively. however, the ssudat1i system contained two isoschizomeric restriction endonuclease genes, designated ssura and ssurb. the deduced amino acid sequence of r.ssura was 49% identical to that of r.dpnii, and r.ssurb was 72% identical to r.lladchi of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris dch-4. the four ssudat1i genes overlapped and  were bounded by purine biosynthetic gene clusters in the following gene order: purf-purm-purn-purh-ssuma-ssumb-ssura++ +-ssurb-purd-pure. the g+c content of the ssudat1i gene region (34.1%) was lower than that of the pur region (48.9%), suggesting horizontal transfer of the ssudat1i system. no transposable element or long-repeat sequence was found in the flanking regions. the ssudat1i genes were functional by themselves, as they were individually expressed in escherichia coli. comparison of the sequences between strains with and without the r-m system showed that only the region from 53 bp upstream of ssuma to 5 bp downstream of ssurb was inserted in the intergenic sequence between purh and purd and that the  insertion target site was not the recognition site of ssudat1i. no notable substitutions or insertions could be found, and the structures were conserved among all the strains. these results suggest that the ssudat1i system could have  been integrated into the s. suis chromosome by an illegitimate recombination mechanism.

TI  == efficient insertional mutagenesis in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == bacteria have always been considered ideal organisms for genetic analysis. while  this is true for some model organisms, like escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and, more recently, lactococcus lactis, genetic analysis of other organisms is often prevented by lack of valuable tools, like vectors, transposons and methods  for transformation, gene inactivation and random insertional mutagenesis. this is the case of the moderately thermophilic bacterium streptococcus thermophilus, an  organism that, in spite of its widespread use for food fermentations, is only poorly characterized. we report here an insertional mutagenesis system that allows efficient random mutagenesis, easy characterization of the interrupted genes and construction of stable null mutations. this may become a powerful s. thermophilus tool for both genetic analysis and construction of 'food-grade' mutants of this biotechnologically relevant microorganism.

TI  == gene transfer to clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319.
AB  == although much is known about the bacterial cellulosome and its various protein components, their contributions to bacterial growth on cellulose and the process  of cellulolysis in vivo cannot currently be assessed. to remedy this, the authors have developed gene transfer techniques for clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319. firstly, transfer of tn1545 has been obtained using an enterococcus faecalis donor. secondly, incp-mediated conjugative mobilization of plasmids from escherichia coli donors has also been achieved. the yield of transconjugants in both cases was low and was probably limited by the suboptimal growth conditions that must of necessity be employed for the co-culture of oligotrophic c. cellulolyticum with copiotrophic donors. a restriction endonuclease was detected  in crude extracts of c. cellulolyticum. this enzyme, named cce:i, is an isoschizomer of msp:i (hpa:ii). electro-transformation was employed to establish  plasmids containing the replication functions of pamss1 (en. faecalis), pim13 (bacillus subtilis), pcb102 (clostridium butyricum), pip404 (clostridium perfringens) and pwv01 (lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris) in c. cellulolyticum. transformants were only obtained if the dna was appropriately methylated on the external c of the sequence 5'-ccgg-3' using either bsu:fi methylase in vivo or msp:i methylase in vitro. plasmids based on the pamss1 and pim13 replicons were more stably maintained than one based on the pcb102 replicon. selection of transformants on solid medium led to low apparent transformation efficiencies (approx. 10(2) transformants per microg dna) which might, in part, reflect the low plating efficiency of the organism. selection of transformants in liquid medium led to a higher apparent yield of transformants (between 10(5) and 10(7) transformants per microg dna). the methods developed here will pave the way for functional analysis of the various cellulosome components in vivo.

AB  == the promoter-like sequence p15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 is active in lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and escherichia coli, but not in lactococcus lactis. n-methyl-n-nitroso-n-guanidine (mnng) mutagenesis of p15 was used to select for a promoter active in l. lactis mg1363. molecular analysis  of the mutated promoter (designated p16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a t-->a transversion. this deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to  the consensus promoter sequence found in e. coli and bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. the activity of p16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pbv5030 (designated pla16). the mic of chloramphenicol in  l. lactis, l. reuteri, l. plantarum, e. coli, and l. acidophilus harbouring pla16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. this represents an increase in promoter activity compared to p15 in l. reuteri of 3-fold, in l. plantarum of 9-fold, and in e. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in l. acidophilus of 7-fold.

TI  == the n-terminal region of the oenococcus oeni bacteriophage fog44 lysin behaves as a bona fide signal peptide in escherichia coli and as a cis-inhibitory element, preventing lytic activity on oenococcal cells.
AB  == the function of the n-terminal region of the oenococcus oeni phage fog44 lysin (lys44) as an export signal was investigated. we observed that when induced in escherichia coli, lys44 was cleaved between residues 27 and 28 in a seca-dependent manner. lys44 processing could be blocked by a specific signal peptidase inhibitor and was severely reduced by modification of the cleavage site. the lethal effect of lys44 expression observed in e. coli was ascribed to the presence of its n-terminal 27-residue sequence, as its deletion resulted in the production of a nontoxic, albeit active, product. we have further established that lytic activity in oenococcal cells was dependent on lys44 processing. an active protein with the molecular mass expected for the cleaved enzyme was detected in extracts from o. oeni-infected cells. the temporal pattern of its appearance suggests that synthesis and export of lys44 in the infected host progress along with phage maturation. overall, these results provide, for the first time, experimental evidence for the presence of a signal peptide in a bacteriophage lysin. database searches and alignment of protein sequences support the prediction that other known o. oeni and lactococcus lactis phages also encode secretory lysins. the evolutionary significance of a putative phage lysis mechanism relying on secretory lytic enzymes is tentatively discussed, on the basis of host cell wall structure and autolytic capacity.

AB  == citrate transport in lactococcus lactis biovar diacetylactis (l. diacetylactis) is catalyzed by citrate permease p (citp), which is encoded by the plasmidic citp gene. two partial overlapping open reading frames citq and citr are located upstream of citp. these two genes, together with citp, constitute the citqrpoperon. in this report it was shown that in l. diacetylactis and escherichia coli, cit mrna is subject to the same specific cleavages at a complex secondary structure which includes the central region of citq and the 5'-end of citr. the role of ribonucleases in the fate of the cit mrna processing was investigated in e. coli rnase mutant strains. the results obtained indicate that  both endoribonucleases rnase e and rnase iii are involved in the generation of mrna processed species. rnase e is responsible for the major cleavages detected within citq and upstream of citr, whereas rnase iii cleaves citr within its ribosomal binding site. preliminary results indicate the existence of a rnaselll-like enzyme in l. diacetylactis. based on these results, a model for the role of cit mrna processing in the expression of citp is presented.

AB  == the enzyme pyruvate formate-lyase (pfl) from lactococcus lactis was produced in escherichia coli and purified to obtain anti-pfl antibodies that were shown to be specific for l. lactis pfl. it was demonstrated that activated l. lactis pfl was  sensitive to oxygen, as in e. coli, resulting in the cleavage of the pfl polypeptide. the pfl protein level and its in vivo activity and regulation were shown by western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and metabolite measurement to be dependent on the growth conditions. the pfl level during anaerobic growth on the slowly fermentable sugar galactose was higher than that on glucose. this shows that variation in the pfl protein level may play an important role in the regulation of metabolic shift from homolactic to mixed-acid product formation, observed during growth on glucose and galactose, respectively. during anaerobic growth in defined medium, complete activation of pfl was observed. strikingly, although no formate was produced during aerobic growth of l. lactis, pfl protein was indeed detected under these conditions, in which the enzyme is dispensable due to the irreversible inactivation of pfl by oxygen. in contrast, no oxygenolytic cleavage was detected during aerobic growth in complex  medium. this observation may be the result of either an effective pfl deactivase  activity or the lack of pfl activation. in e. coli, the pfl deactivase activity resides in the multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenase adhe. it was shown that in l. lactis, adhe does not participate in the protection of pfl against oxygen under the conditions analyzed. our results provide evidence for major differences in the mechanisms of posttranslational regulation of pfl activity in e. coli and  l. lactis.

TI  == characterization of opua, a glycine-betaine uptake system of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a lactococcus lactis glycine-betaine transport system was identified by functional complementation of an escherichia coli prop prou mutant with a gene library from l. lactis sbsp. cremoris. the cloned locus forms an operon highly homologous to opua, encoding a glycine-betaine uptake system of bacillus subtilis. disruption of opua in l. lactis abolished protection by glycine-betaine against elevated osmolarity. opua belongs to the so-called "abc transporters" family, which comprise an extracellularly localized substrate-binding protein. in b. subtilis opua system, this binding protein is a lipoprotein, attached to the external face of the cytoplasmic membrane by its lipidic moiety. in contrast, in  the l. lactis opua operon, and in other gram-positive homologues as well, a fusion between the gene encoding the integral membrane protein and the substrate-binding protein components gave rise to a hybrid protein presumably attaching the substrate-binding protein to the surface of the cell via its covalent link to the integral membrane component. mapping of l. lactis opua transcription start identified one mrna, more abundant in cells grown at elevated osmolarity. construction of an opua-gusa fusion confirmed that opua transcription is directed by a promoter osmotically inducible in l. lactis. when recombined upstream from a lac transcriptional fusion in the chromosome of e. coli, the opua promoter appeared as very strong, and only poorly stimulated by elevated osmotic  pressure, suggesting the existence of a specific machinery involved in the osmotic signal transduction in l. lactis.

TI  == engineering the active center of the 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase from lactococcus lactis.
AB  == several amino acids in the active center of the 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase from lactococcus lactis were replaced by the corresponding residues in homologous enzymes of glycosidase family 1 with different specificities. three mutants, w429a, k435v/y437f and s428d/ k435v/y437f, were constructed. w429a was found to have an improved specificity for glucosides compared with the wild-type, consistent with the theory that the amino acid at this position is relevant for the distinction between galactosides and glucosides. the k(cat)/k(m) for o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucose-6-phosphate is 8-fold higher than for o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactose-6-phosphate which is the preferred substrate of the wild-type enzyme. this suggests that new hydrogen bonds are formed in the mutant between the active site residues, presumably gln19 or trp421 and the c-4 hydroxyl group. the two other mutants with the exchanges in the phosphate-binding loop were tested for their ability to bind phosphorylated substrates. the triple  mutant is inactive. the double mutant has a dramatically decreased ability to bind o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactose-6-phosphate whereas the interaction with o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactose is barely altered. this result shows that the 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase and the related cyanogenic beta-glucosidase from trifolium repens have different recognition mechanisms for substrates although the structures of the active sites are highly conserved.

TI  == orientation specificity of the lactococcus lactis chi site.
AB  == background: in escherichia coli, the chi sequence modulates the activity of recbcd, a powerful double-stranded (ds) dna exonuclease/helicase. chi attenuates  recbcd exonuclease activity and stimulates homologous recombination in an orientation-dependent manner. chiec is frequent and over-represented on its genome, which is thought to be related to its role in dsdna break repair. we previously identified a chi-like sequence (referred to as chill) and an exonuclease/helicase in the gram-positive bacterium lactococcus lactis. chill and rexab are functional analogues of chiec and recbcd. results: we report that chill attenuates rexab exonuclease activity and stimulates homologous recombination in  an orientation-dependent manner. analysis of chill distribution on the l. lactis  chromosome reveals that chill is frequent, highly over-represented, and oriented  with respect to the direction of replication. conclusion: our results show that a single orientation of chill interacts with rexab. the active orientation is preferentially found on the replication leading strand of the l. lactis genome, consistent with a primary role of chill in repair of dsdna breaks at the replication fork. we propose that orientation-dependence of chi activity and over-representation of chi sequences on bacterial genomes may be conserved properties of exonuclease/helicase-chi couples. other properties of the chi sequence distribution on the genomes might reflect more specific characteristics  of each couple and of the host.

AB  == mobile group ii intron rnas insert directly into dna target sites and are then reverse-transcribed into genomic dna by the associated intron-encoded protein. target site recognition involves modifiable base-pairing interactions between the intron rna and a >14-nucleotide region of the dna target site, as well as fixed interactions between the protein and flanking regions. here, we developed a highly efficient escherichia coli genetic assay to determine detailed target site recognition rules for the lactococcus lactis group ii intron ll.ltrb and to select introns that insert into desired target sites. using human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (hiv-1) proviral dna and the human ccr5 gene as examples, we show that group ii introns can be retargeted to insert efficiently into virtually any target dna and that the retargeted introns retain activity in  human cells. this work provides the practical basis for potential applications of targeted group ii introns in genetic engineering, functional genomics, and gene therapy.

TI  == analysis of promoter sequences from lactobacillus and lactococcus and their activity in several lactobacillus species.
AB  == promoter-active fragments were isolated from the genome of the probiotic organism lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg using the promoter-probe vector pnz272. these promoter elements, together with a promoter fragment isolated from the vaginal strain lactobacillus fermentum br11 and two previously defined promoters (lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 slpa), were introduced into three strains of lactobacillus. primer-extension analysis was used to map the transcriptional start site for each promoter. all promoter fragments tested were functional in each of the three lactobacilli and a purine residue was used to initiate transcription in most cases. the promoter elements encompassed a 52- to 1,140-fold range in promoter activity depending on the host  strain. lactobacillus promoters were further examined by surveying previously mapped sequences for conserved base positions. the lactobacillus hexamer regions  (-35: ttgaca and -10: tataat) closely resembled those of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, with the highest degree of agreement at the -10 hexamer. the tg dinucleotide upstream of the -10 hexamer was conserved in 26% of lactobacillus promoters studied, but conservation rates differed between species. the region upstream of the -35 hexamer of lactobacillus promoters showed conservation with the bacterial up element.

TI  == thrombocidins, microbicidal proteins from human blood platelets, are c-terminal deletion products of cxc chemokines.
AB  == antibacterial proteins are components of the innate immune system found in many organisms and produced by a variety of cell types. human blood platelets contain  a number of antibacterial proteins in their alpha-granules that are released upon thrombin activation. the present study was designed to purify these proteins obtained from human platelets and to characterize them chemically and biologically. two antibacterial proteins were purified from platelet granules in  a two-step protocol using cation exchange chromatography and continuous acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were designated thrombocidin (tc)-1 and tc-2. characterization of these proteins using mass spectrometry and n-terminal sequencing revealed that tc-1 and tc-2 are variants of the cxc chemokines neutrophil-activating peptide-2 and connective tissue-activating peptide-iii, respectively. tc-1 and tc-2 differ from these chemokines by a c-terminal truncation of 2 amino acids. both tcs, but not neutrophil-activating peptide-2 and connective tissue-activating peptide-iii, were bactericidal for bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and lactococcus lactis and fungicidal for cryptococcus neoformans. killing of b. subtilis by either tc appeared to be very rapid. because tcs were unable to dissipate the membrane potential of l. lactis, the mechanism of tc-mediated killing most probably does not involve pore formation.

TI  == rapid genome walking: a simplified oligo-cassette mediated polymerase chain reaction using a single genome-specific primer.
AB  == in the present report we show that unknown dna fragments are easily amplified in  a single pcr reaction from an oligo-cassette library with a single genome-specific primer in combination with a cassette-specific primer. the novelty of the system, in comparison to the vectorette pcr method, lies in the use of unphosphorylated in contrast with phosphorylated oligo-cassettes in the ligation to the chromosomal dna fragments. after denaturation of the dna library, all chromosomal fragments carry a single-stranded linker attached to the 5'-end only. therefore, the presence of the vectorette mismatched region is not required when unphosphorylated cassettes are used. as an example we report the amplification of the era gene from lactococcus lactis.

TI  == transcriptional control of the citrate-inducible citmcdefgrp operon, encoding genes involved in citrate fermentation in leuconostoc paramesenteroides.
AB  == in this study we describe the expression pattern of the leuconostoc paramesenteroides citmcdefgrp operon in response to the addition of citrate to the growth medium. an 8.8-kb polycistronic transcript, which includes the citmcdefgrp genes, was identified; its synthesis was dramatically induced upon addition of citrate to the growth medium. we also found that expression of the cit operon is subjected to posttranscriptional regulation, since processing sites included in four complex secondary structures (i, ii, iii, and iv) were identified by northern blot analysis and mapped by primer extension. upstream of  the citmcdefgrp operon a divergent open reading frame, whose expression was also  increased by citrate, was identified by dna sequencing and designated citi. the start and end sites of transcription of the cit operon and citi gene were mapped. the start sites are separated by a stretch of 188 bp with a very high a+t content of 77% and are preceded by transcriptional promoters. the end sites of the transcripts are located next to the 3' end of two secondary structures characteristic of rho-independent transcriptional terminators. the effect of the  citi gene on expression of the cit operon was studied in escherichia coli. the presence of the citi gene in cis and in trans resulted in increased activity of the cit promoter. these data provide the first evidence that citrate fermentation in leuconostoc is regulated at the transcriptional level by a transcriptional activator rather than by a repressor.

AB  == a branched-chain aminotransferase gene (ilve) from lactococcus lactis lm0230 was  identified on a 9-kb chromosomal insert by complementation in escherichia coli dl39. sequencing of a 2.0-kbp fragment resulted in the identification of a 1,023-bp open reading frame that could encode a 340-amino-acid protein. sequence  analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed 62% identity to ilve of haemophilus influenzae and high similarity to ilves from a variety of organisms found in genbank classified as class iv aminotransferases. under logarithmic growth in complex medium, ilve is transcribed monocistronically as a 1.1-kb transcript. hydrophobicity plot analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence and the lack of a signal peptide sequence suggest ilve is a cytosolic protein. a derivative of lm0230 lacking ilve activity was constructed by gene replacement. comparison of the ilve-deficient strain's ability to grow in defined media lacking an amino acid but containing its alpha-keto acid biosynthetic precursor to that of the wild-type strain indicated that ilve is the only enzyme capable of synthesis of ile and val from their biosynthetic precursors. comparison of the aminotransferase activity of the ilve mutant to lm0230 revealed that the mutant retained <2, 4.5, 43, 40, and 76% of its aminotransferase activity with ile, val, leu, met, and phe, respectively. no difference in growth or acidification rate between lm0230 and the ilve-deficient strain was observed in milk.

TI  == expression of staphylococcus aureus clumping factor a in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris using a new shuttle vector.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus harbors redundant adhesins mediating tissue colonization and infection. to evaluate their intrinsic role outside of the staphylococcal background, a system was designed to express them in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 1363. this bacterium is devoid of virulence factors and has a known genetic background. a new escherichia coli-l. lactis shuttle and expression vector was constructed for this purpose. first, the high-copy-number lactococcal  plasmid pil253 was equipped with the oricole1 origin, generating pori253 that could replicate in e. coli. second, the lactococcal promoters p23 or p59 were inserted at one end of the pori253 multicloning site. gene expression was assessed by a luciferase reporter system. the plasmid carrying p23 (named pori23) expressed luciferase constitutively at a level 10,000 times greater than did the  p59-containing plasmid. transcription was absent in e. coli. the staphylococcal clumping factor a (clfa) gene was cloned into pori23 and used as a model system.  lactococci carrying pori23-clfa produced an unaltered and functional 130-kda clfa protein attached to their cell walls. this was indicated both by the presence of  the protein in western blots of solubilized cell walls and by the ability of clfa-positive lactococci to clump in the presence of plasma. clfa-positive lactococci had clumping titers (titer of 4,112) similar to those of s. aureus newman in soluble fibrinogen and bound equally well to solid-phase fibrinogen. these experiments provide a new way to study individual staphylococcal pathogenic factors and might complement both classical knockout mutagenesis and modern in vivo expression technology and signature tag mutagenesis.

TI  == electron paramagnetic resonance evidence for a novel interconversion of [3fe-4s](+) and [4fe-4s](+) clusters with endogenous iron and sulfide in anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase activase in vitro.
AB  == we report an epr study of the iron-sulfur enzyme, anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase activase from lactococcus lactis. the activase (nrdg gene) together with s-adenosyl-l-methionine (adomet) give rise to a glycyl radical in the nrdd component. a semi-reduced [4fe-4s](+) cluster with an axially symmetric epr signal was produced upon photochemical reduction of the activase. air exposure of the reduced enzyme gave a [3fe-4s](+) cluster. the fe(3)s(4) cluster was convertible to the epr-active [4fe-4s](+) cluster by renewed treatment with reducing agents, demonstrating a reversible [3fe-4s](+)- to-[4fe-4s](+) cluster conversion without exogenous addition of iron or sulfide. anaerobic reduction of  the activase by a moderate concentration of dithionite also resulted in a semi-reduced [4fe-4s](+) cluster. prolonged reduction gave an epr-silent fully reduced state, which was enzymatically inactive. both reduced states gave the [3fe-4s](+) epr signal after air exposure. the iron-sulfur cluster interconversion was also studied in the presence of adomet. the epr signal of semi-reduced activase-adomet had rhombic symmetry and was independent of which reductant was applied, whereas the epr signal of the [3fe-4s](+) cluster after air exposure was unchanged. the results indicate that an adomet-mediated [4fe-4s](+) center is the native active species that induces the formation of a glycyl radical in the nrdd component.

TI  == a second dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (type a) of the human pathogen enterococcus faecalis: expression, purification, and steady-state kinetic mechanism.
AB  == we report the identification, expression, and characterization of a second dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (dhodase a) from the human pathogen enterococcus faecalis. the enzyme consists of a polypeptide chain of 322 amino acids that shares 68% identity with the cognate type a enzyme from the bacterium lactococcus lactis. e. faecalis dhodase a catalyzed the oxidation of l-dihydroorotate while reducing a number of substrates, including fumarate, coenzyme q(0), and menadione. the steady-state kinetic mechanism has been determined with menadione  as an oxidizing substrate at ph 7.5. initial velocity and product inhibition data suggest that the enzyme follows a two-site nonclassical ping-pong kinetic mechanism. the absorbance of the active site fmn cofactor is quenched in a concentration-dependent manner by titration with orotate and barbituric acid, two competitive inhibitors with respect to dihydroorotate. in contrast, titration of  the enzyme with menadione had no effect on fmn absorbance, consistent with nonoverlapping binding sites for dihyroorotate and menadione, as suggested from the kinetic mechanism. the reductive half-reaction has been shown to be only partially rate limiting, and an attempt to evaluate the slow step in the overall  reaction has been made by simulating orotate production under steady-state conditions. our data indicate that the oxidative half-reaction is a rate-limiting segment, while orotate, most likely, retains significant affinity for the reduced enzyme, as suggested by the product inhibition pattern.

AB  == the gene (dppa) encoding the binding protein of the di-tripeptide abc transporter of lactococcus lactis (dppa) was cloned under the control of the nisin promoter.  amplified expression ( approximately 200-fold increase) of the protein fused to a carboxyl-terminal six-histidine tag allowed the purification of dppa-(his)(6) by  nickel-chelate affinity and anion-exchange chromatography. ligand binding to dppa-(his)(6) elicited an electrophoretic mobility shift, a decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence, and a blue shift of the emission maximum. each of these parameters detected conformational changes in the protein that reflect ligand binding, and these were used to determine the structural requirements of dppa-(his)(6) for binding peptides. the major features of peptide binding include (i) high affinity for di- and tripeptides, (ii) requirement of a free n-terminal  alpha-amino group and an alpha-peptide bound contiguous with the n-terminal amino group, (iii) stereospecificity for l-isomers, and (iv) preference for dipeptides  containing methionine or arginine, followed by hydrophobic tripeptides consisting of leucine or valine residues. maximal binding affinity was detected at ph 6.0, and the k(d) for binding increased 1 order of magnitude for every unit increase in ph. this suggests that the ionization of protein residues (pk > 6.0) in or in  close proximity to the binding site is critical in the binding mechanism.

TI  == characterization of the lactococcus lactis transcription factor flpa and demonstration of an in vitro switch.
AB  == the commercially important bacterium lactococcus lactis contains two fnr-like proteins (flpa and flpb) which have a high degree of identity to each other and to the flp of lactobacillus casei. flpa was isolated from a gst-flpa fusion protein produced in escherichia coli. like flp, isolated flpa is a homodimeric protein containing both zn and cu. however, the properties of flpa were more like those of the e. coli oxygen-responsive transcription factor fnr than the flp of l. casei. as prepared flpa recognized an fnr site (ttgat-n4-atcaa) but not an flp site (cctga-n4-tcagg) in band-shift assays. in contrast to flp, dna binding by flpa did not require the formation of an intramolecular disulphide bond. however, despite containing only two cysteine residues per monomer, flpa was able to acquire an fnr-like, oxygen-labile [4fe 4s] cluster. but, whereas the incorporation of a [4fe 4s] cluster into fnr enhances interaction with target dna, it abolished dna binding by flpa. an flpa variant (flpa') with an n-terminal region designed to be more flp-like failed to incorporate an iron-sulphur cluster but could now form an intramolecular disulphide. this simple example of protein engineering, converting an oxygen-labile [4fe 4s] containing fnr-like protein into a dithiol-disulphide flp-like redox sensor demonstrates the versatility of the basic crp structure. attempts to demonstrate an flpa-based aerobic-anaerobic  switch in the heterologous host e. coli were unsuccessful. however, studies with  a series of fnr-dependent lac reporter fusions in strains of e. coli expressing flpa or flpb revealed that both homologues were able to activate expression of fnr-dependent promoters in vivo but only when positioned 61 base pairs upstream of the transcription start.

TI  == allosteric regulation of the class iii anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase from bacteriophage t4.
AB  == ribonucleotide reductase (rnr) is an essential enzyme in all organisms. it provides precursors for dna synthesis by reducing all four ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. the overall activity and the substrate specificity of rnr are allosterically regulated by deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and atp, thereby providing balanced dntp pools. we have characterized the allosteric regulation of the class iii rnr from bacteriophage t4. our results show that the  t4 enzyme has a single type of allosteric site to which dgtp, dttp, datp, and atp bind competitively. the dissociation constants are in the micromolar range, except for atp, which has a dissociation constant in the millimolar range. atp and datp are positive effectors for ctp reduction, dgtp is a positive effector for atp reduction, and dttp is a positive effector for gtp reduction. datp is not a general negative allosteric effector. these effects are similar to the allosteric regulation of class ib and class ii rnrs, and to the class ia rnr of bacteriophage t4, but differ from that of the class iii rnrs from the host bacterium escherichia coli and from lactococcus lactis. the relative rate of reduction of the four substrates was measured simultaneously in a mixed-substrate assay, which mimics the physiological situation and illustrates the interplay between the different effectors in vivo. surprisingly, we did not observe any significant utp reduction under the conditions used. balancing of the pyrimidine  deoxyribonucleotide pools may be achieved via the dcmp deaminase and dcmp hydroxymethylase pathways.

TI  == expression of a heterologous glutamate dehydrogenase gene in lactococcus lactis highly improves the conversion of amino acids to aroma compounds.
AB  == the first step of amino acid degradation in lactococci is a transamination, which requires an alpha-keto acid as the amino group acceptor. we have previously shown that the level of available alpha-keto acid in semihard cheese is the first limiting factor for conversion of amino acids to aroma compounds, since aroma formation is greatly enhanced by adding alpha-ketoglutarate to cheese curd. in this study we introduced a heterologous catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) gene into lactococcus lactis so that this organism could produce alpha-ketoglutarate from glutamate, which is present at high levels in cheese. then we evaluated the impact of gdh activity on amino acid conversion in in vitro tests and in a cheese model by using radiolabeled amino acids as tracers. the gdh-producing lactococcal strain degraded amino acids without added alpha-ketoglutarate to the same extent that the wild-type strain degraded amino acids with added alpha-ketoglutarate. interestingly, the gdh-producing lactococcal strain produced a higher proportion of carboxylic acids, which are major aroma compounds. our results demonstrated that a gdh-producing lactococcal  strain could be used instead of adding alpha-ketoglutarate to improve aroma development in cheese.

TI  == rules for dna target-site recognition by a lactococcal group ii intron enable retargeting of the intron to specific dna sequences.
AB  == group ii intron homing occurs primarily by a mechanism in which the intron rna reverse splices into a dna target site and is then reverse transcribed by the intron-encoded protein. the dna target site is recognized by an rnp complex containing the intron-encoded protein and the excised intron rna. here, we analyzed dna target-site requirements for the lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb group ii intron in vitro and in vivo. our results suggest a model similar to yeast mtdna introns, in which the intron-encoded protein first recognizes a small number of nucleotide residues in double-stranded dna and causes dna unwinding, enabling the intron rna to base-pair with the dna for reverse splicing. antisense-strand cleavage requires additional interactions between the protein and 3' exon. key nucleotide residues are recognized directly by the intron-encoded protein independent of sequence context, and there is a stringent requirement for fixed spacing between target site elements recognized by the protein and rna components of the endonuclease. experiments with dna substrates containing gc-clamps or "bubbles" indicate a requirement for dna unwinding in the 3' exon but not the distal 5' exon region. finally, by applying the target-site recognition rules, we show that the l1.ltrb intron can be modified to insert at new sites in a plasmid-borne thya gene in escherichia coli. this strategy should be generally applicable to retargeting group ii introns and to delivering foreign sequences to specific sites in heterologous genomes.

TI  == genetic analysis of chromosomal regions of lactococcus lactis acquired by recombinant lytic phages.
AB  == recombinant phages are generated when lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis harboring  plasmids encoding the abortive type (abi) of phage resistance mechanisms is infected with small isometric phages belonging to the p335 species. these phage variants are likely to be an important source of virulent new phages that appear  in dairy fermentations. they are distinguished from their progenitors by resistance to abi defenses and by altered genome organization, including regions  of l. lactis chromosomal dna. the objective of this study was to characterize four recombinant variants that arose from infection of l. lactis nck203 (abi(+))  with phage phi31. hindiii restriction maps of the variants (phi31.1, phi31.2, phi31.7, and phi31.8) were generated, and these maps revealed the regions containing recombinant dna. the recombinant region of phage phi31.1, the variant  that occurred most frequently, was sequenced and revealed 7.8 kb of new dna compared with the parent phage, phi31. this region contained numerous instances of homology with various lactococcal temperate phages, as well as homologues of the lambda recombination protein bet and escherichia coli holliday junction resolvase rus, factors which may contribute to efficient recombination processes. a sequence analysis and phenotypic tests revealed a new origin of replication in  the phi31.1 dna, which replaced the phi31 origin. three separate hindiii fragments, accounting for most of the recombinant region of phi31.1, were separately cloned into gram-positive suicide vector ptrk333 and transformed into  nck203. chromosomal insertions of each plasmid prevented the appearance of different combinations of recombinant phages. the chromosomal insertions did not  affect an inducible prophage present in nck203. our results demonstrated that recombinant phages can acquire dna cassettes from different regions of the chromosome in order to overcome abi defenses. disruption of these regions by insertion can alter the types and diversity of new phages that appear during phage-host interactions.

TI  == characteristics of chi distribution on different bacterial genomes.
AB  == the availability of full genome sequences provides the bases for analyzing global properties of the genetic text. for example, oligonucleotide sequences that are over- or underrepresented can be identified by taking into account the overall genome composition and organization. one of the most overrepresented oligonucleotides in escherichia coli is the chi site, an octanucleotide that stimulates dna repair by homologous recombination. here we analyze the genomic distribution of chi in e. coli and in the three other bacteria where a chi sequence has been identified; note that chi is a different sequence in each organism. for each bacterial genome, chi sequences are frequent, regularly distributed, and overrepresented. this suggests that selection for chi may have occurred during evolution to favor efficient repair of a damaged chromosome. other characteristics of chi distribution are not conserved and might reflect specific features of dna repair in each host. the different sequence and characteristics of chi in each microorganism suggest that selection for chi occurred independently in different bacteria.

TI  == acid- and multistress-resistant mutants of lactococcus lactis : identification of intracellular stress signals.
AB  == lactococcus lactis growth is accompanied by lactic acid production, which results in acidification of the medium and arrest of cell multiplication. despite growth  limitation at low ph, there is evidence that lactococci do have inducible responses to an acid ph. in order to characterize the genes involved in acid tolerance responses, we selected acid-resistant insertional mutants of the l. lactis strain mg1363. twenty-one independent characterized mutants were affected  in 18 different loci, some of which are implicated in transport systems or base metabolism. none of these genes was identified previously as involved in lactococcal acid tolerance. the various phenotypes obtained by acid stress selection allowed us to define four classes of mutants, two of which comprise multistress-resistant strains. our results reveal that l. lactis has several means of protecting itself against low ph, at least one of which results in multiple stress resistance. in particular, intracellular phosphate and guanine nucleotide pools, notably (p)ppgpp, are likely to act as signals that determine the level of lactococcal stress response induction. our results provide a link between the physiological state of the cell and the level of stress tolerance and establish a role for the stringent response in acid stress response regulation.

TI  == engineering a disulfide bond and free thiols in the lantibiotic nisin z.
AB  == the antimicrobial peptide nisin contains the uncommon amino acid residues lanthionine and methyl-lanthionine, which are post-translationally formed from ser, thr and cys residues. to investigate the importance of these uncommon residues for nisin activity, a mutant was designed in which thr13 was replaced by a cys residue, which prevents the formation of the thioether bond of ring c. instead, cys13 couples with cys19 via an intramolecular disulfide bridge, a bond  that is very unusual in lantibiotics. nmr analysis of this mutant showed a structure very similar to that of wild-type nisin, except for the configuration of ring c. the modification was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in antimicrobial activity to less than 1% of wild-type activity, indicating that the lanthionine of ring c is very important for this activity. the nisin z mutants s5c and m17c were also isolated and characterized; they are the first lantibiotics known that contain an additional cys residue that is not involved in bridge formation but is present as a free thiol. secretion of these peptides by the lactococcal producer cells, as well as their antimicrobial activity, was found to be strongly dependent on a reducing environment. their ability to permeabilize lipid vesicles was not thiol-dependent. labeling of m17c nisin z with iodoacetamide abolished the thiol-dependence of the peptide. these results show that the presence of a reactive cys residue in nisin has a strong effect on  the antimicrobial properties of the peptide, which is probably the result of interaction of these residues with thiol groups on the outside of bacterial cells.

TI  == the anaerobic (class iii) ribonucleotide reductase from lactococcus lactis. catalytic properties and allosteric regulation of the pure enzyme system.
AB  == lactococcus lactis contains an operon with the genes (nrdd and nrdg) for a class  iii ribonucleotide reductase. strict anaerobic growth depends on the activity of  these genes. both were sequenced, cloned, and overproduced in escherichia coli. the corresponding proteins, nrdd and nrdg, were purified close to homogeneity. the amino acid sequences of nrdd (747 residues, 84.1 kda) and nrdg (199 residues, 23.3 kda) are 53 and 42% identical with the respective e. coli proteins. together, they catalyze the reduction of ribonucleoside triphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides in the presence of s-adenosylmethionine, reduced flavodoxin or reduced deazaflavin, potassium ions, dithiothreitol, and formate. epr experiments demonstrated a [4fe-4s](+) cluster in reduced nrdg and a glycyl radical in activated nrdd, similar to the e. coli nrdd and nrdg proteins.  different from e. coli, the two polypeptides of nrdd and the proteins in the nrdd-nrdg complex were only loosely associated. also the fes cluster was easily lost from nrdg. the substrate specificity and overall activity of the l. lactis enzyme was regulated according to the general rules for ribonucleotide reductases. allosteric effectors bound to two separate sites on nrdd, one binding datp, dgtp, and dttp and the other binding datp and atp. the two sites showed an  unusually high degree of cooperativity with complex interactions between effectors and a fine-tuning of their physiological effects. the results with the  l. lactis class iii reductase further support the concept of a common origin for  all present day ribonucleotide reductases.

TI  == an explosive antisense rna strategy for inhibition of a lactococcal bacteriophage.
AB  == the coding regions of six putative open reading frames (orfs) identified near the phage phi31 late promoter and the right cohesive end (cos) of lactococcal bacteriophage phi31 were used to develop antisense constructs to inhibit the proliferation of phage phi31. two middle-expressed orfs (orf 1 and orf 2) and four late-expressed orfs (orf 3 through orf 6) were cloned individually between the strong lactobacillus p6 promoter and the t7 terminator (t(t7)) to yield a series of antisense rna transcripts. when expressed on a high-copy-number vector  from a strong promoter, the constructs had no effect on the efficiency of plaquing (eop) or the plaque size of phage phi31. to increase the ratio of antisense rna to the targeted sense mrna appearing during a phage infection, the  antisense cassettes containing the late-expressed orfs (orf 3 through orf 6) were subcloned to ptrk360, a low-copy-number vector containing the phage phi31 origin  of replication, ori31. ori31 allows for explosive amplification of the low-copy-number vector upon phage infection, thereby increasing levels of antisense rna transcripts later in the lytic cycle. in addition, the presence of  ori31 also lowers the burst size of phage phi31 fourfold, resulting in fewer sense, target mrnas being expressed from the phage genome. the combination of ori31 and p6::anti-orf 4h::t(t7) resulted in a threefold decrease in the eop of phage phi31 (eop = 0.11 +/- 0.03 [mean +/- standard deviation]) compared to the presence of ori31 alone (eop = 0.36). one-step growth curves showed that expression of anti-orf 4h rna decreased the percentage of successful centers of infection (75 to 80% for ori31 compared to 35 to 45% for ori31 plus anti-orf 4h), with no further reduction in burst size. growth curves performed in the presence  of varying levels of phage phi31 showed that ori31 plus anti-orf 4h offered significant protection to lactococcus lactis, even at multiplicities of infection of 0.01 and 0.1. these results illustrate a successful application of an antisense strategy to inhibit phage replication in the wake of recent unsuccessful reports.

TI  == x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase gene (pepx) is part of the glnra operon in lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  == a peptidase gene expressing x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (pepx) activity was cloned from lactobacillus rhamnosus 1/6 by using the chromogenic substrate l-glycyl-l-prolyl-beta-naphthylamide for screening of a genomic library in escherichia coli. the nucleotide sequence of a 3.5-kb hindiii fragment expressing the peptidase activity revealed one complete open reading frame (orf) of 2,391 nucleotides. the 797-amino-acid protein encoded by this orf was shown to be 40, 39, and 36% identical with pepxs from lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and lactococcus lactis, respectively. by northern analysis with a pepx-specific probe, transcripts of 4.5 and 7.0 kb were detected, indicating that pepx is part of a polycistronic operon in l. rhamnosus. cloning and sequencing of the upstream region of pepx revealed the presence of two orfs of 360 and 1,338 bp that were shown to be able to encode proteins with high homology to glnr and glna proteins, respectively. by multiple primer extension analyses, the only functional promoter in the pepx region was located 25 nucleotides upstream of glnr. northern analysis with glna- and pepx-specific probes indicated that transcription from glnr promoter results in a 2.0-kb dicistronic glnr-glna transcript and also in a longer read-through polycistronic transcript of 7.0 kb that was detected with both probes in samples from cells in exponential growth phase. the glna gene was disrupted by a single-crossover recombinant event using  a nonreplicative plasmid carrying an internal part of glna. in the disruption mutant, glnra-specific transcription was derepressed 10-fold compared to the wild type, but the 7.0-kb transcript was no longer detectable with either the glna- or pepx-specific probe, demonstrating that pepx is indeed part of glnra operon in l. rhamnosus. reverse transcription-pcr analysis further supported this operon structure. an extended stem-loop structure was identified immediately upstream of pepx in the glna-pepx intergenic region, a sequence that showed homology to a 23s-5s intergenic spacer and to several other l. rhamnosus-related entries in data banks.

TI  == the pyrh gene of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris encoding ump kinase is transcribed as part of an operon including the frr1 gene encoding ribosomal recycling factor 1.
AB  == the pyrh gene of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363, encoding ump kinase,  has been sequenced and cloned. it encodes a polypeptide of 239 amino acid residues (deduced molecular weight of 25951), which was shown to complement a temperature sensitive pyrh mutation in escherichia coli, thus establishing the ability of the encoded protein to synthesize udp. the pyrh gene in l. lactis is flanked downstream by frr1 encoding ribosomal recycling factor 1 and upstream by  an open reading frame, orfa, of unknown function. the three genes were shown to constitute an operon transcribed in the direction orfa-pyrh-frr1 from a promoter  immediately in front of orfa. this operon belongs to an evolutionary highly conserved gene cluster, since the organization of pyrh on the chromosomal level in l. lactis shows a high resemblance to that found in bacillus subtilis as well  as in escherichia coli and several other prokaryotes

TI  == comparison of partial malolactic enzyme gene sequences for phylogenetic analysis  of some lactic acid bacteria species and relationships with the malic enzyme.
AB  == dna sequences covering 36% of the mle gene that encodes the malolactic enzyme were determined for 13 strains of lactic acid bacteria, representing pediococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus and oenococcus genera. the sequences were aligned with the corresponding region of mles in lactococcus lactis. the phylogenetic distance matrix tree of all mle sequences was compared with the 16s rrna phylogenetic tree. the analysis showed that the mle fragment evolved more rapidly than the 16s gene and differently. pediococcus and lactobacillus species were intermixed in the 16s rrna tree whereas they were separated in the mle tree. leuconostoc mesenteroides and oenococcus oeni were distinct from other species in the 16s rrna tree, whereas they were intermixed with lactobacillus species and lactococcus lactis in the mle tree. the amino acid sequences deduced from partial mle genes were aligned with 22 malic enzyme sequences and the corresponding phylogenetic tree was constructed. malic and malolactic enzymes were distinct at  the phylogenetic level, except for malic enzymes of yeast and escherichia coli which were nearer the malolactic enzymes than the other malic enzymes. the analysis of conserved sites showed several interesting amino acids specific to either malic enzyme or malolactic enzyme.

TI  == a protein-based phylogenetic tree for gram-positive bacteria derived from hrca, a unique heat-shock regulatory gene.
AB  == the dnak operon from bacillus subtilis and other gram-positive bacteria with low  g + c dna content contains additional heat-shock genes, including hrca. the hrca  gene encodes a transcription factor that negatively regulates heat-shock genes and is uniformly present in all gram-positive bacteria studied to date. an hrca homologue is also present in synechocystis species, leptospira interrogans, chlamydia trachomatis, caulobacter crescentus and methanococcus jannaschii, organisms that diverged early on from the common ancestor of all gram-positive bacteria and proteobacteria, according to 16s rrna phylogeny. a partial, protein-based phylogenetic tree, derived using amino acid sequence homology of hrca proteins from gram-positive bacteria, is presented here, and the results are compared with the phylogenetic trees generated from 16s rrna, dnak and dnaj sequences. the location of the hrca gene and the genome organization of the dnak  operon support the division of all gram-positive bacteria into three major groups: one group contains high-g + c gram-positive bacteria, and two others contain low-g + c gram-positive bacteria. among the gram-positive bacteria with low g + c dna content, the results indicate that there is a close phylogenetic relationship between bacillus species and clostridium species on the one hand and between lactococcus lactis and streptococcus mutans on the other. streptomyces and mycobacterium species also exhibited a close relationship. a hierarchical arrangement of gram-positive bacteria based on hrca sequences is proposed as an additional refinement of the phylogenetic relationships within this important bacterial group.

TI  == n5-(l-1-carboxyethyl)-l-ornithine synthase: physical and spectral characterization of the enzyme and its unusual low pka fluorescent tyrosine residues.
AB  == n5-(l-1-carboxyethyl)-l-ornithine synthase [e.c. 1.5.1.24] (ceos) from lactococcus lactis has been cloned, expressed, and purified from escherichia coli in quantities sufficient for characterization by biophysical methods. the nadph-dependent enzyme is a homotetramer (mr approximately equal to 140,000) and  in the native state is stabilized by noncovalent interactions between the monomers. the far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectrum shows that the folding  pattern of the enzyme is typical of the alpha,beta family of proteins. ceos contains one tryptophan (trp) and 19 tyrosines (tyr) per monomer, and the fluorescence spectrum of the protein shows emission from both trp and tyr residues. relative to n-acetyltyrosinamide, the tyr quantum yield of the native enzyme is about 0.5. all 19 tyr residues are titratable and, of these, two exhibit the uncommonly low pka of approximately 8.5, 11 have pka approximately 10.75, and the remaining six titrate with pka approximately 11.3. the two residues with pka approximately 8.5 contribute approximately 40% of the total tyrosine emission, implying a relative quantum yield >1, probably indicating tyr-tyr energy transfer. in the presence of nadph, tyr fluorescence is reduced by 40%, and trp fluorescence is quenched completely. the latter result suggests that the single trp residue is either at the active site, or in proximity to the sequence gsgnva, that constitutes the beta alphabeta fold of the nucleotide-binding domain. chymotrypsin specifically cleaves native ceos after phe255. although inactivated by this single-site cleavage of the subunit, the enzyme retains the capacity to bind nadph and tetramer stability is maintained. possible roles in catalysis for the chymotrypsin sensitive loop and for the low pka tyr residues are discussed.

TI  == the ald gene, encoding a coenzyme a-acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase, distinguishes clostridium beijerinckii and two other solvent-producing clostridia from clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == the coenzyme a (coa)-acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh) catalyzes a key reaction in the acetone- and butanol (solvent)-producing clostridia. it reduces acetyl-coa and butyryl-coa to the corresponding aldehydes, which are then reduced by alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) to form ethanol and 1-butanol. the aldh of clostridium beijerinckii nrrl b593 was purified. it had no adh activity, was nad(h) specific, and was more active with butyraldehyde than with acetaldehyde. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified aldh was determined. the open  reading frame preceding the ctfa gene (encoding a subunit of the solvent-forming  coa transferase) of c. beijerinckii nrrl b593 was identified as the structural gene (ald) for the aldh. the ald gene encodes a polypeptide of 468 amino acid residues with a calculated m(r) of 51, 353. the position of the ald gene in c. beijerinckii nrrl b593 corresponded to that of the aad/adhe gene (encoding an aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase) of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 and dsm 792. in southern analyses, a probe derived from the c. acetobutylicum aad/adhe gene did not hybridize to restriction fragments of the genomic dnas of c. beijerinckii and two other species of solvent-producing clostridia. in contrast,  a probe derived from the c. beijerinckii ald gene hybridized to restriction fragments of the genomic dna of three solvent-producing species but not to those  of c. acetobutylicum, indicating a key difference among the solvent-producing clostridia. the amino acid sequence of the aldh of c. beijerinckii nrrl b593 was  most similar (41% identity) to those of the eute gene products (coa-acylating aldhs) of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli, whereas it was about 26% identical to the aldh domain of the aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenases of c. acetobutylicum, e. coli, lactococcus lactis, and amitochondriate protozoa. the predicted secondary structure of the c. beijerinckii aldh suggests the presence of an atypical rossmann fold for nad(+) binding. a comparison of the proposed catalytic pockets of the coa-dependent and coa-independent aldhs identified 6 amino acids that may contribute to interaction with coa.

TI  == in vitro utilization of amylopectin and high-amylose maize (amylomaize) starch granules by human colonic bacteria.
AB  == it has been well established that a certain amount of ingested starch can escape  digestion in the human small intestine and consequently enters the large intestine, where it may serve as a carbon source for bacterial fermentation. thirty-eight types of human colonic bacteria were screened for their capacity to  utilize soluble starch, gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, and high-amylose maize starch granules by measuring the clear zones on starch agar plates. the six cultures which produced clear zones on amylopectin maize starch- containing plates were selected for further studies for utilization of amylopectin maize starch and high-amylose maize starch granules a (amylose; sigma) and b (culture pro 958n). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was used to detect bacterial starch-degrading enzymes. it was demonstrated that bifidobacterium spp., bacteroides spp., fusobacterium spp., and strains of eubacterium, clostridium, streptococcus, and propionibacterium could hydrolyze the gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, while only bifidobacterium spp. and clostridium butyricum could efficiently utilize high-amylose maize starch granules. in fact, c. butyricum and bifidobacterium spp. had higher specific growth rates in the autoclaved medium containing high-amylose maize starch granules and hydrolyzed 80 and 40% of the amylose, respectively. starch-degrading enzymes were cell bound on bifidobacterium and bacteroides cells and were extracellular for c. butyricum. active staining for starch-degrading enzymes on sds-page gels showed that the bifidobacterium cells produced several starch-degrading enzymes with high relative molecular (m(r)) weights (>160,000),  medium-sized relative molecular weights (>66,000), and low relative molecular weights (<66,000). it was concluded that bifidobacterium spp. and c. butyricum degraded and utilized granules of amylomaize starch.

TI  == group ii introns and expression of conjugative transfer functions in lactic acid  bacteria.
AB  == the homologous lactococcal conjugative elements prs01 and the sex factor of lactococcus lactis strain 712 both contain a group ii intron within a gene believed to encode a conjugative relaxase enzyme. this enzyme is responsible for  nicking of dna at the origin of transfer (orit) sequence of the sex factor dna to initiate the strand transfer process. group ii introns have been studied in eukaryotes, and several of these elements in yeast mitochondrial genes have received considerable attention. these introns are relatively large in size and generally encode a protein within the intron sequence. in addition to splicing activity. group ii introns are mobile genetic elements. the intron-encoded proteins (ieps) contain endonuclease and reverse transcriptase domains believed to play an enzymatic role in genetic mobility reactions, while a putative maturase domain is thought to promote splicing by stabilizing the folding of the  intron rna into an active ribozyme structure which carries out the splicing reaction. the lactococcal introns represent the first examples of group ii introns shown to be functional in vivo in prokaryotes. because of the advantages  of a bacterial system for genetic and molecular studies, the ll.ltrb intron from  prs01 has attracted the attention of several laboratories interested in group ii  intron biology. recently, it has been shown that the system can be adapted to function in escherichia coli (although at somewhat reduced efficiency). in addition, it has been recently proven that the best studied form of mobility, the homing of the intron into an intronless allele of the cognate exon gene, occurs via an rna intermediate and does not require dna homology or generalized host recombination functions. current efforts are analysis of the role ll.ltrb splicing in regulating expression of prs01 conjugation functions. the lactococcal group ii introns represent the first demonstrated genetically mobile prokaryotic  retroelements, and they also have considerable potential as genetic engineering tools for lactic acid bacteria (lab) and other organisms.

AB  == biosynthesis of the food additive nisin, a posttranslationally modified peptide antibiotic existing as two natural variants (a and z), requires eleven genes (nisa/zbtciprkfeg) involved in modification, secretion, regulation and self-immunity. the suggested self-immunity genes (nisfeg) of the nisin z producer lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis n8 were cloned and sequenced. putative binding sites of the nisr transcription factor were recognized upstream of the nisf promoter. the hydrophilic nisf protein was expressed in escherichia coli and shown to be associated with the membrane. expression of the nisf gene from a plasmid in l. lactis mg1614, a strain lacking the nisin operons, did not increase the nisin resistance of the cells. this showed that nisf alone does not protect against nisin. overexpression of the nisf gene in the n8 nisin producer did not affect the level of nisin immunity, indicating that the wild-type amount of nisf  is not limiting the level of nisin immunity. production of antisense-niseg or antisense-nisg rna in l. lactis n8 resulted in severe reduction in the level of nisfeg mrna and a clearly reduced immunity showing that the nisfeg transcript is  important for development of nisin self-immunity.

AB  == sixteen exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing lactococcus lactis strains were analyzed for the chemical compositions of their epss and the locations, sequences, and organization of the eps genes involved in eps biosynthesis. this allowed the grouping of these strains into three major groups, representatives of which were studied in detail. previously, we have characterized the eps gene cluster of strain nizo b40 (group i) and determined the function of three of its  glycosyltransferase (gtf) genes. fragments of the eps gene clusters of strains nizo b35 (group ii) and nizo b891 (group iii) were cloned, and these encoded the  nizo b35 priming galactosyltransferase, the nizo b891 priming glucosyltransferase, and the nizo b891 galactosyltransferase involved in the second step of repeating-unit synthesis. the nizo b40 priming glucosyltransferase gene epsd was replaced with an erythromycin resistance gene, and this resulted in loss of eps production. this epsd deletion was complemented with priming gtf genes from gram-positive organisms with known function and substrate specificity. although no eps production was found with priming galactosyltransferase genes from l. lactis or streptococcus thermophilus, complementation with priming glucosyltransferase genes involved in l. lactis eps and streptococcus pneumoniae  capsule biosynthesis could completely restore or even increase eps production in  l. lactis.

TI  == a reverse transcriptase/maturase promotes splicing by binding at its own coding segment in a group ii intron rna.
AB  == group ii introns encode reverse transcriptases that promote rna splicing (maturase activity) and then with the excised intron form a dna endonuclease that mediates intron mobility by target dna-primed reverse transcription (tprt). here, we show that the primary binding site for the maturase (ltra) encoded by the lactococcus lactis ll.ltrb intron is within a region of intron domain iv that includes the start codon of the ltra orf. this binding is enhanced by other elements, particularly domain i and the ebs/ibs interactions, and helps position  ltra to initiate cdna synthesis in the 3' exon as occurs during tprt. our results suggest how the maturase functions in rna splicing and support the hypothesis that the reverse transcriptase coding region was derived from an independent genetic element that was inserted into a preexisting group ii intron.

AB  == lactobacillus johnsonii la1, a probiotic bacterium with demonstrated health effects, grows in milk, where it ferments lactose to d- and l-lactate in a 60:40% ratio. the d-lactate dehydrogenase (d-ldh) gene (ldhd) of this strain was isolated, and an in vitro-truncated copy of that gene was used to inactivate the  genomic copy in two strains, la1 and n312, by gene replacement. for that, an 8-bp deletion was generated within the cloned ldhd gene to inactivate its function. the plasmid containing the altered ldhd was transferred to l. johnsonii via conjugative comobilization with lactococcus lactis carrying pambeta1. crossover integrations of the plasmid at the genomic ldhd site were selected, and appropriate resolution of the cointegrate structures resulted in mutants that had lost the plasmid and in which the original ldhd was replaced by the truncated copy. these mutants completely lacked d-ldh activity. nevertheless, the lower remaining l-ldh activity of the cells was sufficient to reroute most of the accumulating pyruvate to l-lactate. only a marginal increase in production of the secondary end products acetaldehyde, diacetyl, and acetoin was observed. it can be concluded that in l. johnsonii d- and l-ldh are present in substantial excess  for their role to eliminate pyruvate and regenerate nad(+) and that accumulated pyruvate is therefore not easily redirected in high amounts to secondary metabolic routes.

TI  == an aminoacyl-trna synthetase paralog with a catalytic role in histidine biosynthesis.
AB  == in addition to their essential catalytic role in protein biosynthesis, aminoacyl-trna synthetases participate in numerous other functions, including regulation of gene expression and amino acid biosynthesis via transamidation pathways. herein, we describe a class of aminoacyl-trna synthetase-like (hisz) proteins based on the catalytic core of the contemporary class ii histidyl-trna synthetase whose members lack aminoacylation activity but are instead essential components of the first enzyme in histidine biosynthesis atp phosphoribosyltransferase (hisg). prediction of the function of hisz in lactococcus lactis was assisted by comparative genomics, a technique that revealed a link between the presence or the absence of hisz and a systematic variation in the length of the hisg polypeptide. hisz is required for histidine prototrophy, and three other lines of evidence support the direct involvement of  hisz in the transferase function. (i) genetic experiments demonstrate that complementation of an in-frame deletion of hisg from escherichia coli (which does not possess hisz) requires both hisg and hisz from l. lactis. (ii) coelution of hisg and hisz during affinity chromatography provides evidence of direct physical interaction. (iii) both hisg and hisz are required for catalysis of the atp phosphoribosyltransferase reaction. this observation of a common protein domain linking amino acid biosynthesis and protein synthesis implies an early connection between the biosynthesis of amino acids and proteins.

TI  == rna and protein catalysis in group ii intron splicing and mobility reactions using purified components.
AB  == group ii introns encode proteins with reverse transcriptase activity. these proteins also promote rna splicing (maturase activity) and then, with the excised intron, form a site-specific dna endonuclease that promotes intron mobility by reverse splicing into dna followed by target dna-primed reverse transcription. here, we used an escherichia coli expression system for the lactococcus lactis group ii intron ll.ltrb to show that the intron-encoded protein (ltra) alone is sufficient for maturase activity, and that rnp particles containing only the ltra protein and excised intron rna have site-specific dna endonuclease and target dna-primed reverse transcriptase activity. detailed analysis of the splicing reaction indicates that ltra is an intron-specific splicing factor that binds to  unspliced precursor rna with a k(d) of </=0.12 pm at 30 degrees c. this binding occurs in a rapid bimolecular reaction, which is followed by a slower step, presumably an rna conformational change, required for splicing to occur. our results constitute the first biochemical analysis of protein-dependent splicing of a group ii intron and demonstrate that a single intron-encoded protein can interact with the intron rna to carry out a coordinated series of reactions leading to splicing and mobility.

AB  == enterococcus faecalis was tested for the ability to persist in mouse peritoneal macrophages in two separate studies. in the first study, the intracellular survival of serum-passaged e. faecalis 418 and two isogenic mutants [cytolytic strain fa2-2(pam714) and non-cytolytic strain fa2-2(pam771)] was compared with that of escherichia coli dh5alpha by infecting balb/c mice intraperitoneally and  then monitoring the survival of the bacteria within lavaged peritoneal macrophages over a 72-h period. all e. faecalis isolates were serum passaged to enhance the production of cytolysin. e. faecalis 418, fa2-2(pam714), and fa2-2(pam771) survived at a significantly higher level (p = 0.0001) than did e. coli dh5alpha at 24, 48, and 72 h. internalized e. faecalis 418, fa2-2(pam714), and fa2-2(pam771) decreased 10-, 55-, and 31-fold, respectively, over the 72-h infection period, while internalized e. coli dh5alpha decreased 20, 542-fold. the difference in the rate of survival of e. faecalis strains and e. coli dh5alpha was most prominent between 6 and 48 h postinfection (p = 0.0001); however, no significant difference in killing was observed between 48 and 72 h postinfection. in the second study, additional e. faecalis strains from clinical sources, including ds16c2, mgh-2, og1x, and the cytolytic strain fa2-2(pam714), were compared with the nonpathogenic gram-positive bacterium, lactococcus lactis k1, for the ability to survive in mouse peritoneal macrophages. in these experiments, the e. faecalis strains and l. lactis k1 were grown in brain heart infusion (bhi) broth to ensure that there were equal quantities of injected bacteria. e. faecalis fa2-2(pam714), ds16c2, mgh-2, and og1x survived significantly better (p  < 0.0001) than did l. lactis k1 at each time point. l. lactis k1 was rapidly destroyed by the macrophages, and by 24 h postinfection, viable l. lactis could not be recovered. e. faecalis fa2-2(pam714), ds16c2, mgh-2, and og1x declined at  an equivalent rate over the 72-h infection period, and there was no significant difference in survival or rate of decline among the strains. e. faecalis fa2-2(pam714), mgh-2, ds16c2, and og1x exhibited an overall decrease of 25-, 55-, 186-, and 129-fold respectively, between 6 and 72 h postinfection. the overall reduction by 1.3 to 2.27 log units is slightly higher than that seen for serum-passaged e. faecalis strains and may be attributable to the higher level of uptake of serum-passaged e. faecalis than of e. faecalis grown in bhi broth. electron microscopy of infected macrophages revealed that e. faecalis 418 was present within an intact phagocytic vacuole at 6 h postinfection but that by 24 h the infected macrophages were disorganized, the vacuolar membrane was degraded, and the bacterial cells had entered the cytoplasm. macrophage destruction occurred by 48 h, and the bacteria were released. in conclusion, the results of these experiments indicate that e. faecalis can persist for an extended period in mouse peritoneal macrophages.

TI  == post-translational modification of nisin. the involvement of nisb in the dehydration process.
AB  == the lantibiotic nisin is an antimicrobial peptide produced by lactococcus lactis. as with all lantibiotics, nisin contains a number of dehydro-residues and thioether amino acids that introduce five lanthionine rings into the target peptide. these atypical amino acids are introduced by post-translational modification of a ribosomally synthesized precursor peptide. in certain cases, the serine residue, at position 33 of nisin, does not undergo dehydration to dha33. with native nisin this partially processed form represents about 10% of the total peptide, whereas with the engineered variants, [trp30]nisin a and [lys27,lys31]nisin a, the proportion of peptide that escapes full processing was  found to be to approximately 50%. this feature of nisin biosynthesis was exploited in an investigation of the role of the nisb protein in pre-nisin maturation. manipulation of the level of nisb was achieved by cloning and overexpressing the plasmid-encoded nisb gene in a range of different nisin-producing strains. the resulting fourfold increase in the level of nisb significantly increased the efficiency of the dehydration reaction at ser33. the  final secreted product of biosynthesis by these strains was the homogenous form of the fully processed nisin (or nisin variant) molecule. the results presented represent the first experimental evidence for the direct involvement of the nisb  protein in the maturation process of nisin.

TI  == two operons that encode fnr-like proteins in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == global regulatory circuits of the type mediated by crp and fnr in escherichia coli were sought in lactococcus lactis to provide a basis for redirecting carbon  metabolism to specific fermentation products. using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) approach, two genes (flpa and flpb) encoding fnr-like proteins (flpa and flpb) with the potential for mediating a dithiol-disulphide-dependent regulatory  switch, were identified. transcript analysis indicated that they are distal genes of two paralogous operons, orfx-orfy-flp, in which the orfx and orfy genes were predicted to encode binding domain components of cation atpases and storage proteins respectively. the corresponding promoters were each associated with a potential fnr site (ttgat----atcaa) at positions +4.5 (flpa operon) and -42.5 (flpb operon), suggesting that the respective operons might be negatively and positively autoregulated. the incomplete open reading frames (orfwa/b) located upstream of each operon were predicted to encode additional components of paralogous cation atpases. no phenotypic effects were detected in flpa and flpb single mutants, but the double mutant had a lower intracellular zinc content, an  increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and an altered polypeptide profile (as determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis): formate production was not affected. it was concluded tentatively that flpa and flpb regulate overlapping modulons, including systems concerned with zinc uptake, in response to metal ion  or oxidative stress.

TI  == effect of elevated oxygen and carbon dioxide on the surface growth of vegetable-associated micro-organisms.
AB  == the impact of a novel type of modified atmosphere (ma), referred to as high o2-ma, on micro-organisms associated with the spoilage of minimally-processed vegetables was studied. pure cultures of pseudomonas fluorescens, enterobacter agglomerans, aureobacterium strain 27, candida guilliermondii, c. sake, salmonella typhimurium, salm. enteritidis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, leuconostoc mesenteroides var. mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis were cultured on an agar-surface model system and incubated at 8 degrees c under an atmosphere composed of o2 (80 or 90%, balanced with n2), co2 (10 or 20%, balanced with n2), or a combination of both gases. in general, exposure to high o2 alone did not inhibit microbial growth strongly, while co2 alone reduced growth to some extent in most cases. consistently strong inhibition was observed only when the two gases were used in  combination. with minimally-processed vegetables, where co2 levels of around 20%  or above cannot be used because of physiological damage to the produce, the combined treatment of high o2 and 10-20% co2 may provide adequate suppression of  microbial growth, allowing a safe, prolonged shelf-life.

TI  == characterization and heterologous expression of the genes encoding enterocin a production, immunity, and regulation in enterococcus faecium dpc1146.
AB  == enterocin a is a small, heat-stable, antilisterial bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium dpc1146. the sequence of a 10, 879-bp chromosomal region containing at least 12 open reading frames (orfs), 7 of which are predicted to play a role in enterocin biosynthesis, is presented. the genes enta, enti, and entf encode the enterocin a prepeptide, the putative immunity protein, and the induction factor prepeptide, respectively. the deduced proteins entk and entr resemble the histidine kinase and response regulator proteins of two-component signal transducing systems of the agrc-agra type. the predicted proteins entt and entd are homologous to abc (atp-binding cassette) transporters and accessory factors, respectively, of several other bacteriocin systems and to proteins implicated in the signal-sequence-independent export of escherichia coli hemolysin a. immediately downstream of the entt and entd genes are two orfs, the  product of one of which, orf4, is very similar to the product of the ytei gene of bacillus subtilis and to e. coli protease iv, a signal peptide peptidase known to be involved in outer membrane lipoprotein export. another potential bacteriocin is encoded in the opposite direction to the other genes in the enterocin cluster. this putative bacteriocin-like peptide is similar to lafx, one of the components  of the lactacin f complex. a deletion which included one of two direct repeats upstream of the enta gene abolished enterocin a activity, immunity, and ability to induce bacteriocin production. transposon insertion upstream of the entf gene  also had the same effect, but this mutant could be complemented by exogenously supplied induction factor. the putative enti peptide was shown to be involved in  the immunity to enterocin a. cloning of a 10.5-kb amplicon comprising all predicted orfs and regulatory regions resulted in heterologous production of enterocin a and induction factor in enterococcus faecalis, while a four-gene construct (entaitd) under the control of a constitutive promoter resulted in heterologous enterocin a production in both e. faecalis and lactococcus lactis.

TI  == disruption and analysis of the clpb, clpc, and clpe genes in lactococcus lactis:  clpe, a new clp family in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == in the genome of the gram-positive bacterium lactococcus lactis mg1363, we have identified three genes (clpc, clpe, and clpb) which encode clp proteins containing two conserved atp binding domains. the proteins encoded by two of the  genes belong to the previously described clpb and clpc families. the clpe gene, however, encodes a member of a new clp protein family that is characterized by a  short n-terminal domain including a putative zinc binding domain (-cx2cx22cx2c-). expression of the 83-kda clpe protein as well as of the two proteins encoded by clpb was strongly induced by heat shock and, while clpc mrna synthesis was moderately induced by heat, we were unable to identify the clpc protein. when we  analyzed mutants with disruptions in clpb, clpc, or clpe, we found that although  the genes are part of the l. lactis heat shock stimulon, the mutants responded like wild-type cells to heat and salt treatments. however, when exposed to puromycin, a trna analogue that results in the synthesis of truncated, randomly folded proteins, clpe mutant cells formed smaller colonies than wild-type cells and clpb and clpc mutant cells. thus, our data suggest that clpe, along with clpp, which recently was shown to participate in the degradation of randomly folded proteins in l. lactis, could be necessary for degrading proteins generated by certain types of stress.

TI  == the activity of escherichia coli dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is dependent on a conserved loop identified by sequence homology, mutagenesis, and limited proteolysis.
AB  == dihydroorotate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate. the enzyme from escherichia coli was overproduced and characterized in comparison with the dimeric lactococcus lactis a enzyme, whose structure is known. the two enzymes represent two distinct evolutionary families of dihydroorotate dehydrogenases, but sedimentation in sucrose gradients suggests a  dimeric structure also of the e. coli enzyme. product inhibition showed that the  e. coli enzyme, in contrast to the l. lactis enzyme, has separate binding sites for dihydroorotate and the electron acceptor. trypsin readily cleaved the e. coli enzyme into two fragments of 182 and 154 residues, respectively. cleavage reduced the activity more than 100-fold but left other molecular properties, including the heat stability, intact. the trypsin cleavage site, at r182, is positioned in  a conserved region that, in the l. lactis enzyme, forms a loop where a cysteine residue is very critical for activity. in the corresponding position, the enzyme  from e. coli has a serine residue. mutagenesis of this residue (s175) to alanine  or cysteine reduced the activities 10000- and 500-fold, respectively. the s175c mutant was also defective with respect to substrate and product binding. structural and mechanistic differences between the two different families of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase are discussed.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a purc(orf)qlf operon from lactococcus [correction of lactobacillus] lactis mg1614.
AB  == we have isolated genes encoding enzymes of the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway from lactococcus lactis mg1614 by colony hybridization using dig-labeled dna probes. the organization of the genes needed for the de novo biosynthesis of purine nucleotides in l. lactis differs from that found in other  organisms. in l. lactis there is a gene cluster, which contains five out of the 11 genes needed for the de novo biosynthesis of imp, namely purc, orf, purq, purl and purf. these genes were shown to be transcribed as a single transcription unit by northern hybridization analysis. the 5' end of the transcript of the purc(orf)qlf operon was determined by primer extension analysis using fluorescently end-labeled probes. the purc(orf)qlf operon of l. lactis is transcribed in escherichia coli, and the gene product of the purf gene, glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (glutamine prpp atase, ec 2.4.2.14), can functionally complement the e. coli purf mutant strain tx158. we also show that the promoter of the purc(orf)qlf operon is regulated in response to exogenously added purines.

TI  == effects of metabolic flux on stress response pathways in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == studies of cellular responses to stress conditions such as heat, oxygen or starvation have revealed the existence of numerous specific or interactive response pathways. we previously observed in lactococcus lactis that inactivation of the reca gene renders the lactococcal strain sensitive not only to dna-damaging agents but also to oxygen and heat. to further examine the stress response pathways in l. lactis, we isolated thermoresistant insertional mutants (trm) of the reca strain. eighteen independent trm mutations were identified and  characterized. we found that mutations map in only seven genes, implicated in purine metabolism (deob, guaa and tkta), phosphate uptake (pstb and psts), mrna stability (pnpa) and in one uncharacterized gene (trma). all the trm mutations, with the exception of trma, confer multiple stress resistance to the cell. some of the mutations confer improved heat stress resistance not only in the reca but  also in the wild-type context. our results reveal that cellular metabolic pathways are intimately related to stress response and that the flux of particular metabolites, notably guanine and phosphate, may be implicated in stress response in lactococci.

TI  == bactericidal action of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation: an in vitro investigation.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation on bacterial growth. six different bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, lactococcis lactis, salmonella typhimurium, and deinococcus radiodurans) were exposed in vitro to various doses and energy densities of laser radiation. to exclude bacterial killing by supraphysiological heating, the temperature change in the samples during irradiation was measured. extended antimicrobial effects of xecl excimer-laser radiation depending on the time of radiation, the energy density of the laser beam, and the irradiated bacterial strain were observed. reduction of bacterial growth is independent of temperature and not linked to any ablative tissue removal. in almost all cases, a 99.9% reduction of bacteria was reached by total radiation times < 100 ms. the proven antimicrobial effects of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation may be of significant clinical importance in endodontics  and periodontology in the future.

TI  == clpp participates in the degradation of misfolded protein in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == clpp proteins constitute a family of homologous proteins found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. in escherichia coli, clpp is the proteolytic component of a large complex also containing either the clpa or the clpx atpases. we show here that the clpp gene from the gram-positive bacterium lactococcus lactis encodes a 22-kda protein that is induced by low ph and by the  t-rna analogue puromycin, which interferes with translation, resulting in the production of misfolded puromycyl-containing peptides. northern blot and primer extension analysis showed that clpp expression is also induced by heat shock and  that stress induction occurs at the transcriptional level independent of the circe regulatory element often implicated in stress regulation in gram-positive bacteria. when we disrupted the l. lactis clpp gene by insertional inactivation,  the resulting mutant was more sensitive to both heat and puromycin than wild-type cells. furthermore, cells lacking clpp had a reduced ability to degrade puromycyl-containing peptides, and they synthesized heat shock proteins constitutively in the absence of stress. thus, our data suggest that clpp plays a major role in the degradation of misfolded proteins.

TI  == 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from lactococcus lactis: a role for arginine residues in binding substrate and coenzyme.
AB  == a gene encoding 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-pgdh, ec 1.1.1. 44) was identified from the homofermentative lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis, by complementation of escherichia coli mutants. the cloned gene was then expressed to high levels in e. coli and the protein purified for kinetic analysis. the enzyme had a km for 6-phosphogluconate of 15.4+/-1.4 microm and for nadp of 1.9+/-0.2 microm at ph 7.5. sequence comparison of the l. lactis 6-pgdh with the  corresponding enzyme derived from the pathogenic protozoan trypanosoma brucei and sheep liver revealed the substrate-binding residues to be identical in all three  species, although the three coenzyme-binding pockets differed slightly. a totally conserved arginine residue (arg-447), believed to bind the 6-phosphate of substrate, was mutated to lysine, aspartate, alanine or tryptophan. in each case  enzyme activity was lost, confirming an essential role for this residue on activity. a second arginine (arg-34), believed to be critical in binding the 2'-phosphate of cofactor nadp+, was mutated to a tyrosine residue, as found in one atypical isoform of the enzyme in bacillus subtilis. this alteration led to decrease in affinity for nadp+ of nearly three orders of magnitude. a second 6-pgdh gene has been identified from the genome of b. subtilis. this second isoform contains an arginine (arg-34) in this position, suggesting that b. subtilis has two 6-pgdhs with different coenzyme specificities.

TI  == restrictive use of detergents in the functional reconstitution of the secondary multidrug transporter lmrp.
AB  == the histidine-tagged secondary multidrug transporter lmrp was overexpressed in lactococcus lactis, using a novel protein expression system for cytotoxic proteins based on the tightly regulated, nisin-inducible nisa promoter. lmrp-mediated h+/drug antiport activity in inside-out membrane vesicles was inhibited by detergents, such as triton x-100, triton x-114, and tween 80, at low concentrations that did not affect the magnitude or composition of the proton motive force. the inhibition of the activity of lmrp by detergents restricted the range of compounds that could be used for the solubilization and reconstitution of the protein because low concentrations of detergent are retained in proteoliposomes. surprisingly, dodecyl maltoside did not modulate the activity of lmrp. therefore, lmrp was solubilized with dodecyl maltoside, purified by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography, and reconstituted in dodecyl maltoside-destabilized, preformed liposomes prepared from escherichia coli phospholipids and egg phosphatidylcholine. reconstituted lmrp mediated the transport of multiple drugs in response to an artificially imposed ph gradient, demonstrating that the protein functions as a proton motive force-dependent multidrug transporter, independent of accessory proteins. these observations are  relevant for the effective solubilization and reconstitution of multidrug transporters belonging to the major facilitator superfamily, which, in view of their broad drug specificity, may strongly interact with detergents.

AB  == the binding of escherichia coli and lactococcus lactis fapy-dna glyosylase (fpg)  proteins to dna containing either cyclic or non-cyclic abasic (ap) site analogs was investigated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa) and by footprinting experiments. we showed that the reduced ap site is the best substrate analog for the e.coli and l.lactis enzymes ( k dapp = 0.26 and 0.5 nm,  respectively) as compared with the other analogs tested in this study ( k dapp >2.8 nm). the 1,3-propanediol (pr) residue-containing dna seems to be the minimal ap site structure allowing a fpg specific dna binding, since the ethyleneglycol residue is not specifically bound by these enzymes. the newly described cyclopentanol residue is better recognized than tetrahydrofuran (for the e.coli fpg, k dapp = 2.9 and 25 nm, respectively). these results suggest that the hemiacetal form of the ap site is negatively discriminated by the fpg protein suggesting a hydrogen bond between the c4'-hydroxyl group of the sugar and a fpg  residue. high-resolution hydroxyl radical footprinting using a duplex containing  pr shows that fpg binds to six nucleotides on the strand containing the ap site and only the base opposite the lesion on the undamaged complementary strand. this comparative study provides new information about the molecular mechanism involved in the fpg ap lyase activity.

(1994) protein sci. 3, 1114-6]. in addition, bsts-a demonstrates specific activity 2-3-fold higher than ts from lactobacillus casei or escherichia coli. we have solved the crystal structure of this unusual ts in four crystal forms to a maximum resolution of 1.7 a. each of these crystal forms contains either one or two noncrystallographically related dimers. stabilization of the beta-sheet dimer interface through a dramatic architecture of buttressed internal salt bridges maintains the structural integrity of bsts-a at elevated temperatures. melting curves of tss from l. casei and e. coli are compared to that of ts-a from b. subtilis and correlated with numbers of hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and the numbers of interactions localized to the dimer interface. analysis of this structure will shed light on the conservation of function across diversity of sequence, as well as provide insights into the thermal stabilization of a highly conserved enzyme.

TI  == the site-specific recombination system of the lactobacillus species bacteriophage a2 integrates in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the region of the bacteriophage a2 genome involved in site-specific recombination with the dna of lactobacillus spp. has been identified. two orfs, transcribed from the same strand, have been found immediately upstream of the phage attachment site (attp). the orf adjacent to attp predicts a 385-amino-acid protein that presents significant similarity with site-specific recombinases of the integrase family. the other orf encodes a basic polypeptide of 76 amino acid  residues. the junctions of the prophage with the genomes of its hosts have been determined, allowing the identification of the host attachment site (attb), which has a common 19-nucleotide core region with attp. the attb site is located at the 3' end of the transfer rnaleu gene (anticodon caa). nonreplicative plasmids containing the a2-specific recombination cassette integrate into different lactobacilli but also into unrelated gram-positive bacteria such as lactococcus lactis and even into escherichia coli. in lc. lactis, integration occurs in a previously unknown intergenic region, whereas in e. coli, it maps within the rrnd operon, 5' of rrsd gene. comparison of the integration sites in the different hosts indicates that some flexibility is permitted in the attb sequence, since lc. lactis and e. coli only share 13 and 11 nucleotides, respectively, with the 19-nucleotide core sequence of the lactobacilli.

TI  == conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in pcr amplification of lactic acid bacteria (lab). an appropriately-sized pcr product was obtained from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll43-1 and mg1363; lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lc10-1, lc11-1, and  lc12-1; streptococcus thermophilus st1-1; enterococcus faecalis ef1-1; lactobacillus acidophilus la1-1; lactobacillus helveticus lh1-1; pediococcus pentosaceus pp1-1; and bifidobacterium animalis ba1-1. the pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the human y-box factor. the amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also  highly conserved in the lab strains. it is possible, therefore, that this protein in lab may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an rna chaperone unwinding tightly folded rna molecules.

TI  == characterization of multiple regions involved in replication and mobilization of  plasmid pnz4000 coding for exopolysaccharide production in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == we characterized the regions involved in replication and mobilization of the 40-kb plasmid pnz4000, encoding exopolysaccharide (eps) production in lactococcus lactis nizo b40. the plasmid contains four highly conserved replication regions with homologous rep genes (repb1, repb2, repb3, and repb4) that belong to the lactococcal theta replicon family. subcloning of each replicon individually showed that all are functional and compatible in l. lactis. plasmid pnz4000 and genetically labeled derivatives could be transferred to different l. lactis strains by conjugation, and pnz4000 was shown to be a mobilization plasmid. two regions involved in mobilization were identified near two of the replicons; both  included an orit sequence rich in inverted repeats. conjugative mobilization of the nonmobilizable plasmid pnz124 was promoted by either one of these orit sequences, demonstrating their functionality. one orit sequence was followed by a moba gene, coding for a trans-acting protein, which increased the frequency of conjugative transfer 100-fold. the predicted moba protein and the orit sequences  show protein and nucleotide similarity, respectively, with the relaxase and with  the inverted repeat and nic site of the orit from the escherichia coli plasmid r64. the presence on pnz4000 of four functional replicons, two orit sequences, and several insertion sequence-like elements strongly suggests that this eps plasmid is a naturally occurring cointegrate.

AB  == the effects of lactobacillus-gg-fermented oat bran product on the microbiota and  its metabolic activity in the human gut were investigated, using a simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (shime), by analysing the bacterial population, shortchain fatty acids and gas production. in addition, the effects of fermented oat bran supernatant and supernatant samples from reactors 4, 5 and  6 (large intestine) on the growth of escherichia coli ihe 13047, enterococcus faecalis vtt e-93203, lactobacillus rhamnosus vtt e-94522 (lactobacillus gg) and  lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis vtt e-90414 were monitored to ascertain possible stimulatory/inhibitory effects by an in vitro turbidometric method. our experiments showed that lactobacillus gg colonized the shime reactor and this colonization could be maintained for several weeks without extra supplementation. oat bran feeding also favoured the growth of bifidobacteria and caused an increase in the production of acetic, propionic and butyric acid as well as ch4 and co2. however, the effects of oat bran, either on bacterial populations or on  their metabolic activity, were not directly dose-dependent. in turbidometric measurements, the supernatant of fermented oat bran exerted an inhibitory effect  of lactobacillus gg, but stimulated the growth of enterococci.

TI  == transcriptional regulation and evolution of lactose genes in the galactose-lactose operon of lactococcus lactis ncdo2054.
AB  == the genetics of lactose utilization within the slow-lactose-fermenting lactococcus lactis strain ncdo2054 was studied with respect to the organization,  expression, and evolution of the lac genes. initially the beta-galactosidase gene (lacz) was cloned by complementation of an escherichia coli mutant on a 7-kb hpai fragment. nucleotide sequence analysis of the complete fragment revealed part of  a gal-lac operon, and the genes were characterized by inactivation and complementation analyses and in vitro enzyme activity measurements. the gene order is galk-galt-laca-lacz-gale; the gal genes encode enzymes of the leloir pathway for galactose metabolism, and laca encodes a galactoside acetyltransferase. the galt and gale genes of l. lactis lm0230 (a lactose plasmid-cured derivative of the fast-lactose-fermenting l. lactis c2) were highly similar at the nucleotide sequence level to their counterparts in strain ncdo2054 and, furthermore, had the same gene order except for the presence of the intervening laca-lacz strain ncdo2054. analysis of mrna for the gal and lac genes revealed an unusual transcriptional organization for the operon, with a surprisingly large number of transcriptional units. the regulation of the lac genes was further investigated by using fusions consisting of putative promoter fragments and the promoterless beta-glucuronidase gene (gusa) from e. coli, which identified three lactose-inducible intergenic promoters in the gal-lac operon. the greater similarity of the laca and lacz genes to homologs in gram-negative organisms than to those of gram-positive bacteria, in contrast to the homologies  of the gal genes, suggests that the genes within the gal operon of l. lactis ncdo2054 have been recently acquired. thus, the laca-lacz genes appear to have engaged the promoters of the gal operon in order to direct and control their expression.

TI  == retrohoming of a bacterial group ii intron: mobility via complete reverse splicing, independent of homologous dna recombination.
AB  == the mobile group ii intron of lactococcus lactis, ll.ltrb, provides the opportunity to analyze the homing pathway in genetically tractable bacterial systems. here, we show that ll.ltrb mobility occurs by an rna-based retrohoming mechanism in both escherichia coli and l. lactis. surprisingly, retrohoming occurs efficiently in the absence of reca function, with a relaxed requirement for flanking exon homology and without coconversion of exon markers. these results lead to a model for bacterial retrohoming in which the intron integrates  into recipient dna by complete reverse splicing and serves as the template for cdna synthesis. the retrohoming reaction is completed in unprecedented fashion by a dna repair event that is independent of homologous recombination between the alleles. thus, ll.ltrb has many features of retrotransposons, with practical and  evolutionary implications.

TI  == trnatrp as a key element of antitermination in the lactococcus lactis trp operon.
AB  == the expression of the trp operon of lactococcus lactis is regulated in response to tryptophan availability by a mechanism of transcription antitermination. we present evidence in support of a previously described model involving trnatrp as  a key element in the sensing of tryptophan levels and the realization of the regulatory response to tryptophan limitation. in agreement with this model, two sites of presumed direct interaction between the trp leader transcript and trnatrp are found to be of crucial importance for efficient antitermination. these correspond to the specifier codon, which presumably interacts with the anticodon in the trna, and a sequence complementary to, and presumably interacting with, the acceptor stem of the trna. through these interactions, uncharged trnatrp is believed to stabilize an antiterminator conformation of the  trp leader transcript, thus allowing transcription and expression of the structural genes of the operon. for the first time, we present direct evidence that it is the ratio of uncharged to charged trna that is important for the regulation of antitermination, rather than the absolute amount of uncharged trna. in addition, our results indicate that the codon-anticodon interaction, although  contributing largely to the efficiency of the regulatory response, is not strictly indispensable, which suggests the existence of additional interactions between mrna and trna. finally, we describe a possible additional level of regulation, superimposed and dependent on trna-mediated anti-termination control, that is based on the processing of the trp leader transcript. together with the regulation mechanisms described earlier for the escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis trp operons, this constitutes the third different mechanism of transcript elongation control found to be involved in the regulation of an operon of which the structural genes are highly conserved.

TI  == induced levels of heat shock proteins in a dnak mutant of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the bacterial heat shock response is characterized by the elevated expression of  a number of chaperone complexes and proteases, including the dnak-grpe-dnaj and the groels chaperone complexes. in order to investigate the importance of the dnak chaperone complex for growth and heat shock response regulation in lactococcus lactis, we have constructed two dnak mutants with c-terminal deletions in dnak. the minor deletion of 65 amino acids in the dnakdelta2 mutant  resulted in a slight temperature-sensitive phenotype. bk6, containing the larger  deletion of 174 amino acids (dnakdelta1), removing the major part of the inferred substrate binding site of the dnak protein, exhibited a pronounced temperature-sensitive phenotype and showed altered regulation of the heat shock response. the expression of the heat shock proteins was increased at the normal growth temperature, measured as both protein synthesis rates and mrna levels, indicating that dnak could be involved in the regulation of the heat shock response in l. lactis. for bacillus subtilis, it has been found (a. mogk, g. homuth, c. scholz, l. kim, f. x. schmid, and w. schumann, embo j. 16:4579-4590, 1997) that the activity of the heat shock repressor hrca is dependent on the chaperone function of the groels complex and that a dnak insertion mutant has no  effect on the expression of the heat shock proteins. the present data from l. lactis suggest that the dnak protein could be involved in the maturation of the homologous hrca protein in this bacterium.

TI  == the -16 region of bacillus subtilis and other gram-positive bacterial promoters.
AB  == the bacillus subtilis alpha-amylase promoter amy p contains an essential tgtg motif (-16 region) upstream of the -10 region. mutations of this region significantly reduced in vitro promoter strength. a -15 g-->c transversion eliminated transcription from amy p by both b.subtilis and escherichia coli rna polymerase (rnap). a second alpha-amylase promoter ( amy p2) also required the -16 region for function. to determine conserved sequences in promoters containing -16 region elements, sequences of 64 b.subtilis promoters with the second tg motif of the -16 region were aligned and analyzed. unlike the e.coli class of 'extended -10 promoters', with a similar tg motif but lacking a -35 region, the -16 region promoters contain highly conserved -35 regions. they also contain conserved a n and t n tracts upstream of the -35 region. in addition, we analyzed all available gram-positive bacterial promoter compilations to determine the generality of the -16 region. from this analysis, the -16 region trtg motif (r =  purine) appears to be a basic element found in a large portion of gram-positive bacterial promoters and is, in the case of at least the alpha-amylase promoters,  necessary for transcription by the major form of b.subtilis and e.coli rnap.

TI  == lactococcus lactis phage operon coding for an endonuclease homologous to ruvc.
AB  == the function of the lactococcus lactis bacteriophage bil66 middle time-expressed  operon (m-operon), involved in sensitivity to the abortive infection mechanism abid1, was examined. expression of the m-operon is detrimental to escherichia coli cells, induces the sos response and is lethal to reca and recbc e. coli mutants, which are both deficient in recombinational repair of chromosomal double-stranded breaks (dsbs). the use of an inducible expression system allowed  us to demonstrate that the m-operon-encoded proteins generate a limited number of randomly distributed chromosomal dsbs that are substrates for exov-mediated dna degradation. dsbs were also shown to occur upstream of the replication initiation point of unidirectionally theta-replicating plasmids. the characteristics of the  dsbs lead us to propose that the endonucleolytic activity of the m-operon is not  specific to dna sequence, but rather to branched dna structures. genetic and physical analysis performed with different derivatives of the m-operon indicated  that two orfs (orf2 and orf3) are needed for nucleolytic activity. the orf3 product has amino acid homology with the e. coli ruvc holliday junction resolvase. by site-specific mutagenesis, we have shown that one of the amino acid residues constituting the active centre of ruvc enzyme (glu-66) and conserved in  orf3 (glu-67) is essential for the nucleolytic activity of the m-operon gene product(s). we therefore propose that orf2 and orf3 of the m-operon code for a structure-specific endonuclease (m-nuclease), which might be essential for phage  multiplication.

AB  == the importance of lactococcus lactis biovar diacetylactis (l. diacetylactis) in the dairy industry is due to its ability to produce aroma compounds, such as acetoin and diacetyl, from citrate. the first step in citrate utilization is its  uptake by the cells. in l. diacetylactis, the citrate transport system is encoded by the citqrp operon. we have previously proposed that expression of citqrp operon is regulated at the post-transcriptional level. in this paper, we show that the cit mrna is processed at a complex secondary structure in l. diacetylactis and escherichia coli. this secondary structure includes the 5'-terminal two-thirds of citq and the overlap between citq and citr. primer-extension analysis revealed that the major cleavage sites are located upstream of citr and within citq. in an attempt to identify the enzyme(s) responsible for this cleavage, we have analyzed this processing in e. coli mutants deficient in endoribonucleases. a comparative analysis of cit mrna degradation was performed in rnase e and rnase iii mutants and in wild-type strains using northern blot hybridization. this analysis revealed that the cit transcript is degraded into several breakdown products, which are significantly stabilized in the mutant lacking rnase iii. our results indicate that the complex secondary structure has a critical role in the control of the expression of cit mrna. a model for processing is discussed.

TI  == a chloride-inducible acid resistance mechanism in lactococcus lactis and its regulation.
AB  == previously, a promoter was identified in lactococcus lactis that is specifically  induced by chloride. here, we describe the nucleotide sequence and functional analysis of two genes transcribed from this promoter, gadc and gadb. gadc is homologous to putative glutamate-gamma-aminobutyrate antiporters of escherichia coli and shigella flexneri and contains 12 putative membrane-spanning domains. gadb shows similarity to glutamate decarboxylases. a l. lactis gadb mutant and a  strain that is unable to express both gadb and gadc was more sensitive to low ph  than the wild type when nacl and glutamate were present. expression of gadcb in l. lactis in the presence of chloride was increased when the culture ph was allowed to decrease to low levels by omitting buffer from the medium, while glutamate also stimulated gadcb expression. apparently, these genes encode a glutamate-dependent acid resistance mechanism of l. lactis that is optimally active under conditions in which it is needed to maintain viability. immediately  upstream of the chloride-dependent gadcb promoter pgad, a third gene encodes a protein (gadr) that is homologous to the activator rgg from streptococcus gordonii. gadr expression is chloride and glutamate independent. a gadr mutant did not produce the 3kb gadcb mrna that is found in wild-type cells in the presence of nacl, indicating that gadr is an activator of the gadcb operon.

TI  == molecular characterization of a phage-inducible middle promoter and its transcriptional activator from the lactococcal bacteriophage phi31.

AB  == bacteriophage sk1 is a small isometric-headed lytic phage belonging to the 936 species. it infects lactococcus lactis, a commonly used dairy starter organism. nucleotide sequence data analysis indicated that the sk1 genome is 28,451 nucleotides long and contains 54 open reading frames (orfs) of 30 or more codons, interspersed with three large intergenic regions. the nucleotide sequence of several of the sk1 orfs demonstrated significant levels of identity to genes (many encoding proteins of unknown function) in other lactococcal phages of both  small isometric-headed and prolate-headed morphotype. based on this identity and  predicted peptide structures, sk1 genes for the terminase, major structural protein and dna polymerase have been putatively identified. genes encoding holin  and lysin were also identified, subcloned into an escherichia coli expression vector, and their function demonstrated in vivo. the sk1 origin of replication was located by identifying sk1 dna fragments able to support the maintenance in l. lactis of a plasmid lacking a functional gram-positive ori. the minimal fragment conferring replication origin function contained a number of direct repeats and 179 codons of orf47. although no similarity between phage sk1 and coliphage lambda at the nucleotide or amino acid sequence level was observed, an  alignment of the sk1 late region orfs with the lambda structural and packaging genes revealed a striking correspondence in both orf length and isoelectric point of the orf product. it is proposed that this correspondence is indicative of a strong conservation in gene order within these otherwise unrelated isometric-headed phages that can be used to predict the functions of the sk1 gene products.

TI  == isolation and characterization of promoters from the lactobacillus casei temperate bacteriophage a2.
AB  == random sau3a1 dna fragments from the temperate lactobacillus bacteriophage a2 were cloned into the promoter-probe plasmid pgkv210. seven dna fragments with promoter activity were selected, after transformation of escherichia coli and lactococcus lactis, subsp, lactis, through the chloramphenicol resistance they conferred to the corresponding clones. the seven promoters were functional in lactobacillus casei. their strength was analysed by measuring the levels of chloramphenicol resistance and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity induced in each host. the nucleotide sequences of these fragments were determined and primer extension analysis was used to locate the initiation site of transcription from each promoter in e coli. the promoters contained -10 and -35 regions similar to the consensus sequences of e. coli and lactobacillus promoters.

TI  == identification of the lactococcal exonuclease/recombinase and its modulation by the putative chi sequence.
AB  == studies of recbcd-chi interactions in escherichia coli have served as a model to  understand recombination events in bacteria. however, the existence of similar interactions has not been demonstrated in bacteria unrelated to e. coli. we developed an in vivo model to examine components of dsdna break repair in various microorganisms. here, we identify the major exonuclease in lactococcus lactis, a  gram-positive organism evolutionarily distant from e. coli, and provide evidence  for exonuclease-chi interactions. insertional mutants of l. lactis, screened as exonuclease-deficient, affected a single locus and resulted in uv sensitivity and recombination deficiency. the cloned lactococcal genes (called rexab) restored uv resistance, recombination proficiency, and the capacity to degrade linear dna, to an e. coli recbcd mutant. in this context, dna degradation is specifically blocked by the putative lactococcal chi site (5'-gcgcgtg-3'), but not by the e. coli chi (5'-gctggtgg-3') site. rexab-mediated recombination was shown to be stimulated approximately 27-fold by lactococcal chi. our results reveal that rexab fulfills the biological roles of recbcd and indicate that its activity is modulated by a short dna sequence. we speculate that exonuclease/recombinase enzymes whose activities are modulated by short dna sequences are widespread among bacteria.

TI  == the sequence of spacers between the consensus sequences modulates the strength of prokaryotic promoters.
AB  == we constructed a library of synthetic promoters for lactococcus lactis in which the known consensus sequences were kept constant while the sequences of the separating spacers were randomized. the library consists of 38 promoters which differ in strength from 0.3 up to more than 2,000 relative units, the latter among the strongest promoters known for this organism. the ranking of the promoter activities was somewhat different when assayed in escherichia coli, but  the promoters are efficient for modulating gene expression in this bacterium as well. dna sequencing revealed that the weaker promoters (which had activities below 5 relative units) all had changes either in the consensus sequences or in the length of the spacer between the -35 and -10 sequences. the promoters in which those features were conserved had activities from 5 to 2,050 u, which shows that by randomizing the spacers, at least a 400-fold change in activity can be obtained. interestingly, the entire range of promoter activities is covered in small steps of activity increase, which makes these promoters very suitable for quantitative physiological studies and for fine-tuning of gene expression in industrial bioreactors and cell factories.

TI  == determinant role of e. coli rnase iii in the decay of both specific and heterologous mrnas.

TI  == a chloride-inducible gene expression cassette and its use in induced lysis of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a chloride-inducible promoter previously isolated from the chromosome of lactococcus lactis (j. w. sanders, g. venema, j. kok, and k. leenhouts, mol. gen. genet., in press) was exploited for the inducible expression of homologous and heterologous genes. an expression cassette consisting of the positive-regulator gene gadr, the chloride-inducible promoter pgad, and the translation initiation signals of gadc was amplified by pcr. the cassette was cloned upstream of escherichia coli lacz, the holin-lysin cassette (lytpr) of the lactococcal bacteriophage r1t, and the autolysin gene of l. lactis, acma. basal activity of pgad resulted in a low level of expression of all three proteins. growth in the presence of 0.5 m nacl of a strain containing the gadc::lacz fusion resulted in a 1,500-fold increase of beta-galactosidase activity. the background activity levels of lytpr and acma had no deleterious effects on cell growth, but induction of lysin expression by addition of 0.5 m nacl resulted in inhibition of growth. lysis was monitored by following the release of the cytoplasmic marker enzyme pepx. released pepx activity was maximal at 1 day after induction of lytpr expression with 0.1 m nacl. induction of acma expression resulted in slower release of pepx from the cells. the presence of the inducing agent nacl resulted  in the stabilization of osmotically fragile cells.

TI  == a bacterial group ii intron encoding reverse transcriptase, maturase, and dna endonuclease activities: biochemical demonstration of maturase activity and insertion of new genetic information within the intron.
AB  == the lactococcus lactis group ii intron ll.ltrb is similar to mobile yeast mtdna group ii introns, which encode reverse transcriptase, rna maturase, and dna endonuclease activities for site-specific dna insertion. here, we show that the lactococcal intron can be expressed and spliced efficiently in escherichia coli.  the intron-encoded protein ltra has reverse transcriptase and rna maturase activities, with the latter activity shown both in vivo and in vitro, a first for any group ii intron-encoded protein. as for the yeast mtdna introns, the dna endonuclease activity of the lactococcal intron is associated with rnp particles  containing both the intron-encoded protein and the excised intron rna. also, the  intron rna cleaves the sense-strand of the recipient dna by a reverse splicing reaction, whereas the intron-encoded protein cleaves the antisense strand. the lactococcal intron endonuclease can be obtained in large quantities by coexpression of the ltra protein with the intron rna in e. coli or reconstituted  in vitro by incubating the expressed ltra protein with in vitro-synthesized intron rna. furthermore, the specificity of the endonuclease and reverse splicing reactions can be changed predictably by modifying the rna component. expression in e. coli facilitates the use of group ii introns for the targeting of specific  foreign sequences to a desired site in dna.

TI  == a triggered-suicide system designed as a defense against bacteriophages.
AB  == a novel bacteriophage protection system for lactococcus lactis based on a genetic trap, in which a strictly phage-inducible promoter isolated from the lytic phage  phi31 is used to activate a bacterial suicide system after infection, was developed. the lethal gene of the suicide system consists of the three-gene restriction cassette llair+, which is lethal across a wide range of gram-positive bacteria. the phage-inducible trigger promoter (phi31p) and the llair+ restriction cassette were cloned in escherichia coli on a high-copy-number replicon to generate ptrk414h. restriction activity was not apparent in e. coli or l. lactis prior to phage infection. in phage challenges of l. lactis(ptrk414h) with phi31, the efficiency of plaquing was lowered to 10(-4) and accompanied by a fourfold reduction in burst size. center-of-infection assays revealed that only 15% of infected cells released progeny phage. in addition to phage phi31, the phi31p/llair+ suicide cassette also inhibited four phi31-derived recombinant phages at levels at least 10-fold greater than that of phi31. the phi31p/llair+-based suicide system is a genetically engineered form of abortive infection that traps and eliminates phages potentially evolving in fermentation environments by destroying the phage genome and killing the propagation host. this type of phage-triggered suicide system could be designed for any bacterium-phage combination, given a universal lethal gene and an inducible promoter which is triggered by the infecting bacteriophage.

TI  == a new family of k+ transporters from arabidopsis that are conserved across phyla.
AB  == transport of k+ in higher plants, as in bacteria and fungi, is mediated by two broad classes of transport proteins that operate in the millimolar and micromolar k+ concentration ranges. a search of the expressed sequence tag database using amino acid consensus sequences for the k+ transporters hak1 from schwanniomyces and kup of escherichia coli yielded two homologous sequences for arabidopsis. cloning and sequencing of these genes gave single open reading frames for the putative transporters, atkt1 and atkt2, with predicted molecular weights of 79 and 88 kda. the predicted gene products showed a high degree of homology at the amino acid level (56% identity) and exhibited significant hydrophobic stretches in their n-terminal halves, consistent with 12 membrane-spanning, alpha-helical domains. database searches using atkt1 and atkt2 identified 10 additional sequences in arabidopsis as well as additional homologous sequences in the plant  species oryza and allium, the bacterium lactococcus lactis, and in homo sapiens.  expression of atkt2 rescued growth on low millimolar [k+] in saccharomyces cerevisiae carrying deletions for the genes encoding the k+ transporters trk1 and trk2. rescue was associated with a 2-fold stimulation of rb+ uptake and was sensitive to competition with external na+ but not to extracellular ph, indicating that the gene encodes a low-affinity k+ transporter. these and additional results suggest that atkt1 and atkt2 belong to a superfamily of cation transporters that have been conserved through evolution.

TI  == functional features of an ssi signal of plasmid pgkv21 in escherichia coli.
AB  == a single-strand initiation (ssi) signal was detected on the lactococcus lactis plasmid pgkv21 containing the replicon of pwv01 by its ability to complement the  poor growth of an m13 phage derivative (m13 delta lac182) lacking the complementary-strand origin in escherichia coli. this ssi signal was situated at  the 229-nucleotide (nt) ddei-drai fragment and located within the 109 nt upstream of the nick site of the putative plus origin. ssi activity is orientation specific with respect to the direction of replication. we constructed an ssi signal-deleted plasmid and then examined the effects of the ssi signal on the conversion of the single-stranded replication intermediate to double-stranded plasmid dna in e. coli. the plasmid lacking an ssi signal accumulated much more plasmid single-stranded dna than the wild-type plasmid did. moreover, deletion of this region caused a great reduction in plasmid copy number or plasmid maintenance. these results suggest that in e. coli, this ssi signal directs its lagging-strand synthesis as a minus origin of plasmid pgkv21. primer rna synthesis in vitro suggests that e. coli rna polymerase directly recognizes the 229-nt ssi signal and synthesizes primer rna dependent on the presence of e. coli single-stranded dna binding (ssb) protein. this region contains two stem-loop structures, stem-loop i and stem-loop ii. deletion of stem-loop i portion results in loss of priming activity by e. coli rna polymerase, suggesting that stem-loop  i portion is essential for priming by e. coli rna polymerase on the ssb-coated single-stranded dna template.

TI  == characterization of escherichia coli nrdh. a glutaredoxin-like protein with a thioredoxin-like activity profile.
AB  == ribonucleotides are converted to deoxyribonucleotides by ribonucleotide reductases. either thioredoxin or glutaredoxin is a required electron donor for class i and ii enzymes. glutaredoxins are reduced by glutathione, thioredoxins by thioredoxin reductase. recently, a glutaredoxin-like protein, nrdh, was isolated  as the functional electron donor for a nrdef ribonucleotide reductase, a class ib enzyme, from lactococcus lactis. the absence of glutathione in this bacterium raised the question of the identity of the intracellular reductant for nrdh. homologues of nrdh are present in the genomes of escherichia coli and salmonella  typhimurium, upstream of the genes for the poorly transcribed nrdef, separated from it by an open reading frame (nrdi) coding for a protein of unknown function. overexpression of e. coli nrdh protein shows that it is a functional hydrogen donor with higher specificity for the class ib (nrdef) than for the class ia (nrdab) ribonucleotide reductase. furthermore, this glutaredoxin-like enzyme is reduced by thioredoxin reductase and not by glutathione. we suggest that several  uncharacterized glutaredoxin-like proteins present in the genomes of organisms lacking gsh, including archae, will also react with thioredoxin reductase and be  related to the ancestors from which the gsh-dependent glutaredoxins have evolved  by the acquisition of a gsh-binding site. we also show that nrdi, encoded by all  nrdef operons, has a stimulatory effect on ribonucleotide reduction.

AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the chromosomally encoded type ii scrfi restriction/modification system from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris uc503 was completed. the scrfi restriction endonuclease (enase) has previously been shown to specifically recognize 5' ccngg 3' sites, cleaving after the second cytosine and the degenerate central base. the enase gene (scrfir; 362 bp) was located between, and co-directionally transcribed with, two formerly characterized 5-methylcytosine methyltransferase genes, which encodes proteins that independently confer protection against scrfi digestion. scrfir codes for a protein of 272 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 31470 da, which agrees favourably with a previously estimated molecular mass of 34 kda for this enzymes. the deduced sequence of this protein did not show any significant homology with known protein sequences, including the isoschizomeric ssoll enase from shigella sonnei. the enase gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli and lactococcus; however, no in vivo restriction of phage was observed, suggesting that expression of the enase gene may be repressed, or that the appropriate expression signals may be absent in the cloned constructs. the ability of scrfi to cleave non-canonically modified 5' ccngg 3' sequences suggested that some scrfi sites may require complex modifications to fully impair digestion by this enzyme.

AB  == studies of cellular responses to dna-damaging agents, mostly in escherichia coli, have revealed numerous genes and pathways involved in dna repair. however, other  species, particularly those which exist under different environmental conditions  than does e. coli, may have rather different responses. here, we identify and characterize genes involved in dna repair in a gram-positive plant and dairy bacterium, lactococcus lactis. lactococcal strain mg1363 was mutagenized with transposition vector pg+host9::iss1, and 18 mutants sensitive to mitomycin and uv were isolated at 37 degrees c. dna sequence analyses allowed the identification of 11 loci and showed that insertions are within genes implicated in dna metabolism (pola, hexb, and deob), cell envelope formation (gerc and dltd), various metabolic pathways (arcd, bgla, gida, hgrp, metb, and proa), and, for seven mutants, nonidentified open reading frames. seven mutants were chosen for further characterization. they were shown to be uv sensitive at 30 degrees c (the optimal growth temperature of l. lactis); three (gida, pola, and uvs-75) were affected in their capacity to mediate homologous recombination. our results indicate that uv resistance of the lactococcal strain can be attributed in part to dna repair but also suggest that other factors, such as cell envelope composition, may be important in mediating resistance to mutagenic stress.

TI  == membrane topology of the di- and tripeptide transport protein of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == transport of hydrophilic di- and tripeptides into lactococcus lactis is mediated  by a proton motive force-driven peptide transport protein (dtpt) that shares similarity with eukaryotic peptide transporters, e.g., from kidney and small intestine of rabbit, man, and rat. hydropathy profiling in combination with the "positive inside rule" predicts for most of the homologous proteins an alpha-helical bundle of 12 transmembrane segments, but the positions of these transmembrane segments and the location of the amino and carboxyl termini are by  no means conclusive. the secondary structure of dtpt was investigated by analyzing 42 dtpt-alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins, generated by random or directed fusions of the corresponding genes. these studies confirm the presence of 12 transmembrane segments but refute several other predictions made of the secondary structure. data obtained from the fusion proteins were substantiated by studying the accessibility of single cysteine mutants in putative cytoplasmic or  extracellular loops by membrane (im)permeant sulfhydryl reagents. the deduced topology model of dtpt consists of a bundle of 12 alpha-helixes with a short amino and a large carboxyl terminus, both located at the cytoplasmic site of the  membrane. on the basis of sequence comparisons with dtpt, it seems likely that the structure model of the amino-terminal half of dtpt also holds for the eukaryotic peptide transporters, whereas the carboxyl-terminal half is largely different.

AB  == the bacterium lactococcus lactis has become a model organism in studies of growth physiology and membrane transport, as a result of its simple fermentative metabolism. it is also used as a model for studying the importance of specific genes and functions during life in excess nutrients, by comparison of prototrophic wild-type strains and auxotrophic domesticated (dairy) strains. in a study of the capacity of domesticated strains to perform directed responses toward various stress conditions, we have analyzed the heat and salt stress response in the established l. lactis subsp. cremoris laboratory strain mg1363, which was originally derived from a dairy strain. after two-dimensional separation of proteins, the dnak, groel, and groes heat shock proteins, the hrca  (orf1) heat shock repressor, and the glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase, glyceral-dehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and phosphoglycerate kinase were identified by a combination of western blotting and direct n-terminal amino acid  sequencing of proteins from the gels. of 400 to 500 visible proteins, 17 were induced more than twofold during heat stress. two classes of heat stress proteins were identified from their temporal induction pattern. the fast-induced proteins  (including dnak) showed an abruptly increased rate of synthesis during the first  10 min, declining to intermediate levels after 15 min. groel and groes, which also belong to this group, maintained a high rate of synthesis after 15 min. the  class of slowly induced proteins exhibited a gradual increase in the rate of synthesis after the onset of stress. unlike other organisms, all salt stress-induced proteins in l. lactis were also subjected to heat stress induction. dnak, groel, and groes showed similar temporal patterns of induction during salt stress, resembling the timing during heat stress although at a lower  induction level. these data indicate an overlap between the heat shock and salt stress responses in l. lactis.

AB  == thermus thermophilus peptide deformylase was characterized. its enzymatic properties as well as its organization in domains proved to share close resemblances with those of the escherichia coli enzyme despite few sequence identities. in addition to the hexxh signature sequence of the zinc metalloprotease family, a second short stretch of strictly conserved amino acids  was noticed, egcls, the cysteine of which corresponds to the third zinc ligand. the study of site-directed mutants of the e. coli deformylase shows that the residues of this stretch are crucial for the structure and/or catalytic efficiency of the active enzyme. both aforementioned sequences were used as markers of the peptide deformylase family in protein sequence databases. seven sequences coming from haemophilus influenzae, lactococcus lactis, bacillus stearothermophilus, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, bacillus subtilus and synechocystis sp. could be identified. the characterization of the product of the open reading frame from b. stearothermophilus confirmed that it actually corresponded to a peptide deformylase with properties similar to those of the e. coli enzyme. alignment of the nine peptide deformylase sequences showed that, in addition to the two above sequences, only a third one, gxgxaaxq, is strictly conserved. this motif is also located in the active site according to the three-dimensional structure of the e. coli enzyme. site-directed variants of  e. coli peptide deformylase showed the involvement of the corresponding residues  for maintaining an active and stable enzyme. altogether, these data allow us to propose that the three identified conserved motifs of peptide deformylases build  up the active site around a metal ion. finally, an analysis of the location of the other conserved residues, in particular of the hydrophobic ones, was performed using the three-dimensional model of the e. coli enzyme. this enables us to suggest that all bacterial peptide deformylases adopt a constant overall tertiary structure.

TI  == molecular characterization of the plasmid-encoded eps gene cluster essential for  exopolysaccharide biosynthesis in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == lactococcus lactis strain nizo b40 produces an extracellular phosphopolysaccharide containing galactose, glucose, and rhamnose. a 40 kb plasmid encoding exopolysaccharide production was isolated through conjugal transfer of total plasmid dna from strain nizo b40 to the plasmid-free l. lactis  model strain mg1614 and subsequent plasmid curing. a 12 kb region containing 14 genes with the order epsrxabcdefghijkl was identified downstream of an iso-is982  element. the predicted gene products of epsabcdefghijk show sequence homologies with gene products involved in exopolysaccharide, capsular polysaccharide, lipopolysaccharide, or teichoic acid biosynthesis of other bacteria. transcriptional analysis of the eps gene cluster revealed that the gene cluster is transcribed as a single 12 kb mrna. the transcription start site of the promoter was mapped upstream of the first gene epsr. the involvement of epsd in exopolysaccharide (eps) biosynthesis was demonstrated through a single gene disruption rendering an exopolysaccharide-deficient phenotype. heterologous expression of epsd in escherichia coli showed that its gene product is a glucosyltransferase linking the first sugar of the repeating unit to the lipid carrier.

TI  == a survey of polypeptide deformylase function throughout the eubacterial lineage.
AB  == n-terminal formylation of ribosome-synthesized polypeptides is assumed to be among the most conserved features that distinguish the eubacterial line of descent from other living phyla. in order to assess the ancientness of this trait, def genes encoding polypeptide deformylase were characterized from four eubacterial species, lactococcus lactis, bacillus subtilis, calothrix pcc7601 and thermotoga maritima, taking advantage of the conditional viability of the def mutants of escherichia coli. altogether, eight sequences of polypeptide deformylase have been obtained from all the eubacterial sources which were investigated, either through systematic genome sequence analysis or through genetic screening, yielding a highly homologous family. a gene putatively encoding met-trnai formyltransferase, fmt, was found downstream of the deformylase gene except in l. lactis, mycoplasma genitalium, calothrix pcc7601 and t. maritima. these results argue strongly for the ancestral character of n-terminal formylation in eubacteria. most of the wide deviations of amino acid usage observed in def- and fmt-encoded proteins among species is best accounted for by the nucleotide composition of genomes. furthermore, the species of origin  of each protein appears to be more recognizable than its function, considering only its amino acid composition.

TI  == double-glycine-type leader peptides direct secretion of bacteriocins by abc transporters: colicin v secretion in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == many non-lantibiotic bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria are produced as precursors which have n-terminal leader peptides that share similarities in amino acid sequence and contain a conserved processing site of two glycine residues in  positions -1 and -2. a dedicated atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of the leader peptides and subsequent translocation of the bacteriocins across the cytoplasmic membrane. to investigate the role that these leader peptides play in the recognition of the precursor by the abc transporters, the leader peptides of leucocin a, lactococcin a or colicin v were fused to divergicin a, a bacteriocin from carnobacterium divergens that is secreted via the cell's general secretion pathway. production of divergicin was monitored when these fusion constructs were introduced into leuconostoc gelidum,  lactococcus lactis and escherichia coli, which carry the secretion apparatus for  leucocin a, lactococcins a and b, and colicin v, respectively. the different leader peptides directed the production of divergicin in the homologous hosts. in some cases production of divergicin was also observed when the leader peptides were used in heterologous hosts. for abc-transporter-dependent secretion in e. coli the outer membrane protein tolc was required. using this strategy, colicin v was produced in l. lactis by fusing this bacteriocin behind the leader peptide of leucocin a.

TI  == a c-methyltransferase involved in both ubiquinone and menaquinone biosynthesis: isolation and identification of the escherichia coli ubie gene.
AB  == strains of escherichia coli with mutations in the ubie gene are not able to catalyze the carbon methylation reaction in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone (coenzyme q) and menaquinone (vitamin k2), essential isoprenoid quinone components of the respiratory electron transport chain. this gene has been mapped to 86 min on the chromosome, a region where the nucleic acid sequence has recently been determined. to identify the ubie gene, we evaluated the amino acid  sequences encoded by open reading frames located in this region for the presence  of sequence motifs common to a wide variety of s-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent  methyltransferases. one open reading frame in this region (o251) was found to encode these motifs, and several lines of evidence that confirm the identity of the o251 product as ubie are presented. the transformation of a strain harboring  the ubie401 mutation with o251 on an expression plasmid restored both the growth  of this strain on succinate and its ability to synthesize both ubiquinone and menaquinone. disruption of o251 in a wild-type parental strain produced a mutant  with defects in growth on succinate and in both ubiquinone and menaquinone synthesis. dna sequence analysis of the ubie401 allele identified a missense mutation resulting in the amino acid substitution of asp for gly142. e. coli strains containing either the disruption or the point mutation in ubie accumulated 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone and demethylmenaquinone as predominant intermediates. a search of the gene databases identified ubie homologs in saccharomyces cerevisiae, caenorhabditis elegans, leishmania donovani, lactococcus lactis, and bacillus subtilis. in b. subtilis the ubie homolog is likely to be required for menaquinone biosynthesis and is located within the gerc gene cluster, known to be involved in spore germination and normal vegetative growth. the data presented identify the e. coli ubie polypeptide and provide evidence that it is required for the c methylation reactions in both ubiquinone and menaquinone biosynthesis.

TI  == the lac operon of lactobacillus casei contains lact, a gene coding for a protein  of the bg1g family of transcriptional antiterminators.
AB  == the 5' region of the lac operon of lactobacillus casei has been investigated. an  open reading frame of 293 codons, designated lact, was identified upstream of lace. the gene product encoded by lact is related to the family of transcriptional antiterminator proteins, which includes bglg from escherichia coli, arbg from erwinia chrysanthemi, sact, sacy, and lict from bacillus subtilis, and bglr from lactococcus lactis. amino acid sequence identities range  from 35 to 24%, while similarities range from 56 to 47%. the transcriptional start site of the lac operon was identified upstream of lact. the corresponding mrna would contain in the 5' region a sequence with high similarity to the consensus rna binding site of transcriptional antiterminators overlapping a sequence capable of folding into a structure that resembles a rho-independent terminator. lact was shown to be active as an antiterminator in a b. subtilis test system using the sacb target sequence. lact directly precedes lacegf, the genes coding for enzyme iicb, phospho-beta-galactosidase, and enzyme iia, and these genes are followed by a sequence that appears to encode a second rho-independent transcription terminator-like structure. northern hybridizations  with probes against lact, lace, and lacf revealed transcripts of similar sizes for the lac mrnas of several l. casei strains. since the length of the lac mrna is just sufficient to contain lactegf, we conclude that the lac operon of l. casei does not contain the genes of the accessory tagatose-6-phosphate pathway as occurs in the lac operons of lactococcus lactis, streptococcus mutans, or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == high level heterologous protein production in lactococcus and lactobacillus using a new secretion system based on the lactobacillus brevis s-layer signals.
AB  == a secretion cassette, based on the expression and secretion signals of a s-layer  protein (slpa) from lactobacillus brevis, was constructed. e. coli beta-lactamase (bla) was used as the reporter protein to determine the functionality of the s-layer signals for heterologous expression and secretion in lactococcus lactis,  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus casei using a low-copy-number plasmid derived from pgk12. in all hosts tested, the bla gene was expressed under the slpa signals and all bla activity was secreted to the culture medium. the lb. brevis s-layer promoters were very efficiently recognized in l. lactis, lb. brevis and lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. gasseri the slpa promoter region appeared to be recognized at a lower level and in lb. casei the level of transcripts was below the detection limit. the production of bla was mainly restricted to the exponential phase of growth. the highest yield of bla was obtained with l. lactis and lb. brevis. without ph control, substantial degradation of bla occurred during prolonged cultivations with all lactic acid bacteria (lab) tested. when growing l. lactis and lb. brevis under ph control, the bla activity could be stabilized also at the stationary phase. l. lactis produced up to 80 mg/l of bla which to our knowledge  represents the highest amount of a heterologous protein secreted by lab so far. the short production phase implied a very high rate of secretion with a calculated value of 5 x 10(5) bla molecules/cell per h. such a high rate was also observed with lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. brevis the competition between the wild type slpa gene and the secretion construct probably lowered the rate of bla  production. the results obtained indicate wide applicability of the lb. brevis slpa signals for efficient protein production and secretion in lab.

TI  == the crystal structure of the flavin containing enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase a from lactococcus lactis.
AB  == background: . dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (dhod) is a flavin mononucleotide containing enzyme, which catalyzes the oxidation of (s)-dihydroorotate to orotate, the fourth step in the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. lactococcus lactis contains two genes encoding different functional dhods whose sequences are only 30% identical. one of these enzymes, dhoda, is a highly efficient dimer, while the other, dhodb, shows optimal activity only in the presence of an iron-sulphur cluster containing protein with which it forms a complex tetramer. sequence alignments have identified three different families among the dhods: the two l. lactis enzymes belong to two of the families, whereas the enzyme from e. coli is a representative of the third. as no three-dimensional structures of dhods are currently available, we set out to determine the crystal  structure of dhoda from l. lactis. the differences between the two l. lactis enzymes make them particularly interesting for studying flavoprotein redox reactions and for identifying the differences between the enzyme families. results: . the crystal structure of dhoda has been determined to 2.0 resolution.  the enzyme is a dimer of two crystallographically independent molecules related by a non-crystallographic twofold axis. the protein folds into and alpha/beta barrel with the flavin molecule sitting between the top of the barrel and a subdomain formed by several barrel inserts. above the flavin isoalloxazine ring there is a small water filled cavity, completely buried beneath the protein surface and surrounded by many conserved residues. this cavity is proposed as the substrate-binding site. conclusions: . the crystal structure has allowed the function of many of the conserved residues in dhods to be identified: many of these are associated with binding the flavin group. important differences were identified in some of the active-site residues which vary across the distinct dhod families, implying significant mechanistic differences. the substrate cavity, although buried, is located beneath a highly conserved loop which is much less ordered than the rest of the protein and may be important in giving access to the cavity. the location of the conserved residues surrounding this cavity suggests the potential orientation of the substrate.

TI  == antitermination of transcription of catabolic operons.
AB  == antitermination of transcription mediated by proteins interacting with mrna sequences is described for nine operons/regulons. eight of the systems are catabolic, while the ninth, the klebsiella pneumoniae nas regulon, is involved in the assimilation of nitrate and nitrite. six of the catabolic operons/regulons are found in bacillus subtilis, one is found in escherichia coli, and one in pseudomonas aeruginosa. the antitermination system of five of the operons/regulons (e. coli blg, and sacpa, sacb, bgl, and lic from b. subtilis) are assigned to the bgl-sac family on the basis of extensive similarities with regard to antiterminator proteins and the sequences of the antiterminators. other members of the bgl-sac family are the arb operon of erwinia chrysanthemi and a presumed bgl operon of lactococcus lactis. the antitermination systems of the other four operons/regulons (b. subtilis glp, b. subtilis hut, p. aeruginosa ami, and k. pneumoniae nas) seem to be unrelated both to the bgl-sac family and to each other. the antiterminator protein of the b. subtilis glp regulon has been found not only to cause antitermination but also to stabilize the resultant mrna  and to mediate glucose repression. if other antiterminator proteins, and antitermination factors, also prove to have additional functions, it will broaden the impact of antitermination as a means of controlling gene expression.

TI  == the b form of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from lactococcus lactis consists of two different subunits, encoded by the pyrdb and pyrk genes, and contains fmn, fad, and [fes] redox centers.
AB  == the b form of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from lactococcus lactis (dhodehase b)  is encoded by the pyrdb gene. however, recent genetic evidence has revealed that  a co-transcribed gene, pyrk, is needed to achieve the proper physiological function of the enzyme. we have purified dhodehase b from two strains of escherichia coli, which harbored either the pyrdb gene or both the pyrdb and the  pyrk genes of l. lactis on multicopy plasmids. the enzyme encoded by pyrdb alone  (herein called the delta-enzyme) was a bright yellow, dimeric protein that contained one molecule of tightly bound fmn per subunit. the delta-enzyme exhibited dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity with dichloroindophenol, potassium hexacyanoferrate(iii), and molecular oxygen as electron acceptors but could not use nad+. the dhodehase b purified from the e. coli strain that carried both the pyrdb and pyrk genes on a multicopy plasmid (herein called the deltakappa-enzyme) was quite different, since it was formed as a complex of equal amounts of the two polypeptides, i.e. two pyrdb and two pyrk subunits. the deltakappa-enzyme was orange-brown and contained 2 mol of fad, 2 mol of fmn, and  2 mol of [2fe-2s] redox clusters per mol of native protein as tightly bound prosthetic groups. the deltakappa-enzyme was able to use nad+ as well as dichloroindophenol, potassium hexacyanoferrate(iii), and to some extent molecular oxygen as electron acceptors for the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate, and it was a considerably more efficient catalyst than the purified delta-enzyme. based on these results and on analysis of published sequences, we propose that the architecture of the deltakappa-enzyme is representative for the dihydroorotate dehydrogenases from gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == membrane topology of the sodium ion-dependent citrate carrier of klebsiella pneumoniae. evidence for a new structural class of secondary transporters.
AB  == the predicted secondary structure model of the sodium ion-dependent citrate carrier of klebsiella pneumoniae (cits) presents the 12-transmembrane helix motif observed for many secondary transporters. biochemical evidence presented in this  paper is not consistent with this model. n-terminal and c-terminal fusions of cits with the biotin acceptor domain of the oxaloacetate decarboxylase of k. pneumoniae catalyze citrate transport, showing the correct folding of the cits part of the fusion proteins in the membrane. proteolysis experiments with these fusion proteins revealed that the n terminus of cits is located in the cytoplasm, while the c terminus faces the periplasm. the membrane topology was studied further by constructing a set of 20 different fusions of n-terminal fragments of  the citrate transporter with the reporter enzyme alkaline phosphatase (cits-phoa  fusions). most fusion points were selected in hydrophilic areas flanking the putative transmembrane-spanning domains in cits that are predicted from the hydropathy profile of the primary sequence. the alkaline phosphatase activities of cells expressing the cits-phoa fusions suggest that the polypeptide traverses  the membrane nine times and that the c-terminal half of the protein is characterized by two large hydrophobic periplasmic loops and two large hydrophilic cytoplasmic loops. cits belongs to the family of the 2-hydroxycarboxylate transporters in which also the citrate carriers, citps, of lactic acid bacteria and the malate transporter, mlep, of lactococcus lactis are  found. since the hydrophobicity profile of cits is very similar to the hydrophobicity profiles of citp and mlep, it is most likely that the new structural motif of nine transmembrane segments is shared within this new transporter family.

AB  == the replication origin region, ori, of the lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis plasmid pci305 contains three-and-one-half directly repeated 22-bp sequences and  two inverted repeat sequences, ir1 and ir2. these inverted repeat sequences overlap the promoter of the repb gene, which encodes a protein (repb) essential for plasmid replication. gel retardation assays, using lactococcal crude cell extracts in which repb was overproduced, were used to demonstrate that the replication protein interacts with dna sequences within the origin region. ir1 was identified as a repb binding site. the -35 region of the repb promoter is contained within the loop of the potential stem-loop structure of ir1, suggesting autoregulation of repb. the pci305 repb failed to interact with dna sequences within the minimal replicons of nine other members of the pci305 family of plasmids and it was concluded that this dna-protein interaction was replicon specific. in vivo studies were performed to determine the role of the three-and-one-half copies of the 22-bp sequences. when this sequence was provided in trans on a compatible vector, it resulted in the loss of pci305 from the cell  population (incompatibility).

AB  == three genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of pyrimidines have been found to constitute an operon in lactococcus lactis. two of the genes are the well-known pyr genes pyrdb and pyrf, encoding dihydroorotate dehydrogenase and orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase, respectively. the third gene encodes a protein which was shown to be necessary for the activity of the pyrdb-encoded dihydroorotate dehydrogenase; we propose to name the gene pyrk. the pyrk-encoded  protein is homologous to a number of proteins which are involved in electron transfer. the lactococcal pyrkdbf operon is highly homologous to the corresponding part of the much-larger pyr operon of bacillus subtilis. orf2, the  pyrk homolog in b. subtilis, has also been shown to be necessary for pyrimidine biosynthesis (a. e. kahler and r. l. switzer, j. bacteriol. 178:5013-5016, 1996). four genes adjacent to the operon, i.e., orfe, orfa, orfc, and gidb, were also sequenced. three of these were excluded as members of the pyr operon by insertional analysis (orfa) or by their opposite direction of transcription (orfe and gidb). orfc, however, seems to be the distal gene in the pyrkdbf-orfc operon.

TI  == splicing of a group ii intron in a functional transfer gene of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a chromosomally located sex factor that controls conjugation in lactococcus lactis 712 has been cloned and sequenced, leading to the discovery of an open reading frame with homology to the maturases of group ii self-splicing introns. reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification was used to demonstrate that the intron was spliced out of mrna in vivo, and sequence analysis revealed the site of splicing. the intron was inserted within a sex-factor gene which encodes a protein with homology to proteins involved in rolling-circle dna replication. gene-disruption experiments were used to demonstrate that this moba gene was essential for sex-factor transfer and this suggests that intron splicing is a necessary part of the conjugation process. the sequence of the intron was modelled to produce a secondary structure that exhibited several features characteristic of the iia subgroup. here we report the characterization of a new group ii intron in the gram-positive bacterium l. lactis and demonstrate for the first time in bacteria both splicing in vivo and an active role for the gene carrying the intron.

TI  == functional analysis of promoters in the nisin gene cluster of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the promoters in the nisin gene cluster nisabtciprkfeg of lactococcus lactis were characterized by primer extension and transcriptional fusions to the escherichia  coli promoterless beta-glucuronidase gene (gusa). three promoters preceding the nisa, nisr, and nisf genes, which all give rise to gusa expression in the nisin-producing strain l. lactis nz9700, were identified. the transcriptional autoregulation of nisa by signal transduction involving the sensor histidine kinase nisk and the response regulator nisr has been demonstrated previously (0.  p. kuipers, m. m. beerthuyzen, p. g. g. a. de ruyter, e. j. luesink, and w. m. de vos, j. biol. chem. 270: 27299-27304, 1995), and therefore the possible nisin-dependent expression of gusa under control of the nisr and nisf promoters was also investigated. the nisr promoter was shown to direct nisin-independent gusa expression in l. lactis mg 1363, which is a nisin-transposon- and plasmid-free strain. l. lactis nz9800, which does not produce nisin because of a  deletion in the nisa gene, containing the nisf-gusa fusion plasmid, gave rise to  beta-glucuronidase production only after induction by nisin. a similar regulation was found in l. lactis nz3900, which contains a single copy of the nisr and nisk  genes but no other genes of the nisin gene cluster. in contrast, when the nisk gene was disrupted, no beta-glucuronidase activity directed by the nisf promoter  could be detected even after induction with nisin. these results show that, like  the nisa promoter, the nisf promoter is nisin inducible. the nisf and nisa promoter sequences have significant similarities and contain a conserved region that could be important for transcriptional control.

AB  == monoclonal antibodies against peptidases of lactococcus lactis were isolated and  characterized: pepn1-4 against a lysyl aminopeptidase pepn, pept1-5 against a tripeptidase pept and pepd1-3 against a dipeptidase pepd. these monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with their respective antigens in crude cell extracts of lc. lactis subspp. cremoris and lactis. a number of monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with proteins of other (lactic acid) bacteria. pept1, 2, 4 and 5 cross reacted weakly with a 35 kda protein in lactobacillus delbrueckii,  while pept1 and pept2 reacted with proteins in the cell-free extract of streptococcus thermophilus and clostridium fervidus. of the four isolated monoclonal antibodies against pepn, only pepn3 cross reacted weakly with a 90 kda protein in escherichia coli cell-free extract, and the other three antibody species against pepn3 cross reacted with 80 kda proteins of lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii, and str. bovis, but not of esch. coli. of the three monoclonal antibodies against pepd, only pepd1 and pepd2 cross reacted with 40 kda proteins  of lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii and str. bovis. all pepn, pepd and pept antibodies  reacted with components in cell-free extracts of eleven different lc. lactis strains, indicating that the peptidases of these strains were very similar to those of lc. lactis subsp. cremoris wg2. however, lc. lactis subsp. hordniae appeared to differ from the other lc. lactis subspecies since only pept1, 2 and 5 reacted with a protein in the cell-free extract. immunogold labelling of lc. lactis wg2 with the isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that pepn, pepd and pept were located intracellularly. the intracellular location of these peptidases is discussed in relation to the supply of essential amino acids and peptides.

TI  == the ribonucleotide reductase system of lactococcus lactis. characterization of an nrdef enzyme and a new electron transport protein.
AB  == escherichia coli contains the genetic information for three separate ribonucleotide reductases. two of them (class i enzymes), coded by the nrdab and  nrdef genes, respectively, contain a tyrosyl radical, whose generation requires oxygen. the nrdab enzyme is physiologically active. the function of the nrdef gene is not known. the third enzyme (class iii), coded by nrddg, operates during  anaerobiosis. the dna of lactococcus lactis contains sequences homologous to the  nrddg genes. surprisingly, an nrdd- mutant of l. lactis grew well under standard  anaerobic growth conditions. the ribonucleotide reductase system of this mutant was shown to consist of an enzyme of the nrdef-type and a small electron transport protein. the coding operon contains the nrdef genes and two open reading frames, one of which (nrdh) codes for the small protein. the same gene organization is present in e. coli. we propose that the aerobic class i ribonucleotide reductases contain two subclasses, one coded by nrdab, active in e. coli and eukaryotes (class ia), the other coded by nrdef, present in various microorganisms (class ib). the nrdef enzymes use nrdh proteins as electron transporter in place of thioredoxin or glutaredoxin used by nrdab enzymes. the two classes also differ in their allosteric regulation by datp.

TI  == an origin of dna replication from lactococcus lactis bacteriophage c2.
AB  == an origin of dna relication was identified in the intergenic region between the early and late gene regions of prolate lactococcal phage c2. a dna fragment containing this origin, designated ori, was shown to direct dna replication in lactococcus lactis but not in escherichia coli. a comparison of ori with the corresponding regions of other prolate phages revealed strict conservation of the nucleotide sequence in one half of this intergenic region. this conserved region  alone would not support dna replication. no open reading frames were identified in the ori fragment, suggesting that host factors alone are sufficient to initiate dna replication at ori. a novel class of lactococcal vectors and e. coli-l. lactis shuttle vectors based on ori have been constructed.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the genes encoding the malolactic enzyme and the  malate permease of leuconostoc oenos.
AB  == using degenerated primers from conserved regions of the protein sequences of malic enzymes, we amplified a 324-bp dna fragment by pcr from leuconostoc oenos and used this fragment as a probe for screening a leuconostoc oenos genomic bank. of the 2,990 clones in the genomic bank examined, 7 with overlapping fragments were isolated by performing colony hybridization experiments. sequencing 3,453 bp from overlapping fragments revealed two open reading frames that were 1,623 and 942 nucleotides long and were followed by a putative terminator structure. the first deduced protein (molecular weight, 59,118) is very similar (level of similarity, 66%) to the malolactic enzyme of lactococcus lactis; as in several malic enzymes, highly conserved protein regions are present. the synthesis of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kda was highlighted by the results  of labelling experiments performed with escherichia coli minicells. the gene was  expressed in e. coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae and conferred "malolactic activity" to these species. the second open reading frame encodes a putative 34,190-da protein which has the characteristics of a carrier protein and may have 10 membrane-spanning segments organized around a central hydrophilic core. energy-dependent l-[14c]malate transport was observed with e. coli dicarboxylic acid transport-deficient mutants carrying the malate permease-expressing vector.  our results suggest that in leuconostoc oenos the genes that encode the malolactic enzyme and a malate carrier protein are organized in a cluster.

TI  == transcriptional activation of the citrate permease p gene of lactococcus lactis biovar diacetylactis by an insertion sequence-like element present in plasmid pcit264.
AB  == the lactococcal plasmid pcit264 contains a cluster of three genes (citq, citr and citp) involved in the transport of citrate in lactococcus lactis biovar diacetylactis. the cit cluster contains a copy of a newly discovered insertion sequence (is)-like element located between its promoter p1 and the first gene of  the cluster. in this report, we show that this is-like element can act as a mobile switch for the downstream genes, creating two new transcriptional promoters named p2 and p2'. the p2 promoter is recognized by the lactococcal rna  polymerase in vivo. this is a hybrid promoter composed of a -35 region reading outwards 12bp from the right end of the is-like element, and a nucleotide sequence from the recipient plasmid, adjacent to the element, which provides an appropriately spaced -10 region. transcription of the citqrp cluster from this promoter takes place during the exponential and stationary phases of growth in l. lactis. promoter p2' is included in the is-like element and is the only promoter  responsible for expression of citp in e. coli. thus, it appears that the introduction of this element into pcit264 allows expression of the citqrp cluster in e. coli, and increases its levels of expression in l. lactis.

TI  == food-grade cloning and expression system for lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a versatile set of cloning and expression vectors has been developed for application in self-cloning and other genetic modifications of lactococcus lactis. the expression vectors were equipped with the controlled and strong laca  promoter of the lactococcal lactose operon. in addition, the transcriptional terminator of the aminopeptidase n gene, pepn, was inserted, which in some cases  increased the genetic stabilities of the vectors and the cloned dna. the small, 0.3-kb lacf gene encoding the soluble carrier enzyme iialac was used as a dominant selection marker in the plasmid-free l. lactis strain nz3000 carrying an in-frame deletion of the chromosomal lacf gene. lactose-utilizing transformants were easily selected on lactose indicator plates at high frequencies and showed a copy number of approximately 50 plasmids per cell. all vectors were stably maintained in the lacf strain nz3000 when grown on lactose, and only the high-level expression vectors showed some instability when their host was grown on glucose-containing medium. the application potentials of the expression vectors carrying the lacf marker were determined by cloning of the promoterless escherichia coli gusa reporter gene under control of the laca promoter followed by analysis of its expression. while in one of the vectors this resulted in a promoter-down mutation in the -10 region of the laca promoter, in other vectors high-level and controlled expression of the gusa gene was observed.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and analysis of pwc1, a pc194-type rolling circle replicon in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a 2.8-kb cryptic plasmid showing no homology to either pfx3 (rolling circle, pe194-type) or pci305 (theta-type) lactococcal replicons was identified in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. the plasmid, pwc1, was compatible with both pci3340 (a pci305 derivative) and pfx3 in l. lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. sequence analysis of pwc1 showed one major orf encoding a protein with a deduced  size of 316 amino acids (aa). database comparisons showed that the protein was distinct from the pfx- and pci-type replication proteins (less than 21% aa identity), but shared significant homology (up to 57% aa identity) with the replication proteins from a different group of rolling circle plasmids (pc194-type) commonly found in gram-positive bacteria. a pc194-type rolling circle plasmid has not been previously described in l. lactis. further sequence analysis showed a conserved double-stranded origin of replication in pwc1 preceded by a large (118-bp) direct repeat. the chloramphenicol-resistance gene from pc194 was inserted into a nonessential region of pwc1 to give pcp12. the host range of pcp12 included streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus, but not escherichia coli. both pcp12 and to a lesser extent pwc1 generated single-stranded dna (ssdna) in l. lactis. a possible single-stranded origin of replication was identified by sequence analysis of pwc1 and by comparing levels of ssdna produced by pcp12 deletion derivatives. the pwc1 replicon may be a useful addition to other replicons currently available for vector construction.

TI  == identical transcriptional control of the divergently transcribed prtp and prtm genes that are required for proteinase production in lactococcus lactis sk11.
AB  == we have investigated transcriptional regulation of the divergently transcribed genes required for proteinase production (prtp and prtm) of lactococcus lactis sk11. their promoters partially overlap and are arranged in a face-to-face configuration. the medium-dependent activities of both prtp and prtm promoters were analyzed by quantitative primer extension studies and beta-glucuronidase assays with l. lactis mg1363 cells harboring transcriptional gene fusions of each promoter with the promoterless beta-glucuronidase gene (gusa) from escherichia coli. high-level production of prtp- or prtm-specific mrnas was found after the growth of cells in media with low peptide concentrations, while increases in peptide concentrations resulted in an approximately eightfold decrease in mrna production. furthermore, prtp and prtm promoters exhibited similar efficiencies under different growth conditions. deletion analysis of the prt promoter region showed that all the information needed for full activity and regulation of the prtp and prtm promoters is retained within a 90-bp region which includes both transcription initiation sites. an inverted repeat sequence positioned around the prtp and prtm transcription initiation sites was disrupted by either deletion or  insertion of a small dna sequence to analyze their effects on the activities of both prtp and prtm promoters. the mutations affected the activities of these promoters only marginally at low peptide concentrations but resulted in 1.5- to 5-fold derepression at high peptide concentrations. these results indicate that the expression of both prtm and prtp genes is controlled in an identical manner via a control mechanism capable of repressing transcription initiation at high peptide concentrations.

TI  == nisin z, mutant nisin z and lacticin 481 interactions with anionic lipids correlate with antimicrobial activity. a monolayer study.
AB  == monomolecular layers of lipids at the air/water interface have been used as a model membrane to study membrane interactions of the lantibiotic nisin. the natural lantibiotics nisin a and nisin z proved to have a high affinity for the anionic lipids phosphatidylglycerol and bis(phosphatidyl)glycerol (cardiolipin).  the interaction with zwitterionic phopholipids or neutral lipids is very low at surface pressures higher than 32 mn/m. nisin, nisin mutants and lacticin 481 show a remarkable correlation between anti-microbial activity and anionic lipid interaction. the results indicate that primarily the n-terminal part (residues 1-22) penetrates into the lipid phase. reduction of the flexibility at positions  20-21 has a negative effect on monolayer interaction and activity. the c-terminal part is probably responsible for ionic interactions of nisin in monomeric or oligomeric form with anionic lipids. in mixtures of anionic and zwitterionic lipids maximal interactions are found at approximately 70 mol/100 mol anionic lipid. gram-positive bacteria, which form the main target for nisin, are characterized by a high content of anionic lipids in the membrane. monolayers formed of lipid extracts of bacteria sensitive to nisin were more strongly penetrated than those of bacteria relatively insensitive to nisin.

AB  == lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned  the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.

TI  == highly bioluminescent streptococcus thermophilus strain for the detection of diary-relevant antibiotics in milk.
AB  == inefficient translational initiation is often the cause of poor foreign gene expression in gram-positive organisms. the expression of bacterial luciferase (lux) genes in streptococcus thermophilus (bioluminescence) was improved by addressing this problem in two ways; by ribosome-binding site (rbs) replacement,  and by enhancing lux rbs access by polymerase chain reaction modification either  alone or combined with translational coupling to a truncated upstream open- reading frame (orf') having its own rbs. lactococcal expression signals were employed for plasmid-based lux expression. the same constructs were used to monitor bioluminescence in lactococcus lactis, as well as two non-lactic bacterial strains, for comparison. high lux expression was achieved in all four organisms with a heterodimeric thermostable enzyme. surprisingly, where ready access to the lux rbs was predicted, translational coupling to the lactococcal orf remained a prerequisite for detectable lux expression in l. lactis. in contrast, high bioluminescence in s. thermophilus was independent of coupling. consistent with these observations, inspection of published gene sequences suggests that rbs "strength" may be a more important factor in translation in s.  thermophilus than in l. lactis. using reduced light production in highly bioluminescent s. thermophilus as an indicator of biocide presence in milk, test  times could be significantly shortened compared with a commercial test utilizing  the related non-bioluminescent strain. lux genes appear to be sensitive, exponential-phase reporters of gene activity in s. thermophilus, an organism with molecular biology and genetics that remain largely unstudied.

TI  == a system to generate chromosomal mutations in lactococcus lactis which allows fast analysis of targeted genes.
AB  == a system for generating chromosomal insertions in lactococci is described. it is  based on the conditional replication of lactococcal pwv01-derived ori+ repa- vector pori19, containing lacz alpha and the multiple cloning site of puc19. chromosomal alui fragments of lactococcus lactis were cloned in pori19 in repa+ helper strain escherichia coli ec101. the frequency of campbell-type recombinants, following introduction of this plasmid bank into l. lactis (repa-), was increased by combining the system with temperature-sensitive pwv01 derivative pve6007. transformation of l. lactis mg1363 (pve6007) with the pori19 bank of lactococcal chromosomal fragments at the permissive temperature allowed replication of several copies of a recombinant plasmid from the bank within a cell because of the provision in trans of repa-ts from pve6007. a temperature shift to 37 degrees c resulted in loss of pve6007 and integration of the pori19 derivatives at high frequencies. a bank of lactococcal mutants was made in this way and successfully screened for the presence of two mutations: one in the monocistronic 1.3-kb peptidoglycan hydrolase gene (acma) and one in the hitherto  uncharacterized maltose fermentation pathway. reintroduction of pve6007 into the  mal- mutant at 30 degrees c resulted in excision of the integrated plasmid and restoration of the ability of ferment maltose. the integration plasmid (pmal) was rescued by using the isolated plasmid content of a restored mal+ colony to transform e. coli ec101. nucleotide sequencing of the 564-bp chromosomal fragment in pmal revealed an internal part of an open reading frame of which the translated product showed significant homology with atp-binding proteins malk of  e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and enterobacter aerogenes and msmk of streptococcus mutans. this combined use of two types of conditional replicating pwv01-derived vectors represents a novel, powerful tool for chromosomal gene inactivation, targeting, cloning, and sequencing of the labelled gene.

AB  == a 22-kb segment of chromosomal dna from enterococcus faecalis og1rf containing the pyrimidine biosynthesis genes pyrc and pyrd was previously detected as complementing escherichia coli pyrc and pyrd mutations. in the present study, it  was found that the e. faecalis pyrimidine biosynthetic genes in this clone (designated pkv48) are part of a larger cluster resembling that seen in bacillus  spp. transposon insertions were isolated at a number of sites throughout the cluster and resulted in loss of the ability to complement e. coli auxotrophs. the dna sequences of the entire pyrd gene of e. faecalis and selected parts of the rest of the cluster were determined, and computer analyses found these to be similar to genes from bacillus subtilis and bacillus caldolyticus pyrimidine biosynthesis operons. five of the transposon insertions were introduced back into the e. faecalis chromosome, and all except insertions in pyrd resulted in pyrimidine auxotrophy. the prototrophy of pyrd knockouts was observed for two different insertions and suggests that e. faecalis is similar to lactococcus lactis, which has been shown to possess two pyrd genes. a similar analysis was performed with the purl gene from e. faecalis, contained in another cosmid clone, and purine auxotrophs were isolated. in addition, a pool of random transposon insertions in pkv48, isolated in e. coli, was introduced into the e. faecalis chromosome en masse, and an auxotroph was obtained. these results demonstrate a new methodology for constructing defined knockout mutations in e. faecalis.

TI  == an archaeal gene upstream of grpe different from eubacterial counterparts.
AB  == in some eubacteria with a dnak locus in which grpe is close upstream of dnak, grpe is preceded by an open reading frame (orf) believed to be a heat-shock gene. we also found an orf, orf16, upstream of grpe in the archaeon methanosarcina mazei s-6, but this gene differs from the eubacterial counterpart: it is shorter, does not respond to a temperature upshift as heat-shock genes do, and the deduced protein orf16, does not resemble the proteins coded by the eubacterial equivalents. orf16 is expressed monocistronically, with a transcription initiation site 24 bases upstream of the translation start codon, 22 bases downstream of a putative promoter identical to the consensus promoter for genes in methanogens. this initiation site is used by heat-shocked and non-heat-shocked cells in the two morphologic stages of m. mazei s-6 tested, i.e., packets and single cells. three transcription termination sites were identified, one of which is detectable only in non-heat-shocked cells. data from comparative analyses of the orf16 deduced amino acid sequence and those of other known proteins, as well  as the apparent biochemical characteristics of orf16, suggest that the latter is  a membrane molecule.

TI  == the isolation of lactococcal promoters and their use in investigating bacterial luciferase synthesis in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == 18 different promoter elements, encompassing a 71-fold range of activity, were isolated from the chromosome of lactococcus lactis (ll) mg1363 and from an uncharacterised small isometric bacteriophage of ll. the vibrio fischeri (vf) luciferase-encoding gene (lux) was used as a reporter in ll, so that the promoters could be identified strictly on the basis of their activity in the homologous host. sequence and primer extension analysis of six of the promoters has provided a new consensus sequence for the -35 and -10 hexanucleotide motifs present upstream from lactococcal transcription start points. when the nucleotide sequence of the most active promoter (p15) was compared with that of the highly expressed ll usp45 gene, a novel 8-bp region of homology was identified which corresponded to the newly derived consensus -35 sequence element; this element may therefore be of general importance in ll gene expression. the isolation of these promoters has also enabled us to investigate the characteristics of the vf  lux activity in ll under different physiological conditions using promoters of different strengths. lux activity in ll is critically dependent upon the phase of cell growth. luminescence falls sharply in stationary phase, possibly due to a lack of fmnh2. in contrast to the kinetics of lux function in escherichia coli (ec), lux activity in ll declines rapidly after addition of the substrate; the rate of decay is dependent both on the growth phase and on the strength of the promoter. it is apparent that the previously reported thermal instability of lux  is in fact a function of the host organism in which lux is expressed.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the lactococcal lmrp gene encodes a proton motive force-dependent drug transporter.
AB  == to genetically dissect the drug extrusion systems of lactococcus lactis, a chromosomal dna library was made in escherichia coli and recombinant strains were selected for resistance to high concentrations of ethidium bromide. recombinant strains were found to be resistant not only to ethidium bromide but also to daunomycin and tetraphenylphosphonium. the drug resistance is conferred by the lmrp gene, which encodes a hydrophobic polypeptide of 408 amino acid residues with 12 putative membrane-spanning segments. some sequence elements in this novel membrane protein share similarity to regions in the transposon tn10-encoded tetracycline resistance determinant teta, the multidrug transporter bmr from bacillus subtilis, and the bicyclomycin resistance determinant bcr from e. coli.  drug resistance associated with lmrp expression correlated with energy-dependent  extrusion of the molecules. drug extrusion was inhibited by ionophores that dissipate the proton motive force but not by the atpase inhibitor ortho-vanadate. these observations are indicative for a drug-proton antiport system. a lmrp deletion mutant was constructed via homologous recombinant using dna fragments of the flanking region of the gene. the l. lactis (delta lmrp) strain exhibited residual ethidium extrusion activity, which in contrast to the parent strain was  inhibited by ortho-vanadate. the results indicate that in the absence of the functional drug-proton anti-porter lmrp, l. lactis is able to overexpress another, atp-dependent, drug extrusion system. these findings substantiate earlier studies on the isolation and characterization of drug-resistant mutants of l. lactis (bolhuis, h., molenaar, d., poelarends, g., van veen, h. w., poolman, b., driessen, a. j. m., and konings, w. n.

TI  == structural and functional analysis of the single-strand origin of replication from the lactococcal plasmid pwv01.
AB  == the single-strand origin (sso) of the rolling-circle (rc), broad-host-range lactococcal plasmid pwvo1 was functionally characterized. the activity of this sso in the conversion of single-stranded dna to double-stranded dna was tested both in vivo and in vitro. in addition, the effect of this sso on plasmid maintenance was determined. the functional pwvo1 sso comprises a 250 bp region, containing two inverted repeats (irs). the activity of each ir was tested, separately and in combination, in a plasmid derivative that was otherwise completely devoid of structures that might function as sso. one of the irs (ir i) showed some homology with other previously described ssos of the ssoa type, as well as with the conversion signal of the escherichia coli phage phi x174. this ir was shown to have a partial, rna polymerase-independent activity in complementary strand synthesis, both in vivo and in vitro. the second ir, which had no activity of its own, was required for full sso activity, both in vivo and  in vitro. the conversion of single-stranded dna to the double-stranded form by the complete sso was only partly sensitive to inhibition by rifampicin, indicating the existence of an rna polymerase-independent pathway for this event. the results suggest that the pwvo1 sso can be activated by two different routes:  an rna polymerase-dependent one (requiring the entire sso), and an rna polymerase-independent one (requiring only ir i).

AB  == degenerate pcr primers were designed from the n-terminal amino acid sequence of a glutamyl aminopeptidase (pepa) from lactococcus lactis. these primers were used to screen a lambda library for clones containing the gene (pepa) encoding pepa. the dna sequence of a 2.1 kb fragment containing pepa was determined. the sequence revealed the presence of one complete and two incomplete open reading frames (orfs). the complete orf encodes a putative protein of 353 amino acids with a predicted n-terminal sequence identical to that determined for purified pepa. the pepa gene was subcloned on an escherichia coli plasmid vector and production of active pepa was confirmed by means of a zymogram. mutants of l. lactis in which the pepa gene was inactivated grew to normal cell densities in milk but exhibited a reduced growth rate during the exponential phase. thus whilst pepa is required for optimal growth it is not essential.

TI  == the reca gene of lactococcus lactis: characterization and involvement in oxidative and thermal stress.
AB  == the role of reca in lactococcus lactis, a microaerophilic fermenting organism, was examined by constructing a reca-disrupted strain. this single alteration had  a surprisingly pleiotropic effect. in addition to its roles in homologous recombination and dna repair, reca is also involved in responses to oxygen and heat stresses. we found that oxygen stress induced by aeration causes reductions  in growth and stationary-phase survival of the reca strain. toxicity is a consequence of hydroxyl radical production via the fenton reaction and is alleviated by catalase or ferrozine addition. these results suggest that oxygen radicals are not efficiently eliminated and accumulate in lactococcal cultures, and that reca is needed to deal with the damage they incur. unexpectedly, thermal stress arrested growth of the reca strain. immunological data indicate that the reca mutant is deficient in heat-shock proteins dnak, groel, and grpe. poor growth at elevated temperature is therefore due to a diminished heat-shock response in the reca strain. in contrast, levels of a novel heat-shock protein, hfib, are elevated. in escherichia coli, hfib downregulates the heat-shock response by promoting degradation of the transcription factor sigma 32. we propose that reca regulates the heat-shock response via hfib. this work provides  the first evidence showing that two major pathways of stress response, induced by heat shock and dna damage, are interactive.

TI  == stress response in lactococcus lactis: cloning, expression analysis, and mutation of the lactococcal superoxide dismutase gene.
AB  == in an analysis of the stress response of lactococcus lactis, three proteins that  were induced under low ph culture conditions were detected. one of these was identified as the lactococcal superoxide dismutase (soda) by n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. the gene encoding this protein, designated soda, was cloned by the complementation of a soda sodb escherichia coli strain. the deduced amino acid sequence of l. lactis soda showed the highest degree of similarity to  the manganese-containing sod (mnsod) of bacillus stearothermophilus. a promoter upstream of the soda gene was identified by primer extension analysis, and an inverted repeat surrounding the -35 hexanucleotide of this promoter is possibly involved in the regulation of the expression of soda. the expression of soda was  analyzed by transcriptional fusions with a promoterless lacz gene. the induction  of beta-galactosidase activity occurred in aerated cultures. deletion experiments revealed that a dna fragment of more than 130 bp surrounding the promoter was needed for the induction of lacz expression by aeration. the growth rate of an insertion mutant of soda did not differ from that of the wild type in standing cultures but was decreased in aerated cultures.

TI  == expression of foreign genes and selection of promoter sequences in acholeplasma laidlawii.
AB  == the stable maintenance and expression of foreign genes in mollicutes (mycoplasmas) have been difficult to achieve due to the lack of suitable vectors. in this paper we show for the first time that a replicating vector can been used  to express foreign genes other than antibiotic resistance genes in acholeplasma laidlawii. plasmids derived from the lactococcal vector pnz18 could introduce and maintain four different genes for many generations in a. laidlawii. one of these, encoding the dominant membrane lipoprotein spiralin from the mollicute spiroplasma citri, was expressed; however, expression was weak, the signal peptide of spiralin was not cleaved and the protein was not covalently modified by fatty acids. this resulted in a hydrophilic character of spiralin and its cytoplasmic localization in a. laidlawii. to increase the expression of foreign genes, random a. laidlawii dna fragments were cloned into a pnz18-related plasmid and expression signals were selected using the bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase gene as a probe. selection was done in escherichia coli as well as  directly in a. laidlawii. active recombinants from e. coli were also able to express alpha-amylase activities and an enzyme of native size in a. laidlawii. the highest activity was obtained from a recombinant selected directly in a. laidlawii. this is the first example of a promoter sequence selected in a mollicute. analysis of the putative promoters in seven clones revealed similar -10 and -35 regions, and similar spacer distances in a. laidlawii, acholeplasma oculi, lactococcus and e. coli. vectors related to pnz18 should be useful for the genetic analysis of specific a. laidlawii proteins and functions.

TI  == improvement of solubility and stability of the antimicrobial peptide nisin by protein engineering.
AB  == nisin is a 3.4-kda antimicrobial peptide that, as a result of posttranslational modifications, contains unsaturated amino acids and lanthionine residues. it is applied as a preservative in various food products. the solubility and stability  of nisin and nisin mutants have been studied. it is demonstrated that nisin mutants can be produced with improved functional properties. the solubility of nisin a is highest at low ph values and gradually decreases by almost 2 orders of magnitude when the ph of the solution exceeds a value of 7. at low ph, nisin z exhibits a decreased solubility relative to that of nisin a; at neutral and higher ph values, the solubilities of both variants are comparable. two mutants of nisin z, which contain lysyl residues at positions 27 and 31, respectively, instead of asn-27 and his-31, were produced with the aim of reaching higher solubility at neutral ph. both mutants were purified to homogeneity, and their structures were confirmed by one- and two-dimensional 1h nuclear magnetic resonance. their antimicrobial activities were found to be similar to that of nisin z, whereas their solubilities at ph 7 increased by factors of 4 and 7, respectively. the chemical stability of nisin a was studied in the ph range of 2  to 8 and at a 20, 37, and 75 degrees c. optimal stability was observed at ph 3.0. nisin z showed a behavior similar to that of nisin a. a mutant containing dehydrobutyrine at position 5 instead of dehydroalanine had lower activity but was significantly more resistant to acid-catalyzed chemical degradation than wild-type nisin z.

AB  == the gene gap, encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ec 1.2.1.12), was isolated from a genomic library of lactococcus lactis lm0230 dna. plasmids containing the l. lactis gene were able to complement a gap mutant of escherichia coli. the nucleotide sequence of gap predicted a polypeptide chain of 337 amino acids for the enzyme and a subunit molecular mass of 36,043. the codon usage in gap and four other glycolytic genes from l. lactis showed a high degree of bias,  when compared with 84 other chromosomal genes. northern blot analysis of total l. lactis rna showed that gap hybridized strongly with a 1.3 kb transcript. the 5' end of the transcript was determined by primer extension analysis to be a c located 35 bp upstream from the gap start codon. these transcript analyses, and the orientation of the open reading frames in the dna flanking gap, indicated that in l. lactis gap is expressed on a monocistronic transcript. nucleotide sequencing indicated that the dna adjacent to gap did not encode other glycolytic pathway enzymes. the dna sequence flanking gap contained two open reading frames  (orf156 and orf211) of unknown function. the 3' end of a clpa homologue was identified in the sequence upstream of orf156. the location of gap on the l. lactis dl11 chromosome map was determined to be between map coordinates 0.530 and 0.660.

TI  == a family of bacteriocin abc transporters carry out proteolytic processing of their substrates concomitant with export.
AB  == lantibiotic and non-lantibiotic bacteriocins are synthesized as precursor peptides containing n-terminal extensions (leader peptides) which are cleaved off during maturation. most non-lantibiotics and also some lantibiotics have leader peptides of the so-called double-glycine type. these leader peptides share consensus sequences and also a common processing site with two conserved glycine  residues in positions -1 and -2. the double-glycine-type leader peptides are unrelated to the n-terminal signal sequences which direct proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane via the sec pathway. their processing sites are also different from typical signal peptidase cleavage sites, suggesting that a different processing enzyme is involved. peptide bacteriocins are exported across the cytoplasmic membrane by a dedicated atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter. here we show that the abc transporter is the maturation protease and that its proteolytic domain resides in the n-terminal part of the protein. this result demonstrates that the abc transporter has a dual function: (i) removal of the leader peptide from its substrate, and (ii) translocation of its substrate across the cytoplasmic membrane. this represents a novel strategy for secretion of bacterial proteins.

TI  == sequence analysis, distribution and expression of an aminopeptidase n-encoding gene from lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32.
AB  == lactobacillus (lb.) helveticus cnrz32 possesses a 97-kda metalloenzyme with aminopeptidase activity (pepn; ec 3.4.11.2). a 3.8-kb fragment encoding pepn was  cloned into pil253 and designated psuw34. transformation of lactococcus (lc.) lactis lm0230 with psuw34 resulted in > 180-fold increase in general aminopeptidase (ap) activity using l-lysine-p-nitroanilide. southern hybridization was conducted to determine the distribution of homology to the cnrz32 pepn gene among lactic-acid bacteria (lab). hybridization was observed with strains of lactobacilli, pediococci, leuconostoc, streptococci and lactococci. the pepn gene was sequenced and found to encode a protein containing  844 amino acid (aa) residues. a comparison of lb. helveticus cnrz32 pepn to lb. delbrueckii ssp. lactis dsm7290 pepn indicated 69.5% nucleotide (nt) identity and 71.8% aa identity, while comparison to pepn from lc. lactis ssp. cremoris mg1363  indicated 61.1% nt identity and 49.2% aa identity. alignment of peptidase aa sequences of lab, escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian origin display homology in the zinc-binding domain, as well as a conserved region upstream from the putative active site.

TI  == a 7-base-pair sequence protects dna from exonucleolytic degradation in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == linear dna molecules are subject to degradation by various exonucleases in vivo unless their ends are protected. it has been demonstrated that a specific 8-bp sequence, 5'-gctggtgg-3', named chi, can protect linear double-stranded dna from  the major escherichia coli exonuclease recbcd. chi protects linear replication products of rolling-circle plasmids from recbcd degradation in vivo, in agreement with observations in vitro. a unique 7-bp sequence, 5'-gcgcgtg-3', is shown to protect similar replication products from degradation in lactococcus lactis strains but not in more distantly related gram-positive bacteria. the properties  of this sequence in l. lactis correspond to those of a chi site. linear plasmid replication products have been detected in numerous prokaryotes, suggesting the widespread existence of short species-specific sequences that preserve linear dna from extensive degradation by host cell exonucleases.

TI  == bactericidal properties of hydrogen peroxide and copper or iron-containing complex ions in relation to leukocyte function.
AB  == various combinations of hydrogen peroxide, reductant (ascorbic acid and superoxide ion), and copper or iron salts and their coordination complexes were examined to determine their cytotoxicity toward several bacteria with diverse metabolic capabilities and cell envelope structures. four sets of bactericidal conditions were identified, comprising: (1) high concentration levels (5-100 mm)  of h2o2 in the absence of exogenous metal ions and reductant; (2) ferrous or ferric coordination complexes plus enzymatically generated o2.- and h2o2 at relatively low steady-state concentration levels; (3) cupric ion plus low concentration levels of h2o2 (1 microm-1 mm) and ascorbate (10 microm-4 mm); (4)  cuprous ion (or cupric ion plus ascorbate) in the absence of o2 and h2o2. rates of losses in viabilities increased proportionately with increases in the concentration of h2o2 in metal-free environments and with each of the components  in the cu2+/ascorbate/h2o2 bactericidal assay system. oxidant levels required for equivalent killing increased with increasing cell densities of the bacterial suspensions over the range investigated (2 x 10(7)-2 x 10(9) cfu/ml). other experimental conditions or other combinations of reagents, most notably fe3+/ascorbate/h2o2 systems, did not generate bactericidal environments. the patterns of response of the three organisms tested, streptococcus lactis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were similar, suggesting common bactericidal mechanisms. however, preliminary evidence suggests that the lethal lesions caused by the various bactericidal conditions are distinct: as discussed, each of the four bactericidal conditions could conceivably be attained within the phagosomes of leukocytes, although none has as yet been identified.

TI  == molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the major peptidoglycan hydrolase of lactococcus lactis, a muramidase needed for cell separation.
AB  == a gene of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363 encoding a peptidoglycan hydrolase was identified in a genomic library of the strain in puc19 by screening escherichia coli transformants for cell wall lysis activity on a medium containing autoclaved, lyophilized micrococcus lysodeikticus cells. in cell extracts of l. lactis mg1363 and several halo-producing e. coli transformants, lytic bands of similar sizes were identified by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gels containing l. lactis or m. lysodeikticus cell walls. of these clearing bands, corresponding to the presence of lytic enzymes with sizes of 46 and 41 kda, the 41-kda band was also present in the supernatant of an l. lactis culture. deletion analysis of one of the recombinant plasmids showed that  the information specifying lytic activity was contained within a 2,428-bp ecorv-sau3a fragment. sequencing of part of this fragment revealed a gene (acma)  that could encode a polypeptide of 437 amino acid residues. the calculated molecular mass of acma (46,564 da) corresponded to that of one of the lytic activities detected. presumably, the enzyme is synthesized as a precursor protein which is processed by cleavage after the ala at position 57, thus producing a mature protein with a size of 40,264 da, which would correspond to the size of the enzyme whose lytic activity was present in culture supernatants of l. lactis. the n-terminal region of the mature protein showed 60% identity with the n-terminal region of the mature muramidase-2 of enterococcus hirae and the autolysin of streptococcus faecalis. like the latter two enzymes, acma contains c-terminal repeated regions. in acma, these three repeats are separated by nonhomologous intervening sequences highly enriched in serine, threonine, and asparagine. genes specifying identical activities were detected in various strains of l. lactis subsp. lactis and l. lactis subsp. cremoris by the sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis detection assay and pcr experiments. by replacement recombination, an acma deletion mutant which grew as long chains was  constructed, indicating that acma is required for cell separation.

TI  == genes involved in immunity to the lantibiotic nisin produced by lactococcus lactis 6f3.
AB  == the lantibiotic nisin is produced by several strains of lactococcus lactis. the complete gene cluster for nisin biosynthesis in l. lactis 6f3 comprises 15 kb of  dna. as described previously, the structural gene nisa is followed by the genes nisb, nist, nisc, nisi, nisp, nisr, and nisk. further analysis revealed three additional open reading frames, nisf, nise, and nisg, adjacent to nisk. approximately 1 kb downstream of the nisg gene, three open reading frames in the  opposite orientation have been identified. one of the reading frames, sacr, belongs to the sucrose operon, indicating that all genes belonging to the nisin gene cluster of l. lactis 6f3 have now been identified. proteins nisf and nise show strong homology to members of the family of atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters, and nisg encodes a hydrophobic protein which might act similarly to the immunity proteins described for several colicins. gene disruption mutants carrying mutations in the genes nisf, nise, and nisg were still able to produce nisin. however, in comparison with the wild-type strain, these mutants were more  sensitive to nisin. this indicates that besides nisi the newly identified genes are also involved in immunity to nisin. the nisf-nise abc transporter is homologous to an abc transporter of bacillus subtilis and the mbcf-mbce transporter of escherichia coli, which are involved in immunity to subtilin and microcin b17, respectively.

TI  == induction of thermotolerance by chemical agents in lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403.
AB  == like in other organisms tested to date, adapted cells of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 pretreated at 42 degrees c for 30 min develop a thermotolerant state, i.e. an increased ability to survive subsequent exposure to a lethal challenge temperature (52 degrees c for 15 or 30 min). in different cellular systems, chemicals as diverse as divalent metal salts, natural or synthetic compounds trigger the development of thermotolerance. yet, in l. lactis subsp. lactis il1403, among the 17 chemicals tested, only four induced this transient increased tolerance to heat: cadmium chloride, mercury chloride, sodium azide and beta-mercaptoethanol. intriguingly, none of these four compounds induced the synthesis of three major heat shock proteins (dnak, groel and hsp104-analogue), which are believed to be responsible for thermotolerance in most organisms. it is suggested that: (i) the lesions produced by these various 'proteotoxic' agents are fundamentally different from those produced by heat; (ii) heat shock protein synthesis and transient induced tolerance to heat are not tightly correlated phenomena in l. lactis subsp. lactis as they are in escherichia coli and some other organisms.

TI  == primary structure and functional analysis of the lysis genes of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phi adh.
AB  == the lysis genes of the lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phi adh were isolated  by complementation of a lambda sam mutation in escherichia coli. nucleotide sequencing of a 1,735-bp dna fragment revealed two adjacent coding regions of 342 bp (hol) and 951 bp (lys) in the same reading frame which appear to belong to a common transcriptional unit. proteins corresponding to the predicted gene products, holin (12.9 kda) and lysin (34.7 kda), were identified by in vitro and  in vivo expression of the cloned genes. the phi adh holin is a membrane-bound protein with structural similarity to lysis proteins of other phage, known to be  required for the transit of murein hydrolases through the cytoplasmic membrane. the phi adh lysin shows homology with mureinolytic enzymes encoded by the lactobacillus bulgaricus phage mv4, the streptococcus pneumoniae phage cp-1, cp-7, and cp-9, and the lactococcus lactis phage phi lc3. significant homology with the n termini of known muramidases suggests that phi adh lysin acts by a similar catalytic mechanism. in e. coli, the phi adh lysin seems to be associated with the total membrane fraction, from which it can be extracted with lauryl sarcosinate. either one of the phi adh lysis proteins provoked lysis of e. coli when expressed along with holins or lysins of phage lambda or bacillus subtilis phage phi 29. concomitant expression of the combined holin and lysin functions of phi adh in e. coli, however, did not result in efficient cell lysis.

TI  == repair of oxidative dna damage in gram-positive bacteria: the lactococcus lactis  fpg protein.
AB  == the formamidopyrimidine dna glycosylase gene (fpg-l) of the gram-positive microaerophilic bacterium lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris ml3 has been cloned, characterized and sequenced. the fpg-l gene is composed of 819 bp encoding a protein of 31.3 kda (fpg-l). the deduced amino acid sequence of the fpg-l protein shows 59% similarity and 38% identity with the escherichia coli fpg protein (fpg-e). polyclonal antibodies against fpg-e react with the fpg-l protein. the fpg-l protein was purified to apparent homogeneity from the overproducing e. coli strain bh410 hosting plasmid pve1064, which carries fpg-l under the control of the e. coli lac promoter. in its active form, fpg-l is a 30 kda monomeric enzyme  with a measured isoelectric point of 9.0. it contains one zinc per molecule and has a zinc finger motif localized at the carboxyterminal end (cys-x2-cys-x16-cys-x2-cys-x3-cooh). the fpg-l protein has two enzyme activities: dna glycosylase, which excises 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5n-methylformamidopyrimidine and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine, and dna nicking at abasic sites. furthermore, the expression of the fpg-l gene in fpg and muty mutants of e. coli suppresses their  spontaneous gc-->ta mutator phenotype. the similarity of the activity of the two  fpg proteins and its conversation in evolutionarily distant bacteria may reflect  the importance of its role in protecting bacterial dna against oxidative free radicals.

TI  == cloning and molecular analysis of the dihydrofolate reductase gene from lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the lactococcus lactis gene encoding trimethoprim resistance has been cloned and  expressed in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. several lines of evidence indicate that the cloned gene encodes dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr). (i) it fully complements the fol "null" mutation in e. coli. (ii) nucleotide sequencing  of the cloned fragment revealed the presence of one open reading frame encoding a protein that shares homology with the family of bacterial dhfr enzymes. (iii) overexpression of this open reading frame in e. coli resulted in the appearance in cell extracts of a protein of the expected size as well as in a dramatic increase of dhfr activity. in cell extracts, the dhfr activity was not inhibited  by low trimethoprim concentration. by northern (rna) blotting and primer extension analyses, the size and the start point of the dhfr transcript, respectively, have been determined. results of these experiments indicate that in l. lactis the dhfr gene represents part of a larger transcription unit.

TI  == reca gene involvement in oxidative and thermal stress in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the reca gene is best known for its effects on homologous recombination and dna repair via sos induction. there is gathering evidence that reca also affects expression of genes associated with different types of stress. we studied reca properties in lactococcus lactis by generating a reca-disrupted mutant of mg1363  and comparing it with the wild type strain. reca appears to have an important role in cell survival upon oxygen or thermal stress, in addition to its conserved role in dna repair. oxygen toxicity appears to be due to the production of hydroxyl radicals via the fenton reaction; reca would be involved in the repair of dna damage generated by these radicals. surprisingly, the reca strain stops growing at elevated temperature (37 degrees c). immunological tests indicate that amounts of three heat shock proteins are reduced in the reca strain compared to the wild type strain. in contrast, the amount of heat shock regulator hflb is markedly increased, even at low temperature. hflb is known to degrade heat shock  transcription factor sigma 32 in escherichia coli. we propose that heat shock response is reduced in the reca mutant due to overproduction of hflb.

TI  == two lactococcus lactis genes, including lacx, cooperate to trigger an sos response in a reca-negative background.
AB  == a 4.3-kb ecori fragment from a lactococcus lactis genomic library alleviates the  methyl methanesulfonate, mitomycin c, and uv sensitivities of an escherichia coli reca mutant (m. novel, x. f. huang, and g. novel, fems microbiol. lett. 72:309-314, 1990). it complements reca1 and delta reca mutations but not reca13.  three proteins (with molecular masses of 20, 35, and 23 kda) were produced from this fragment in a t7-directed system, and three corresponding genes were detected by dna sequencing, namely, iss1ch;lacx, which is the distal gene of the  lac operon; and a third open reading frame, named lacn, which encodes 211 amino acids. mutations produced in either lacx or in lacn resulted in the loss of the resistance to dna-damaging agents. thus, these two genes appeared to be involved  in this activity. introduction of pucb214 carrying the 4.3-kb fragment into a lexa+ delta reca306 sfia::lacz strain resulted in uv-inducible synthesis of beta-galactosidase. a uvra strain or a lexa (ind-) strain containing pucb214 did  not support any dna repair. however, a lexa (def-) strain carrying pucb214 could  partly repair uv damage. we discuss possible targets for lacx and lacn products,  and we speculate that lacx and lacn may constitute a two-component regulatory system that is able to respond to sos signals, and then to act in the sos response, bypassing the reca-activated function.

AB  == triosephosphate isomerase (ec 5.3.1.1) from lactococcus lactis was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. approximately 3 mg purified enzyme (specific activity 3300 u mg-1) was obtained from 70 g (wet wt) cells. in solution, triosephosphate isomerase (pi 4.0-4.4) was observed to exist as a homodimer (m(r) 57,000) of noncovalently linked subunits. the sequence of the first 37 amino acid residues from the nh2-terminus were determined by step-wise edman degradation. this sequence, and that of a region conserved in all known bacterial triosephosphate isomerases, was used to design oligonucleotide primers for the synthesis of a lactococcal tpi probe by pcr. the probe was used to isolate a molecular clone of tpi from a lambda gem11 library of l. lactis lm0230 dna. the nucleotide sequence of tpi predicted a protein of 252 amino acids with the same nh2-terminal sequence as that determined for the purified enzyme and a subunit m(r) of 26,802 after removal of the nh2-terminal methionine. escherichia coli cells harbouring a plasmid containing tpi had 15-fold higher triosephosphate isomerase activity than isogenic plasmid-free cells, confirming the identity of the cloned gene. northern analysis of l. lactis lm0230 rna showed that a 900 base transcript hybridized with tpi. the 5' end of the transcript was determined by primer extension analysis to be a g located 65 bp upstream from the tpi start codon. these transcript analyses indicated that in l. lactis, tpi is expressed on a monocistronic transcript. nucleotide sequencing indicated that the dna adjacent to tpi did not encode another embden-meyerhoff-parnas pathway enzyme. the location of tpi on the l. lactis dl11 chromosome map was determined to be between map coordinates 1.818 and 1.978.

AB  == uracil phosphoribosyltransferase catalyzes the key reaction in the salvage of uracil in many microorganisms. the gene encoding uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (upp) was cloned from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363 by complementation of an escherichia coli mutant. the gene was sequenced, and the putative amino acid sequence was deduced. the promoter was mapped by both primer  extension and analysis of beta-galactosidase expressed from strains carrying fusion between upp promoter fragments and the laclm gene. the results showed that the upp gene was expressed from its own promoter. after in vitro construction of  an internal deletion, a upp mutant was constructed by a double-crossover event. this implicated the utilization of a plasmid with a thermosensitive origin of replication and a new and easy way to screen for double crossover events in both  gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. the phenotype of the uracil phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient strain was established. surprisingly, the upp strain is resistant only to very low concentrations of 5-fluorouracil. secondary  mutants in thymidine phosphorylase and thymidine kinase were isolated by selection for resistance to high concentrations of 5-fluorouracil.

TI  == mosaic structure of large regions of the lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris chromosome.
AB  == lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris are closely related phenotypically and genetically. here we report that certain regions of their chromosomes diverge considerably more than others. conserved regions differ by less than 20%, whilst variable regions differ by more than 60%. this mosaic structure may have arisen by horizontal gene transfer from distantly  related bacteria since in a particular region of the l. lactis subsp. cremoris chromosome the g+c content and the codon bias are not typical for lactococci. such an exchange, which conserves the function of the gene and cannot be achieved under selective pressure, may be of considerable importance in the evolution of bacteria.

TI  == mode of action of lcia, the lactococcin a immunity protein.
AB  == monoclonal antibodies were raised against a fusion between the escherichia coli maltose-binding protein and lcia, the immunity protein that protects lactococcus  lactis against the effects of the bacteriocin lactococcin a. one of the antibodies directed against the lcia moiety of the fusion protein was used to locate the immunity protein in the l. lactis producer cell. lcia was present in the cytosolic, the membrane-associated, and the membrane fractions in roughly equal amounts, irrespective of the production by the cells of lactococcin a. the  monoclonal antibody specifically reacted with right-side-out vesicles obtained from a strain producing the immunity protein. it did not react with inside-out vesicles of the same strain, or with right-side-out vesicles obtained from a strain producing both lcia and lactococcin a. also, externally added lactococcin  a blocked the interaction between the antibody and right-side-out vesicles obtained from a strain producing only lcia. the epitope in lcia was localized between amino acid residues 60 and 80. as the epitope could be removed from right-side-out vesicles by proteinase k, it is located at the outside of the cell. the immunity protein contains a putative alpha-amphiphilic helix from residue 29 to 47. a model is proposed in which this helix is thought to traverse  the membrane in such a way that the c-terminal part of the protein, containing the epitope, is on the outside of the cell. vesicle-fusion studies together with  leucine-uptake experiments suggest that the immunity protein interacts with the putative receptor for lactococcin a, thus preventing pore formation by the bacteriocin.

TI  == a lactococcus lactis gene encodes a membrane protein with putative atpase activity that is homologous to the essential escherichia coli ftsh gene product.
AB  == a gene, encoding a protein homologous to an essential escherichia coli protein, ftsh, was identified adjacent to the hpt gene and the trna operon in the gram-positive bacterium lactococcus lactis. the deduced amino acid sequence of the gene product showed full-length similarity to ftsh of e. coli, yme1p of saccharomyces cerevisiae and a conserved region found in a new family of putative atpases. in-frame fusions of l. lactis ftsh and phoa1 in e. coli, and immunodetection of the l. lactis ftsh protein in cell fractions using anti-e. coli ftsh serum showed that l. lactis ftsh was expressed and encodes a membrane protein. when contained on a high copy number plasmid, the l. lactis ftsh gene complemented the lethality of a delta ftsh3::kan mutation in e. coli at 37 degrees c and below, indicating that the l. lactis ftsh gene can functionally replace the e. coli ftsh gene to some extent. the resulting e. coli strain showed temperature sensitivity and salt sensitivity. a l. lactis mutant with an insertion into ftsh was salt-, heat- and cold-sensitive. these results suggest that ftsh is somehow involved in stress responses. southern hybridization analysis indicated that genes homologous to ftsh of l. lactis were also present in bacillus subtilis, and several lactobacillus and leuconostoc species, suggesting high conservation of ftsh in bacterial species.

AB  == a nuclear gene from saccharomyces cerevisiae was cloned by genetic complementation of a temperature-sensitive respiratory-deficient mutant. dna sequence analysis reveals that it encodes a protein with homology to yme1, ftsh and tma, proteins which belong to the aaa-protein family (atpases associated with diverse cellular activities). the members of this family are involved in very different biological processes. yme1p, a yeast mitochondrial protein, affects the rate of dna escape from mitochondria to the nucleus and the escherichia coli ftsh protein is apparently involved in the post-translational processing of pbp3, a protein necessary for septation during cell division. this newly sequenced gene,  which we have designated afg3 for atpase family gene 3, encodes a putative mitochondrial protein of 760 amino acid residues that is closely related to ftsh, tma (protein from lactococcus lactis) and yme1p with 58, 55 and 46% identity respectively.

TI  == a novel approach for high level production of a recombinant human parathyroid hormone fragment in escherichia coli.
AB  == we describe a novel approach to the production in e. coli of a peptide fragment derived from the human parathyroid hormone (hpth). the first 38 amino acids of hpth were fused at the amino terminus to a derivative of the bacteriophage t4-encoded gp55 protein, and were expressed in the e. coli cytoplasm in inclusion bodies at levels exceeding 50% of the total cell protein. solubilization and subsequent incubation of the inclusion bodies in dilute hydrochloric acid facilitated the cleavage of an acid-labile aspartyl-prolyl peptide bond engineered into the fusion protein, thus releasing the hormone fragment directly  from the inclusion body preparation. the amino-terminal prolyl-prolyl dipeptide-extension was subsequently removed by treatment with lactococcus lactis dipeptidyl peptidase iv which was overexpressed in e. coli and purified to near homogeneity from the cytosol of the recombinant bacteria. in pilot-scale fermentations, more than 80 mg of pure hpth(1-38) were isolated per liter of bacterial culture, with an overall yield of 35%. this process is suitable for scale-up, is cost effective, and by employing recombinant dipeptidyl peptidase iv, should be widely and directly applicable to the manufacturing of peptides of  pharmaceutical interest.

TI  == confirmation of the existence of a third family among peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases. amino acid sequence and recombinant production of parvulin.
AB  == in addition to the major cyclophilin-like peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (ppiases) of escherichia coli an enzyme of very low relative molecular mass (10.1 kda) was discovered in this organism which gave first indication of the existence of a novel family in this enzyme class [1994, febs lett. 343, 65-69]. in the present report we describe the chemically determined amino acid sequence of four  peptides derived from the 10.1 kda protein by the treatment with either cyanogen  bromide or endoproteinase lys-c. together with a continuous run of 75 amino acids starting n-terminally, the sequence of the mature enzyme, 92 residues in length,  was elucidated. cloning and determination of the primary structure of a dna fragment encoding this enzyme were also performed. overexpression of the enzyme by using multicopies of plasmid psep38 in e. coli and detecting an enhanced ppiase activity attributed to the 10.1 kda enzyme provided additional proof that  the 92 amino acid protein was a ppiase. the enzyme was called parvulin (lat.: parvulus, very small). homology analyses indicated that several parvulin-like proteins could be found in the database screened. to further elucidate the functional role of ppiases it might be of some importance that homologous proteins like the prtm protein of lactococcus lactis and the prsa lipoprotein of  bacillus subtilis are known to be involved in the protein export and maturation machinery of the bacteria.

TI  == bglr protein, which belongs to the bglg family of transcriptional antiterminators, is involved in beta-glucoside utilization in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a fragment of the lactococcus lactis chromosome containing an open reading frame  of 265 codons, denoted bglr, has been characterized. the polypeptide encoded by bglr shares 36 to 30% sequence identity with a family of regulatory proteins including arbg from erwinia chrysanthemi, bglg from escherichia coli, and sact and sacy from bacillus subtilis. these regulatory proteins are involved in positive control of the utilization of different sugars by transcription antitermination. for some of these regulatory proteins it has been demonstrated that antitermination is exerted by binding to a conserved rna sequence, partially overlapping the transcription terminator and thus preventing transcription termination. upstream of bglr, we identified a transcription terminator whose 5'  end was overlapped by a 32-bp sequence, highly homologous to the rna-binding site that is conserved in other regulatory systems. constitutive expression of bglr in e. coli increased the expression of a bglg::lacz transcriptional fusion. the fact that that the expression of bglg is autoregulated in e. coli suggests that bglg and bglr are functionally equivalent. in l. lactis, we observed that (i) the expression of a bglr::lacz fusion is increased by beta-glucoside sugars, (ii) disruption of bglr impairs growth on some beta-glucosides, and (iii) the expression of bglr is positively autoregulated. because of these structural and functional similarities between bglr and the transcription antiterminators of the bglg family, we propose that bglr may be the lactococcal counterpart of the e. coli bglg regulator of beta-glucoside utilization.

TI  == controlled expression and structural organization of a lactococcus lactis bacteriophage lysin encoded by two overlapping genes.
AB  == the phi vml3 bacteriophage lysin is specific for lactococci and could be used to  promote enzyme release during cheese manufacture. the level of lysin expression from the cloned gene using its own upstream sequences is very low. expression in  escherichia coli by using a synthetic hybrid lysin gene and a series of bal 31 deletions of the original cloned dna fragment suggested that the start of the gene had previously been incorrectly assigned. reevaluation of homology between the lysin and bacillus subtilis pza protein 15 led to the identification of a new potential ribosome binding site (rbs). a 0.72-kb pcr-generated fragment including this rbs and the complete lysin gene was expressed and inducibly controlled. the  translational start of the lysin gene was identified as an isoleucine codon, and  this may lead to a low translation rate. during the analysis of the bal 31 deletion fragments, two proteins of 20 and 8 kda were shown to be expressed from  the originally defined lysin gene. the dna sequence has a second open reading frame with a good rbs and two potential start methionines. the smaller lysin protein was isolated, and the n terminus was sequenced, confirming that one methionine codon acted as the start of a second gene. the larger lysin protein has homology with lysozymes. the smaller lysin protein has some features resembling those of a holin. the possible roles of these two proteins in lysis of lactococci are discussed.

TI  == gene cloning and characterization of pepc, a cysteine aminopeptidase from streptococcus thermophilus, with sequence similarity to the eucaryotic bleomycin  hydrolase.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus cnrz 302 contains at least three general aminopeptidases able to hydrolyze phe-beta-naphthylamide substrate. the gene encoding one of these aminopeptidases was cloned from a total dna library of s. thermophilus cnrz 302 constructed in escherichia coli tg1 using pbluescript plasmid. the wild-type tg1 strain, although not deficient in aminopeptidase activity, is unable to hydrolyze the substrate phe-beta-naphthylamide, and thus the library could be screened with an enzymic plate assay using this substrate. one clone was selected which was shown to express an aminopeptidase, identified as a pepc-like enzyme on the basis of cross-reactivity with polyclonal antibodies directed against the lactococcal pepc cysteine aminopeptidase. the gene was further subcloned and sequenced. a complete open reading frame coding for a 445-residue (50414 da) polypeptide was identified. 70% identity was found between the deduced amino acid sequence and the sequence of pepc from lactococcus lactis  subspecies cremoris, confirming the identity of the cloned gene. high sequence similarity (38% identity) was also found with an eucaryotic enzyme, bleomycin hydrolase. in addition, the predicted amino acid sequence of the streptococcal pepc showed a region of strong similarity to the active site of cysteine proteinases with conservation of the residues involved in the catalytic site. the product of the cloned pepc gene was overproduced in e. coli and was purified from a cellular extract. purification to homogeneity was achieved by two-step ion-exchange chromatography. biochemical characterization of the pure recombinant enzyme confirms that the cloned peptidase is a thiol aminopeptidase possessing a  broad specificity. the enzyme has a molecular mass of 300 kda suggesting an hexameric structure. on the basis of sequence similarities as well as common biochemical and enzymic properties, the bacterial pepc-type enzymes and the eucaryotic bleomycin hydrolase constitute a new family of thiol aminopeptidases among the cysteine peptidases.

AB  == a system for direct screening of recombinant clones in lactococcus lactis, based  on secretion of the staphylococcal nuclease (snase) in the organism, was developed. the nuc gene (encoding snase) was cloned on both rolling-circle and theta-replicating plasmids. l. lactis strains containing these nuc+ plasmids secrete snase and are readily detectable by a simple plate test. a multicloning site (mcs) was introduced just after the cleavage site between leader peptide and the mature snase, without affecting nuclease activity. cloning foreign dna fragments into any site of the mcs interrupts nuc and thus results in nuc mutant  clones which are easily distinguished fron nuc+ clones on plates. the utility of  this system for l. lactis was demonstrated by cloning an antibiotic resistance marker and escherichia coli chromosomal dna fragments into the mcs of the nucmcs  cassette. both cloning vectors containing the nucmcs cassette were also introduced into streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, in which direct screening of nuc mutant recombinant clones was also achieved. the potential uses  of nuc as a secretion reporter system are discussed.

AB  == the genes encoding the lysis proteins of lactococcus lactis bacteriophage phi lc3 were cloned, sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli. the phi lc3 lysis genes, lysa and lysb, encode a membrane-disrupting protein (lysa) of 88 amino acids, and a cell wall degrading protein (lysb) of 429 amino acids, which shares  significant sequence similarity with lysins from the streptococcus pneumoniae phages cp-1, cp-7, and cp-9, and lactobacillus delbrueckii phage mv1. both lysa and lysb function in e. coli, as judged by lysis of the e. coli host cells and by lytic activity against lactococcal cells when the cloned lysa and lysb genes are  expressed. the lysa protein possesses two putative transmembrane helices and highly charged n- and c-termini, and is structurally similar to phage holins that are known to induce lesions in the inner membrane through which phage endolysin can be released to its cell wall substrate. the c-terminal end of lysb contains two highly homologous sequence repeats of 43 amino acids. the lysb repeats show strong sequence similarity to repeats found in lytic enzymes from other gram-positive bacteria and from bacillus subtilis phage phi 29 and pza, as well as in some functionally unrelated proteins, and they are possibly involved in binding of the enzyme to the cell wall substrate. the organization of the dual phi lc3 lysis system supports earlier suggestions that exchange of modular units  is an important principle in protein evolution.

TI  == bactericidal potency of hydroxyl radical in physiological environments.
AB  == rates of radiolytic inactivation of bacteria suspended in n2o-saturated solutions were dramatically increased over normal background levels when the media contained chloride or bicarbonate ions. the bacteria could be protected from this enhanced toxicity by the addition of free radical scavengers (ethanol, ascorbate, hydrogen peroxide, mannitol, glucose, edta, picolinic acid), indicating that the  lethal reactions were extracellular in origin. prior irradiation of chloride-containing solutions led to formation of hypochlorous acid, which was identified by detection of ring-chlorinated products when reacted with fluorescein. prolonged irradiation of other solutions did not lead to accumulation of bactericidal agents; however, irradiation of bicarbonate-containing solutions in the presence of the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline n-oxide (dmpo) led to formation of the epr-detectable dmpo.co3- adduct. the results are interpreted in terms of formation of secondary  radicals, among which the carbonate and chlorine radicals are uniquely toxic to bacteria. from rate comparisons of the solution components, it was concluded that the reactions involving chloride ion are unlikely to be expressed in biological environments, but that the co3- radical could be an important intermediary oxidant in peroxide-inflicted cellular damage, particularly in spatially confined environments such as the leukocyte phagosome.

TI  == identification of genes encoding ribosomal protein l33 from bacillus licheniformis, thermus thermophilus and thermotoga maritima.
AB  == three previously unrecognized genes from bacillus licheniformis, thermus thermophilus and thermotoga maritima, encoding ribosomal protein l33, have been identified and designated as rpmg genes. their sequence and context have been compared with the three known rpmg genes from escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis and b. subtilis. previously unrecognized open reading frames homologous to sece are located immediately downstream from rpmg in b. licheniformis, t. thermophilus and ta. maritima: beyond that lie previously identified nusg and rplk genes. thus, the genes located downstream from rpmg show similar organization across three of the four bacterial phyla represented.

TI  == use of the escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase (gusa) gene as a reporter gene for analyzing promoters in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a transcriptional fusion vector, designated pnz272, based on the promoterless beta-glucuronidase gene (gusa) of escherichia coli as a reporter gene, has been constructed for lactic acid bacteria. the replicon of pnz272 was derived from the lactococcus lactis plasmid psh71, allowing replication in a wide range of gram-positive bacteria and e. coli. the applicability of pnz272 and the expression of the gusa gene in l. lactis was demonstrated in shotgun cloning experiments with lactococcal chromosomal and bacteriophage dna. in addition, three defined lactococcal promoters were inserted in pnz272: the plasmid-derived  laca promoter, the chromosomal usp45 promoter, and a promoter from bacteriophage  phi sk11g. the three resulting plasmids showed beta-glucuronidase activity in a gusa-deficient e. coli strain and in four species of lactic acid bacteria belonging to the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, and leuconostoc. the copy numbers of the gusa-expressing plasmids were similar within a single species of lactic acid bacteria. however, the specific beta-glucuronidase activity and the gusa mrna levels varied considerably both within a single species and among different species of lactic acid bacteria. the transcriptional start site of all  three promoters was determined and found to be identical in the different species. the results of this comparative promoter analysis indicate that the requirements for efficient transcription initiation differ among the lactic acid  bacteria studied.

TI  == cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding lactococcus lactis malolactic  enzyme: relationships with malic enzymes.
AB  == malolactic enzyme is the key enzyme in the degradation of l-malic acid by lactic  acid bacteria. using degenerated primers designed from the first 20 n-terminal amino acid sequence of lactococcal malolactic enzyme, a 60-bp dna fragment containing part of the mles gene was amplified from lactococcus lactis in a polymerase chain reaction. this specific probe was used to isolate two contiguous fragments covering the gene as a whole. the 1.9-kb region sequenced contains an open reading frame of 1623 bp, coding a putative protein of 540 amino acids. the  deduced amino acid sequence reveals that lactococcal putative protein (mlep) is highly homologous to the malic enzyme of other organisms. expression of the mles  gene in escherichia coli results in malolactic activity.

TI  == differences in sensitivity to nadh of purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes of enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, azotobacter vinelandii and escherichia coli: implications for their activity in vivo.
AB  == the effect of nadh on the activity of the purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes (pdhc) of enterococcus (ec.) faecalis, lactococcus lactis, azotobacter  vinelandii and escherichia coli was determined in vitro. it was found that the pdhc of e. coli and l. lactis was active only at relatively low nadh/nad ratios,  whereas the pdhc of ec. faecalis was inhibited only at high nadh/nad ratios. the  pdhc of azotobacter vinelandii showed an intermediate sensitivity. the organisms  were grown in chemostat culture under conditions that led to different intracellular nadh/nad ratios and the pdhc activities in vivo could be calculated from the specific rates of product formation. under anaerobic growth conditions,  only ec. faecalis expressed pdhc activity in vivo. the activities in vivo of the  complexes of the different organisms were in good agreement with their properties determined in vitro. the physiological consequences of these results are discussed.

TI  == cloning and sequence analysis of the dnak gene region of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  == a 5.4 kb hindiii fragment of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was identified using a homologous dnak probe generated by pcr and cloned in escherichia coli. upstream sequences were generated by inverse pcr. the two cloned fragments partially overlapped, and sequencing of 5915 bp revealed the presence of four open reading frames in the order orf1-grpe-dnak-orf4. orf1 encodes a 39 kda protein of unknown function which shows considerable sequence homology with the orf39 and orfa proteins of bacillus subtilis and clostridium acetobutylicum, respectively. the downstream orfs showed high homology to the grpe and dnak genes of other prokaryotes. the dnak protein has a characteristic 24-amino-acid deletion exhibited by all the known dnak proteins of gram-positive species. in many bacteria the dnak and dnaj genes are found as part of the same operon. the l. lactis dnak operon is unusual in that the dnak gene is followed by a putative  transcription terminator and a fourth large orf which shares no homology with the dnaj genes of other bacteria but has a small degree of homology with various membrane proteins. vegetative promoter sequences are found upstream of both orf1  and orf4. a 12 bp inverted repeat is found upstream of the putative promoter of orf1 and an 8 bp inverted repeat is found between this promoter and the orf1 initiation codon. these repeats are thought to be involved in regulation of the heat-shock genes. the dnak homologue is induced approximately 3-fold on heat shock at 42 degrees c.

TI  == 6-phospho-beta-galactosidases of gram-positive and 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase b of gram-negative bacteria: comparison of structure and function by kinetic and immunological methods and mutagenesis of the lacg gene of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase of staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus casei and 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase b of escherichia coli build a  subfamily inside a greater enzyme family, named the glycosal hydrolase family 1,  which, in addition, contains nine beta-glycosidases of different origins. kinetic and immunological evidence is provided in this report which strengthens the relationship of the four 6-phospho-beta-glycosidases. it is shown that the 6-phospho-beta-galactosidases and 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase b are able to split  aromatic beta-galactoside phosphates and beta-glucoside phosphates. the turnover  numbers of hydrolysis of substrates with different epimerization at c-4 of the glycon vary up to 15-fold only. two polyclonal antisera, one derived against the  native 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase from s. aureus and the other derived against  the 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase b, cross-reacted with both enzymes. peptides of the proteins were separated by reverse phase hplc. the cross-reacting peptides were sequenced and shown to be localized at almost the same position in the aligned primary structures of both enzymes. an insertion of nine amino acids near these antigenic domains is unique for the 6-phospho-beta-glycosidases and missing within the sequences of the beta-glycoside-specific members of the family. the lacg gene of a 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase negative s. aureus mutant was cloned  into e. coli and sequenced. in the totally inactive mutant protein only the glycine at position 332 was changed to an arginine. this amino acid is part of the sequence insertion near the antigenic domain reacting with both antisera.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == cloning, sequence and expression of the gene encoding the malolactic enzyme from  lactococcus lactis.
AB  == many lactic acid bacteria can carry out malolactic fermentation. this secondary fermentation is mediated by the nad- and mn(2+)-dependent malolactic enzyme, which catalyses the decarboxylation of l-malate to l-lactate. the gene we call mles, coding for malolactic enzyme, was isolated from lactococcus lactis. the mles gene consists of one open reading frame capable of coding for a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 59 kda. the amino acid sequence of the predicted mles gene product is homologous to the sequences of different malic enzymes. bacterial and yeast cells expressing the malolactic gene convert l-malate to l-lactate.

TI  == theta replication of the lactococcal plasmid pwvo2.
AB  == pwvo2 is a 3.8 kb narrow-host-range plasmid from lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris wg2, which does not replicate in bacillus subtilis or escherichia coli. single-stranded pwvo2 dna was not observed in lactococcal cells, indicating that  this plasmid does not replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism. the sequence of pwvo2 neither showed the structural organization typical for rolling-circle plasmids, nor were sequence similarities with known rolling-circle plasmids present. by 2-d agarose gel electrophoresis of replication intermediates, it was  shown that pwvo2 replicates via a theta mechanism. this is the first proof for the existence of theta-replicating plasmids in lactococci. the pwvo2 minimal replicon is strongly related to that of several other lactococcal plasmid replicons. it contains one open reading frame encoding the replication protein, which is preceded by a 22 bp sequence tandemly repeated three and a half times. further upstream is another 10 bp direct repeat present in an a/t-rich sequence.  this structural organization resembles that of several iteron-containing theta-type plasmids from e. coli. derivatives of pwvo2 were stably maintained in  l. lactis and are good candidates for the development of stable food-grade cloning vectors for this organism.

TI  == functional analysis of the lactococcus lactis usp45 secretion signal in the secretion of a homologous proteinase and a heterologous alpha-amylase.
AB  == the ups45 gene encodes the major extracellular protein from lactococcus lactis. the deduced sequence of the 27 residue leader peptide revealed the tripartite characteristics of a signal peptide. this leader peptide directed the efficient secretion of the homologous proteinase (prtp) in l. lactis, indicating that the putative signal peptide of prtp can be replaced by the 27 residue usp45 leader peptide. in addition, the 27 residue leader peptide could be used to secrete the  bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase, encoded by the amys gene. fusion of the usp45 promoter region and various parts of the leader sequence to an amys gene devoid of its signal sequence, showed that in escherichia coli the first 19, 20, and 27 residues of the usp45 leader are able to direct alpha-amylase secretion. in l. lactis the shorter signal peptides did not result in secretion of alpha-amylase, providing experimental evidence for the hypothesis that gram-positive bacteria require a longer signal peptide for secretion than gram-negative organisms.

TI  == physiological and genetic regulation of rrna synthesis in lactococcus.
AB  == the macromolecular composition of lactococcus was regulated by growth rate in the same general way as that of less fastidious bacteria such as escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the ratios of rna:dna and rna:protein increased approximately threefold over a 13.5-fold increase in growth rate, whereas the ratio of dna:protein remained approximately constant. using reporter genes fused  to a dna fragment of a cloned lactococcal rrna operon, promoter activity was located upstream of the 16s rrna structural gene. this dna fragment had some characteristics typical of a rrn promoter in e. coli. two consensus promoter sequences p1 and p2 were located 296 and 157 bp, respectively, upstream of the start of the 16s rrna gene. between p2 and the start of the 16s rrna gene, sequences were identified with typical anti-termination motifs characteristic of  e. coli rrn promoter regions. a putative transcription terminator sequence was identified downstream of the 5s rrna gene and putative primary rna transcript processing sites at both ends of the lactococcal rrna operon were also noted.

AB  == the nisin gene cluster nisabtcipr of lactococcus lactis, located on a 10-kbp dna  fragment of the nisin-sucrose transposon tn5276, was characterized. this fragment was previously shown to direct nisin-a biosynthesis and to contain the nisp and nisr genes, encoding a nisin leader peptidase and a positive regulator, respectively [van der meer, j. r., polman, j., beerthuyzen, m. m., siezen, r. j., kuipers, o. p. & de vos, w. m. (1993) j. bacteriol. 175, 2578-2588]. further sequence analysis revealed the presence of four open-reading frames, nisb, nist,  nisc and nisi, downstream of the structural gene nisa. the nist, nisc and nisi genes were subcloned and expressed individually in escherichia coli, using the t7-rna-polymerase system. this resulted in the production of radiolabelled proteins with sizes of 45 kda (nisc) and 32 kda (nisi). the nist gene product was not detected, possibly because of protein instability. the deduced amino acid sequence of nisi contained a consensus lipoprotein signal sequence, suggesting that this protein is a lipid-modified extracellular membrane-anchored protein. expression of nisi in l. lactis provided the cells with a significant level of protection against exogenously added nisin, indicating that nisi plays a role in  the immunity mechanism. in edta-treated e. coli cells, expression of nisi conferred up to a 170-fold increase in immunity against nisin a compared to controls. moreover, a lactococcal strain deficient in nisin-a production, designated nz9800, was created by gene replacement of nisa by a truncated nisa gene and was 10-fold less resistant to nisin a than the wild-type strain. a wild-type immunity level to nisin and production of nisin was obtained in strain  nz9800 harboring complementing nisa and nisz plasmids. transcription analyses of  several l. lactis strains indicated that an expression product of the nisa gene,  together with nisr, is required for the activation of nisa transcription.

AB  == translational gene fusions between the escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (lacz) gene and the lactococcus lactis lactose operon were constructed such that transcription from the lactose operon promoter could be assessed by measuring beta-galactosidase activity. the level of beta-galactosidase activity was up to 2.5-fold lower when mg5267 cells, which contain a chromosomal copy of the lactose operon, were grown in glucose compared to those grown in lactose. a greater degree of repression was seen in cells containing the multi-copy plasmid-encoded  repressor than in those with only the single-copy chromosomal gene, indicating that the repressor protein is at least partly responsible for the reduction in expression when the cells are grown in glucose (i.e. in the absence of inducer).  however, the beta-galactosidase activity was found to be 5.5-fold lower in glucose than in lactose in cells which lacked a fully functional lactose operon.  the decrease in expression was shown to be due to glucose repression. the levels  of expression when the cells were grown in glucose were considerably higher for mg5267 than for mg1363 suggesting perhaps that a product of the chromosomally-encoded operon in mg5267 has a positive effect on transcription.

TI  == gene inactivation in lactococcus lactis: histidine biosynthesis.
AB  == lactococcus lactis strains from dairy and nondairy sources were tested for the ability to grow in the absence of histidine. among 60 dairy strains tested, 56 required histidine, whereas only 1 of 11 nondairy strains had this requirement. moreover, 10 of the 56 auxotrophic strains were able to grow in the presence of histidinol (hol+), the immediate histidine precursor. this indicates that adaptation to milk often results in histidine auxotrophy. the histidine operon was detected by southern hybridization in eight dairy auxotrophic strains tested. a large part of the histidine operon (8 kb, containing seven histidine biosynthetic genes and three unrelated open reading frames [orfs]) was cloned from an auxotroph, which had an inactive hisd gene, as judged by its inability to grow on histidinol. complementation analysis of three genes, hisa, hisb, and hisg, in escherichia coli showed that they also were inactive. sequence analysis  of the cloned histidine region, which revealed 98.6% overall homology with that of the previously analyzed prototrophic strain, showed the presence of frameshift mutations in three his genes, hisc, hisg, and hish, and two genes unrelated to histidine biosynthesis, orf3 and orf6. in addition, several mutations were detected in the promoter region of the operon. northern (rna) hybridization analysis showed a much lower amount of the his transcript in the auxotrophic strain than in the prototrophic strain. the mutations detected account for the histidine auxotrophy of the analyzed strain. certain other dairy auxotrophic strains carry a lower number of mutations, since they were able to revert either  to a hol+ phenotype or to histidine prototrophy.

TI  == high-efficiency gene inactivation and replacement system for gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == a system for high-efficiency single- and double-crossover homologous integration  in gram-positive bacteria has been developed, with lactococcus lactis as a model  system. the system is based on a thermosensitive broad-host-range rolling-circle  plasmid, pg+host5, which contains a pbr322 replicon for propagation in escherichia coli at 37 degrees c. a nested set of l. lactis chromosomal fragments cloned onto pg+host5 were used to show that the single-crossover integration frequency was logarithmically proportional to the length of homology for dna fragments between 0.35 and 2.5 kb. using random chromosomal 1-kb fragments, we showed that homologous integration can occur along the entire chromosome. we made use of the reported stimulatory effect of rolling-circle replication on intramolecular recombination to develop a protocol for gene replacement. cultures were first maintained at 37 degrees c to select for a bacterial population enriched for plasmid integrants; activation of the integrated rolling-circle plasmid by a temperature shift to 28 degrees c resulted in efficient plasmid excision by homologous recombination and replacement of a chromosomal gene by the plasmid-carried modified copy. more than 50% of cells underwent replacement recombination when selection was applied for the replacing gene. between 1 and 40% of cells underwent replacement recombination when no selection was applied. chromosomal insertions and deletions were obtained in this way. these results show that gene replacement can be obtained at an extremely high efficiency by making use of the thermosensitive rolling-circle nature of the delivery vector. this procedure is applicable to numerous gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == improved cloning vectors and transformation procedure for lactococcus lactis.
AB  == four shuttle vectors (pmig 1, 2, 2h and 3) have been constructed based on the broad host-range plasmid pck1. all the pmig vectors possess a multiple cloning site containing 12 or more unique restriction enzyme sites, and are stably maintained at either high or low copy number in lactococcus lactis and in escherichia coli. by cloning the e. coli puc replicon into one of these vectors a plasmid was constructed which can replicate to high copy number in reca strains of e. coli. the broad host-range of the pck1 replicon may enable these cloning vectors to be used in a number of gram-positive bacteria. one of these vectors was used to optimize an electroporation procedure for transformation of a commonly used plasmid-cured strain mg1363 of l. lactis which routinely yielded 1  x 10(7) to 5 x 10(7) transformants micrograms-1 supercoiled dna using stored, snap-frozen cells. this transformation efficiency was obtained by growing the cells in medium containing the cell wall weakening agent glycine, to an upper limit of 2.5% w/v. although growth of l. lactis strain mg1363 was inhibited by the use of 0.5 mol l-1 sucrose as an osmotic stabilizer, the presence of sucrose  in the electroporation buffer was critical for high transformation efficiency. other variables which were tested for their effect on the efficiency of transformation were cell concentration, dna concentration, pulse time and field strength. these results provide a model procedure which can be followed to optimize conditions for the genetic transformation of various strains of l. lactis.

AB  == biosynthesis of the lantibiotic peptide nisin by lactococcus lactis nizo r5 relies on the presence of the conjugative transposon tn5276 in the chromosome. a  12-kb dna fragment of tn5276 including the nisa gene and about 10 kb of downstream dna was cloned in l. lactis, resulting in the production of an extracellular nisin precursor peptide. this peptide reacted with antibodies against either nisin a or the synthetic leader peptide, suggesting that it consisted of a fully modified nisin with the nisin leader sequence still attached to it. this structure was confirmed by n-terminal sequencing and 1h-nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the purified peptide. deletion studies showed that the nisr gene is essential for the production of this intermediate. the deduced amino acid sequence of the nisr gene product indicated that the protein belongs to the family of two-component regulators. the deduced amino acid sequence of nisp, the putative product of the gene upstream of nisr, showed an n-terminal signal sequence, a catalytic domain with a high degree of similarity to those of  subtilisin-like serine proteases, and a putative c-terminal membrane anchor. cell extracts of escherichia coli overexpressing nisp were able to cleave the nisin precursor peptide, producing active, mature nisin. a similar activation was obtained with whole cells but not with membrane-free extracts of l. lactis strains carrying tn5276 in which the nisa gene had been inactivated. the results  indicate that the penultimate step in nisin biosynthesis is secretion of precursor nisin without cleavage of the leader peptide, whereas the last step is  the cleavage of the leader peptide sequence from the fully maturated nisin peptide.

AB  == the dnaj gene of lactococcus lactis was isolated from a genomic library of l. lactis nizo r5 and cloned into puc19. nucleotide sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 1,137 bp in length, encoding a protein of 379 amino acids. the deduced amino acid sequence showed homology to the dnaj proteins of escherichia coli, mycobacterium tuberculosis, bacillus subtilis, and clostridium acetobutylicum. the level of the dnaj monocistronic mrna increased approximately  threefold after heat shock. the transcription initiation site of the dnaj gene was determined and appeared to be preceded by a typical gram-positive vegetative  promoter sequence (ttgcca-17 bp-taaaat). upstream of the promoter region, an inverted repeat is located that is identical to those detected upstream of heat shock genes of other gram-positive organisms. a transcriptional fusion between the dnaj expression signals and a usp45-amys secretion cassette caused a significant increase in alpha-amylase activity after heat shock induction. deletion mutagenesis showed that the inverted repeat is involved in heat shock regulation of the dnaj gene. the conservation of this palindromic sequence in gram-positive heat shock genes suggests a common regulatory pathway distinct from the system used in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == in vitro pore-forming activity of the lantibiotic nisin. role of protonmotive force and lipid composition.
AB  == nisin is a lantibiotic produced by some strains of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. the target for nisin action is the cytoplasmic membrane of gram-positive  bacteria. nisin dissipates the membrane potential (delta psi) and induces efflux  of low-molecular-mass compounds. evidence has been presented that a delta psi is  needed for nisin action. the in vitro action of nisin was studied on liposomes loaded with the fluorophore carboxyfluorescein. nisin-induced efflux of carboxyfluorescein was observed in the absence of a delta psi from liposomes composed of escherichia coli lipids or dioleoylglycerophosphocholine (ole2gropcho) at low nisin/lipid ratios. the initial rate of carboxyfluorescein efflux is dependent on the nisin/lipid ratio and saturates at high ratios. both delta psi (inside negative) and delta ph (inside alkaline) enhance the action of  nisin, while nisin is more potent at acidic external ph values. efficient carboxyfluorescein efflux is observed with the zwitterionic phospholipid ole2gropcho or mixtures of ole2gropcho with dioleoylglycerophosphoethanolamine and neutral glycolipids, while anionic phospholipids are strongly inhibitory. it  is concluded that a delta psi is not essential, but that the total protonmotive force stimulates the action of nisin.

TI  == two genes present on a transposon-like structure in lactococcus lactis are involved in a clp-family proteolytic activity.

TI  == the mode of replication is a major factor in segregational plasmid instability in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the effects of the rolling-circle and theta modes of replication on the maintenance of recombinant plasmids in lactococcus lactis were studied. heterologous escherichia coli or bacteriophage lambda dna fragments of various sizes were inserted into vectors based on either the rolling-circle-type plasmid  pwv01 or the theta-type plasmid pambeta1. all pambeta1 derivatives were stably maintained. pwv01 derivatives, however, showed size-dependent segregational instability, in particular when large dna fragments were inserted. all recombinant pwv01 derivatives generated high-molecular-weight plasmid multimers (hmw) in amounts that were positively correlated with plasmid size and inversely  correlated with the copy numbers of the monomeric plasmid forms. formation of hmw or reductions in copy numbers were not observed with pambeta1 derivatives. the results indicate that hmw formation and/or reduction in plasmid copy numbers is an important factor in the maintenance of pwv01 derivatives. it is concluded that theta-type plasmids are superior to rolling-circle-type plasmids for cloning in lactococci.

TI  == lysines 72, 80 and 213 and aspartic acid 210 of the lactococcus lactis lacr repressor are involved in the response to the inducer tagatose-6-phosphate leading to induction of lac operon expression.
AB  == site-directed mutagenesis of the lactococcus lactis lacr gene was performed to identify residues in the lacr repressor that are involved in the induction of lacabcdfegx operon expression by tagatose-6-phosphate. a putative inducer binding domain located near the c-terminus was previously postulated based on homology studies with the escherichia coli deor family of repressors, which all have a phosphorylated sugar as inducer. residues within this domain and lysine residues  that are charge conserved in the deor family were changed into alanine or arginine. the production of the lacr mutants k72a, k80a, k80r, d210a, k213a and k213r in the lacr-deficient l.lactis strain nz3015 resulted in repressed phospho-beta-galactosidase (lacg) activities and decreased growth rates on lactose. gel mobility shift assays showed that the complex between a dna fragment carrying the lac operators and lacr mutants k72a, k80a, k213a and d210a did not dissociate in the presence of tagatose-6-phosphate, in contrast to wild type lacr. other mutations (k62a/k63a, k72r, k73a, k73r, t212a, f214r, r216r and r216k) exhibited no gross effects on inducer response. the results strongly suggest that the lysines at positions 72, 80 and 213 and aspartic acid at position 210 are involved in the induction of lac operon expression by tagatose-6-phosphate.

TI  == enhancement of the chemical and antimicrobial properties of subtilin by site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  == subtilin and nisin are gene-encoded antibiotic peptides that are ribosomally synthesized by bacillus subtilis and lactococcus lactis, respectively. gene-encoded antibiotics are unique in that their structures can be manipulated by mutagenesis of their structural genes. although subtilin and nisin share considerable structural homology, subtilin has a greater tendency than nisin to undergo spontaneous inactivation. this inactivation is a accompanied by chemical  modification of the dehydroalanine at position 5 (dha5) with a kinetic first-order t1/2 of 0.8 days. it was hypothesized that the r group carboxyl of glu4 in subtilin participates in the chemical modification of the adjacent dha5.  noting that nisin has ile at position 4, site-directed mutagenesis was used to change glu4 of subtilin to ile, in order to eliminate this carboxyl-group participation. the dha5 of this mutant subtilin (e4i-subtilin) underwent modification with a t1/2 of 48 days, which is 57-fold slower than natural subtilin, and the rate of loss of biological activity dropped by a like amount. these results suggest that an intact dha5 is critical for subtilin activity against bacterial spore outgrowth. a double mutant of subtilin, in which the dha5 residue of e4i-subtilin was mutated to ala was devoid of detectable inhibition against spore outgrowth. the specific activity of e4i-subtilin was 3-4-fold higher than natural subtilin, suggesting that an increase in the hydrophobicity of the n-terminal end of the molecule enhances activity. these are the first mutants of subtilin that have been reported, and e4i-subtilin is the first example of any lantibiotic whose properties have been improved by mutagenesis. in order to carry out the mutagenesis, a host-vector pair was constructed that permits a deletion replacement in which the natural subtilin gene is replaced by  the mutant gene at the normal location in the chromosome. this maintains normal gene dosage and regulatory responses, as well as eliminates ambiguities caused by expression of the normal and mutant genes in the same cell.

TI  == engineering dehydrated amino acid residues in the antimicrobial peptide nisin.
AB  == the small antimicrobial peptide nisin, produced by lactococcus lactis, contains the uncommon amino acid residues dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine and five thio ether bridges. since these structures are posttranslationally formed from ser, thr, and cys residues, it is feasible to study their role in nisin function and biosynthesis by protein engineering. here we report the development of an expression system for mutated nisin z (nisz) genes, using nisin a producing l. lactis as a host. replacement by site-directed mutagenesis of the ser-5 codon in  nisz by a thr codon, led to a mutant with a dehydrobutyrine instead of a dehydroalanine residue at position 5, as shown by nmr. its antimicrobial activity was 2-10-fold lower relative to wild-type nisin z, depending on the indicator strain used. in another mutagenesis study a double mutation was introduced in the nisz gene by replacing the codons for met-17 and gly-18 by codons for gln and thr, respectively, as in the third lanthionine ring of the related antimicrobial  peptide subtilin from bacillus subtilis. this resulted in the simultaneous production of two mutant species, one containing a thr residue and the other containing a dehydrobutyrine residue at position 18, both having different bacteriocidal properties.

TI  == biosynthesis of the lantibiotic nisin: genomic organization and membrane localization of the nisb protein.
AB  == nisin produced by lactococcus lactis 6f3 is used as a food preservative and is the most important member of a group of peptide-antibiotics containing lanthionine bridges (lantibiotics) (n. schnell, k.-d. entian, u. schneider, f. gotz, h. zahner, r. kellner, and g. jung, nature [london] 333:276-278, 1988). nisin is ribosomally synthesized, and its structural gene, nisa, encodes a prepeptide that is posttranslationally modified, revealing the active lantibiotic (c. kaletta and k.-d. entian, j. bacteriol. 171:1597-1601, 1989). adjacent to nisa, the additional genes nisb, nist, and nisc were identified. over their entire sequences, these genes were homologous to genes recently identified as important for the biosynthesis of lantibiotics, that is, subtilin from bacillus subtilis atcc 6633 and epidermin from staphylococcus epidermidis tu 3298. genes nisb, nist, and nisc corresponded to open reading frames of 993, 600, and 418 amino acid residues, respectively. the nist open reading frame is homologous to proteins of the hlyb (hemolysin b protein of escherichia coli) subfamily. proteins of this subfamily are responsible for the secretion of a variety of compounds, including large polypeptides, polysaccharides, and anti-drug tumors, indicating that nist may be involved in nisin transport. northern (rna) blot analysis revealed a 0.3-kb transcript for the nisa structural gene, and the transcriptional start point of the nisa gene was determined by primer extension.  additionally, a mrna of at least 3 kb was identified by using a hybridization probe specific to nisb. antibodies were raised against the nisb protein, and western blot (immunoblot) analysis revealed a molecular weight of about 115 kda,  which is in accordance with the theoretical protein size of 117.5 kda as calculated from the nisb open reading frame. several amphipathic transmembrane alpha-helices indicated that nisb is associated with the membrane. this was confirmed by preparing l. lactis vesicles. the nisb protein was tightly associated with the vesicle fraction and was released by sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment only. these results suggest that nisb is membrane associated and that nisin biosynthesis occurs at the cell membrane.

TI  == molecular characterization of a second abortive phage resistance gene present in  lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis me2.
AB  == the fifth phage resistance factor from the prototype phage-insensitive strain lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis me2 has been characterized and sequenced. the genetic determinant for prf (phage resistance five) was subcloned from the conjugative plasmid ptn20, which also encodes a restriction and modification system. typical of other abortive resistance mechanisms, prf reduces the efficiency of plaquing to 10(-2) to 10(-3) and decreases the plaque size and burst size of the small isometric-headed phage p2 in l. lactis subsp. lactis lm0230. however, normal-size plaques occurred at a frequency of 10(-4) and contained mutant phages that were resistant to prf, even after repeated propagation through a sensitive host. prf does not prevent phage adsorption or promote restriction and modification activities, but 90% of prf+ cells infected with phage p2 die. thus, phage infections in prf+ cells are aborted. prf is effective in both l. lactis subsp. lactis and l. lactis subsp. cremoris strains against several small isometric-headed phages but not against prolate-headed phages. the prf determinant was localized by tn5 mutagenesis and subcloning. dna  sequencing identified a 1,056-nucleotide structural gene designated abic. prf+ expression was obtained when abic was subcloned into the lactococcal expression vector pmg36e. abic is distinct from two other lactococcal abortive phage resistance genes, abia (hsp+, from l. lactis subsp. lactis me2) and abi416 (abi+, from l. lactis subsp. lactis il416). unlike abia, the action of abic does not appear to affect dna replication. thus, abic represents a second abortive system  found in me2 that acts at a different point of the phage lytic cycle.

AB  == a gene (designated ldh) that encodes fructose-1,6-bisphosphate-activated l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase was cloned from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. plasmids containing ldh conferred fructose-1,6-bisphosphate-activated l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase activity on escherichia coli cells. this activity was conferred only when a promoter had been introduced into the plasmid to express the cloned ldh. the nucleotide sequence of ldh predicted a chain length of 324 amino acids and a subunit molecular weight of 34,910 for the enzyme, after removal of the n-terminal methionine residue. northern analyses of l. lactis subsp. lactis rna showed that a 4.1-kb transcript hybridized strongly with ldh and that 1.2- and 1.1-kb transcripts hybridized to much lesser extents. promoter- and terminator-cloning studies in which we used the vectors pgkv210 and pgkv259 in l. lactis subsp. lactis revealed that the 5' flanking dna of ldh is devoid of  transcription initiation signals and that transcription entering the 3' flanking  dna from either direction is efficiently terminated. these data and the data from northern analyses led to the conclusion that ldh is expressed as the 3' gene of the 4.1-kb transcript and suggested that posttranscriptional processing yielded the shorter transcripts. we determined that ldh is located on the l. lactis subsp. lactis chromosome between coordinates 1.619 and 1.669 of the previously reported physical map (d. l. tulloch, l. r. finch, a. j. hillier, and b. e. davidson, j. bacteriol. 173:2768-2775, 1991).

AB  == the complete nucleotide sequences of lacrabcdf and partial nucleotide sequence of lace from the lactose operon of streptococcus mutans are presented. comparison of the streptococcal lac determinants with those of staphylococcus aureus and lactococcus lactis indicate exceptional protein and nucleotide identity. the deduced polypeptides also demonstrate significant, but lower, sequence similarity with the corresponding lactose proteins of lactobacillus casei. additionally, lacr has sequence homology with the repressor (deor) of the escherichia coli deoxyribonucleotide operon, while lacc is similar to phosphokinases (fruk and pfkb) from e. coli. the primary translation products of the lacrabcdfe genes are  polypeptides of 251 (m(r) 28,713), 142 (m(r) 15,610), 171 (m(r) 18,950), 310 (m(r) 33,368), 325 (m(r) 36,495), 104 (m(r) 11,401), and 123 (nh2-terminal) amino acids, respectively. as inferred from their direct homology to the staphylococcal lac genes, these determinants would encode the repressor of the streptococcal lactose operon (lacr), galactose-6-phosphate isomerase (laca and lacb), tagatose-6-phosphate kinase (lacc), tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (lacd), and the sugar-specific components enzyme iii-lactose (lacf) and enzyme ii-lactose (lace) of the s. mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system.  the nucleotide sequence encompassing the s. mutans lac promoter appears to contain repeat elements analogous to those of s. aureus, suggesting that repression and catabolite repression of the lactose operons may be similar in these organisms.

TI  == is thermotolerance correlated to heat-shock protein synthesis in lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis?
AB  == exposure of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis cells to a heat shock at 40 degrees  c for 30 min induces thermotolerance, the increased ability of bacterial cells to survive exposure to lethal temperature (52 degrees c for 25 min). this transient  state of thermal resistance is accompanied, as in escherichia coli, by the synthesis of a new set of specific proteins termed heat-shock proteins (hsps). pre-treatment of the bacterial cells by antibiotics (streptomycin, spiramycin, kanamycin and erythromycin) known to act on translation, induces the major hsps synthesis but no thermal protection; conversely, puromycin and amino acid analogues treatments, known to produce abnormal and incomplete peptides, triggers the thermotolerance state without inducing significant hsps synthesis. these results demonstrate that heat-shock response and induced thermotolerance are not  tightly correlated phenomena in l. lactis subsp. lactis.

AB  == the rates of reduction of seven redox dyes by 13 bacterial strains were measured  and found to vary greatly between different bacterium/dye combinations. phenazine ethosulphate and toluidine blue were the most rapidly reduced dyes by the majority of bacteria and resorufin and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone were reduced  slowly, if at all. there was also considerable variation in the rates of reduction with any single dye/organism combination. glucose stimulated the rates  of endogenous dye reduction in about half of the organisms. for bacillus cereus,  pseudomonas fluorescens and escherichia coli, dye reduction was stimulated by a range of exogenous substrates but lactose, the primary available carbon and energy source in milk, had little effect. in lactococcus lactis, dye reduction was stimulated by sugars but not by organic acids. oxygen successfully competed with dye reduction in organisms containing respiratory chains, but with membrane  fractions, dye reduction was more rapid than oxygen consumption. all the organisms showed little cytosolic dye reduction, except l. lactis which showed substantial rates of reduction of some dyes by this fraction. with the membrane fraction of e. coli and ps. fluorescens, cyanide inhibited nadh and succinate-dependent dye reduction, antimycin a inhibited lactate and succinate and rotenone had no significant effect, but inhibition was not always observed with membrane from both organisms.

TI  == antibacterial and antiviral activity of camel milk protective proteins.
AB  == lysozyme (lz), lactoferrin (lf), lactoperoxidase (lp), immunoglobulin g and secretory immunoglobulin a were extracted from camel milk. the activity of these  protective proteins was assayed against lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium and rotavirus. comparative activities of egg white lz, bovine lz and bovine lf are also presented. the antibacterial activity spectrum of camel milk lz was similar to that of egg white lz, and differed from bovine milk lz. bovine and camel milk lf  antibacterial activity spectra were similar. the camel milk lp was bacteriostatic against the gram-positive strains and was bactericidal against gram-negative cultures. the immunoglobulins had little effect against the bacteria but high titres of antibodies against rotavirus were found in camel milk. the lp system was ineffective against rotavirus.

TI  == sequence of a gene (lap) encoding a 95.3-kda aminopeptidase from lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris wg2.
AB  == a gene (lap) coding for a lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris wg2 aminopeptidase was cloned from genomic libraries of size-fractionated lactococcal dna. the 5' end of the lap gene was isolated by using a polymerase chain reaction hybridization probe of 77 nucleotides (nt) synthesized from two degenerate primers derived from the n-terminal amino acid (aa) sequence of the lactococcal lysine-aminopeptidase  (lap). the remaining part(s) of the gene were recovered by a search for overlapping sequences in southern blots of variably restricted genomic dna. the complete nt sequence of the lap gene has been determined. a large open reading frame of 2538 nt is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 846 aa (approx. 95.3 kda; pi, 5.93). a recombinant plasmid containing the lap gene with its flanking sequences was shown to direct in vivo synthesis of lap activity in escherichia coli, indicating that the cloned dna fragment is the lap gene. primer extension analysis of lap mrna and northern blot hybridization indicated the gene transcript to be approx. 3.0 kb in size with a 5'-untranslated region of 19-22 nt. comparison of the deduced aa sequence indicates that the lap has extensive homology with the super family of zn(2+)-metallohydrolases and shows identity in  the core deca-peptide consensus sequence for the zn(2+)-binding motif of these enzymes.

TI  == staphylococcal phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system: molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the staphylococcus carnosus ptsi gene and expression and complementation studies of the gene product.
AB  == a digoxigenin-labeled dna probe that was complementary to the gene ptsh and the beginning of the gene ptsi was used to clone a 3.2-kb hincii-bamhi restriction fragment containing the complete ptsi gene of staphylococcus carnosus. the restriction fragment was cloned in the antisense orientation to the lac promoter  in the low-copy-number vector psu18. the nucleotide sequences of the ptsi gene, which encodes enzyme i (ec 2.7.3.9), and the corresponding flanking regions were  determined. the primary translation product, derived from the nucleotide sequence, consists of 574 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 63,369. amino acid sequence comparison showed 47% similarity to enzyme i of escherichia coli and 37% similarity to the enzyme i domain of the multiphosphoryl transfer protein of rhodobacter capsulatus. the histidinyl residue at position 191 could be identified as the probable phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation site of enzyme i of s. carnosus because of sequence homologies with the peptide sequences of enzyme i-active sites of enterococcus faecalis and  lactococcus lactis. several in vivo and in vitro complementation studies with the enzyme i ptsi genes of s. carnosus and the e. coli ptsi mutant jlt2 were carried  out. the generation times and interaction between enzyme i with histidine-containing protein from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were measured in a phosphoryl group transfer test.

TI  == characterization of the lactococcus lactis lactose operon promoter: contribution  of flanking sequences and lacr repressor to promoter activity.
AB  == we determined the location, activity, and regulation of the promoter of the lactococcus lactis 8-kb lactose operon (lacabcdfegx), which encodes the enzymes of the lactose phosphotransferase system and the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway. the lac promoter sequence corresponds closely to the consensus promoter described for gram-positive bacteria and is located in a back-to-back configuration with the promoter of the divergently transcribed lacr gene, which encodes the lacr repressor. the transcription start sites used under induced (lactose) and noninduced (glucose) conditions were determined. the minimal promoter region that could be isolated on a single restriction fragment included sequences ranging from -75 to +42. the effect of the presence of flanking sequences and the lacr gene on promoter activity and regulation was studied in escherichia coli and l. lactis strains by using transcriptional fusions with promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter genes. the results showed that transcriptional regulation of the lac operon is mediated by the interaction between the lacr repressor, the lac promoter, and sequences in the noncoding region between the lacr and laca genes. sequences flanking the minimal promoter region appeared to enhance lac promoter activity much more in l. lactis (5- to 38-fold) than in e. coli (1.3- to 5-fold).

TI  == zinc, a novel structural element found in the family of bacterial adenylate kinases.
AB  == the adk gene from bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli under the control of the lac promoter. the primary structure of  b. stearothermophilus adenylate kinase exhibited 76% identity with the enzyme from bacillus subtilis, 60% identity with the enzyme from lactococcus lactis, and 42% identity with the enzyme from e. coli. the most striking property of the adenylate kinase from b. stearothermophilus is the presence of a structural zinc  atom bound to four cysteines in a zinc finger-like fashion. the ability to coordinate zinc is predicted also for a number of other isoforms of bacterial adenylate kinases. furthermore, the tightly bound metal ion contributes to the high thermodynamic stability of adenylate kinase from b. stearothermophilus.

AB  == on the bacteriocin plasmid p9b4-6 of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 9b4, a third bacteriocin determinant was identified. the genes encoding bacteriocin production and immunity resided on a 1.2-kb celii-scai fragment and were located  adjacent to one of two previously identified bacteriocin operons (m. j. van belkum, b. j. hayema, r. e. jeeninga, j. kok, and g. venema, appl. environ. microbiol. 57:492-498, 1991). the fragment was sequenced and analyzed by deletion and mutation analyses. the bacteriocin determinant consisted of two genes which were transcribed as an operon. the first gene (lcnb), containing 68 codons, was involved in bacteriocin activity. the second gene (lcib) contained 91 codons and  was responsible for immunity. the specificity of this novel bacteriocin, designated lactococcin b, was different from that of the other two bacteriocins specified by p9b4-6. part of the nucleotide sequence of the lactococcin b operon  was similar to a nucleotide sequence also found in the two other bacteriocin operons of p9b4-6. this conserved region encompassed a nucleotide sequence upstream of the bacteriocin gene and the 5' part of the gene. when the lactococcin b operon was expressed in escherichia coli by using a t7 rna polymerase-specific promoter, antagonistic activity could be detected.

TI  == gene expression in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria are of major economic importance, as they occupy a key position in the manufacture of fermented foods. a considerable body of research is currently being devoted to the development of lactic acid bacterial strains with improved characteristics, that may be used to make fermentations pass of more efficiently, or to make new applications possible. therefore, and because the lactococci are designated 'gras' organisms ('generally recognized as safe') which may be used for safe production of foreign proteins, detailed knowledge of  homologous and heterologous gene expression in these organisms is desired. an overview is given of our current knowledge concerning gene expression in lactococcus lactis. a general picture of gene expression signals in l. lactis emerges that shows considerable similarity to those observed in escherichia coli  and bacillus subtilis. this feature allowed the expression of a number of l. lactis-derived genes in the latter bacterial species. several studies have indicated, however, that in spite of the similarities, the expression signals from e. coli, b. subtilis and l. lactis are not equally efficient in these three  organisms.

AB  == a vector (pkmp10) capable of campbell-like integration into the lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis lm0230 chromosome via homologous recombination with chromosomal is981 sequences was constructed from the replication region of lactococcal plasmid psk11l, an internal fragment of is981, and the erythromycin resistance gene and escherichia coli replication origin of pva891. the psk11l replication region is temperature sensitive for maintenance in l. lactis subsp. lactis lm0230, resulting in loss of unintegrated pkmp10 during growth at greater  than 37 degrees c. pkmp10 integrants made up 8 to 75% of lm0230(pkmp10) erythromycin-resistant cells following successive growth at 25 degrees c with selection, 39 degrees c without selection, and 39 degrees c with selection. pkmp10 integrants were also isolated from l. lactis subsp. lactis mg1363(pkmp10)  but at a 10-fold-lower frequency (4%). no integrants were isolated form l. lactis subsp. lactis mms368(pkmp10) (a rec-deficient strain) or lm0230(pkmp1-e) (the corresponding plasmid lacking the is981 fragment). examination of 17 lm0230 integrants by southern hybridization revealed pkmp10 integration into five different chromosomal sites. four of the integration sites appeared to be chromosomal is981 sequences, while one was an uncharacterized chromosomal sequence. the four is981 integrants seemed to have pkmp10 integrated in a tandem  repeat structure of undetermined length. integrated pkmp10 was more stable (0 to  2% plasmid loss) than unintegrated pkmp10 (100% plasmid loss) when grown for 100  generations at 32 degrees c without selection.

TI  == functional reconstitution of membrane proteins in monolayer liposomes from bipolar lipids of sulfolobus acidocaldarius.
AB  == membranes of sulfolobus acidocaldarius, an extreme thermophilic archaebacterium,  are composed of unusual bipolar lipids. they consist of macrocyclic tetraethers with two polar heads linked by two hydrophobic c40 phytanyl chains which are thought to be arranged as a monolayer in the cytoplasmic membrane. fractionation  of a total lipid-extract from s. acidocaldarius yielded a lipid fraction which forms closed and stable unilamellar liposomes in aqueous media. beef heart cytochrome c-oxidase could be functionally reconstituted in these liposomes. in the presence of reduced cytochrome c, a protonmotive force (delta p) across the liposomal membrane was generated of up to -92 mv. upon fusion of these proteoliposomes with membrane vesicles of lactococcus lactis, the delta p generated by cytochrome c-oxidase activity was capable to drive uphill transport  of leucine. electron microscopic analysis indicated that the tetraether lipids form a single monolayer liposome. the results demonstrate that tetraether lipids  of archaebacteria can form a suitable matrix for the function of exogenous membrane proteins originating from a regular lipid bilayer.

TI  == replication and temperature-sensitive maintenance functions of lactose plasmid psk11l from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris.
AB  == the replication region of psk11l, the lactose plasmid of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris (l. cremoris) sk11, was isolated on a 14.8-kbp pvuii fragment by  shotgun cloning into an escherichia coli vector encoding erythromycin resistance  and selection for erythromycin-resistant transformants of l. lactis subsp. lactis (l. lactis) lm0230. deletion analysis and tn5 mutagenesis of the resulting plasmid (pkmp1) further localized the replication region to a 2.3-kbp scai-spei fragment. dna sequence analysis of this 2.3-kbp fragment revealed a 1,155-bp open reading frame encoding the putative replication protein, rep. the replication origin was located upstream of rep and consisted of an 11-bp imperfect direct repeat and a 22-bp sequence tandemly repeated three and one-half times. the overall organization of the psk11l replicon was remarkably similar to that of pci305, suggesting that psk11l does not replicate by the rolling-circle mechanism. like psk11l, pkmp1 was unstable in l. lactis lm0230. deletion analysis allowed identification of several regions which appeared to contribute to the maintenance of pkmp1 in l. lactis lm0230. pkmp1 was significantly more stable in  l. cremoris eb5 than in l. lactis lm0230 at all of the temperatures compared. this stability was lost by deletion of a 3.1-kbp pvuii-xbai fragment which had no effect on stability in l. lactis lm0230. other regions affecting stability in l.  cremoris eb5 but not in l. lactis lm0230 were also identified. stability assays conducted at various temperatures showed that pkmp1 maintenance was temperature sensitive in both l. lactis lm0230 and l. cremoris eb5, although the plasmid was  more unstable in l. lactis lm0230. the region responsible for the temperature sensitivity phenotype in l. lactis lm0230 was tentatively localized to a 1.2-kbp  clai-hindiii fragment which was distinct from the replication region of psk11l. our results suggest that the closely related l. lactis and l. cremoris subspecies behave differently regarding maintenance of plasmids.

TI  == the bacteriocin lactococcin a specifically increases permeability of lactococcal  cytoplasmic membranes in a voltage-independent, protein-mediated manner.
AB  == lactococcin a is a bacteriocin produced by lactococcus lactis. its structural gene has recently been cloned and sequenced (m. j. van belkum, b. j. hayema, r. e. jeeninga, j. kok, and g. venema, appl. environ. microbiol. 57:492-498, 1991).  purified lactococcin a increased the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane of  l. lactis and dissipated the membrane potential. a significantly higher concentration of lactococcin a was needed to dissipate the membrane potential in  an immune strain of l. lactis. lactococcin a at low concentrations (0.029 microgram/mg of protein) inhibited secondary and phosphate-bond driven transport  of amino acids in sensitive cells and caused efflux of preaccumulated amino acids. accumulation of amino acids by immune cells was not affected by this concentration of lactococcin a. lactococcin a also inhibited proton motive force-driven leucine uptake and leucine counterflow in membrane vesicles of the sensitive strain but not in membrane vesicles of the immune strain. these observations indicate that lactococcin a makes the membrane permeable for leucine in the presence or absence of a proton motive force and that the immunity factor(s) is membrane linked. membrane vesicles of clostridium acetobutylicum, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli were not affected by lactococcin a, nor were liposomes derived from phospholipids of l. lactis. these results indicate that lactococcin a acts on the cytoplasmic membrane and is very specific towards  lactococci. the combined results obtained with cells, vesicles, and liposomes suggest that the specificity of lactococcin a may be mediated by a receptor protein associated with the cytoplasmic membrane.

TI  == a host factor absent from lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis mg1363 is required for conjugative transposition.
AB  == in matings between lactococcus lactis strains, the conjugative transposons tn916  and tn919 are found in the chromosome of the transconjugants in the same place as in the chromosome of the donor, indicating that no transposition has occurred. in agreement with this, the frequency of l. lactis transconjugants from intraspecies matings is the same whether the donor contains the wild-type form of the transposon or the mutant tn916-int1, which has an insertion in the transposon's integrase gene. however, in intergeneric crosses with bacillus subtilis or enterococcus faecalis donors, tn916 and tn919 transpose to different locations on the chromosome of the l. lactis transconjugants. moreover, tn916 and tn919 could  not be transferred by conjugation from l. lactis and b. subtilis, e. faecalis or  streptococcus pyogenes. this suggests that excision of these elements does not occur in l. lactis. when cloned into e. coli with adjacent chromosomal dna from l. lactis, the conjugative transposons were able to excise, transpose and promote conjugation. therefore, the inability of these elements to excise in l. lactis is not caused by a permanent structural alteration in the transposon. we conclude that l. lactis lacks a factor required for excision of conjugative transposons.

AB  == an artificial composite transposon was constructed based on the lactococcal insertion sequence is946. a 3.0-kb element composed of the pc194 cat gene (cmr) flanked by inversely repeated copies of is946 was assembled on pbluescript ks+. when subcloned into the shuttle vector psa3 (emr), two putative transposons were  created on the recombinant plasmid ptrk128: the 3.0-kb cmr element (tn-cma) and an inverse 11.5-kb emr element (tn-ema). ptrk128 was electroporated into the recombination-deficient strain lactococcus lactis mms362, which contains the self-transmissible plasmid prs01. an mms362 cmr emr transformant was used to assay for transposition events via conjugal mobilization of ptrk128-encoded cmr or emr to l. lactis lm2345. transfer of either marker alone occurred at frequencies of ca. 2 x 10(-4) per input donor. approximately 19% of the emr transconjugants were cms, indicating loss of the cat gene marker. no cmr ems transconjugants were recovered (n = 550). plasmid analysis showed that the cms emr isolates contained a single large plasmid that was determined to be a cointegrate between prs01 and the tn-ema element. a 32p-labeled psa3 probe hybridized specifically to ptrk128 sequences and revealed different junction fragments within each of the cointegrate plasmids. dna sequence analysis of the tn-ema::prs01 junctions from a representative cointegrate verified transposition  by tn-ema. this represents the first example of a functional composite transposon in the genus lactococcus and serves as an experimental tool and model for the genetic analyses of transposons in these organisms.

AB  == the conjugative plasmid ptr2030 confers bacteriophage resistance to lactococci by two independent mechanisms, an abortive infection mechanism (hsp+) and a restriction and modification system (r+/m+). ptr2030 transconjugants of lactococcal strains are used in the dairy industry to prolong the usefulness of mesophilic starter cultures. one bacteriophage which has emerged against a ptr2030 transconjugant is not susceptible to either of the two defense systems encoded by the plasmid. phage nck202.50 (phi 50) is completely resistant to restriction by ptr2030. a region of homology between ptr2030 and phi 50 was subcloned, physically mapped, and sequenced. a region of 1,273 bp was identical in both plasmid and phage, suggesting that the fragment had recently been transferred between the two genomes. sequence analysis confirmed that the transferred region encoded greater than 55% of the amino domain of the structural gene for a type ii methylase designated llai. the llai gene is 1,869 bp in length and shows organizational similarities to the type ii a methylase foki. in addition to the amino domain, upstream sequences, possibly containing the expression signals, were present on the phage genome. the phage phi 50 fragment containing the methylase amino domain, designated llapi, when cloned onto the shuttle vector psa3 was capable of modifying another phage genome in trans. this  is the first report of the genetic exchange between a bacterium and a phage which confers a selective advantage on the phage. definition of the llai system on ptr2030 provides the first evidence that type ii systems contribute to restriction and modification phenotypes during host-dependent replication of phages in lactococci.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and characterization of the broad-host-range lactococcal plasmid pwvo1.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the lactococcus lactis broad-host-range plasmid pwvo1, replicating in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, was determined. this analysis revealed four open reading frames (orfs). orf a appeared to encode  a trans-acting 26.8-kda protein (repa), necessary for replication. the orf c product was assumed to play a regulatory role in replication. both repa and the orf c product showed substantial sequence similarity with the rep proteins of the streptococcal plasmid pls1. in addition, the plus origin of replication was identified on the basis of strong similarity with the plus origin of pls1. derivatives of pwvo1 produced single-stranded (ss) dna in bacillus subtilis and l. lactis, suggesting that this plasmid uses the rolling-circle mode of replication. in b. subtilis, but not in l. lactis, the addition of rifampicin resulted in increased levels of ssdna, indicating that in the former organism the host-encoded rna polymerase is involved in the conversion of the ssdna to double-stranded plasmid dna (dsdna). apparently, in l. lactis the conversion of ss to ds pwvo1 dna occurs by a mechanism which does not require the host rna polymerase.

TI  == shuttle vectors containing a multiple cloning site and a lacz alpha gene for conjugal transfer of dna from escherichia coli to gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the mobilizable shuttle cloning vectors, pat18 and pat19, are composed of: (i) the replication origins of puc and of the broad-host-range enterococcal plasmid pam beta 1; (ii) an erythromycin-resistance-encoding gene expressed in gram- and  gram+ bacteria; (iii) the transfer origin of the incp plasmid rk2; and (iv) the multiple cloning site and the lacz alpha reporter gene of puc18 (pat18) and puc19 (pat19). these 6.6-kb plasmids contain ten unique cloning sites that allow screening of derivatives containing dna inserts by alpha-complementation in escherichia coli carrying the lacz delta m15 deletion, and can be efficiently mobilized by self-transferable incp plasmids co-resident in the e. coli donors. plasmids pat18, pat19 and recombinant derivatives have been successfully transferred by conjugation from e. coli to bacillus subtilis, bacillus thuringiensis, listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, and staphylococcus aureus at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9). the presence of a restriction system in the recipient dramatically affects (by three  orders of magnitude) the efficiency of conjugal transfer of these vectors from e. coli to gram+ bacteria.

AB  == the genetic determinant for abortive infection of bacteriophage (abi) from the lactococcal plasmid pci829 was cloned on a 6.2 kb stui fragment in escherichia coli using the shuttle vector psa3. in lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis mg1363sm  the resulting recombinant plasmid pci816 conferred complete insensitivity to the  small isometric-headed phage 712 and a reduced plaque size in the case of the prolate-headed phage c2. the determinant was further localized by subcloning and  nuclease bal31 deletion analysis; approximately 2.0 kb of dna was essential for the expression of the abi+ phenotype. nucleotide sequence analysis of this region revealed a putative open reading frame of 1887 base pairs preceded by a putative  promotor sequence and ribosome-binding site which exhibited similarity to consensus e. coli and bacillus subtilis transcription/translation signals. hybridization experiments indicated that this region was not homologous to the abi determinant from the phenotypically similar lactococcal plasmid pci750.

TI  == lactococcin a, a new bacteriocin from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris: isolation and characterization of the protein and its gene.
AB  == a new bacteriocin, termed lactococcin a (lcn-a), from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lmg 2130 was purified and sequenced. the polypeptide contained no unusual amino acids and showed no significant sequence similarity to other known  proteins. only lactococci were killed by the bacteriocin. of more than 120 l. lactis strains tested, only 1 was found resistant to lcn-a. the most sensitive strain tested, l. lactis subsp. cremoris ncdo 1198, was inhibited by 7 pm lcn-a.  by use of a synthetic dna probe, lcna was found to be located on a 55-kb plasmid. the lcna gene was cloned and sequenced. the sequence data revealed that lcn-a is  ribosomally synthesized as a 75-amino-acid precursor including a 21-amino-acid n-terminal extension. an open reading frame encoding a 98-amino-acid polypeptide  was found downstream of and in the same operon as lcna. we propose that this open reading frame encodes an immunity function for lcn-a. in escherichia coli lcna did not cause an lcn-a+ phenotype. l. lactis subsp. lactis il 1403 produced small amounts of the bacteriocin and became resistant to lcn-a after transformation with a recombinant plasmid carrying lcna. the other lactococcal strains transformed with the same recombinant plasmid became resistant to lcn-a but did not produce any detectable amount of the bacteriocin.

TI  == characterization of the heat shock response in lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  == the heat shock response in lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was characterized with respect to synthesis of a unique set of proteins induced by thermal stress.  a shift in temperature from 30 to 42 degrees c was sufficient to arrest the growth of l. lactis subsp. lactis, but growth resumed after a shift back to 30 degrees c. heat shock at 50 degrees c reduced the viable cell population by 10; however, pretreatment of the cells at 42 degrees c made them more thermoresistant to exposure at 50 degrees c. the enhanced synthesis of approximately 13 proteins  was observed in cells labeled with s upon heat shock at 42 degrees c. of these heat shock-induced proteins, two appeared to be homologs of groel and dnak, based on their molecular weights and reactivity with antiserum against the corresponding escherichia coli proteins. therefore, we conclude that l. lactis subsp. lactis displays a heat shock response similar to that observed in other mesophilic bacteria.

TI  == distance-dependent translational coupling and interference in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the possibility of raising the expression level of a heterologous gene in lactococcus lactis by exploiting the principle of translational coupling was investigated. for this purpose, the escherichia coli lacz gene was transcriptionally fused to a short open reading frame (orf) of lactococcal origin. a shine-dalgarno (sd) sequence was introduced at the boundary of the two  orfs. in a series of otherwise identical plasmids, the relative positions of the  translational stop codon of the upstream orf and the translational start codon of the downstream orf (lacz) were varied. the expression of lacz gradually increased as the stop and start codons were placed in closer proximity. a concomitant switch from translational interference to translational coupling was observed. best results were obtained with partially overlapping stop and start codons. it is concluded that the principle of translational coupling offers good possibilities to increase the level of heterologous gene expression in l. lactis.

TI  == isolation and characterization of chromosomal promoters of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  == a promoter probe vector, ptg244, was constructed with the aim of isolating transcription initiation signals from streptococcus thermophilus (streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). ptg244 is based on the escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle vector ptg222, into which the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of bacillus pumilus (cat-86) was cloned. random sau3a fragments from the s. thermophilus a054 chromosomal dna were cloned  upstream of the cat-86 gene by using e. coli as the host. the pool of recombinant plasmids were introduced into s. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in order to search for promoter activity in these hosts. for s. thermophilus, it was necessary to first select erythromycin-resistant transformants and then to screen for chloramphenicol resistance among these. direct selection of chloramphenicol-resistant clones was, however, possible in l. lactis subsp. lactis. six fragments exhibiting promoter activity were characterized in s. thermophilus by measuring the levels of cat-86 transcription  and/or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase specific activity. three of the promoter-carrying fragments were sequenced. the 5' ends of their corresponding mrnas were determined by s1 mapping and shown to correspond to a purine residue in all cases. upstream from these potential transcription start points, sequences homologous to the e. coli sigma 70 and the bacillus subtilis vegetative sigma 43  (or sigma a) consensus promoters were identified.

TI  == development and application of oligonucleotide probes for identification of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris.
AB  == lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris is of considerable interest to the dairy industry, which relies upon the few available strains for the manufacture of cheddar cheese free of fermented and fruity flavors. the subspecies cremoris differs from related subspecies by the lack of a few phenotypic traits. our purpose was to identify unique rrna sequences that could be used to discriminate  l. lactis subsp. cremoris from related subspecies. the 16s rrnas from 13 lactococcus strains were partially sequenced by using reverse transcriptase to identify domains unique to l. lactis subsp. cremoris. all five strains of the subspecies cremoris had a unique base sequence in a hypervariable region located  70 to 100 bases from the 5' terminus. in this region, all l. lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis strains examined had a sequence identical to that of l. lactis subsp. lactis 7962, which was different from other strains of the subspecies lactis by only one nucleotide at position 90 (escherichia coli 16s rrna structural model) (j. brosius, j. l. palmer, j. p. kennedy, and h. f. noller, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 75:4801-4805, 1978). oligonucleotide probes specific for the genus lactococcus (212rla) and for the subspecies cremoris (68rca) were synthesized and evaluated by hybridization to known rrnas as well as fixed whole cells. efficient and specific hybridization to the genus-specific probe was observed for the 13 lactococcus strains tested. no hybridization was seen with the control species. all five strains of the subspecies cremoris hybridized to the subspecies-specific probe.

TI  == improved vector for promoter screening in lactococci.
AB  == fragments of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis np45 chromosomal dna provided promoter activity in escherichia coli when cloned into the promoter probe vector  pgkv210. only 13% of these recombinant plasmids promoted detectable cat-86 activity when transferred to l. lactis, i.e., expressed chloramphenicol resistance. in these promoter-containing versions of pgkv210, the cat-86 gene specifies chloramphenicol-inducible chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression. this could be a limiting factor for cloning of promoters with lower activity in l. lactis. therefore, we have constructed a new promoter probe vector, pbv5030, with the mutated version of the cat-86 gene, which is constitutively expressed when transcriptionally activated by the insertion of a promoter. we found that in l. lactis il1403 the constitutively expressed cat-86 gene (on a pbv5030 derivative) has four times higher activity than the inducible version of the same gene (on a pgkv210 derivative) when both have the same promoter inserted upstream of the cat-86 gene. these results suggest that plasmid pbv5030 could be a more efficient vector for the cloning of promoters from lactococci.

AB  == with tem beta-lactamase as a reporter gene, a set of expression-secretion-promoting fragments were isolated from the chromosome of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. the fact that only translocated beta-lactamase  renders cells resistant to ampicillin allowed direct ampicillin selection with an escherichia coli vector (pkth33). the clones showing the greatest ampicillin resistance were subcloned onto a replicon capable of replication in lactic acid bacteria (pvs2), and the nucleotide sequences of the relevant fragments were determined. the structure of the secretion-promoting fragments in general resembled that of gram-positive true signal sequences, with a strongly positively charged n terminus, a long hydrophobic core, and a putative signal peptidase recognition site. the promoterlike sequences preceding the signal sequences matched well with those of previously published lactococcal promoters. in addition to e. coli, the functioning of these expression-secretion cassettes was  studied in three gram-positive hosts: bacillus subtilis, l. lactis, and lactobacillus plantarum. efficient expression and secretion of tem beta-lactamase into the culture medium of each gram-positive host was obtained. furthermore, when a strain of l. lactis subsp. lactis showing increased sensitivity to lysozyme was compared with a standard laboratory strain, threefold-higher secreted enzyme activities were detected.

AB  == plasmid pci305 is an 8.7-kb, narrow-host-range, cryptic plasmid originating from  lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis uc317. the nucleotide sequence of the pci305 replication region was determined. a single open reading frame of 1158 bp was identified in the trans-active domain repb. the size of the predicted repb protein (46 kda) is in close agreement with the size of the repb product visualized in vivo in escherichia coli when repb was placed under control of the  inducible phi t7 rna polymerase promoter. in vivo substitution of the native repb promoter sequence with a tn5-derived promoter sequence was demonstrated. repa, a  344-bp cis-acting region which is the probable pci305 replication origin region,  was noncoding, was at-rich, and possessed a unique set of inverted and direct repeat sequences. no significant homology between repa or repb and other gram-positive replication regions was evident. combined with the absence of a detectable single-stranded dna intermediate during replication, these results indicate that the pci305 replication region differs markedly from most gram-positive replicons examined to date. the presence on other lactococcal plasmids of replication regions related to that of pci305 was demonstrated.

AB  == the plasmid-encoded lactose genes of the lactococcus lactis phosphotransferase system encoding enzyme iiilac (lacf) and enzyme iilac (lace) have been identified and cloned in escherichia coli and l. lactis. nucleotide sequence and transcription analysis showed that these genes are organized into a lactose-inducible operon with the gene order lacf-lace-lacg-lacx, the latter two  genes encoding phospho-beta-galactosidase and a 34-kda protein with an unknown function, respectively. the lac-operon is immediately followed by an is element that is homologous to iss1. enzyme iiilac was purified from l. lactis and determination of its nh2-terminal sequence demonstrated that the lacf gene starts with a ttg codon and encodes a 105 amino acid protein (mr = 11416). cross-linking studies with the purified enzyme showed that enzyme iiilac is active as a trimer. a mutant lacf gene was identified in strain yp2-5 and appeared to encode enzyme iiilac containing the missense mutation g18e. the lacf gene could be expressed under control of vector-located promoter sequences resulting in overproduction of enzyme iiilac in e. coli and complementation of the l. lactis lacf mutant yp2-5.  the deduced amino acid sequence of enzyme iilac consists of 586 amino acids (mr = 61562) and shows the characteristics of a hydrophobic, integral membrane protein. the deduced primary structures of the l. lactis enzyme iiilac and enzyme iilac are homologous to those of staphylococcus aureus (72 and 71% identity, respectively) and lactobacillus casei (48 and 47% identity, respectively). in contrast, the organization of the lactose genes differs significantly between those gram-positive bacteria. heterogramic homology in specific domains was observed between the derived amino acid sequences of the lactose-specific enzymes and that of e. coli enzyme iiicel and enzyme iicel, which suggest a common function in the transport and phosphorylation of these structurally related beta-glucosides.

TI  == cloning, expression, and sequence determination of a bacteriophage fragment encoding bacteriophage resistance in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a number of host-encoded phage resistance mechanisms have been described in lactococci. however, the phage genome has not been exploited as a source of additional resistance determinants. a 4.5-kb bamhi-hindiii fragment of phage nck202.50 (phi 50) was subcloned in streptococcus-escherichia coli shuttle plasmid psa3 and introduced into lactococcus lactis nck203 and mg1363 by protoplast transformation. this cloned phage fragment directed a bacteriophage resistance phenotype designated per (phage-encoded resistance). both phi 50 and a distantly related phage, nck202.48 (phi 48), formed small plaques on strain nck213 at a slightly reduced efficiency of plaquing on the per+ host. the per locus was further reduced to a 1.4-kb fragment through in vitro deletion analysis. the 1.4-kb fragment was sequenced, and the per phenotype was found to be associated with a ca. 500-bp region rich in direct and inverted repeats. we present evidence that the per region contains a phage origin of replication which, in trans, may interfere with phage replication by titration of dna polymerase or other essential replication factors. it was demonstrated that the per+ phenotype is not a result of reduced adsorption or action of a restriction and modification system. per+ activity was not detected against six independent phages which were previously shown to be sensitive to the hsp+ mechanism. the mutually exclusive resistance mechanisms could be combined to confer resistance to both types of phages (hsp resistant and per resistant) in a single host. this  is the first description in lactococci of a phage resistance phenotype, other than superinfection immunity, originating from a lactococcal phage genome.

AB  == we have cloned usp45, a gene encoding an extracellular secretory protein of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strain mg1363. unidentified secreted 45-kda protein (usp45) is secreted by every mesophilic l. lactis strain we tested so far and it is chromosomally encoded. the nucleotide sequence of the usp45 gene revealed an open reading frame of 1383 bp encoding a protein of 461 amino acids (aa), composed of a 27-aa signal peptide and a mature protein initiated at asp28. the gene contains a consensus promoter sequence and a weak ribosome-binding site; the latter is rather uncommon for gram-positive bacteria. expression studies in escherichia coli showed efficient synthesis and secretion of the protein. usp45 has an unusual aa composition and distribution, and it is predicted to be structurally homologous with p54 of enterococcus faecium. up to now, no biological activity could be postulated for this secreted protein.

TI  == molecular cloning, transcriptional analysis, and nucleotide sequence of lacr, a gene encoding the repressor of the lactose phosphotransferase system of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the repressor gene (lacr) of the lactose phosphotransferase system of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strain mg1820 has been cloned and characterized. transcription of lacr, into a 1.2-kilobase monocistronic messenger, is repressed  approximately 5-fold during growth on lactose. nucleotide sequence analysis of the lacr gene showed the presence of an open reading frame of 861 base pairs. the deduced amino acid sequence of lacr is homologous to three escherichia coli regulatory proteins (deor, fucr, and gutr) and includes a n-terminal domain (helix-turn-helix) involved in dna binding and a c-terminal domain that may be responsible for inducer binding. the in vivo function of lacr has been determined by introducing multiple copies of lacr into l. lactis, under control of its own or the unrelated prtp promoter. growth rates and lactose phosphotransferase system enzyme activities were measured during growth on lactose and glucose. the  presence of lacr on a multicopy plasmid resulted in the decrease of lactose phosphotransferase system activity, whereas only on lactose a decrease (25%) of growth rate was observed. no significant difference in growth rate was observed on glucose, indicating that lacr specifically represses the lactose genes of l. lactis.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and expression in escherichia coli of the lactococcus lactis  citrate permease gene.
AB  == the plasmid-encoded citrate determinant of the lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis var. diacetylactis ncdo176 was cloned and functionally expressed in a cit- escherichia coli k-12 strain. from deletion derivative analysis, a 3.4-kilobase region was identified which encodes the ability to transport citrate. analysis of proteins encoded by the cloned fragment in a t7 expression system revealed a 32,000-dalton protein band, which correlated with the ability of cells to transport citrate. energy-dependent [1,5-14c]citrate transport was found with membrane vesicles prepared from e. coli cells harboring the citrate permease-expressing plasmid. the gene encoding citrate transport activity, citp,  was located on the cloned fragment by introducing a site-specific mutation that abolished citrate transport and resulted in a truncated form of the 32,000-dalton expression product. the nucleotide sequence for a 2.2-kilobase fragment that includes the citp gene contained an open reading frame of 1,325 base pairs coding for a very hydrophobic protein of 442 amino acids, which shows no sequence homology with known citrate carriers.

AB  == staphylococcus aureus plasmid pe194 manifests a natural thermosensitivity for replication and can be established in several species, both gram positive and gram negative, thus making it attractive for use as a delivery vector. like most  characterized plasmids of gram-positive bacteria, pe194 generates single-stranded dna. the direction of pe194 replication is clockwise, as determined by the strandedness of free single-stranded dna. significant homology exists between a 50-base-pair sequence in the origin of pe194 and sequences present in plasmids pmv158 (streptococcus agalactiae), padb201 (mycoplasma mycoides), and psh71 (lactococcus lactis). we used an initiation-termination reaction, in which pe194  initiates replication at its own origin and is induced to terminate at the related pmv158 sequence, to demonstrate that pe194 replicates by a rolling-circle mechanism; the initiation nick site was localized to an 8-base-pair sequence.

AB  == the self-transmissible plasmid ptr2030 mobilized nonconjugative heterologous cloning vectors pgk12 (cmr emr) and psa3 (emr) at frequencies of 10(-5) to 10(-6) per input donor. transconjugants harbored a 51- or 58-kilobase (kb) plasmid not found in the parental strains that cotransferred at high frequency with cmr emr and ptr2030-encoded phage resistance (hsp+) in second-round matings (10(-1) per input donor). restriction endonuclease mapping and dna-dna hybridization identified the 51- to 58-kb plasmids as ptr2030::vector cointegrates. examination of four cointegrates indicated that pgk12 and psa3 had inserted within two locations on ptr2030. resolution of the cointegrates generated vector derivatives containing a 0.8-kb insert of ptr2030 dna. restriction analyses of several resolution plasmids indicated that the 0.8-kb element had inserted into various positions within pgk12 and psa3 and in certain cases had inactivated the cmr or emr marker of pgk12. a conjugative mobilization assay demonstrated that the 0.8-kb element, designated is946, mediated transpositional recombination. nucleotide sequence determination identified is946 as an 808-base-pair (bp) insertion sequence sharing ca. 96% homology with lactococcal insertion sequence iss1. is946 differed by 27 and 31 bp from iss1s and iss1t, respectively, and in 2 of 226 amino acids in the deduced sequence of the putative transposase. is946 has perfect 18-bp terminal inverted repeats, identical to iss1, and similarly generated 8-bp direct repeats of the target site upon insertion.

AB  == the replication region of a 28-kilobase-pair (kbp) cryptic plasmid from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis ssd207 was cloned in l. lactis subsp. lactis mg1614 by using the chloramphenicol resistance gene from the streptococcal plasmid pgb301 as a selectable marker. the resulting 8.1-kbp plasmid, designated pvs34, was characterized further with respect to host range,  potential cloning sites, and location of replication gene(s). in addition to lactococci, pvs34 transformed lactobacillus plantarum and, at a very low frequency, staphylococcus aureus but not escherichia coli or bacillus subtilis. the 4.1-kbp clai fragment representing lactococcal dna in pvs34 contained unique  restriction sites for hindiii, ecori, xhoii, and hpaii, of which the last three could be used for molecular cloning. a region necessary for replication was located within a 2.5-kbp fragment flanked by the ecori and clai restriction sites. a 3.8-kbp ecori fragment derived from a nisin resistance plasmid, psf01, was cloned into the ecori site of pvs34 to obtain a nisin-chloramphenicol double-resistance plasmid, pvs39. from this plasmid, the streptococcal chloramphenicol resistance region was subsequently eliminated. the resulting plasmid, pvs40, contains only lactococcal dna. potential uses for this type of a  nisin resistance plasmid are discussed.

TI  == thymidylate synthase gene from lactococcus lactis as a genetic marker: an alternative to antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  == the potential of the thymidylate synthase thya gene cloned from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis as a possible alternative selectable marker gene to antibiotic resistance markers has been examined. the thya mutation is a recessive lethal one; thya mutants cannot survive in environments containing low amounts of thymidine or thymine (such as luria-bertani medium) unless complemented by the thya gene. the cloned thya gene was strongly expressed in l. lactis subsp. lactis, escherichia coli, rhizobium meliloti, and a fluorescent pseudomonas strain. in addition, when fused to a promoterless enteric lac operon, the thya gene drove expression of the lac genes in a number of gram-negative bacteria. in  transformation experiments with thya mutants of e. coli and conjugation experiments with thya mutants of r. meliloti, the lactococcal thya gene permitted selection of transformants and transconjugants with the same efficiency as did genes for resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, or tetracycline. starting from the broad-host-range plasmid pgd500, a plasmid, designated ppr602, was constructed which is completely free of antibiotic resistance genes and has the lactococcal thya gene fused to a promoterless lac operon. this plasmid will permit growth of thya mutant strains in the absence of thymidine or thymine and has a number of unique restriction sites which can be used for cloning.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the thymidylate synthase gene from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  == the thymidylate synthase (thya) gene has been isolated from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. the cloned gene was strongly expressed in escherichia coli both in vivo and in vitro (maxicells and cell-free transcription and translation systems) and complemented e. coli thya mutants. dna-dna hybridizations demonstrated that the thya gene is encoded by the chromosome of l. lactis subsp. lactis. by sequential deletion of dna outside the complementing region, the thya gene was localized to a 1.1-kilobase dna fragment. the nucleotide sequence of the lactococcal thya gene was determined by the dideoxy-chain termination technique.  the derived amino acid sequence indicated a protein size of 32,580 daltons, which is in good agreement with results obtained from maxicell and in vitro transcription and translation experiments. the primary sequence is homologous to  12 other thya proteins from a variety of other organisms. upstream from the structural gene, -10 and -35 promoter sequences which were almost canonical sigma-70 promoter sequences were identified, which may explain the strong expression of the thya gene observed in e. coli. an a-t-rich sequence characteristic of gram-positive promoters was also noted adjacent to the -35 region. the thya gene has potential as a marker for plasmid maintenance and selection in food systems.

AB  == dna fragments from the temperate lactococcal bacteriophage bk5-t were cloned into the promoter-detecting plasmid pmu1328. five dna fragments conferring promoter activity were selected by transformation of streptococcus sanguis and were functional in escherichia coli, s. sanguis, and lactococcus lactis subspp. lactis and cremoris. the nucleotide sequences of these fragments were determined, and primer extension analysis was used to locate the site of initiation of transcription from each promoter in both e. coli and s. sanguis. transcription was initiated from the same nucleotide in these two organisms, and the promoters  contained -10 and -35 regions similar to the consensus sequence for e. coli promoters. the activities of three of the five promoters were decreased two- to threefold when a compatible plasmid containing a 3.8-kilobase-pair ecori fragment (ecori-f) of bk5-t was coresident with the promoter-containing plasmid in either  l. lactis subsp. cremoris or e. coli. data from tn5 mutagenesis, subcloning experiments, and dna sequence analysis indicate that this decrease in promoter activity requires a region of ecori-f that contains a 621-base-pair open reading  frame. this region has been designated bpi (for bk5-t promoter inhibitor).

TI  == primary structure and organization of the gene for a procaryotic, cell envelope-located serine proteinase.
AB  == we have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for the cell envelope-located proteinase of lactococcus lactis sk11. the gene contains a very  at-rich promoter region followed by the coding sequence of a protein of 1962 amino acids. comparison of the nh2-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature proteinase and the expected primary translation product of the proteinase gene indicates that the enzyme is probably synthesized as a pre-pro-protein. this is confirmed by expression studies of the proteinase gene in escherichia coli. the amino acid sequence of the proteinase shows significant homology to a number of serine proteinases of the subtilisin family. compared with the related proteinase of l. lactis wg2, the proteinase of l. lactis sk11 contains a 60-amino acids duplication and a total of 44-amino acid substitutions, some of which may account for the different cleavage specificity of both enzymes. furthermore, a region was identified in the lactococcus proteinase, which shows homology to the membrane-anchoring domains of a number of proteins from other gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == directly upstream of the lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris wg2 proteinase gene is an oppositely directed open reading frame (orf1). the complete nucleotide sequence of orf1, encoding a 33-kilodalton protein, was determined. a protein of  approximately 32 kilodaltons was synthesized when orf1 was expressed in escherichia coli by using a t7 rna polymerase-specific promoter. l. lactis subsp. lactis mg1363 transformants carrying the proteinase gene but lacking orf1 were phenotypically proteinase deficient, unlike transformants carrying both the proteinase gene and orf1. synthesis and secretion of proteinase antigen by l. lactis could be detected with proteinase-directed monoclonal antibodies regardless of whether orf1 was present. the requirement of orf1 for proteinase activation was reflected in a reduction in the molecular weight of the secreted proteinase. furthermore, deletion of the 130 c-terminal amino acids of the wg2 proteinase prevented attachment of the enzyme to lactococcal cells.

TI  == a maturation protein is essential for production of active forms of lactococcus lactis sk11 serine proteinase located in or secreted from the cell envelope.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of a gene located immediately upstream of the lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris sk11 prtp gene encoding the cell envelope-attached proteinase was determined. this gene, designated prtm, was found to be transcribed from the same promotor region as was the proteinase gene  but in the opposite direction. the prtm gene directed the expression in escherichia coli of a protein with a size similar to the expected value of 33 kilodaltons, as deduced from the nucleotide sequence data. the derived amino acid sequence of the prtm protein indicated the presence of a consensus lipoprotein signal sequence at the n terminus, which suggested that prtm is a lipoprotein. plasmids containing the prtm gene, the prtp gene, or both were constructed. expression studies of l. lactis clones containing these plasmids showed that the  prtm gene encodes a trans-acting activity involved in the maturation of cell envelope-located and -secreted forms of the sk11 proteinase.

TI  == functional reconstitution of prokaryote and eukaryote membrane proteins.
AB  == a new strategy for the functional reconstitution of membrane proteins is described. this approach introduces a new class of protein stabilizing agents--osmolytes--whose presence at high concentration (10-20%) during detergent solubilization prevents the inactivations that normally occur when proteins are extracted from natural membranes. osmolytes that act in this way include compounds such as glycerol and higher polyols (erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol), sugars (glucose, trehalose), and certain amino acids (glycine, proline, betaine). the beneficial effects of osmolytes are documented by reconstitution of a variety of prokaryote and eukaryote membrane proteins, including several proton- and calcium-motive atpases, cation- and anion-linked solute carriers (symport and antiport), and a membrane-bound hydrolase from endoplasmic reticulum. in all cases, the presence of 20% glycerol or other osmolyte during detergent solubilization led to 10-fold or more increased specific activity in proteoliposomes. these positive effects did not depend on use of any specific detergent for protein solubilization, nor on any particular method of reconstitution, but for convenience most of the work reported here has used octylglucoside as the solubilizing agent, followed by detergent-dilution to form  proteoliposomes. the overall approach outlined by these experiments is simple and flexible. it is now feasible to use reconstitution as an analytical tool to study the biochemical and physiological properties of membrane proteins.

TI  == campbell-like integration of heterologous plasmid dna into the chromosome of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  == integrable vectors were constructed based on the plasmid phv60, which is essentially a pbr322 replicon carrying a chloramphenicol resistance marker, by inserting 1.3-kilobase chromosomal fragments of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis  mg1363 into this plasmid. three constructs as well as phv60 were electroporated to strain mg1363. transformants were obtained with all constructs, and also with  phv60 (albeit with low frequency). by using southern hybridizations, it appeared  that phv60 showed homology with the chromosome of mg1363, and that it most probably uses this homology to integrate in a campbell-like manner. the presence  of chromosomal sequences in phv60 stimulated insertion elsewhere in the chromosome by a factor of 5 to 100. in all cases the integrated plasmids were amplified, at a selective pressure of 5 micrograms of chloramphenicol per ml, to  a level of approximately 15 copies per chromosome. although the amplification was gradually lost under nonselective conditions, one copy remained stably integrated in the chromosome. the results show that a campbell-like integration strategy can be used to improve the accessibility of the lactococcal chromosome for genetic analysis and is potentially useful in stabilizing unstable genes in lactococci.

TI  == structure, expression, and evolution of a gene encoding the precursor of nisin, a small protein antibiotic.
AB  == we have cloned and sequenced a gene (span) from streptococcus lactis atcc 11454 which encodes the peptide precursor of the small protein antibiotic nisin. the encoded precursor is 57 amino acids long, with a 23-residue leader region and a 34-residue structural region. the structural region contains serines, threonines, and cysteines at exactly the positions required to give mature nisin by a series  of post-translational modifications involving dehydration of serines and threonines to dehydro forms, and cross-linking with cysteine residues. s1 mapping revealed a 267-nucleotide transcript of the nisin gene that is expressed during vegetative growth and stationary phase. it has a half-life of 7-10 min. the absence of an identifiable promoter or rho-independent terminator and the detection of two different 5'-ends of the transcript suggested it is a processing product from a larger rna. this may represent a polycistronic mrna which may also encode proteins involved in processing the nisin precursor peptide. open reading  frames were found in regions flanking the nisin gene. the one downstream had a ribosome binding site and appeared to be transcribed by read-through from the nisin gene. the one upstream had significant homology to a putative transposase from the escherichia coli is2 insertion element. comparison of gene sequence homologies between nisin and the other lanthionine antibiotics, subtilin and epidermin, indicated that they all evolved from a common ancestor. corresponding  leader peptide sequences showed mediocre amino acid homology, but nearly perfect  hydropathic homologies, suggesting a common function. it is proposed that this function includes recognition signals or other information required for post-translational processing.

TI  == viability and metabolic capability are maintained by escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus lactis at very low adenylate energy charge.
AB  == metabolic regulation by nucleotides has been examined in several bacteria within  the context of the adenylate energy charge (ec) concept. the ecs of bacteria capable of only fermentative metabolism (streptococcus lactis and the atpase-less mutant escherichia coli an718) fell to less than 0.2 under carbon-limiting conditions, but the bacteria were able to step up the ec to greater than 0.8 upon exposure to nutrient sugars. similarly, nongrowing e. coli 25922, whose ec had been artificially lowered to less than 0.1 by the addition of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (cccp), was able to immediately step up  the ec to 0.8 to 0.9 upon the addition of glucose but was unable to respond to respiratory substrates. the ec of respiring bacteria (e. coli 25922 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853) fell to 0.3 to 0.4 under certain limiting growth conditions, but the bacteria also responded immediately when challenged with succinate to give ec values greater than 0.8. these bacteria could not step up the ec with respiratory substrates in the presence of cccp. for all bacteria, the loss of the ability to step up the ec was attributable to the loss of nutrient transport function. mixtures of viable and hocl-killed e. coli 25922 were able to step up the ec in proportion to the fraction of surviving cells. the data indicate that nucleotide phosphorylation levels are not regulatory in nongrowing  bacteria but that the ec step-up achievable upon nutrient addition may be an accurate index of viability.

TI  == silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  == a blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as x-static) was used in these experiments. this fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. at ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. the rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in x-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of  tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. when bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees c as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for pseudomonas, klebsiella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species. the rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that x-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.

TI  == reconstitution of atp-dependent calcium transport from streptococci.
AB  == membrane vesicles of three streptococcal strains (streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus lactis, and streptococcus sanguis) were extracted with octyl-beta-d-glucoside in the presence of escherichia coli lipid and glycerol. for reconstitution, the detergent extract was mixed with bath-sonicated e. coli lipid, in the presence of octyl-beta-d-glucoside, and proteoliposomes were formed by a 25-fold dilution. atp-dependent calcium accumulation by proteoliposomes was  comparable to that found in parent vesicles. recovery of this calcium transport activity was dependent on the inclusion of an osmolyte protein stabilant (glycerol, etc.) during solubilization. the properties of atp-driven calcium transport were studied in the reconstituted system. in proteoliposomes, atp-linked calcium accumulation was not affected by the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, or by the ionophores, valinomycin and  nigericin, in the presence of potassium, or by n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an  inhibitor of the f0f1-atpase. on the other hand, calcium transport was completely blocked by micromolar levels of orthovanadate; half-maximal inhibitions were observed at 0.4, 4, and 4 microm vanadate, for s. faecalis, s. lactis, and s. sanguis, respectively. this marked sensitivity to orthovanadate suggests operation of an e1e2-type ion-motive pump. these data demonstrate that, in a reconstituted system, calcium transport is not linked to an atp-dependent proton  circulation via the f0f1-atpase, but rather is driven by a calcium-translocating  atpase. thus, calcium extrusion from the cytosol of enteric, lactic acid, or oral streptococci is mediated by an atp-linked process analogous to the ion-motive atpases of eukaryotic membranes.

TI  == bacterial anion exchange. use of osmolytes during solubilization and reconstitution of phosphate-linked antiport from streptococcus lactis.
AB  == membranes of streptococcus lactis were solubilized with 1.1% octyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside in the presence of 0.37% acetone/ether-washed phospholipid from several sources. after adding excess escherichia coli phospholipid as bath-sonicated liposomes, phosphate:sugar phosphate antiport was  reconstituted in proteoliposomes by a 25-fold dilution in 0.1 m kpi (ph 7). assays of 32pi:pi exchange showed that antiport was subject to an inactivation which varied in severity according to the lipid present at solubilization. recovery of pi-linked exchange was improved by the presence of 10-20% glycerol or other osmolyte during extraction. the osmolytes tested in this regard have included polyols (glycerol, erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol), sugars (glucose, trehalose), and two amino acids (glycine, proline). each gave 10--20-fold increased recoveries of 32pi:pi antiport compared to controls using only detergent and lipid; these precautions were not required for the efficient reconstitution of f0f1-atpase. antiport in the artificial system was studied most carefully when glycerol was the stabilizing additive. for that case, the kt values for pi or 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate transport (275 and 25 microm, respectively) were the same as in native membranes. maximal rates of pi and 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate transport (200 and 42 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively) and the turnover number for pi exchange (25--50/s) suggested that antiporters were recovered without loss of activity. we conclude that the quantitative aspects of bacterial anion exchange are amenable to study in an artificial system, and that the use of osmolytes as general stabilants can be a valuable adjunct to current techniques for reconstitution of integral membrane transport proteins.

AB  == genes for lactose catabolism and proteinase production in streptococcus lactis 712 are encoded by a 56.5 kb metabolic plasmid, plp712. a lactose mini-plasmid of only 23.7 kb, pmg820, was constructed by introducing two deletions into plp712, and was cloned as two segments of dna into the escherichia coli vector pat153 using restriction endonuclease psti. the lactose genetic region of plp712, which  has been defined by deletion and restriction mapping, was cut into two parts by this process. when the smaller 10.8 kb segment of pmg820 dna was present, the key lactic streptococcal lactose splitting enzyme, phospho-beta-d-galactosidase, was  expressed in e. coli. the gene for phospho-beta-d-galactosidase was more precisely located by introducing a series of deletions into cloned dna by in vitro manipulations and then assaying for enzyme activity. the presence of this phospho-beta-d-galactosidase activity was correlated with the production of a 58  kda 35s-labelled protein both by e. coli minicells and after coupled transcription and translation of cloned dna. the product of a second gene, a 37 kda protein ('protein x'), and a possible truncated phospho-beta-d-galactosidase  protein of 16 kda were also detected in minicells.

TI  == selective advantages of various bacterial carbohydrate transport mechanisms.
AB  == at least four strategies have been developed by bacteria for capturing carbohydrates. they are typified by the transport mechanisms for glycerol, glucose, lactose, and galactose in escherichia coli. glycerol enters the cell by  facilitated diffusion catalyzed by specific membrane protein. once inside the cell, the substrate is trapped by phosphorylation mediated by an adenosine triphosphate (atp)-dependent kinase. glucose is phosphorylated in transit by a membrane-associated phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts). a specific component of this complex serves also for signal recognition to chemotaxis. lactose is concentrated chemically unaltered by beta-galactoside permease driven by a proton motive force. galactose is also pumped into the cell, but the process is energized by atp or its equivalent. in addition, there is a periplasmic galactose-binding protein essential for both transport and chemotactic response. the relative functional merits of each kind of transport mechanism are discussed. although many bacterial species possess both the concentrative mechanism and the pts, some employ the former and others the latter for beta-galactoside utilization. the postulate that the pts is more avid in scavenging while the concentrative permease system permits a broader range of substrate exploitation is supported by the growth responses of 12 bacterial strains to several beta-galactosides.

AB  == when cells of streptococcus lactis or escherichia coli were suspended in a potassium-free medium, a membrane potential (negative inside) could be artificially generated by the addition of the potassium ionophore, valinomycin. in response to this inward directed protonmotive force, atp synthesis catalyzed by the membrane-bound atpase (ec 3.6.1.3) was observed. the formation of atp was  not found in s. lactis that had been treated with the atpase inhibitor, n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, nor was it observed in a mutant of e. coli lacking the atpase. inhibition of atp synthesis in s. lactis was also observed when the membrane potential was reduced by the presence of external potassium, or when cells were first incubated with the proton conductor, carbonylcyanidefluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. these results are in agreement with  predictions made by the chemiosmotic hypothesis of mitchell.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of natural phenols and related compounds: obtusastyrene  and dihydro-obtusastyrene.
AB  == factors influencing the antimicrobial properties of obtusastyrene and dihydro-obtusastyrene were studied. both of these compounds were soluble in acetone, alcohol, and olive oil. in water, they were soluble at concentrations of 34 and 53 mug/ml, respectively. the minimal inhibitory concentrations against gram-positive bacteria and yeast were below 100 mug/ml. the compounds were not effective against gram-negative bacteria at 200 mug/ml or lower concentrations. with initial populations of cells greater than 10(6)/ml, the concentrations of these compounds required to prevent growth were greater than with lower cell populations. changing the ph of the growth medium did not decrease the effectiveness of these two compounds in the ph range of 3 through 8. both obtusastyrene and dihydro-obtusastyrene were rapidly bactericidal to staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus at 25 mug/ml.

TI  == stimulation of lactic streptococci in milk by -galactosidase.
AB  == acid production in milk by lactic streptococci was stimulated by added beta-galactosidase. both glucose and galactose accumulated rapidly in the presence of this enzyme. glucose accumulation ceased as the culture entered the most rapid period of acid production, whereas galactose accumulation continued. in cultures without added beta-galactosidase, a low concentration of galactose accumulated in the milk, whereas glucose was not detected after 2 hr of incubation. cultures grew and produced acid faster in broth containing glucose rather than galactose or lactose. these observations suggest that the lactic streptococci do not metabolize the lactose in milk efficiently enough to permit optimum acid production and that a phenomenon such as catabolite repression functions to allow for a preferential use of glucose over either galactose or lactose. in addition to providing the culture with a more readily available energy source, it is possible that the culture produced more acidic metabolites as a result of preferentially utilizing the glucose released by the action of the beta-galactosidase.

TI  == influence of antibiotics or certain intestinal bacteria on orally administered candida albicans in germ-free and conventional mice.
AB  == candida albicans, administered by gastric intubation, persisted in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic mice for long periods but was eliminated within a relatively short period of time in pathogen-free mice. oxytetracycline administered by mouth had no reproducible effect on the persistence of c. albicans in the gastrointestinal tract of either germ-free or pathogen-free mice. prolonged administration of streptomycin extended the time that c. albicans could be recovered from feces of pathogen-free mice when compared to mice not receiving the antibiotic or those receiving a single large dose. there was a brief interval of time during which c. albicans could not be recovered from the feces of gnotobiotic mice contaminated with certain intestinal bacteria, but eventually all mice began to shed the fungus again. c. albicans administered by mouth was not pathogenic for germ-free or pathogen-free mice. it can be concluded from these findings that mice do not possess an innate resistance to c. albicans but that pathogen-free mice do possess some ecological mechanism which prevents establishment of the fungus in their gastrointestinal tract. the reason for the difference in colonization of c. albicans in germ-free or gnotobiotic mice and pathogen-free mice was not determined.
