TI  == phylogenetic evidence for the transfer of eubacterium lentum to the genus eggerthella as eggerthella lenta gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  == eubacterium lentum has unique phenotypic characters within the genus eubacterium. the 16s rrna sequence of eubacterium lentum was determined and its phylogenetic position was defined. this micro-organism is a member of the genus eubacterium but it is not closely related to eubacterium limosum, the type species of the genus eubacterium, and is nearer to collinsella aerofaciens and coriobacterium glomerans. a pcr-based identification system using species-specific primers designed on the basis of dna sequences encoding the 16s rrna of strains of eubacterium lentum, collinsella aerofaciens and coriobacterium glomerans is described. a species-specific primer set can distinguish eubacterium lentum from  eubacterium limosum or closely related species including collinsella aerofaciens, coriobacterium glomerans and atopobium species. this species-specific pcr method  can be used to identify eubacterium lentum-like species isolated from human faeces. on the basis of the 16s rrna sequence divergence from collinsella aerofaciens and coriobacterium glomerans and the presence of unique phenotypic characters, a new genus, eggerthella gen. nov., is proposed for eubacterium lentum, with one species, eggerthella lenta comb. nov. the type strain of eggerthella lenta is jcm 9979t.
