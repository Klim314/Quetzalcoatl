TI  == administration of bifidobacterium breve ps12929 and lactobacillus salivarius ps12934, two strains isolated from human milk, to very low and extremely low birth weight preterm infants: a pilot study.
AB  == the preterm infant gut has been described as immature and colonized by an aberrant microbiota. therefore, the use of probiotics is an attractive practice in hospitals to try to reduce morbidity and mortality in this population. the objective of this pilot study was to elucidate if administration of two probiotic strains isolated from human milk to preterm infants led to their presence in feces. in addition, the evolution of a wide spectrum of immunological compounds,  including the inflammatory biomarker calprotectin, in both blood and fecal samples was also assessed. for this purpose, five preterm infants received two daily doses (~10(9) cfu) of a 1:1 mixture of bifidobacterium breve ps12929 and lactobacillus salivarius ps12934. bacterial growth was detected by culture-dependent techniques in all the fecal samples. the phylum firmicutes dominated in nearly all fecal samples while l. salivarius ps12934 was detected in all the infants at numerous sample collection points and b. breve ps12929 appeared in five fecal samples. finally, a noticeable decrease in the fecal calprotectin levels was observed along time.

TI  == immunomodulatory effects of lactobacillus salivarius ls01 and bifidobacterium breve br03, alone and in combination, on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of allergic asthmatics.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate probiotic characteristics of lactobacillus  salivarius ls01 and bifidobacterium breve br03 alone and in combination and their immunomodulatory activity in asthmatic subjects. subjects affected by allergic asthma were recruited. initially, ls01 and br03 were analyzed for their growth compatibility by a broth compatibility assay. to study the antimicrobial activity of probiotic strains, an agar diffusion assay was performed. finally, cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) stimulated with ls01 and br03 was determined by means of specific quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the growth of some clinical pathogens were slightly inhibited by ls01 and ls01-br03 co-culture supernatant not neutralized to ph 6.5, while only the growth of e. coli and s. aureus was inhibited by the supernatant of ls01 and  ls01-br03 neutralized to ph 6.5. furthermore, ls01 and br03 combination was able  to decrease the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by pbmcs, leading to an intense increase in il-10 production. l. salivarius ls01 and b. breve br03 showed promising probiotic properties and beneficial immunomodulatory activity that are  increased when the 2 strains are used in combination in the same formulation.

TI  == lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in human breast milk: influence of antibiotherapy and other host and clinical factors.
AB  == objective: the objective of this work was to study the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria population in human milk of healthy women, and to investigate the  influence that several factors (including antibioteraphy during pregnancy and lactation, country and date of birth, delivery mode, or infant age) may exert on  such population. methods: a total of 160 women living in germany or austria provided the breast milk samples. initially, 66 samples were randomly selected and cultured on mrs-cys agar plates. then, the presence of dna from the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, and from most of the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species that were isolated, was assessed by qualitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using genus- and species-specific primers. results: lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could be isolated from the milk of 27 (40.91%) and 7 (10.61%), respectively, of the 66 cultured samples. on the contrary, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sequences were detected by pcr in 108 (67.50%) and 41 (25.62%), respectively, of the 160 samples analyzed. the lactobacillus species most frequently isolated and detected was l salivarius (35.00%), followed by l fermentum (25.00%) and l gasseri (21.88%), whereas b breve (13.75%) was the bifidobacterial species most commonly recovered and whose  dna was most regularly found. the number of lactobacilli- or bifidobacteria-positive samples was significantly lower in women who had received antibiotherapy during pregnancy or lactation. conclusions: our results suggest that either the presence of lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria or their dna may constitute good markers of a healthy human milk microbiota that has not been altered by the use of antibiotics.

TI  == effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: a bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  == background and objectives: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients may be modulated by probiotics. we assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic ibs symptoms. material and methods: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating ibs symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (smds) with 95% confidence intervals (95% cis), where appropriate. the random-effects model was employed in  cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. results: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. probiotics improved pain scores if they contained bifidobacterium breve (smd, - 0.34; 95% ci, - 0.66; -0.02), bifidobacterium longum (smd, -0.48; 95% ci, - 0.91; -0.06), or lactobacillus acidophilus (smd, -0.31; 95% ci, -0.61;  -0.01) species. distension scores were improved by probiotics containing b. breve (smd, -0.45; 95% ci, -0.77; -0.13), bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus plantarum (smd, -0.53; 95% ci, -1.00; -0.06) species. all probiotic species tested improved flatulence: b. breve (smd, -0.42; 95% ci, -0.75;- 0.10), b. infantis, l. casei, l. plantarum (smd, -0.60; 95% ci, -1.07; -0.13), b. longum, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (smd, -0.61; 95% ci, -1.01; -0.21). there was not a  clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. conclusions:  some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for ibs patients, and the effects on each ibs symptom are likely species-specific. future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.

TI  == probiotics reduce gut microbial translocation and improve adult atopic dermatitis.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that probiotics modulate atopic dermatitis (ad) progression, but no data are actually available on their mechanisms of action and on their ability to act as immunomodulators in this pathology. objective: the aim of this randomized double-blinded active treatment versus placebo study was to evaluate clinical efficacy of an intake of a combination of 2 probiotics (lactobacillus salivarius ls01 and bifidobacterium breve br03) for the treatment  of adult ad patients. methods: forty-eight patients were enrolled in the study (randomization ratio 2:1) and treated with a combination (ls01 and br03) or placebo (maltodextrin) for 12 weeks. clinical efficacy was assessed from baseline by changes in the scorad index and dlq index improvement. analysis on the gut permeability barrier, immunologic parameters, and changes in fecal microbiota and recovery of probiotics were performed at baseline, at the end of therapy, and 2 months later. results: patients receiving probiotics showed a significant improvement in clinical parameters (scorad, p<0.0001 and dlq index, p=0.021) from baseline. the probiotics reduced microbial translocation (p=0.050), immune activation (p<0.001), improved t-helper cell (th)17/regulatory t cell (treg) (p=0.029) and th1/th2 (p=0.028) ratios. none of these changes were observed in the placebo group. conclusions: our results suggest that this specific mixture of probiotics (ls01 and br03 strains) may induce beneficial effects for clinical and immunologic alterations in adult ad. this combination could be considered as adjuvant therapy for the treatment of ad in adult patients.

TI  == in vitro assessment of the immunomodulatory effects of multispecies probiotic formulations for management of allergic diseases.
AB  == modulation of the composition of the intestinal microbiota with probiotics could  possibly offer a way of prevention or management of allergic diseases. the objective of this study was to determine the immunomodulating effects of various  multispecies probiotic combinations in vitro, as preamble to application in vivo. multispecies probiotic combinations were formulated and tested for their effects  on in vitro cytokine production by human mononuclear cells and were compared to products that already have shown beneficial effects in vivo. all 4 tested combinations of probiotics showed a 40-71% decrease of th2 cytokine production (il-4, il-5, and il-13) and a variable increase of th1 (ifn-gamma) and treg cytokine (il-10) production compared to the medium. a specific probiotic mixture  that contained bifidobacterium breve w25, bifidobacterium lactis atcc sd 5219, b. lactis atcc sd 5220, lactobacillus plantarum w62, lactobacillus salivarius w57 and lactococcus lactis w19 was superior in its stimulating effect on il-10 production (significant better than the other tested combinations; p=0.001). modulation of in vitro cytokine production profiles can be used to differentiate  between selected probiotic formulations for their immunomodulatory properties. in the future it should be demonstrated whether the immunomodulatory capacities from the multispecies probiotic formulation with the desired profile will be effective in vivo (in adolescents, followed by application in children).

TI  == the probiotic bifidobacterium infantis 35624 displays visceral antinociceptive effects in the rat.
AB  == background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and altering bowel habit with a high percentage of patients displaying comorbid anxiety. growing clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that probiotic agents may restore the altered brain-gut communication in ibs. in  this study, we evaluated the efficacy of repeated treatment with three different  probiotics in reducing visceral pain in visceral normosensitive (sprague-dawley [sd]) and visceral hypersensitive (wistar-kyoto [wky]) rat strains. methods: following 14 days oral gavage of lactobacillus salivarius ucc118, bifidobacterium infantis 35624, or bifidobacterium breve ucc2003 both sd and wky rats were exposed to a novel stress, the open field arena and their behavior was recorded.  subsequently, the effects of probiotics on visceral nociceptive responses were analyzed by recording pain behaviors during colorectal distension (crd). key results: it was found that there was a difference in the open field behavior between strains but none of the probiotic treatment altered behavior within each  strain. interestingly, the probiotic b. infantis 35624 but not others tested significantly reduced crd-induced visceral pain behaviors in both rat strains. it significantly increased the threshold pressure of the first pain behavior and also reduced the total number pain behaviors during crd. conclusions & inferences: these data confirm that probiotics such as b. infantis 35624 are effective in reducing visceral pain and may be effective in treating certain symptoms of ibs.

TI  == bacterial strain-specific induction of foxp3+ t regulatory cells is protective in murine allergy models.
AB  == background: the incidence of atopic disease has increased dramatically during recent decades and the potential immunoregulatory influence of the microbiota in  these individuals is under investigation. objective: the aim of our study was to  identify a bacterial strain that is protective in murine allergy models and to determine if microbial induction of t regulatory cells was associated with protection from allergic inflammation. methods: three microbes (bifidobacterium breve ah1205, b. longum ah1206 and lactobacillus salivarius ah102) of human origin were fed to newborn, adult and germ-free animals. induction of foxp3(+) t  regulatory cells was assessed by flow cytometry. gene array analysis was performed on peyer's patches. strains were also examined for their protective effects in the ovalbumin (ova) respiratory allergy model and the ova-cholera toxin dietary allergy model. results: bifidobacterium longum ah1206 consumption resulted in increased numbers of foxp3(+) t regulatory cells in infant, adult and germ-free animals. b. breve ah1205 induced foxp3(+) t regulatory cell expansion only in infant mice while l. salivarius ah102 did not alter t regulatory cell numbers in any animal model tested. b. longum ah1206 reduced the peyer's patch gene expression associated with antigen presentation, tlr signalling and cytokine production while increasing the expression of genes associated with retinoic acid metabolism. b. longum ah1206 protected against airway inflammation in ova-sensitized animals and b. longum ah1206 blocked the induction of ige to orally administered ova. neither b. breve ah1205 nor l. salivarius ah102 had a protective effect in either model. conclusion: bacterial strain-specific induction of foxp3(+) t regulatory cells in vivo is associated with protection from respiratory and oral allergy.

TI  == bacterial signalling overrides cytokine signalling and modifies dendritic cell differentiation.
AB  == heterogeneity of dendritic cells (dc) is evident in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue and determined, in part, by incompletely understood local environmental factors. bacterial signalling is likely to be a dominant influence on precursor cells when recruited to the mucosa. we assessed the influence of commensal bacteria on dc differentiation and function. murine bone marrow progenitors were  exposed to lactobacillus salivarius, bifidobacterium breve or bifidobacterium infantis. differences in cell surface phenotype and function were assessed. myeloid differentiation factor 88(-/-) (myd88) cells were used to determine the influence of toll-like receptor signalling. while bacterial strains varied in impact, there was a consistent dose-dependent inhibition of dc differentiation with a shift toward a gr-1(+) cd11b(+) monocyte-like phenotype. a single bacterium on a per cell basis (1 : 1) was sufficient to alter cell phenotype. the effect was only evident in early precursors. enhanced interleukin-10 production correlated with increased forkhead box p3 expression and reduced t-cell proliferation. the bacterial effect on dc differentiation was found to be myd88-dependent. signalling by enteric commensals through pattern recognition receptors on precursor cells alters dc differentiation and results in cells that  are phenotypically monocyte-like and functionally suppressive. this may account for some of the features of mucosal immune tolerance to the microbiota.

TI  == effects of rosa rugosa petals on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the effects of pulverized petal of rosa rugosa on the growth of 10 species of intestinal and pathogenic bacteria were investigated. growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was not affected by the addition of the petal in plate cultivation. however, the growth of bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05% (w/v) of the petal respectively. in liquid cultivation, the addition of the petal (0.5%) stimulated the growth of bifidobacterium breve and slightly inhibited the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. but the growth of e. coli, s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp. was inhibited by nearly 50%. hydrolyzable tannins isolated from r. rugosa, rugosin d, and tellimagradin ii showed antibacterial activities against e. coli,  s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp., but little or no effect against bif. breve and l. salivarius. r. rugosa petal showed selective antibacterial activities against intestinal and pathogenic bacteria, and the selectivity resembled that of prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and dietary fiber. hydrolyzable tannins in r. rugosa, such as rugosin d and tellimagradin ii, must be active constituents.

TI  == in vitro inhibition activity of nisin a, nisin z, pediocin pa-1 and antibiotics against common intestinal bacteria.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the sensitivity of 21 common intestinal bacteria to six antibiotics and three broad-spectrum bacteriocins (nisins z and a and pediocin pa-1). methods and results: neutralized cell-free culture supernatants containing active bacteriocins, and antibiotics were tested with the agar diffusion test and the disc-diffusion method, respectively. the tested intestinal strains showed high sensitivity to most antibiotics except for streptomycin and oxacillin. nisins a and z (8 mug per well) had similar activity spectra and inhibited all gram-positive intestinal bacteria at different levels (except streptococcus salivarius), with bifidobacteria (except bifidobacterium breve and bif. catenulatum), collinsella aerofaciens and eubacterium biforme being the most sensitive strains, but they were not active against gram-negative bacteria. surprisingly, none of the tested strains were inhibited by pediocin pa-1 (16 mug  per well). conclusion: pediocin pa-1 which is very active against listeria spp. and other food pathogens did not inhibit major intestinal species in the human intestine in contrast to both nisins a and z. significance and impact of the study: our data suggest that pediocin pa-1 has potential to inhibit listeria within the intestinal microbiota without altering commensal bacteria.

TI  == spotlight on vsl#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, and b. infantis), and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == mechanism of growth inhibition by free bile acids in lactobacilli and bifidobacteria.
AB  == the effects of the free bile acids (fbas) cholic acid (ca), deoxycholic acid (dca), and chenodeoxycholic acid on the bioenergetics and growth of lactobacilli  and bifidobacteria were investigated. it was found that these fbas reduced the internal ph levels of these bacteria with rapid and stepwise kinetics and, at certain concentrations, dissipated deltaph. the bile acid concentrations that dissipated deltaph corresponded with the mics for the selected bacteria. unlike acetate, propionate, and butyrate, fbas dissipated the transmembrane electrical potential (deltapsi). in bifidobacterium breve jcm 1192, the synthetic proton conductor pentachlorophenol (pcp) dissipated deltaph with a slow and continuous kinetics at a much lower concentration than fbas did, suggesting the difference in mode of action between fbas and true proton conductors. membrane damage assessed by the fluorescence method and a viability decrease were also observed upon exposure to ca or dca at the mic but not to pcp or a short-chain fatty acid  mixture. loss of potassium ion was observed at ca concentrations more than 2 mm (0.4x mic), while leakage of other cellular components increased at ca concentrations more than 4 mm (0.8 x mic). additionally, in experiments with membrane phospholipid vesicles extracted from lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius jcm 1044, ca and dca at the mic collapsed the deltaph with concomitant leakage of intravesicular fluorescent ph probe, while they did not show proton conductance at a lower concentration range (e.g., 0.2x mic). taking these observations together, we conclude that fbas at the mic disturb membrane integrity and that this effect can lead to leakage of proton (membrane deltaph and deltapsi dissipation), potassium ion, and other cellular components and eventually cell death.

TI  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
