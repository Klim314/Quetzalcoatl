TI  - Bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. However, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. OBJECTIVE: To determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. STUDY DESIGN: Tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. RESULTS: Aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). Specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; P < 0.01). Bacteria belonging to the Bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). Other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were Peptostreptococcus micros (66%), Bilophila wadsworthia (63%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (44%), Eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing Gram-negative rod (41%). Of the aerobes Escherichia coli (88%) and Streptococcus anginosus group (former Streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. CONCLUSIONS: The shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. The unusually high frequencies of B. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing Gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.
