TI  == macedovicin, the second food-grade lantibiotic produced by streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198.
AB  == streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 was found to produce a second lantibiotic named macedovicin in addition to macedocin. macedovicin was purified to homogeneity and mass spectrometric analysis identified a peptide of approximately 3.4 kda. partial n-terminal sequence analysis and tandem mass spectrometry revealed that macedovicin was identical to bovicin hj50 and thermophilin 1277 produced by streptococcus bovis and streptococcus thermophilus, respectively. macedovicin inhibits a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria, several food spoilage species (e.g. clostridium spp.) and oral streptococci. we determined the complete biosynthetic gene cluster of macedovicin. even though the gene clusters  of macedovicin, thermophilin 1277 and bovicin hj50 were almost identical at the nucleotide level, there were important differences in their predicted genes and proteins. bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics were also found to be encoded by streptococcus suis strains sc84 and d12, enterococcus columbae plch2, clostridium perfringens jgs1721 and several bacillus strains. all these lantibiotics contained a number of conserved amino acids that may be important for their biosynthesis and activity, while phylogenetic analysis supported their dispersion by horizontal gene transfer. in conclusion, the production of multiple bacteriocins may enhance the bio-protective potential of s. macedonicus during food fermentation.

TI  == molecular analysis of yogurt containing lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus in human intestinal microbiota.
AB  == background: yogurt has traditionally been considered a probiotic-carrier food with health-promoting effects. despite the universal assumption of this assertion, several researchers have evaluated the real capability of the yogurt bacteria lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus to survive and proliferate in the human intestine and have found contradictory results. objective: this double-blind crossover study assessed the  qualitative and quantitative effects of fresh and heat-treated yogurt on bacterial intestinal microbiota from healthy subjects. design: the subjects were  divided into experimental (n=63) and control (n=16) groups. the experimental group consumed fresh and heat-treated yogurt for 15 d according to a crossover design with a washout period of 2 wk. three different fecal samples per individual were recovered: at baseline, after fresh yogurt intake, and after heat-treated yogurt intake. qualitative changes in microbiota were studied by denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (dgge) with universal and lactic acid bacteria (lab) 16s-rrna primers. quantitative changes in lab, clostridium coccoides, clostridium perfringens, and bacteroides groups were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a particular dgge stable band pattern was observed in each sample. no significant qualitative differences were  detected in any fecal sample. however, a significantly higher density of lab and  c. perfringens and a significant decrease in the density of bacteroides was observed after consumption of both types of yogurt. microbiota density was not significantly different between the fresh and heat-treated yogurt groups, except  for lab, which was significantly greater in the fresh yogurt group. conclusion: the main change in human microbiota observed after yogurt consumption was an increase in the density of lab and c. perfringens to the detriment of bacteroides. bacterial changes were not different after the consumption of fresh  and heat-treated yogurt.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == effects of probiotic administration upon the composition and enzymatic activity of human fecal microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome or functional diarrhea.
AB  == in a clinical trial, 10 patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome or functional diarrhea were administered the probiotic preparation vsl-3. preliminary results indicated that administration of vsl-3 improved the clinical  picture and changed the composition and biochemistry of fecal microbiota. titer variations of intestinal bacterial groups were evaluated by culture and pcr techniques. a significant increase in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and streptococcus thermophilus was observed as a consequence of probiotic treatment,  while enterococci, coliforms, bacteroides and clostridium perfringens did not change significantly. the strains bifidobacterium infantis y1 and bifidobacterium breve y8, included in vsl-3, were specifically detected in feces of patients treated with the probiotic by using strain-specific pcr primers. in addition, fecal beta-galactosidase increased and urease activities decreased as a result of changes in the intestinal microbiota induced by vsl-3 administration.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == cell-free whey from milk fermented with bifidobacterium breve c50 used to modify  the colonic microflora of healthy subjects.
AB  == the ingestion of viable bacteria is thought to be required to modify intestinal microflora. in the present study, the effects on fecal flora of consumption of cell-free concentrated whey from milk that had been fermented with bifidobacterium breve c50 was tested using 10 healthy human volunteers. results were compared with effects of a commercial milk formula that had been fermented with streptococcus thermophilus and b. breve c50 and given to 10 control subjects. nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase activities were assessed as risk  indexes for colon carcinogenesis, and beta-galactosidase was measured as an indicator of the fermentation capacity of the colonic flora. fecal excretion of bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and clostridial spores decreased after 7 d of consumption of either preparation; however, counts of bifidobacteria only increased after intake of b. breve whey. fecal ph was reduced from 7.1 +/- 0.2 to 6.6 +/- 0.3 after intake of whey that had been fermented with bif. breve.  fecal nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase significantly decreased, and beta-galactosidase activity increased, after consumption of either preparation. the results indicate that ingestion of viable bifidobacteria was not required to  modify intestinal flora of humans. repression of b. fragilis and clostridia seems to be independent of colonic bifidobacterial overgrowth in humans.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from  nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains  of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
