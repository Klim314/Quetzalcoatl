TI  == lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei lc01 positively modulates intestinal microflora in healthy young adults.
AB  == lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei lc01 (lc01) can tolerate intestinal stresses and has antioxidant activity. to evaluate the effect of the bacterium on human intestinal microflora, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial was carried out. fifty-two healthy adult volunteers were randomized equally to two groups. one group consumed 12% (wt/vol) skimmed milk supplemented with 10(10) cfu of lc01 each day for the 4-week treatment period, and then consumed placebo in the next treatment period, separated by a 2-week washout. the other group followed the reverse order. group-specific real-time pcr and biochemical analyses was used to determine the intestinal bacterial composition of fecal samples collected at the end of every period, and the concentration of short-chain fatty acids and ammonia. a significant inhibition in fecal escherichia coli and increase in lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and roseburia intestinalis were observed after consumption of lc01. acetic acid and butyric acid were significantly higher in the probiotic stage and fecal ammonia was significantly lower. the results indicated a modulation effect of lc01 on the intestinal microflora of young adults, suggesting a beneficial effect on bowel health. lc01 may have potential value as a probiotic.

TI  == detection of possible ai-2-mediated quorum sensing system in commensal intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the vibrio harveyi strain bb170-autoinducer bioassay was used to detect possible  quorum sensing autoinducer-2 molecule (ai-2) in culture fluids of commensal intestinal bacteria. culture fluids of bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium proteoclasticum, escherichia coli, eubacterium rectale, lachnospira multipara, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, roseburia intestinalis, ruminococcus albus and ruminococcus flavefaciens contained ai-2-like molecules. the pcr bands from some  of the tested strains could be also amplified using primers designed for the luxs gene. these findings suggest that ai-2 is present in the gastrointestinal tract;  however, it has not yet been proved whether it is used for bacterial cell-to-cell communication.
