TI  - [Microbiological external quality assurance program (MEQAP)--evaluation of results obtained in sanitary epidemiological laboratories in 2002].
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate reliability of identification and determination of sensitivity to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of some Gram positive cocci strains in 34 sanitary-epidemiological stations. All laboratories engaged in this study received 3 strains: S. aureus (S. aureus SC+ CF+, resistant to methicillin., or S. aureus SC - CF+, sensitive to methicillin), coagulase-negative staphylococci (S. epidermidis or S. haemolyticus or S. saprophyticus) and Enterococcus sp. (E. faecalis HLAR-positive or E. faecalis HLAR-negative or E. faecium or E. gallinarum). All these strains previously were identified in Department of Bacteriology of National Institute of Hygiene. Of the 68 staphylococci strains tested, 66 isolates were correctly identified. Among the 34 enterococcal strains studied the greatest difficulty in identification was caused by E. gallinarum strain--(8 out of 13 strains were incorrectly recognised). The determination of the sensitivity of the control strains to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents, generally was performed correctly in accordance with to the NCCLS and national recommendations. Some incorrect results of the antibiograms were caused by an erroneous interpretation of the zones of inhibition.
TI  - Proficiency of Italian clinical laboratories in detecting reduced glycopeptide susceptibility in Enterococcus and Staphylococcus spp. using routine laboratory methodologies.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of 59 clinical microbiology laboratories distributed throughout Italy to correctly identify and detect reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in staphylococci and VanA-, VanB- or VanC-mediated glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. METHODS: Eight test strains comprising three staphylococci (S. aureus ATCC 29212 and two vancomycin-intermediate S. haemolyticus [11105301, 10030683Y]) and five enterococci (E. faecalis ATCC 29212, E. faecalis ATCC 51299 VanB, E. faecium AIB40 VanA, E. faecalis V583 VanB and E. gallinarum AIB39 VanC1) were distributed to 59 Italian clinical microbiology laboratories. Each isolate was blind-coded, and laboratories were instructed to identify the strains and test isolates for susceptibility to teicoplanin and vancomycin using their standard methods. Results were assessed against consensus test results obtained by a reference laboratory. In addition, to complement data interpretation, laboratories were asked to provide retrospective routine test results from their respective hospitals. RESULTS: All 59 laboratories participating in the study completed the susceptibility testing and provided data for analysis. A total of 53 laboratories provided retrospective routine data. Overall, laboratories were able to identify isolates to the genus level successfully. E. gallinarum and S. haemolyticus posed problems for species identification, with only 40.6 and 71.2%, respectively, of results reported correctly; most incorrect results were reported as 'other species'. For enterococcal test strains, VanA phenotypes were detected correctly by 96.6% of laboratories; VanB by 30.5% (E. faecalis ATCC 51299) and 88.1% (E. faecalis V583); and VanC1 by 67.8%. For staphylococcal test strains, 28.8% (S. haemolyticus 11105301) and 23.7% (S. haemolyticus 10030683Y) of the laboratories were able to detect reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Errors in detecting vancomycin resistance in VanB and VanC1 enterococci were made with all methods, most noticeably by disk diffusion users. For staphylococci, most errors in reporting vancomycin-intermediate resistance occurred with disk diffusion and Vitek (software version 5.04) users. Overall, considerably fewer errors occurred with the detection of teicoplanin resistance, especially for staphylococci. For 1999, routine results show that 41/1749 (2.4%) of E. faecium, 220/11 180 (2.0%) of E. faecalis, 29/24 927 (0.12%) of S. aureus and 54/22 102 (0.24%) of coagulase-negative staphylococci were reported as resistant to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Italian laboratories are able to identify staphylococci and enterococci adequately, although all methodologies used have problems in identifying E. gallinarum and coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level. While VanA phenotypes were efficiently detected, problems were experienced in detecting VanB and VanC phenotypes. The majority of laboratories were unable to detect reduced vancomycin susceptibility in staphylococci adequately, especially with disk diffusion and older Vitek systems. Teicoplanin appeared useful as a marker for detecting vancomycin resistance, particularly with disk diffusion. Should enterococcal VanB or staphylococcal glycopeptide-intermediate phenotypes become prevalent in Italy, it is likely that they would be under-detected. New systems under development, such as Vitek2, should improve this situation.
TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar (NCCLS/EUCAST) and on Isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/L free calcium (BSAC). Both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. Daptomycin MICs for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/L. For 99 of the 100 enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; Enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/L. For all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin MICs were 0.016- 0.25 mg/L; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/L. For miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp. and isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin MICs were 0.03-2 mg/L; MICs for the seven isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/L. There was little difference between the results on Mueller-Hinton agar and on supplemented Isotonic agar The discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented Isotonic agar. Daptomycin was active (MICs < or = 2 mg/L) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of E. faecium and L. monocytogenes (MICs = 4 mg/L). Our results indicate that daptomycin MICs are independent of methicillin and vancomycin MICs.
TI  - [Determination of the susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to plycopeptides by the E-test method].
AB  - E-test was evaluated by comparison with the reference agar dilution method on 15  enterococci and 15 staphylococci with variable resistance to glycopeptides and isolated from clinical samples: 15 enterococci with 3 glycopeptide-resistant (2 E. facalis and 1 E. faecium), 1 glycopeptide intermediate E. gallinarum and 11 glycopeptide-sensible E. faecalis; 15 staphylococci with 4 teicoplanine-resistant (1 S. aureus, 1 S. epidermidis and 2 S. hominis), 3 teicoplanin-intermediate (1 S. epidermidis, 2 S. haemolyticus) and 8 teicoplanin sensible strains (6 S. aureus, 1 S. epidermidis and 1 S. hominis). Repeatability (10 determinations by strain) and exactitude were tested for all strains. Our data shows very good results for repeatability and exactitude with the reference method except in the case of coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanin. Some technical problems appear in our experience: for staphylococci, a 48 h incubation is necessary to detect teicoplanin-intermediate strains but 24 h is sufficient for enterococci. E-test is expensive, require a strict methodology, but is a good method to detect glycopeptide resistance for staphylococci and enterococci except for coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanine.
