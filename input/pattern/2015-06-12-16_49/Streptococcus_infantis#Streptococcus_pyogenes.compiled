TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Fast detection of Salmonella Infantis with carbon nanotube field effect transistors.
AB  - In this paper we report a fast, sensitive and label-free biosensor for the selective determination of Salmonella Infantis. It is based on a field effect transistor (FET) in which a network of single-walled carbon nantotubes (SWCNTs) acts as the conductor channel. Anti-Salmonella antibodies were adsorbed onto the SWCNTs and subsequently the SWCNTs were protected with Tween 20 to prevent the non-specific binding of other bacteria or proteins. Our FET devices were exposed to increasing concentrations of S. Infantis and were able to detect at least 100 cfu/mL in 1h. To evaluate the selectivity of our FET devices, Streptococcus pyogenes and Shigella sonnei were tested as potential competing bacteria for Salmonella. At a concentration of 500 cfu/mL, neither Streptococcus nor Shigella interfered with the detection of Salmonella. Therefore, these devices could be used as useful label-free platforms to detect S. Infantis and, by using the suitable antibody, other bacteria or viruses.
TI  - Current status of melanoma treatment with interferon, cytokines and other biologic response modifiers in Japan.
AB  - This paper introduces the current status of melanoma treatment with various biologic response modifiers (BRMs) in Japan, with an emphasis on the clinical results of Interferon therapies. The authors also refer briefly to the current situation of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in Japan. Many BRMs have been used in treatment of melanoma, e.g., IFN, IL-2, TNFs, BCG, MY-1 (DNA extracted from BCG), WPG (CWs of Bifidobacterium infantis, ATCC 15697), OK-432 (Picibanil, Streptococcus pyogenes preparation), bestatin, and forphenicinol. Some of these have completed clinical trials, while others are still undergoing clinical testing. Among IFN-alpha, beta, and gamma, intralesional administration of natural IFN-beta was found to be more effective than IFN-alpha for metastatic skin melanoma, the survival time of patients being prolonged by the administration of IFN-beta. IFN-gamma appeared to have lower efficacy than IFN-alpha and beta. The frequency of BRM application to melanoma treatment will increase. The authors foresee that combinations with radio- and/or other chemotherapy will be more common than the single use of a BRM, especially in the case of IFN.
