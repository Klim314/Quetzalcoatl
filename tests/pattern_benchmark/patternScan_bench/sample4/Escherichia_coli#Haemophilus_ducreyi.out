haemophilus ducreyi is resistant to human antimicrobial peptides.
we examined the susceptibility of haemophilus ducreyi to antimicrobial peptides likely to be encountered in vivo during human infection. h. ducreyi was significantly more resistant than escherichia coli to the bactericidal effects of all peptides tested. class i and ii h. ducreyi strains exhibited similar levels of resistance to antimicrobial peptides.
