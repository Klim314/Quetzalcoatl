TI  == a case of necrotizing fasciitis due to streptococcus agalactiae, arcanobacterium  haemolyticum, and finegoldia magna in a dog-bitten patient with diabetes.
AB  == we report a case of necrotizing fasciitis involving streptococcus agalactiae, arcanobacterium haemolyticum, and finegoldia magna in a 36-yr-old female diabetic patient, which started after a minor dog bite to the toe of the patient. this case suggested that a trivial infection after a minor dog bite in an immunocompromised patient such as diabetes patient could result in a significant  complication such as necrotizing fasciitis. the life-threatening infection was cured by timely above-the-knee amputation, as well as penicillin g and clindamycin therapy.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin.
AB  == background: telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of l-cladinose and a c(11)-c(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. we evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. methods: in the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against  180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), finegoldia magna (n = 20), bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin a, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. in the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by b. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). results: in the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of s. agalactiae, e. faecalis, n. gonorrhoeae, p. anaerobius, f. magna, b. fragilis and p. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. in the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. conclusions: these in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.
