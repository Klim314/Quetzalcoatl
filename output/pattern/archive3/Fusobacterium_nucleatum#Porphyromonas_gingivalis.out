essential oils and isolated compounds from lippia alba leaves and flowers: antimicrobial activity and osteoclast apoptosis.
in the present study, essential oils extracted from the leaves and flowers of lippia alba (mill.) n.e.br. (l. alba) were analyzed for their antimicrobial activity and their effects on osteoclasts. the periodontal pathogens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans; atcc 43717), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum; atcc 25586) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis); atcc 33277) were used in antimicrobial activity assays for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc), whereas bacteroides fragilis (b. fragilis; atcc 25285) was used as the control microorganism. osteoclast (oc) apoptosis was assessed by tunel assay and fas receptor expression was detected by immunocytochemistry. the analysis of antimicrobial activity revealed that p. gingivalis had the lowest mic values, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans had the highest. l. alba essential oils were found to be toxic to human cells, although the compounds, carvone, limonene and citral, were non-toxic and induced apoptosis in the ocs. this study demonstrates that l. alba has potential biotechnological application in dentistry. in fact periodontal disease has a multifactorial etiology, and the immune response to microbial challenge leads to osteoclast activation and the resorption of the alveolar bone, resulting in tooth loss.
nanoparticle-encapsulated chlorhexidine against oral bacterial biofilms.
background: chlorhexidine (chx) is a widely used antimicrobial agent in dentistry. herein, we report the synthesis of a novel mesoporous silica nanoparticle-encapsulated pure chx (nano-chx), and its mechanical profile and antimicrobial properties against oral biofilms. methodology/principal findings: the release of chx from the nano-chx was characterized by uv/visible absorption spectroscopy. the antimicrobial properties of nano-chx were evaluated in both planktonic and biofilm modes of representative oral pathogenic bacteria. the nano-chx demonstrated potent antibacterial effects on planktonic bacteria and mono-species biofilms at the concentrations of 50-200 microg/ml against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and enterococccus faecalis. moreover, nano-chx effectively suppressed multi-species biofilms such as s. mutans, f. nucleatum, a. actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis up to 72 h. conclusions/significance: this pioneering study demonstrates the potent antibacterial effects of the nano-chx on oral biofilms, and it may be developed as a novel and promising anti-biofilm agent for clinical use.
the interaction of implant luting cements and oral bacteria linked to peri-implant disease: an in vitro analysis of planktonic and biofilm growth - a preliminary study.
background: there is little consensus on the most appropriate cement to use when  restoring a cement-retained, implant-supported restoration. one consideration should be the interaction of pathogenic oral bacteria with restorative cements. purpose: to determine how oral bacteria associated with peri-implant disease grow in the presence of implant cements. materials and methods: five test cements with varying composition (zinc oxide-eugenol [tbo], eugenol-free zinc oxide [tbne], zinc orthophosphate [fl], and two resin cements [pic and ml]) were used to fabricate specimen disks. the disks were submerged in bacterial suspensions of either aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, or porphyromonas gingivalis. planktonic bacterial growth within the test media was measured by determining the optical density of the cultures (od600 ). positive controls (media and bacteria without cement disks) and negative controls (media alone) were similarly evaluated. the mean and standard deviations (sd) were calculated for planktonic growth from three separate experiments. anova statistical analysis with post hoc tukey tests was performed where differences existed (p < .05). selected cement disks (tbo and ml) were further examined for bacterial biofilm growth. surface bacteria were removed and grown on agar media, and colony-forming units (cfus) were quantified. results: planktonic growth for both a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis was significantly inhibited (p < .05) when grown in the presence of cement disks consisting of tbne, pic, fl, and tbo. in contrast, neither of these bacteria displayed growth inhibition in the presence of ml cement disks. f. nucleatum growth was also significantly inhibited by pic, fl. and tbo (p < .05), but not by ml and tbne cement disks. cfu counts for the biofilm study for tbo gave minimal and, in some instances, no bacterial adherence and growth, in contrast to ml, which supported substantially greater bacterial biofilm growth. conclusion: cements display differing abilities to inhibit both planktonic and biofilm bacterial growth. cements with the ability to reduce planktonic or biofilm growth of the test bacteria may be advantageous in reducing peri-implant disease. understanding the microbial growth-inhibiting characteristics of different cement types should be considered important in the selection criteria.
phototargeting human periodontal pathogens in vivo.
the effects of blue light at 455 nm were investigated on the bacterial composition of human dental plaque in vivo. eleven subjects who refrained from brushing for 3 days before and during phototherapy participated in the study. light with a power density of 70 mw/cm(2) was applied to the buccal surfaces of premolar and molar teeth on one side of the mouth twice daily for 2 min over a period of 4 days. dental plaque was harvested at baseline and again at the end of 4 days from eight posterior teeth on both the exposed side and unexposed sides of the mouth. microbiological changes were monitored by checkerboard dna probe analysis of 40 periodontal bacteria. the proportions of black-pigmented species porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia were significantly reduced on the exposed side from their original proportions by 25 and 56 %, respectively, while no change was observed to the unexposed side. five other species showed the greatest proportional reduction of the light-exposed side relative to the unexposed side. these species were streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ss. vincentii, fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum, and capnocytophaga sputigena. at the same time, the percentage of gingival areas scored as being red decreased on the side exposed to light from 48 to 42 %, whereas the percentage scored as red increased on the unexposed side from 53 to 56 %. no adverse effects were found or reported in this study. the present study proposes a new method to modify the ecosystem in dental plaque by phototherapy and introduces a new avenue of prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.
oral community interactions of filifactor alocis in vitro.
filifactor alocis is a gram positive anaerobe that is emerging as an important periodontal pathogen. in the oral cavity f. alocis colonizes polymicrobial biofilm communities; however, little is known regarding the nature of the interactions between f. alocis and other oral biofilm bacteria. here we investigate the community interactions of two strains of f. alocis with streptococcus gordonii, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, organisms with differing pathogenic potential in the oral cavity. in an in vitro community development model, s. gordonii was antagonistic to the accumulation of f. alocis into a dual species community. in contrast, f. nucleatum and the type strain of f. alocis formed a synergistic partnership. accumulation of a low passage isolate of f. alocis was also enhanced by f. nucleatum. in three species communities of s. gordonii, f. nucleatum and f. alocis, the antagonistic effects of s. gordonii superseded the synergistic effects of f. nucleatum toward f. alocis. the interaction between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. alocis was strain specific and a. actinomycetemcomitans could either stimulate f. alocis accumulation or have no effect depending on the strain. p. gingivalis and f. alocis formed heterotypic communities with the amount of p. gingivalis greater than in the absence of f. alocis. however, while p. gingivalis benefited from the relationship, levels of f. alocis in the dual species community were lower compared to f. alocis alone. the inhibitory effect of p. gingivalis toward f. alocis was dependent, at least partially, on the presence of the mfa1 fimbrial subunit. in addition, ai-2 production by p. gingivalis helped maintain levels of f. alocis. collectively, these results show that the pattern of f. alocis colonization will be dictated by the spatial composition of microbial microenvironments, and that the organism may preferentially accumulate at sites rich in f. nucleatum.
phototoxic effect of blue light on the planktonic and biofilm state of anaerobic  periodontal pathogens.
purpose: the purpose of this study was to compare the phototoxic effects of blue  light exposure on periodontal pathogens in both planktonic and biofilm cultures. methods: strains of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis, in planktonic or biofilm states, were exposed to visible light at wavelengths of 400.520 nm. a quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp at a power density of 500 mw/cm(2) was used for the light source. each sample was exposed to 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 seconds of each bacterial strain in the planktonic or biofilm state. confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm) was used to observe the distribution of live/dead bacterial cells in biofilms. after light exposure, the bacterial killing rates were calculated from colony forming unit (cfu) counts. results: clsm images that were obtained from biofilms showed a mixture of dead and live bacterial cells extending to a depth of 30-45 microm. obvious differences in the live-to-dead bacterial cell ratio were found in p. gingivalis biofilm according to light exposure time. in the planktonic state, almost all bacteria were killed with 60 seconds of light exposure to f. nucleatum (99.1%) and with 15 seconds to p. gingivalis (100%). in the biofilm state, however, only the cfu of p. gingivalis demonstrated a decreasing tendency with increasing light exposure time, and there was a lower efficacy of phototoxicity to p. gingivalis as biofilm than in the planktonic state. conclusions: blue light exposure using a dental halogen curing unit is effective in reducing periodontal pathogens in the planktonic state. it is recommended that an adjunctive exogenous photosensitizer be used and that pathogens be exposed to visible light for clinical antimicrobial periodontal therapy.
quantitative real-time pcr combined with propidium monoazide for the selective quantification of viable periodontal pathogens in an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
background and objectives: differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. this is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. the objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) combined with propidium monoazide (pma), developed for the selective quantification of viable p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. material and methods: pma-qpcr method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. biofilms were disrupted and pma added (final concentration of 100 mum). after dna isolation, qpcr was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. the differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. results: when pma was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qpcr amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, pma resulted in a significant total reduction of qpcr amplification of about 4 log10 . p. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. conclusion: these results demonstrate the efficiency of pma for differentiating viable and dead p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. hence, this pma-qpcr method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.
antibacterial activity of probiotic candidates for oral health.
the aim of this study was to determine the probiotic potential of autochthonous oral lactobacilli. for this, 66 strains were screened for antibacterial activity against two cariogenic strains (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and two periodontopathogenic strains (fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis). the inhibitory activity was investigated with the agar overlay technique. positive results led us to explore some mechanisms of action. the ability to produce h(2)o(2) and the glycerol dehydratase gene were searched among all the strains. the gassericin a gene was checked among the lactobacillus gasseri. all the tested strains inhibited s. mutans and a. viscosus; only one did not inhibited f. nucleatum and 52 strains inhibited slightly the growth of p. gingivalis. no inactivation of antibacterial activity was observed after treatment with proteinase k. the gene of the gassericin a was not found in any strain. only one strain showed a 275-bp amplicon corresponding to the glycerol dehydratase gene. this strain has been identified by dna 16s sequencing as a l. gasseri. among the 66 tested strains, 7 produced hydrogen peroxide. our findings suggest that in addition to the previous results, some of the autochthonous oral lactobacilli tested could be considered as suitable probiotics.
proteomics of streptococcus gordonii within a model developing oral microbial community.
background: streptococcus gordonii is one of several species that can initiate the formation of oral biofilms that develop into the complex multispecies microbial communities referred to as dental plaque. it is in the context of dental plaque that periodontal pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis cause disease. we have previously reported a whole cell quantitative proteomics investigation of p. gingivalis in a model dental plaque community of s. gordonii, p. gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. here we report the adaptation of s. gordonii to the same model. results: 1122 s. gordonii proteins were detected in s. gordonii control samples, 915 in communities with f. nucleatum, 849 with p. gingivalis, and 649 with all three organisms. quantitative comparisons showed extensive proteome changes in association with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis individually or both p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum together. the changes were species specific, though the p. gingivalis interaction may be dominant, indicated by large differences between the proteomes with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis but limited changes between communities with p. gingivalis or both p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. the results were inspected manually and an ontology analysis conducted using david. extensive changes were seen in nutrition pathways with increases in energy metabolism and changes in the resulting byproducts, while the acid and sugar repressed pts (phosphoenolpyruvate dependent phosphotransferase system) sugar transport systems showed decreases. these results were seen across all the multispecies samples, though with different profiles according to the partner species. f. nucleatum association decreased proteins for the metabolic end products acetate and ethanol but increased lactate, the primary source of acidity from streptococcal cultures. p. gingivalis containing samples had a reduction in levels of proteins for ethanol and formate but increased proteins for both acetate and lactate production. the communities also showed increases in exopolysaccharide synthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and oxidative stress protection and decreases in adhesion and transporter proteins. conclusion: this study showed that s. gordonii demonstrates species specific responses during interactions with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis. extensive changes were seen in energy metabolism and byproduct production implicating nutrient transfer as an important community interaction.
autoinducer 2 of fusobacterium nucleatum as a target molecule to inhibit biofilm  formation of periodontopathogens.
periodontitis is initiated by bacteria in subgingival biofilms, which are composed mostly of gram-negative anaerobes. autoinducer 2 (ai-2) is a universal quorum sensing (qs) molecule that mediates intergeneric signalling in multispecies bacterial communities and may induce biofilm formation. as fusobacterium nucleatum is the major coaggregation bridge organism that links early colonising commensals and late pathogenic colonisers in dental biofilms via the accretion of periodontopathogens, we hypothesised that ai-2 of f. nucleatum contributes to this interspecies interaction, and interruption of this signalling could result in the inhibition of biofilm formation of periodontopathogens. to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of partially purified f. nucleatum ai-2 on monospecies biofilm as well as mutualistic interactions between f. nucleatum and the so-called 'red complex' (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). then we tested the effect of two qs inhibitors (qsis), (5z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5h)-furanone (furanone compound) and d-ribose, on ai-2-induced biofilm formation and coaggregation. f. nucleatum ai-2 remarkably induced biofilm growth of single and dual species and coaggregation between f. nucleatum and each species of the 'red complex', all of which were inhibited by the qsis. f. nucleatum ai-2 induced the expression of the representative adhesion molecules of the periodontopathogens, which were inhibited by the qsis. our results demonstrate that f. nucleatum ai-2 plays an important role in inter- and intraspecies interactions between periodontopathogens via enhanced expression of adhesion molecules and may be a target for the inhibition of pathogenic dental biofilm formation.
effects of oil drops containing lactobacillus salivarius wb21 on periodontal health and oral microbiota producing volatile sulfur compounds.
the objective of this paper is to evaluate the effects of oil drops containing lactobacillus salivarius wb21 on periodontal health and oral microbiota producing volatile sulfur compounds (vscs). for this study, 42 subjects were randomly assigned to receive oil samples containing l. salivarius wb21 or a placebo for two weeks. oral assessment and saliva collection were performed on days 1 and 15. bacterial analysis was performed using the real-time polymerase chain reaction and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp). in both the experimental and placebo groups, the average probing depth, number of periodontal pockets, and the percentage of bleeding on probing (bop) decreased while stimulated salivary flow increased on day 15. bop was reduced in the experimental group compared with the placebo group (p = 0.010). in the experimental group, total bacterial numbers decreased, and the number of l. salivarius increased. the number of prevotella intermedia, which is correlated with hydrogen sulfide concentration in mouth air, increased in the placebo group and did not change in the experimental group. t-rflp analysis found that the peak area proportions representing porphyromonas gingivalis, p. intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and fusobacterium nucleatum decreased in the experimental group, although there was no significant change in the bacterial composition. thus we observed oil drops containing l. salivarius wb21 improved bop and inhibited the reproduction of total and vsc-producing periodontopathic bacteria compared with the placebo group, but also showed the limit of its efficacy in controlling vscs producing and periodontal pathogens.
antimicrobial effect of adjunctive use of chlorhexidine mouthrinse in untreated gingivitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled study.
the aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of chlorhexidine mouthrinse (chx) in addition to daily plaque control on subgingival microbiota in patients with untreated gingivitis. fifty gingivitis patients were randomized to chx or placebo groups. chx group rinsed with 0.2% chx, while placebo group rinsed with placebo mouthrinse for 4 weeks. subgingival plaque samples were collected and plaque index (pi), papilla bleeding index (pbi), calculus index, and probing pocket depth (ppd) were recorded at baseline and at 4 weeks. the amounts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and total bacteria were detected by quantitative real-time pcr method. in the chx group the total bacteria count was significantly reduced in posterior teeth at 4 weeks (p < 0.05), while no significant decrease was observed in the placebo group (p > 0.05). chx mouthrinse as an adjunct to daily plaque control could be useful in the management of plaque-associated gingivitis and in reducing the subgingival total bacteria count especially in posterior teeth.
garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. this study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. the broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/ml or higher. planktonic growth of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/ml. porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/ml). gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of p. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. a gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/ml), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to s. mutans grown in mature biofilms. however, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. in conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.
spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
purpose: the occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the united states. materials and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. in vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. results: a total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), parvimonas micra (10.8%), streptococcus constellatus (10%), streptococcus intermedius (10%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and tannerella forsythia (5.3%). amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in p. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), t. forsythia (15.8%), s. constellatus (10%), f. nucleatum (5.6%), and p. micra (2.7%). only s. constellatus (70%) and s. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. when subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each of s. constellatus and s. intermedius from one study subject. similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except s. constellatus in one subject. conclusions: in vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of united states origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival f. nucleatum species. in vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial efficacy in non-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.
vaccination of mice with porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum modulates the inflammatory response, but fails to prevent experimental periodontitis.
aim: to assess the potential of using vaccination with porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum, in modulating local subcutaneous inflammatory response and alveolar bone loss following coinfection with both bacteria. materials and methods: mice were immunized against either p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. the cytokine response to mixed infection with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum was evaluated using the subcutaneous chamber model. the alveolar bone loss induced by oral mixed infection was evaluated by micro-ct using the experimental periodontitis model. serum levels of specific antibodies were determined by elisa. results: vaccination with either bacterium produced a specific humoral response before infection. animals immunized against either bacteria following a mixed infection with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, showed decreased tnfalpha (but not il-1beta) levels as compared with non-immunized animals. however, the vaccination did not change the level of mixed infection-induced alveolar bone loss when compared with non-immunized animals. six weeks following the oral mixed infection, specific antibody titres remained high. furthermore, specific antibodies against the non-immunized bacterium were present at high levels. conclusions: while vaccination produced specific antibodies and suppressed the inflammatory response, it failed to prevent or reduce the progression of experimental periodontitis induced by mixed infection with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum.
competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains. four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens) were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.
characterization of coaggregation of fusobacterium nucleatum pk1594 with six porphyromonas gingivalis strains.
coaggregation is a key mechanism in biofilm formation. the aim of this study was  to characterize the coaggregation of fusobacterium nucleatum pk1594 with six porphyromonas gingivalis strains in terms of kinetics and sugars inhibition. this coaggregation was quantitatively characterized by using a kinetic coaggregation assay. sugar inhibition profiles were also quantitatively defined. four types of interactions among these coaggregation partners were found: (1) fast coaggregation that was substantially inhibited by galactose, lactose, and fucose (strain pk1924); (2) fast coaggregation that was not inhibited by any of the sugars tested (strain 274); (3) slow coaggregation that was either substantially or partially inhibited by the sugars mentioned (strains hg405 and w50, respectively); and (4) strains that did not coaggregate with the fusobacteria (atcc33277 and a7436). these results suggest that adhesin(s) other than the well-known galactose-mediated ones may be involved in coaggregation between f. nucleatum pk1594 and p. gingivalis strains.
coaggregation of treponema denticola with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum is mediated by the major outer sheath protein of treponema denticola.
coagreggation of treponema denticola with either porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum was characterized and the role of the major outer sheath protein (msp) in the coaggregation process of these bacteria was evaluated. the msp of t. denticola was found to be able to bind to p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum cells and this binding could be inhibited by msp in a concentration-dependent manner. while sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and periodic acid-schiff (pas) staining of msp revealed that it is a glycoprotein, monosaccharide analysis showed that msp contains: glc (44.4), gal (20.4%) glcn (1.3%), galn (31.6%) and fuc (9.2%). peptide n-glycosidase f deglycosylation of msp was found to inhibit its binding to f. nucleatum but not to p. gingivalis cells. sugar-binding studies showed that the requirements for the binding of both t. denticola and msp to f. nucleatum cells are similar to those of the f. nucleatum galactose-binding lectin. these data suggest that msp acts as an adhesin during the coaggregation process of t. denticola with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum through its protein and carbohydrate moieties, respectively.
fusobacterium nucleatum enhances invasion of human gingival epithelial and aortic endothelial cells by porphyromonas gingivalis.
invasion by porphyromonas gingivalis has been proposed as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis in periodontal and cardiovascular diseases. porphyromonas gingivalis have direct access to the systemic circulation and endothelium in periodontitis patients by transient bacteremia. periodontitis can be described as one of the predominant polymicrobial infections of humans. in the present study, p. gingivalis strains were tested for their ability to invade a human gingival epithelial cell line (ca9-22) and human aortic endothelial cells in coinfection with fusobacterium nucleatum using antibiotic protection assays. coinfection with f. nucleatum resulted in 2-20-fold increase in the invasion of host cells by p. gingivalis strains. the invasive abilities of p. gingivalis strains were significantly greater when incubated with a f. nucleatum clinical isolate (which possesses strong biofilm-forming ability), than when incubated with a f. nucleatum-type strain. in inhibition assays with metabolic inhibitors, a difference in inhibition profiles was observed between mono- and polymicrobial infections. collectively, our results suggest that f. nucleatum facilitates invasion of host cells by p. gingivalis. investigations of polymicrobial infection of host cells should improve our understanding of the role of p. gingivalis in periodontal infection and proatherogenic mechanisms.
frequency, microbial interactions, and antimicrobial susceptibility of fusobacterium nucleatum and fusobacterium necrophorum isolated from primary endodontic infections.
this study assessed the prevalence and microbial interactions of fusobacterium nucleatum and fusobacterium necrophorum in primary endodontic infections from a brazilian population and their antimicrobial susceptibility to some antibiotics by the e-test. one hundred ten samples from infected teeth with periapical pathologies were analyzed by culture methods. five hundred eighty individual strains were isolated; 81.4% were strict anaerobes. f. nucleatum was found in 38 root canals and was associated with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., and eubacterium spp. f. necrophorum was found in 20 root canals and was associated with peptostreptococcus prevotii. the simultaneous presence of f. nucleatum and f. necrophorum was not related to endodontic symptoms (p > 0.05). they were 100% susceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and cephaclor. fusobacterium spp. is frequently isolated from primary-infected root canals of teeth with periapical pathologies. amoxicillin is a useful antibiotic against f. nucleatum and f. necrophorum in endodontic infections and has been prescribed as the first choice in brazil.
[characterization and antibacterial effect of ag-nha-ntio2/polyamide 66 nanocomposite membrane on oral bacteria].
objective: undried silver-hydroxyapatite-titania (ag-nha-ntio2) nanoparticles slurry was used to make membrane with polyamide 66 (pa66) by co-polymerization method. the purpose of this study is to test the physical and chemical characteristics and antibacterial ability. methods: the morphology, chemical components and structures of the membrane were characterized by atomic absorption spectrometer (aas), x-ray diffraction (xrd), scanning electron microscope (sem) and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (edx). staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), escherichia coli (e. coli), porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) and streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) were utilized to test the antibacterial effect. results: xrd results demonstrated that the membrane have characteristic diffraction peaks of pure hydroxyapatite (ha). a homogeneous distribution of the ca, p, ti and ag element in the membrane was confirmed by edx. both surface and section showed porous structure which was confirmed by sem and the average hole size was 20-30 microm. the bacteria assay reflected to the antibacterial effect, 50.10% of s. aureus and 56.31% of e. coli were killed. however, 91.84% of p. gingivalis, 90.64% of f. nucleatum and 90.49% of s. mutans were killed and pictures of sem showed obviously fewer cells on the surface. conclusion: the nanocomposite membrane could be one of the bioactive materials with antibacterial properties for oral guided bone regeneration technique.
inhibitory effect of cranberry polyphenol on biofilm formation and cysteine proteases of porphyromonas gingivalis.
background and objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of cranberry polyphenol fraction on biofilm formation and activities of arg-gingipain and lys-gingipain in porphyromonas gingivalis. material and methods: the polyphenol fraction was prepared by using a glass column packed with amberlite xad 7hp and 70% aqueous ethanol as an elution solvent. results: synergistic biofilm formation by p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum was significantly inhibited by the polyphenol fraction at a concentration of 250 microg/ml compared with untreated controls (p < 0.01). arg-gingipain and lys-gingipain activities in p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and fdc 381 were inhibited significantly at a polyphenol fraction concentration of > or = 1 microg/ml (p < 0.05). conclusion: these findings indicate that the polyphenol fraction inhibits biofilm formation and the arg-gingipain and lys-gingipain activities of p. gingivalis.
effects of glass ionomer and microfilled composite subgingival restorations on periodontal tissue and subgingival biofilm: a 6-month evaluation.
background: this 6-month study evaluated the effects of resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (rmgi) and microfilled composite (mc) subgingival restorations on periodontal tissues and subgingival biofilm. methods: fifty-four periodontally healthy patients were assigned as follows: group 1 (n = 18), root exposure (re) without non-carious cervical lesions (nccl) treated with coronally positioned flap (cpf); group 2 (n = 18), re with nccl treated rmgi restorations plus cpf; group 3 (n = 18), re with nccl treated with mc restorations plus cpf. probing depth (pd), visible local plaque score (pl), and local bleeding on probing (bop) were assessed at baseline and 6 months after surgeries. restored and non-restored root recoverage (rr) was assessed at 6 months. each experimental tooth was subgingivally sampled (baseline and 6 months) and analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: clinical results showed no significant differences among the groups regarding pl, bop, and pd at baseline and 6 months. the rr means were similar among the groups at 6 months. intragroup analyses revealed that the proportions of 10 periodontopathogens decreased at 6 months for the control group. for the rmgi group, there was a significant decrease in the proportions of nine periodontopathogens. for the mc group, there was a significant increase in the proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum and gemella morbillorum and a decrease in five periodontopathogens. intergroup analyses showed an increase in the proportion of f. nucleatum polymorphum for the mc group. conclusions: in a 6-month evaluation, well-finished rmgi or mc subgingival restorations did not negatively affect periodontal health. furthermore, rmgi seems to exert more positive effects on the subgingival biofilm composition than mc.
gingival epithelial cell transcriptional responses to commensal and opportunistic oral microbial species.
transcriptional profiling and ontology tools were utilized to define the biological pathways of gingival epithelial cells modulated by coculture with the oral commensal streptococcus gordonii and the opportunistic commensal fusobacterium nucleatum. overall, f. nucleatum and s. gordonii perturbed the gingival epithelial cell transcriptome much less significantly than the oral pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans perturbed the transcriptome, indicating that there was a greater degree of host adaptation by the commensal species (m. handfield, j. j. mans, g. zheng, m. c. lopez, s. mao, a. progulske-fox, g. narasimhan, h. v. baker, and r. j. lamont, cell. microbiol. 7:811-823, 2005). the biological pathways significantly impacted by f. nucleatum and s. gordonii included the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) and toll-like receptor signaling pathways. differential regulation of gadd45 and dusp4, key components of the mapk pathway, was confirmed at the protein level by western blotting. modulation of the mapk pathway is likely to affect host cell proliferation and differentiation. in addition, both the mapk and toll-like receptor pathways ultimately converge on cytokine gene expression. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of secreted interleukin-6 (il-6) and il-8 demonstrated that f. nucleatum induced production of these cytokines, whereas s. gordonii inhibited secretion from the epithelial cells. stimulation of secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from epithelial cells may reflect the invasive phenotype of f. nucleatum and contribute to the greater pathogenic potential of f. nucleatum than of s. gordonii.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine against  selected single-species biofilms.
aim: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 2.5% and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and 2.0% chlorhexidine gel and liquid as endodontic-irrigating substances against selected single-species biofilms. methods: single-species biofilms of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis and fusobacterium nucleatum were generated on a cellulose nitrate membrane placed on agar medium. the biofilms were then immersed in the endodontic-irrigating substances for 30 s and also for 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min, with and without mechanical agitation. sterile saline was used as control. after each time period, the membrane filters were then transferred to tubes containing 2 ml of fresh broth medium plus neutralizers (in order to prevent the residual action of the tested substances). the micro-organisms were suspended using a vortex, and the inoculum was serially diluted 10-fold. aliquots of the dilutions were plated on 5% sheep blood agar medium, and incubated under adequate gaseous conditions. colony-forming units were calculated. the samples were compared using the friedman and tukey test, when necessary, at a significance level of p < 0.05. results: mechanical agitation promoted the effectiveness of the antimicrobial agents, resulting in less time to eliminate the same micro-organisms, except for s. aureus with 2.5% naocl. antimicrobial agents in liquid presentation, especially 5.25% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine, killed the tested micro-organisms more rapidly. saline did not inhibit the growth of any of the tested micro-organisms, with or without agitation, being statistically different (p < 0.05) from naocl and chlorhexidine. p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, p. endodontalis and f. nucleatum were eliminated in 30 s by all antimicrobial agents, with our without agitation, in contrast with the facultative and aerobe strains. conclusions: mechanical agitation improved the antimicrobial properties of the chemical substances tested using a biofilm model, favouring the agents in liquid presentation, especially 5.25% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine.
coaggregation of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum pk 1594 is  mediated by capsular polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide.
previous reports have shown that coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, two important periodontopathogens, is mediated by a galactoside on the surface of p. gingivalis and a lectin on f. nucleatum. in the present study, purified capsular polysaccharide (cps) and lipopolysaccharide (lps) of p. gingivalis pk 1924 (serotype k5) were found to be able to bind to f. nucleatum cells and to inhibit binding of f. nucleatum to p. gingivalis serotype k5. sugar binding studies showed that the requirements for binding of p. gingivalis serotype k5 cps and lps to the f. nucleatum lectin are: the presence of a metal divalent ion, an axial free hydroxyl group at position 4 and free equatorial hydroxyl groups at position 3 and 6 of d-galactose. these data suggest that p. gingivalis serotype k5- cps and lps act as receptors mediating coaggregation between p. gingivalis and fusobacteria.
inhibitory effect of weissella cibaria isolates on the production of volatile sulphur compounds.
aims: the objective of this study was to characterize the inhibitory effects of weissella cibaria isolates on volatile sulphur compounds (vsc) production both in vitro and in vivo. material and methods: we isolated and identified three hydrogen peroxide-generating lactobacilli from children's saliva, and assessed their inhibitory effects on vsc production and fusobacterium nucleatum proliferation. clinical studies were conducted with 46 subjects in order to measure the vsc of their mouth air. results: these lactobacilli were identified as w. cibaria. these isolates inhibited the production of vsc by f. nucleatum (p<0.05). the concentration of f. nucleatum was decreased by 5-log cycles as a result of exposure to the w. cibaria strains (p<0.05), whereas the catalase-treated w. cibaria cultures exerted no evident inhibitory effects on f. nucleatum replication. in the clinical studies, gargling with one isolate resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of h2s and ch3sh by approximately 48.2% (p<0.01) and 59.4% (p<0.05), respectively. conclusions: these results indicate that w. cibaria isolates possess the ability to inhibit vsc production under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, demonstrating that they bear the potential for development into novel probiotics for use in the oral cavity.
fluorescence based measurements of fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregation and of fusobacterial attachment to mammalian cells.
fusobacterium nucleatum is a common oral anaerobe associated with gingivitis, periodontal disease and preterm deliveries. coaggregation among oral bacteria is considered to be a significant factor in dental plaque development. adhesion to host cells was suggested to be important for the f. nucleatum virulence associated with oral inflammation and with preterm births. an uncharacterized fusobacterial galactose inhibitible adhesin mediates coaggregation of f. nucleatum 12230 and f. nucleatum pk1594 with the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. this adhesin is also involved with the attachment of both fusobacterial strains to host cells. however, it has been suggested that additional unidentified fusobacterial adhesins are involved in f. nucleatum virulence associated with preterm births. in this study, a fluorescence-based high throughput sensitive and reproducible method was developed for measuring bacterial coaggregation and bacterial attachment to mammalian cells. using this method we found that coaggregation of f. nucleatum 4h with p. gingivalis and its attachment to murine macrophages is less inhibitible by galactose than that of f. nucleatum pk1594. these findings suggest that f. nucleatum 4h can serve as a model organism for identifying nongalactose inhibitible f. nucleatum adhesins considered to be involved in fusobacterial attachment to mammalian cells.
killing of periodontopathogenic bacteria by photodynamic therapy.
background: the aim of this study was to evaluate a new approach for killing periodontopathogenic bacteria using photodynamic therapy (pdt). methods: in this study, we investigated the photosensitizers chlorin e6, blc 1010, and blc 1014 by three different methods for their effect in pdt on the viability of periodontopathogenic bacterial species. the methods included examination of inhibition zones on agar plates, determination of colony-forming units (cfu), and the use of a bacterial viability kit. results: using the cfu method, we were able to demonstrate that the anaerobic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and capnocytophaga gingivalis can be photoinactivated completely by illumination with an intensity of 5.3 j/cm2 in the presence of 10 microm chlorin e6 and 10 microm blc 1010. with the photosensitizers chlorin e6 and blc 1010, we were able to induce zones of inhibition on agar plates. blc 1014 failed to produce a zone of inhibition. the results of the bacterial viability test also showed that the photosensitizer blc 1014 provides the lowest photodynamic effect in comparison to the others. conclusion: the data collected to date suggest that photodynamic therapy with chlorin e6 and blc 1010 is advantageous for suppressing periodontopathogenic bacteria.
additive antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine on common  endodontic bacterial pathogens.
it is an established procedure to use calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] as a therapeutic component to achieve sterilization of infected root canals. unfortunately, some bacterial species are relatively resistant to ca(oh)2 and are therefore associated with treatment failures. the objective of this study was to identify combinations of substances that improve antimicrobial activity. ca(oh)2 was used as a suspension or as a component of gutta-percha points. efficacy of killing was compared for (a) ca(oh)2 suspension alone; (b) zinc oxide (zno) points alone; (c) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno points; (d) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno/chlorhexidine points; and (e) ca(oh)2 points combined with zno/chlorhexidine points. common endodontopathogenic bacterial species (enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus intermedius) in pure cultures served as target organisms. in the in vitro assay, the antibacterial substances and approximately 10(7) colony forming units of test bacteria were co-incubated in diluted human serum under growth conditions appropriate for the single bacterial species. samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation and viable counts determined. gram-negative bacteria were sufficiently killed by ca(oh)2 alone. combinations with other agents did not improve the killing kinetics. for the inactivation of the gram-positive bacteria p. micros and s. intermedius, a combination of ca(oh)2 and zno/chlorhexidine, killed the bacteria faster than ca(oh)2 alone. for e. faecalis, combining ca(oh)2 suspension with zno/chlorhexidine points lead to a faster decrease in the overall number of viable bacteria, but no test conditions lead to the complete loss of culture viability. the results of this study support the use of a combination of ca(oh)2 and chlorhexidine for faster eradication of p. micros and s. intermedius from infected root canals.
pcr method is essential for detecting mycobacterium tuberculosis in oral cavity samples.
tuberculosis is a re-emerging infectious disease, and infection by mycobacterium  tuberculosis has been increasing in immunocompromised hosts, including elderly persons. m. tuberculosis-infected persons may receive dental treatment. to evaluate the risk of m. tuberculosis infection in dental clinics, we examined the detection rates of m. tuberculosis in sample of mixed saliva, dental plaque, extracted teeth, caries lesions, and denture plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the detection rates by pcr in samples from mixed saliva, dental plaque, caries lesions and denture plaque obtained from tuberculosis patients were 98.0%, 92.0%, 89.0%, and 100%, respectively. the detection rates by the culture method were 17.3%, 2.0%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. m. tuberculosis also was detected from the nontuberculous mycobacteria-infected group. strains of actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum inhibited the growth of clinical strains of m. tuberculosis, but strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans did not. the present study concludes that the pcr method is essential for detecting m. tuberculosis in oral samples.
antibacterial effects of resinous retrograde root filling materials.
the effect of three resinous retrograde root filling materials on the growth of four obligate anaerobic bacteria associated with endodontic infections was determined by using the agar diffusion inhibitory test. samples of the following resinous materials (resin-modified, glass-ionomer cement, fuji ii lc; compomer, dyract; and composite resin, spectrum) were incubated for 1 week with the following anaerobic bacteria: fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, p. endodontalis, and prevotella intermedia. the freshly mixed and set resinous materials were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms for 1 week. after the end of the incubation period, the zone of growth inhibition was observed and measured. analysis of variance of the mean diameter of the zone of inhibition indicated no statistically significant overall differences in the response of the black-pigmented bacteroides species (p > 0.05). for f. nucleatum, spectrum had more antibacterial effect against this bacteria than dyract (p < 0.05). additionally, fuji ii lc was ineffective against f. nucleatum (p < 0.05). however, positive control plates showed bacterial growth in all cases. our data suggest that the antibacterial potency of polymerized materials varied considerably, depending on the type and the product tested.
3-chloro-dl-alanine resistance by l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase activity.
the antibacterial agent 3-chloro-dl-alanine (3ca) is an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis. fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, the bacteria responsible for oral malodor, are shown to be resistant to 1 mm 3ca, whereas streptococcus mutans and escherichia coli are sensitive to this antibacterial agent at the same concentration. we isolated the 3ca resistance gene from f. nucleatum and showed that the gene encodes an l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase that catalyzes the alpha,gamma-elimination of l-methionine to produce methyl mercaptan. the enzyme also exhibits 3ca chloride-lyase (deaminating) activity. this antibacterial agent is expected to be useful for specific selection of malodorous oral bacteria producing high amounts of methyl mercaptan.
effect of fusobacterium nucleatum on the t and b cell responses to porphyromonas  gingivalis in a mouse model.
t cell cytokine profiles and specific serum antibody levels in five groups of balb/c mice immunized with saline alone, viable fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586, viable porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277, f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis and p. gingivalis followed by f. nucleatum were determined. splenic cd4 and cd8 cells were examined for intracytoplasmic interleukin (il)-4, interferon (ifn)-gamma and il-10 by dual colour flow cytometry and the levels of serum anti-f. nucleatum and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies determined by an elisa. both th1 and th2 responses were demonstrated by all groups, and while there were slightly lower percentages of cytokine positive t cells in mice injected with f. nucleatum alone compared with the other groups immunized with bacteria, f. nucleatum had no effect on the t cell production of cytokines induced by p. gingivalis in the two groups immunized with both organisms. however, the percentages of cytokine positive cd8 cells were generally significantly higher than those of the cd4 cells. mice immunized with f. nucleatum alone had high levels of serum anti-f. nucleatum antibodies with very low levels of p. gingivalis antibodies, whereas mice injected with p. gingivalis alone produced anti-p. gingivalis antibodies predominantly. although the levels of anti-f. nucleatum antibodies in mice injected with f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis were the same as in mice immunized with f. nucleatum alone, antibody levels to p. gingivalis were very low. in contrast, mice injected with p. gingivalis followed by f. nucleatum produced equal levels of both anti-p. gingivalis and anti-f. nucleatum antibodies, although at lower levels than the other three groups immunized with bacteria, respectively. anti-actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and prevotella intermedia serum antibody levels were also determined and found to be negligible. in conclusion, f. nucleatum immunization does not affect the splenic t cell cytokine response to p. gingivalis. however, f. nucleatum immunization prior to that of p. gingivalis almost completely inhibited the production of anti-p. gingivalis antibodies while p. gingivalis injection before f. nucleatum demonstrated a partial inhibitory effect by p. gingivalis on antibody production to f. nucleatum. the significance of these results with respect to human periodontal disease is difficult to determine. however, they may explain in part differing responses to p. gingivalis in different individuals who may or may not have had prior exposure to f. nucleatum. finally, the results suggested that p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum do not induce the production of cross-reactive antibodies to other oral microorganisms.
antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on periodontal bacteria.
the antimicrobial agent nitric oxide (no) is formed in the mouth and its concentration is directly related to salivary nitrite, which in turn is related to dietary nitrate intake. the aim of this study was to determine whether nitrite under acidic conditions will have an inhibitory effect, possibly occurring through no production, on the periodontal disease pathogens fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas gingivalis. whereas the growth of these organisms was inhibited by a more acid ph, the addition of nitrite caused a marked, further dose-dependent reduction in bacterial numbers after exposure. the ability of these bacteria to recover from nitrite exposure was also affected by ph and nitrite concentration. at acidity levels below ph 5.0, low concentrations of nitrite (0.2 mm) caused effective complete killing of the periodontal bacteria. addition of sodium thiocyanate did not increase the bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal activity of acidified nitrite against any of the 3 bacteria. these results demonstrate the possibility that nitrite in saliva, under appropriate conditions, may have an effect on the growth and survival of the bacteria implicated in periodontal disease.
interleukin-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 regulation in oral epithelial cells by selected periodontal bacteria: multiple effects of porphyromonas gingivalis via antagonistic mechanisms.
interaction of bacteria with mucosal surfaces can modulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules produced by epithelial cells. previously, we showed that expression of interleukin-8 (il-8) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1) by gingival epithelial cells increases following interaction with several putative periodontal pathogens. in contrast, expression of il-8 and icam-1 is reduced after porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 challenge. in the present study, we investigated the mechanisms that govern the regulation of these two molecules in bacterially infected gingival epithelial cells. experimental approaches included bacterial stimulation of gingival epithelial cells by either a brief challenge (1.5 to 2 h) or a continuous coculture throughout the incubation period. the kinetics of il-8 and icam-1 expression following brief challenge were such that (i) secretion of il-8 by gingival epithelial cells reached its peak 2 h following fusobacterium nucleatum infection whereas it rapidly decreased within 2 h after p. gingivalis infection and remained decreased up to 30 h and (ii) il-8 and icam-1 mrna levels were up-regulated rapidly 2 to 4 h postinfection and then decreased to basal levels 8 to 20 h after infection with either actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, or p. gingivalis. attenuation of il-8 secretion was facilitated by adherent p. gingivalis strains. the il-8 secreted from epithelial cells after f. nucleatum stimulation could be down-regulated by subsequent infection with p. gingivalis or its culture supernatant. although these results suggested that il-8 attenuation at the protein level might be associated with p. gingivalis proteases, the arg- and lys-gingipain proteases did not appear to be solely responsible for il-8 attenuation. in addition, while p. gingivalis up-regulated il-8 mrna expression, this effect was overridden when the bacteria were continuously cocultured with the epithelial cells. the il-8 mrna levels in epithelial cells following sequential challenge with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum and vice versa were approximately identical and were lower than those following f. nucleatum challenge alone and higher than control levels or those following p. gingivalis challenge alone. thus, together with the protease effect, p. gingivalis possesses a powerful strategy to ensure the down-regulation of il-8 and icam-1.
inducible expression of human beta-defensin 2 by fusobacterium nucleatum in oral  epithelial cells: multiple signaling pathways and role of commensal bacteria in innate immunity and the epithelial barrier.
human gingival epithelial cells (hge) express two antimicrobial peptides of the beta-defensin family, human beta-defensin 1 (hbd-1) and hbd-2, as well as cytokines and chemokines that contribute to innate immunity. in the present study, the expression and transcriptional regulation of hbd-2 was examined. hbd-2 mrna was induced by cell wall extract of fusobacterium nucleatum, an oral commensal microorganism, but not by that of porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen. hbd-2 mrna was also induced by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and phorbol myristate acetate (pma), an epithelial cell activator. hbd-2 mrna was also expressed in 14 of 15 noninflamed gingival tissue samples. hbd-2 peptide was detected by immunofluorescence in hge stimulated with f. nucleatum cell wall, consistent with induction of the mrna by this stimulant. kinetic analysis indicates involvement of multiple distinct signaling pathways in the regulation of hbd-2 mrna; tnf-alpha and f. nucleatum cell wall induced hbd-2 mrna rapidly (2 to 4 h), while pma stimulation was slower ( approximately 10 h). in contrast, each stimulant induced interleukin 8 (il-8) within 1 h. the role of tnf-alpha as an intermediary in f. nucleatum signaling was ruled out by addition of anti-tnf-alpha that did not inhibit hbd-2 induction. however, inhibitor studies show that f. nucleatum stimulation of hbd-2 mrna requires both new gene transcription and new protein synthesis. bacterial lipopolysaccharides isolated from escherichia coli and f. nucleatum were poor stimulants of hbd-2, although they up-regulated il-8 mrna. collectively, our findings show inducible expression of hbd-2 mrna via multiple pathways in hge in a pattern that is distinct from that of il-8 expression. we suggest that different aspects of innate immune responses are differentially regulated and that commensal organisms have a role in stimulating mucosal epithelial cells in maintaining the barrier that contributes to homeostasis and host defense.
microbiological response of localized sites with recurrent periodontitis in maintenance patients treated with tetracycline fibers.
background: whether adjunctive tetracycline fibers can provide an additive effect to scaling and root planing in treating non-responsive sites in maintenance subjects is still controversial. recolonization of the bacteria from untreated sites or from the extracrevicular region may explain the insignificant response to local therapy. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the microbiological response of sites treated with tetracycline fibers combined with scaling and root planing. methods: the study was conducted in a split-mouth design. thirty patients on maintenance therapy having at least 2 non-adjacent sites in separate quadrants with probing depths between 4 to 8 mm with bleeding on probing, or aspartate aminotransferase enzyme levels > 800 microiu in the gingival crevicular fluid, were treated with scaling and root planing plus tetracycline fibers or with scaling and root planing only. subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline, and 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment. a. actino-mycetemcomitans, c. rectus, b. forsythus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia were detected by culture, immunofluorescence, or pcr technique. results: there was a reduction of total bacterial cell count, as well as of certain periodontal pathogens, following treatment. the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus, and p. gingivalis and the mean proportions of c. rectus, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and p. gingivalis decreased after therapy, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment groups with respect to bacterial proportions or the number of positive sites. besides, the pathogens could not be eliminated from the periodontal pocket, and recolonization of the pocket was noted at 3 months post-treatment. conclusions: bacteria located within the cheek, tongue mucosa, saliva, or untreated sites may contribute to reinfection of the pockets and explain the insignificant response to local tetracycline therapy.
induction of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte antibodies in mice injected with lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
we examined the levels of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte autoantibody (ata) in the serum of mice injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from periodontopathic bacteria; porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, and non-oral escherichia coli. all of the lps induced igm-ata. among these, lps from c. ochracea induced the highest level of igm-ata, whereas that of p. gingivalis induced the lowest. the peritoneal t lymphocytes of mice injected with lps were bound by igm-ata. peritoneal b-1 (cd5+b) cells stimulated by each lps produced much more igm-ata than splenic b-2 (cd5-b) cells, suggesting that b-1 cells might be responsible for the production of these antibodies. serum of mice injected with c. ochracea and f. nucleatum lps showed cytotoxicity against thymocytes in the presence of rabbit complements. binding and cytotoxicity were confirmed by igm purified from serum of the mice injected with c. ochracea lps. furthermore, serum of mice treated with c. ochracea, f. nucleatum or a. actinomycetemcomitans lps inhibited the proliferation of thymocytes. however, purified igm from the serum of mice treated with c. ochracea lps failed to produce the same inhibition. our results suggest that lps from certain species of periodontopathic bacteria can induce igm-ata in the serum and these antibodies may modulate the local immune network in periodontal tissues.
cytotoxic effect of endodontic bacteria on periapical fibroblasts.
this study was conducted to investigate the effects of sonicated bacterial extracts (sbes) from anaerobic gram-negative bacteria on periapical fibroblast obtained from the apical portion of human periodontal ligaments. porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were chosen from among the endodontic bacteria isolated from root canals having a periapical lesion and compared in terms of their cytotoxicity. the purpose of this study was to examine which bacteria are involved in the development of periapical inflammation. the anaerobes were cultured under strict anaerobic conditions, and the bacterial cells were then harvested by centrifugation after incubation. the concentrated cell suspensions were sonicated and subsequently centrifuged. an sbe was made of each of the filtered supernatants. each sbe was added to cultures of periapical fibroblasts. the cell growth and proliferation were measured by the mtt method after 3, 5, and 7 days. the sbes from p. endodontalis, p. gingivalis, and f. nucleatum inhibited the growth of the fibroblasts, whereas the sbe from p. intermedia did not inhibit it. the sbes from p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum inhibited the fibroblast growth more strongly than did the p. endodontalis, p. gingivalis, and f. nucleatum may participate in the development of periapical lesions.
acid tolerance and acid-neutralizing activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum.
the tolerance to acid and the acid-neutralizing activity of three important periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum were studied. p. gingivalis strains grew only at neutral ph and did not utilize glucose, whereas strains of p. intermedia and f. nucleatum could grow under acidic conditions and increased their growth by utilizing glucose. p. gingivalis tended to raise the culture ph during growth. p. intermedia and f. nucleatum raised the culture ph during growth in the absence of glucose, while in the presence of glucose they decreased the ph. resting cell suspensions of all the bacteria raised the ph in the presence of tryptone and casamino acids. acid-neutralizing activity was confirmed by measuring base production at a fixed ph with a ph-stat. during neutralization, the cells produced cytotoxic substrates, ammonia and organic acids (butyric, isobutyric and isovaleric acids by p. gingivalis; isovaleric and succinic acids by p. intermedia; propionic and butyric acids by f. nucleatum). these findings suggest that deamination of amino acids into ammonia and organic acids occurs simultaneously with base production, resulting in acid neutralization. these results could partially explain the survival of p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in both supragingival and subgingival plaque and the apparent restriction of p. gingivalis to subgingival plaque. the former bacteria may aid in creation of an environment fostering colonization of subgingival plaque by p. gingivalis.
identification of a fusobacterium nucleatum pk1594 galactose-binding adhesin which mediates coaggregation with periopathogenic bacteria and hemagglutination.
attachment of fusobacterium nucleatum to various oral surfaces is mediated by several adhesins anchored on its outer surface. monoclonal antibodies (mabs) were prepared and used to identify the putative galactose-binding adhesin of f. nucleatum pk1594. four unique mabs, 8g7, 26b9, 28g11, and 29d4, were isolated on the basis of their ability to inhibit coaggregation of f. nucleatum pk1594 with porphyromonas gingivalis pk1924. all four mabs were also capable of inhibiting galactose-inhibitable interactions of f. nucleatum pk1594 with other oral gram-negative bacteria and with erythrocytes. preincubation of f. nucleatum pk1594 with mab 26b9 or its fab fragments at concentrations lower than 1 microg/ml resulted in complete inhibition of coaggregation with p. gingivalis pk1924 or hemagglutination. f. nucleatum pk1594 surface components prepared by mild sonication or by extracting whole cells with detergents were subjected to western blot analysis. none of the mabs were able to recognize any polypeptide in these experiments. therefore, detergent extracts of f. nucleatum pk1594 surface components were subjected to three experimental procedures: (i) separation by ion-exchange chromatography and testing of fractions for reaction with mab 26b9 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), (ii) lactose-sepharose affinity chromatography and testing of the lactose eluate in elisa with mab 26b9, and (iii) immunoseparation with either mab 26b9 or 8g7. collectively, the results suggest that the putative adhesin is a 30-kda outer membrane polypeptide which mediates the coaggregation with p. gingivalis pk1924 as well as other galactose-sensitive interactions of f. nucleatum pk1594.
the effect of chlorhexidine on defined, mixed culture oral biofilms grown in a novel model system.
in order to develop an improved method to evaluate antimicrobial agents for use in clinical dentistry, a constant-depth film fermenter (cdff) has been used to generate biofilms of fixed depth comprising nine species of bacteria commonly found in dental plaque in health and disease. these bacteria were grown together initially in a conventional chemostat which was used to inoculate the cdff over an 8 h period. medium was then supplied directly to the cdff and biofilms allowed to develop. the biofilms were then challenged with eight short pulses of two concentrations of chlorhexidine (0.0125 and 0.125% w/v). the lower concentration had a limited effect on the composition of the biofilms while a differential and substantial inhibition was obtained with a higher concentration. actinomyces naeslundii was lost from the biofilm, and the viable counts of streptococci, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis were inhibited by over three orders of magnitude by 0.125% chlorhexidine, whereas veillonella dispar was only transiently affected. the findings were consistent with those from clinical studies of dental plaque, suggesting that this model would have a predictive value when evaluating novel antiplaque or antimicrobial inhibitors.
mixed infection with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum in a murine lesion model: potential synergistic effects on virulence.
these studies determined the characteristics of tissue destruction in a murine abscess model elicited by mixed infection with the periodontopathogens fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. the interbacterial effects of this synergism, the kinetics of the relationship of the bacterial interaction, and the characteristics of the bacteria required for the tissue destruction were studied. infection of mice with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum strains elicited lesions of various sizes as a function of infective dose. primary infection with f. nucleatum plus p. gingivalis at various ratios (i.e., <1:1) resulted in a significantly greater lesion size (p < 0.001) compared with that resulting from primary infection with p. gingivalis alone. at f. nucleatum/p. gingivalis ratios of > or = 1:1, spreading lesion formation and progression were significantly (p < 0.001) decreased, suggesting that bacterial interaction (i.e., coaggregation) may have inhibited the spread of the p. gingivalis infection to a site distant from the initial injection. infection with f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis simultaneously (at different sites) or f. nucleatum administered within 4 h prior to or 1 h following p. gingivalis infection significantly enhanced the ability of p. gingivalis to form large phlegmonous lesions. chemical inhibition of the p. gingivalis trypsin-like protease activity or the use of a trypsin-negative p. gingivalis strain abrogated tissue destruction either alone or in combination with f. nucleatum. therefore, it was possible to examine aspects of virulence of these pathogens in a murine lesion model by either altering bacterial ratios, manipulating the time of infection, or targeting vital bacterial virulence factors.
inhibitory effects of funoran on the adherence and colonization of oral bacteria.
funoran, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from the seaweed gloiopeltis furcata, strongly inhibited the adsorption of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) used as an experimental pellicle and strongly desorbed cariogenic mutans streptococci pre-adsorbed to s-ha. colonization inhibition and anticariogenic effects of funoran were also investigated in experimental rats. the colonization of streptococcus cricetus e49 inoculated on the molar teeth of experimental rats administered funoran was less frequent than that in a funoran-free group. the mean buccal and lingual, sulcal, and total caries scores of rat groups administered funoran were significantly lower than those of the funoran-free group. the inhibitory effect of funoran on periodontopathic bacterial attachment was studied in vitro. funoran strongly inhibited the adsorption of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinomyces species to s-ha and collagen-coated hydroxyapatite (co-ha) and apparently inhibited their attachment to the human gingival fibroblast gin-1 cell line. the present study indicates that funoran inhibits colonization by cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria and excludes them from human oral cavity.
cellular adhesion molecules on periodontal lymphocytes.
t cell induced differentiation of b cells has been shown to be dependent on the cd2/lfa-3 and lfa-1/icam-1 pathways. flow cytometric analysis was used to examine these adhesion molecules on t and b cells extracted from gingival tissues before and after stimulation with the putative periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. adhesion molecule expression on peripheral blood cells from healthy adults was used as a control. approximately 50 per cent of b cells extracted from gingival tissues expressed lfa-3 and icam-1 compared with 30 per cent positive peripheral blood b cells. around 50 per cent of gingival t cells expressed cd2 relative to 76 per cent positive peripheral blood t cells. however, 40-50 per cent of both gingival and peripheral blood t cells expressed lfa-1. there was no difference in the expression of adhesion molecules on t and b cells extracted from health/marginal gingivitis or adult periodontitis lesions. after stimulation of gingival cells in vitro, the per cent cd2 positive t cells and lfa-3 and icam-1 positive b cells remained relatively stable over the six-day culture period, although p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum appeared to induce an increase in the percentage of gingival t cells expressing lfa-1. in contrast to the gingival lymphocytes, stimulation of peripheral blood cells resulted in an increase in the per cent cd2 positive t cells, lfa-3 and icam-1 positive b cells, with a decrease in lfa-1 positive t cells. the results therefore demonstrated that gingival t and b cells express adhesion molecules in vivo.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
effects of lipopolysaccharides on human dental pulp cells.
human dental pulp cells were treated with 1, 10, and 100 micrograms/ml of lipopolysaccharide (lps). the effects of treatment were examined by measurement of the dna content, protein content, and alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells. lps samples were purified from porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from root canals, and escherichia coli 0111:b4 lps was used as a positive control. at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml, none of the lpss caused any change in the production of dna or protein, whereas the amount of dna was increased at 10 micrograms/ml and inhibited at 100 micrograms/ml. protein synthesis was decreased by lpss at both 10 and 100 micrograms/ml. alkaline phosphatase activity was not changed at any concentration of lps tested.
polyclonal b cell activation, endotoxin tolerance, and limulus tests of endotoxin preparations of some periodontopathogens.
potencies of polyclonal b-cell activation in c3h/hen mice of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis endotoxins were 0.36, 0.13 and 0.04, taking salmonella abortusequi as 1.0. f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis endotoxins showed positive reactions in c3h/hej mice. most activities in c3h/hen other than that of f. nucleatum were suppressed by polymyxin b. in c3h/hej mice, similar inhibitions were only 60% for p. gingivalis and hardly observed with f. nucleatum. the resistances to polymyxin b could be due to protein in the endotoxins. a promoting effect of t cells added to b cells was observed only in the activity of f. nucleatum endotoxin in c3h/hej mice; there was no influence in other groups. test endotoxins had nearly the same ability to produce colony stimulating factor as did references and could not produce the factor in tolerant mice. the clinical significance of tolerance is discussed. regression lines of endotoxin doses and limulus activities of test endotoxins and salmonella were parallel, either in specific or non-specific tests. the lines of two test groups were also parallel; values obtained by two tests were very close. these data indicate that the test endotoxins did not contain (1-3)-beta-d-glucan and elicited qualitatively similar limulus reactions to that of the reference, despite their different chemical natures. in conclusion, these test preparations had an endotoxicity similar to that of the reference and contribute to produce periodontitis through polyclonal b cell activation.
in vitro activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
the activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. a fastidious facultative anaerobe, gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. fk037 inhibited 90% of isolates of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, clostridium perfringens, mobiluncus spp., g. vaginalis, and porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. the mics of fk037 for 50 and 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of fk037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. the activity of fk037 against fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, and bilophila wadsworthia decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/ml. little influence of inoculum size on the activity of fk037 was observed for other isolates tested. medium ph affected the activity of fk037 against f. varium (mics at phs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and bacteroides gracilis (mics at phs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. fk037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from b. fragilis gai 0558 and gai 10150.
localization of the fusobacterium nucleatum t18 adhesin activity mediating coaggregation with porphyromonas gingivalis t22.
adherence of pathogenic bacteria is often an essential first step in the infectious process. the ability of bacteria to adhere to one another, or to coaggregate, may be an important factor in their ability to colonize and function as pathogens in the periodontal pocket. previously, a strong and specific coaggregation was demonstrated between two putative periodontal pathogens, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. the interaction appeared to be mediated by a protein adhesin on the f. nucleatum cells and a carbohydrate receptor on the p. gingivalis cells. in this investigation, we have localized the adhesin activity of f. nucleatum t18 to the outer membrane on the basis of the ability of f. nucleatum t18 vesicles to coaggregate with whole cells of p. gingivalis t22 and the ability of the outer membrane fraction of f. nucleatum t18 to inhibit coaggregation between whole cells of f. nucleatum t18 and p. gingivalis t22. proteolytic pretreatment of the f. nucleatum t18 outer membrane fraction resulted in a loss of coaggregation inhibition, confirming the proteinaceous nature of the adhesin. the f. nucleatum t18 outer membrane fraction was found to be enriched for several proteins, including a 42-kda major outer membrane protein which appeared to be exposed on the bacterial cell surface. fab fragments prepared from antiserum raised to the 42-kda outer membrane protein were found to partially but specifically block coaggregation. these data support the conclusion that the 42-kda major outer membrane protein of f. nucleatum t18 plays a role in mediating coaggregation with p. gingivalis t22.
phenotypic analysis of b-cells extracted from human periodontal disease tissue.
b-cells extracted from periodontal disease tissue were analyzed for the presence  of activation markers using a range of monoclonal antibodies. in adult periodontitis (ap), 6% of b-cells expressed the il-2 receptor (cd25) compared with 1-2% in peripheral blood and healthy or marginal gingivitis (h/mg) gingival b-cells. there was also an increase in the mean percentage of igd-positive b-cells and a decrease in cd21 and cd22 expression. in both ap and h/mg lesions, 20-22% of the b-cells expressed cd23 compared with less than 5% in peripheral blood. as b-cells are activated by day 3 in culture and start differentiating into immunoglobulin-secreting cells by day 6, b-cell phenotypes were assayed at these times in this study. following stimulation with the periodontopathic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis, the expression of cd23, cd21 and cd22 on b-cells extracted from ap lesions remained relatively constant over the 6-d culture period. however, with fusobacterium nucleatum stimulation, there was a significant decrease in cd23, cd21 and cd22 expression after 3 d in culture, which corresponds to the activation time for b-cells. these results show that b-cells extracted from periodontal disease tissue display a range of activation markers and on stimulation, demonstrate differing responses to individual periodontopathic bacteria.
comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.
isolation and purification of bacteriocin from prevotella intermedia (bacteroides intermedius).
thirty-three out of 46 strains of prevotella intermedia (bacteroides intermedius) isolated from gingival deposits of patients with adult periodontitis possessed the ability to inhibit growth of p. intermedia strain atcc 25611, and 6 of the 33 showed strong inhibitory activity. thirteen isolates did not have the ability to inhibit the growth of p. intermedia strain atcc 25611. an inhibition factor from one of the isolates, p. intermedia th14 which had strong inhibition, was purified and characterized. bacteriocin th14 activity was effective against only p. intermedia atcc 25611 and fusobacterium nucleatum, but not against other crevicular bacteria, including p. intermedia atcc 33563, porphyromonas gingivalis (bacteroides gingivalis), capnocytophaga sputigena and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. streptococci, actinomyces, and veillonellas were not inhibited by bacteriocin th14. bacteriocin th14 was heat sensitive, proteinaceous with molecular weight of 1,700 daltons and inhibited the growth of strain atcc 25611 in 15 minutes. the growth inhibition of p. intermedia atcc 25611 by bacteriocin th14 was found to be due to the bactericidal activity of the bacteriocin.
the rna polymerases of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum are unrelated to the rna polymerase of escherichia coli.
western blot analysis that used antisera to the e. coli core enzyme and sigma factors was used for examination of the rna polymerase of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. both antisera reacted with proteins in a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. mutans whole-cell extracts. reactions were seen with some f. nucleatum proteins when the anti-core rna polymerase antisera were used, but the cross-reacting proteins were not of an expected molecular weight for beta or beta'. no reaction with f. nucleatum proteins was seen when extracts were reacted with antisera to e. coli sigma factor. there were no cross-reacting proteins detected in p. gingivalis extracts with either antisera. these results suggest that e. coli rna polymerase may not be sufficiently similar to p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase for e. coli rna polymerase to recognize p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum promoters. partially purified p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase exhibited a specificity for a p. gingivalis dna template, while having a decreased activity from an e. coli dna template. the antibiotic sensitivity profile of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase activity was shown to differ from that of e. coli, with these activities not being affected by rifampicin, streptovaricin, or streptolydigin. we conclude that the efficient cloning and expression of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum genes in e. coli will require the use of promoter-containing expression vectors.
[ecosystem of microbial flora in periodontal pockets, in vitro].
this study was designed to analyze the succession of an ecosystem of microbial flora in periodontal pockets, in vitro. bacterial strains used in this study, were fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, porphyromonas gingivalis 381, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10557 and streptococcus mutans omz 176. the bacterial cells, associated with beneficial, pathogenic or plaque forming activity, were cultured in brain heart infusion medium including hemin, vitamin-k1, l-cysteine hydrochloride and sodium thioglycollate under anaerobic condition (n2: 80%, co2: 10%, h2: 10%). the effect of environmental eh and ph on the growth of bacterial cells was investigated in single and mixed culture, and eh and ph tolerance tests were also undertaken. the environmental ph decreased from ph 7.0 to ph 4.9 accompanied with the growth of s. mutans omz 176 and s. sanguis atcc 10557 in both single and mixed culture. the environmental eh increased from -308 mv to -180 mv accompanied with the growth of s. sanguis atcc 10557. the growth of pathogenic bacteria, such as f. nucleatum atcc 10953 and p. gingivalis 381, varied markedly with eh and ph. especially, the growth of p. gingivalis 381 was severely inhibited at or below ph 6.0 in an acid tolerance test, whereas the growth of f. nucleatum atcc 10953 was strongly inhibited at eh -100 mv in an eh tolerance test. the oxygen generation (10.8%) was confirmed in the anaerobic culture of s. sanguis atcc 10557. therefore, it was suggested that hydrogen peroxide produced by s. sanguis atcc 10557 was reduced to oxygen and water. these results suggest that the high eh and the low ph generated from bacterial metabolism is a powerful determinant in ecology of microbial flora in periodontal pockets.
inhibition of coaggregation between fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis by lactose and related sugars.
the coaggregation of fusobacterium nucleatum pk1594 and porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis pk1924 was inhibited equally well by lactose, n-acetyl-d-galactosamine, and d-galactose, which caused 50% inhibition of coaggregation at 2 mm sugar concentration. other sugars such as d-galactosamine, d-fucose (6-deoxy-d-galactose), and alpha-methyl- and beta-methyl-d-galactosides also inhibited coaggregation. sugar specificity was apparent, since neither l-fucose, l-rhamnose, n-acetyl-d-glucosamine, nor n-acetylneuraminic acid was an inhibitor. protease treatment of the fusobacterium completely abolished coaggregation, whereas it had no effect on the coaggregating activity of the porphyromonad. although numerous lactose-inhibitable coaggregating pairs are known to occur among gram-positive bacteria, this report and the accompanying survey (p. e. kolenbrander, r. n. andersen, and l. v. h. moore, infect. immun. 57:3194-3203, 1989) are the first studies demonstrating the extensive nature of this type of interaction between gram-negative human oral bacteria. the significance of galactoside-inhibitable coaggregations between these two potential periodontal pathogens is discussed.
