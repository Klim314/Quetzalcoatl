interactions of salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar typhimurium with  gut bacteria.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the gut microbiota on the growth and survival of s. typhimurium. this was tested in two-species co-cultures and in mixed cultures with a simplified gut model microbiota. subsequently, interactions between s. typhimurium and human faecal bacteria were quantified in both batch and continuous culture systems simulating the human colon. the exponential growth of s. typhimurium was halted when the population of escherichia coli reached the maximum population density in a two-compartment co-culture system where the two species were separated by a 0.45 mum pore membrane. furthermore, the growth of some gut bacteria such as lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium bifidum was inhibited by the presence of s. typhimurium in the other compartment. the survival of s. typhimurium was severely affected in mixed batch cultures with human faecal samples; a reduction of 10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml in the concentration of s. typhimurium was observed in these cultures. however, no effect on s. typhimurium survival was observed in mixed batch cultures with a simplified gut model microbiota under the same conditions. the effect of human faecal samples on s. typhimurium in a three-stage continuous culture was different to that obtained in batch cultures; its growth rather than survival was affected under these conditions. s. typhimurium growth was inhibited, and the bacterium was therefore eliminated by the continuous flow of the medium. depending upon culturing conditions, the gut microbiota caused either growth inhibition, inactivation or did not affect s. typhimurium.
individual and co-operative roles of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the killing activity of enteric strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 against enteric, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated pathogens.
the mechanism underlying the killing activity of lactobacillus strains against bacterial pathogens appears to be multifactorial. here, we investigate the respective contributions of hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid in killing bacterial pathogens associated with the human vagina, urinary tract or intestine by two hydrogen peroxide-producing strains. in co-culture, the human intestinal strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and human vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 strains killed enteric salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344, vaginal gardnerella vaginalis dsm 4944 and urinary tract escherichia coli cft073 pathogens. the cell-free culture supernatants (cfcss) produced the same reduction in sl1344, dsm 4944 and cft073 viability, whereas isolated bacteria had no effect. the killing activity of cfcss was heat-stable. in the presence of dulbecco's modified eagle's minimum essential medium inhibiting the lactic acid-dependent killing activity, cfcss were less effective at killing of the pathogens. catalase-treated cfcss displayed a strong decreased activity. tested alone, hydrogen peroxide triggered a concentration-dependent killing activity against all three pathogens. lactic acid alone developed a killing activity only at concentrations higher than that present in cfcss. in the presence of lactic acid at a concentration present in lactobacillus cfcss, hydrogen peroxide displayed enhanced killing activity. collectively, these results demonstrate that for hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus strains, the main metabolites of lactobacillus, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, act co-operatively to kill enteric, vaginosis-associated and uropathogenic pathogens.
subtractive screening for probiotic properties of lactobacillus species from the  human gastrointestinal tract in the search for new probiotics.
in the search for new probiotics, 61 lactobacillus spp. isolates, belonging to 12 species and isolated as dominant lactic acid bacteria from the feces of healthy humans, were subjected to a subtractive system of in vitro analyses, which included desirable and undesirable traits. twenty-four isolates were able to grow in 2% bovine bile, of which 13 grew in acidified broth at ph 3.5 in acidified cysteine-containing mrs broth. intrinsic resistance to certain antimicrobial agents (cefoxitin, metronidazole, vancomycin) was observed in most isolates, but atypical resistances to erythromycin, clindamycin, or tetracycline were also found in 5 strains. undesirable traits such as alpha-chymotrypsin or n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities were not detected, but low beta-glucuronidase and moderate beta-glucosidase activities were recorded in 2 strains. two lactobacillus gasseri and 2 lactobacillus paracasei selected strains inhibited several intestinal pathogens in an agar spot test, including strains of escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus. they also adhered to human caco-2 and ht-29 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg, and were unable to degrade pig gastric mucin in a plate assay. together, these results suggest these 4 strains to be good probiotic candidates, concluding that the subtractive screening devised in this work could be a valuable tool in large-scale surveys for probiotics.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
