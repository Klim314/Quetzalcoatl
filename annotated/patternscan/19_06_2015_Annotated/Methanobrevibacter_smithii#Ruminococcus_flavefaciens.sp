TI  == in vitro bacterial growth and in vivo ruminal microbiota populations associated with bloat in steers grazing wheat forage.
AB  == the role of ruminal bacteria in the frothy bloat complex common to cattle grazing winter wheat has not been previously determined. two experiments, one in vitro and another in vivo, were designed to elucidate the effects of fresh wheat forage on bacterial growth, biofilm complexes, rumen fermentation end products, rumen bacterial diversity, and bloat potential. in exp. 1, 6 strains of ruminal bacteria (streptococcus bovis strain 26, prevotella ruminicola strain 23, eubacterium ruminantium b1c23, ruminococcus albus sy3, fibrobacter succinogenes ssp. s85, and ruminococcus flavefaciens c94) were used in vitro to determine the  effect of soluble plant protein from winter wheat forage on specific bacterial growth rate, biofilm complexes, vfa, and ruminal h2 and ch4 in mono or coculture  with methanobrevibacter smithii. the specific growth rate in plant protein medium containing soluble plant protein (3.27% nitrogen) was measured during a 24-h incubation at 39 degrees c in hungate tubes under a co2 gas phase. a monoculture  of m. smithii was grown similarly, except under h2:co2 (1:1), in a basal methanogen growth medium supplemented likewise with soluble plant protein. in exp. 2, 6 ruminally cannulated steers grazing wheat forage were used to evaluate  the influence of bloat on the production of biofilm complexes, ruminal microbial  biodiversity patterns, and ruminal fluid protein fractions. in exp. 1, cultures of r. albus (p < 0.01) and r. flavefaciens (p < 0.05) produced the most h2 among  strains and resulted in greater (p < 0.01) ch4 production when cocultured with m. smithii than other coculture combinations. cultures of s. bovis and e. ruminantium + m. smithii produced the most biofilm mass among strains. in exp. 2, when diets changed from bermudagrass hay to wheat forage, biofilm production increased (p < 0.01). biofilm production, concentrations of whole ruminal content (p < 0.01), and cheesecloth filtrate protein fractions (p < 0.05) in the ruminal  fluid were greater on d 50 for bloated than for nonbloated steers when grazing wheat forage. the molecular analysis of the 16s rdna showed that 2 different ruminal microbiota populations developed between bloated and nonbloated animals grazing wheat forage. bloat in cattle grazing wheat pastures may be caused by increased production of biofilm, resulting from a diet-influenced switch in the rumen bacterial population.

TI  == the effect of a methanogen, methanobrevibacter smithii, on the growth rate, organic acid production, and specific atp activity of three predominant ruminal cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  == three predominant ruminal cellulolytic organisms, fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus albus 8, and r. flavefaciens fd-1, were cultured with a methanogen,  methanobrevibacter smithii. growth rates, bacterial protein, organic acids, and methane production were measured. when grown in diculture with the methanogen, a  fermentative advantage was observed with f. succinogenes s85 as seen by an increase in specific rate of atp production and organic acid concentration. the introduction of the methanogen did not improve the growth rate, organic acid yield, or specific rate of atp production for r. albus 8. the growth rate and amount of organic acid end products increased when r. flavefaciens fd-1 was cultured with the methanogen; however, the specific activity of atp production did not increase.
