TI  == antibacterial activity and mode of action of the artemisia capillaris essential oil and its constituents against respiratory tract infection-causing pathogens.
AB  == inhalation therapy using essential oils has been used to treat acute and chronic  sinusitis and bronchitis. the aim of the present study was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of artemisia capillaris, and evaluate the antibacterial effects of the essential oil and its main components, against common clinically relevant respiratory bacterial pathogens. gas chromatography and gas chromatographymass spectrometry revealed the presence of 25 chemical constituents, the main constituents being: alphapinene, betapinene, limonene, 1,8cineole, piperitone, betacaryophyllene and capillin. the antibacterial activities of the essential oil, and its major constituents, were evaluated against streptococcus pyogenes, methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), mrsa (clinical strain), methicillingentamicin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mgrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli. the essential oil and its constituents exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against the various strains. the essential oil was observed to be much more potent, as compared with any of its major chemical constituents, exhibiting low minimum inhibitory and bacteriocidal concentration values against all of the bacterial strains. the essential oil was most active against s. pyogenes, mrsa (clinical strain), s. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and e. coli. piperitone and  capillin were the most potent growth inhibitors, among the major chemical constituents. furthermore, the essential oil of a. capillaris induced significant and dosedependent morphological changes in the s. aureus bacterial strain, killing >90% of the bacteria when administered at a higher dose; as determined by scanning electron microscopy. in addition, the essential oil induced a significant leakage of potassium and phosphate ions from the s. aureus bacterial  cultures. these results indicate that the antibacterial action of a. capillaris essential oil may be mediated through the leakage of these two important ions. in conclusion, a. capillaris essential oil exhibits potent antibacterial activity by inducing morphological changes and leakage of ions in s. aureus bacterial cultures.

TI  == sputum bacteriology and antibiotic sensitivity patterns of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adult patients in nigeria: a 5-year multicentre retrospective study.
AB  == background: a clear knowledge of the pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in a given region and their antibiotic sensitivity patterns is necessary for optimal treatment. we determined the common bacterial pathogens causing cap in nigeria and further reviewed their antibiotic senstivity patterns  with a view to providing recommendations to improve antibiotic management of cap. methods: case notes of all adult patients who were 18 years or more admitted to four major tertiary hospitals in south east nigeria with a diagnosis of cap between 2008 and 2012 were retrospectively studied. to be eligible, patients were required to have sputum culture and sensitivity results available. socio-demographic, clinical, pre-admission and in-hospital treatment data were also obtained. results: of 400 patients with a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of cap, 232 fulfilled the study criteria; 122 (52.6%) were women and the mean age was 50.6 +/- 18.8 years. aetiological agents were identified from sputum in 189 (81.5%) patients. streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 90, 47.6%) was the most frequent  isolate followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 62, 32.8%), staphylococcus aureus  (n = 24, 12.7%) and streptococcus pyogenes (n = 13, 6.9%). the pathogens were most sensitive to levofloxacin (77%), ceftazidime (75.5%) and ofloxacin (55.8%).  the susceptibility of the isolates to antibiotics most frequently presecribed for empirical therapy was low (co-amoxiclav, 47.6%; ciprofloxacin, 45.9% and ceftriaxone, 47.6%) and this was associated with higher mortality and/or longer duration of hospital stay in survivors. conclusion: strep. pneumoniae and k. pneumoniae were the most common causes of cap. the pathogens were most sensitive  to levofloxacin and ceftazidime. we suggest that these antibiotics should increasingly be considered as superior options for empirical treatment of cap in  nigeria.

TI  == subclinical pulmonary pathogenic infection in camels slaughtered in cairo, egypt.
AB  == introduction: camels migrate between the open boundaries of sudan and egypt either for grazing or for slaughtering. bad hygiene and stress is often related to pulmonary diseases in camels. this study investigated whether camels slaughtered in cairo carried pulmonary infections. methodology: five hundred lung tissues of slaughtered camels were examined and 100 samples suspected for pulmonary infection were subjected to microbial identification and histopathology. results: a total of 70 lung tissues revealed 97 bacterial isolates of 8 species, including staphylococcus aureus (37.14%), escherichia coli (27.14%), klebsiella pneumoniae (26.71%), bacillus spp. (25.72%), streptococcus pyogenes (10%), corynebacterium spp. (8.85 %), pasteurella spp. (2.85%), and arcanobacterium pyogenes (1.4%). some of these species were earlier reported to be associated with pulmonary infection. histopathology revealed different types of pneumonia in 50% of the investigated lungs. conclusions: a considerable number of apparently healthy camels carry pathogenic agents in their lower respiratory tracts. immunosuppression and stressful conditions might influence these pathogens to induce respiratory diseases in camels. thus, the infected camels might act as reservoir of these infections agents. if adequate care is not taken, this might be a threat to abattoir workers and may spread infections to humans.

TI  == establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the food and drug administration safety and innovation act. final rule.
AB  == the food and drug administration (fda or agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. this final rule implements a provision of the generating antibiotic incentives now (gain) title of the food and drug administration safety and innovation act (fdasia). gain is intended to encourage  development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of  exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, fda has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' acinetobacter species, aspergillus species, burkholderia cepacia complex, campylobacter species, candida species, clostridium difficile, coccidioides species, cryptococcus species, enterobacteriaceae (e.g.,  klebsiella pneumoniae), enterococcus species, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium  tuberculosis complex, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, pseudomonas species, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and vibrio cholerae. the preamble to the  proposed rule described the factors the agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. as described in the preamble of this final rule, fda applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.

TI  == bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria.
AB  == background: pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. the disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. pid is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. this situation is not in any way different here in nigeria and more so in the federal capital territory, abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on pid. it therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. materials and methods: endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease (pid), attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. results: out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. organisms encountered were  staphylococcus aureus (16%), escherichia coli (10%), streptococcus faecalis (8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), streptococcus pyogenes (3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), proteus rettgeri (2%) and proteus mirabilis (1%). the highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). the age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). there was a significant difference in the acquisition of pid in relation to marital status (p < 0.05). however there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (p > 0.05). antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of pid due to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. conclusion: in conclusion, pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. pid is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. there is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. pid hence can be said to be a very serious  complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. the right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation.  treatment of pid should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with pid, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.

TI  == retrospective analysis of antimicrobial resistance and bacterial spectrum of infection in gabon, central africa.
AB  == background: physicians depend on reliable information on the local epidemiology of infection and antibiotic resistance rates to guide empiric treatment in critically ill patients. as these data are scarce for central africa, we performed a retrospective analysis of microbiological findings from a secondary care hospital in gabon. methods: microbiological reports from 2009 to 2012 were used to assess the non-susceptibility rates of the three most common isolates from six major types of infections (bloodstream, ear-eye-nose-throat, surgical site, skin and soft tissue, urinary tract and wound infection). results: a high diversity of pathogens was found, but staphylococcus aureus was predominant in the majority of infections. overall, the three most prevalent pathogens in children were s. aureus (33.7%), streptococcus pyogenes (8.1%) and escherichia coli (4.5%) and in adults s. aureus (23.5%), e. coli (15.1%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (7.4%). in total, 5.8% (n = 19) of all s. aureus isolates were methicillin resistant. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)  producing enterobacteriaceae was 15.4% (n = 78), 49.4% of all k. pneumoniae were  esbl-producer (n = 42). conclusion: the high diversity of potential pathogens and high resistance rates in gram-negative bacteria challenge a rational empiric use  of antibiotics. countrywide continuous sentinel surveillance is therefore urgently needed.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == plant-based hydrocarbon esters from tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  == antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw), aeromonas hydrophila, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (bacillus cereus and proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against k. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, b. pseudomallei, alcaligens viscolactis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane  and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. for example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (mic of 7.8 microg/ml) against a. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (mic of 15.6 microg/ml) against p. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (mic of 31.25 microg/ml) on b. pseudomallei. cytotoxic effects of compounds were  assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an xtt assay. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. the 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. in conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane  isolated from t. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly lucilia cuprina.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly lucilia sericata (meigen) (diptera:calliphoridae) against bacteria. however, the antibacterial activity of  its sibling species, lucilia cuprina (wiedemann) (diptera:calliphoridae) against  a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. the aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of l. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli). the turbidimetric assay demonstrated that l. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (p < 0.001). additionally, colony-forming unit (cfu), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against p. aeruginosa. the reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. these observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.

TI  == anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of diospyros bipindensis (gurke) extracts and its main constituents.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: diospyros bipindensis (gurke) stem bark is used in cameroon by baka pygmies for the treatment of respiratory disorders. aim of the study: to assess the anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antioxidant properties of constituents from the bark extracts through bioassay-guided fractionation. materials and methods: the anti-inflammatory activity of extracts, fractions and pure compounds was assessed through the inhibition of the pro-inflammatory mediator nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) transcriptional activity and nitric oxide (no) production. dpph, abts and orac assays were used for determining the antioxidant properties. the activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, was evaluated on the basis of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) by the macrodilution method. results: the water extract showed antimicrobial activity against s. pneumoniae (mic: 300 mug/ml) and s. pyogenes (mic: 300 mug/ml). the dichloromethane extract efficiently inhibited nf-kappab transcriptional activity  and no production and exhibited significant antioxidant activity in the orac assay. an interesting activity was also found against s. pneumoniae (mic: 200 mug/ml), s. aureus (mic: 400 mug/ml) and s. pyogenes (mic: 200 mug/ml). the phytochemical investigation of the dichloromethane extract afforded plumbagin, canaliculatin, ismailin, betulinic acid and 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-coumarin as the main constituents. plumbagin and ismailin were found to be responsible for the main biological activities observed. conclusions: these results may provide a rational support for the traditional use of diospyros bipindensis stem bark in the treatment of respiratory disorders, since the anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds isolated from the dichloromethane extract were also present in the traditional water extract.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

TI  == novel carbapenem antibiotics for parenteral and oral applications: in vitro and in vivo activities of 2-aryl carbapenems and their pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals.
AB  == sm-295291 and sm-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such  as methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with mic(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. unlike tebipenem (mic(50), 8 mug/ml), sm-295291 and sm-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(50), >/=  128 mug/ml). the bactericidal activities of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. the therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. sm-295291 and sm-369926 showed intravenous  pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase i. sm-368589 and sm-375769, which are medoxomil esters of sm-295291 and sm-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral,  oral, and switch therapies.

AB  == the crystal structure of an extremely thermostable udp-glucose dehydrogenase (udp-gdh) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrobaculum islandicum was determined at a resolution of 2.0 a. the overall fold was comprised of an n-terminal nad(+) dinucleotide binding domain and a c-terminal udp-sugar binding  domain connected by a long alpha-helix, and the main-chain coordinates of the enzyme were similar to those of previously studied udp-gdhs, including the enzymes from burkholderia cepacia, streptococcus pyogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae. however, the sizes of several surface loops in p. islandicum udp-gdh  were much smaller than the corresponding loops in b. cepacia udp-gdh but were comparable to those of the s. pyogenes and k. pneumoniae enzymes. structural comparison revealed that the presence of extensive intersubunit hydrophobic interactions, as well as the formation of an intersubunit aromatic pair network,  is likely to be the main factor contributing to the hyperthermostability of p. islandicum udp-gdh.

TI  == chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  == background: in 1957, tunisia introduced 117 species of eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. actually, eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. a few investigations were reported on the biological activities of eucalyptus oils worldwide. in tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. at that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against  clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. methods:  the essential oils of eight eucalyptus species harvested from the jbel abderrahman, korbous (north east tunisia) and souinet arboreta (north of tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. results: twenty five components were identified by gc/fid  and gc/ms. these components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. the chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. according to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % i, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to eucalyptus oils. the cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within eucalyptus species  oils. conclusions: e. odorata showed the strongest activity against s. aureus, h. influenzae, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and against all the tested  fungal strains. in addition, e. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. however, the best antiviral activity appeared with e. bicostata. virus pretreatment with e. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (ic(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, si = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (ic(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, si =  3.33). the essential oil of e. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. this activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.

TI  == recent trend of necrotizing fasciitis in taiwan: focus on monomicrobial klebsiella pneumoniae necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  == background: necrotizing fasciitis (nf) is a rapidly progressive, life-threatening soft-tissue infection that is traditionally caused by group a streptococcus (gas) or mixed aerobic/anaerobic bacteria. monomicrobial klebsiella pneumoniae nf (kp-nf) has been reported since 1996 but has not yet been systematically studied. methods: we retrospectively studied consecutive nf cases treated at a university  hospital in taiwan during 1997-2010 and investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with monomicrobial kp-nf, using monomicrobial gas-nf as a reference. we also analyzed the virulence gene profiles of the isolated k. pneumoniae strains. results: of 134 nf cases, 88 were monomicrobial, of which the most common pathogens were gas (n = 16) and k. pneumoniae (n = 15). monomicrobial kp-nf entailed a moderate risk of limb loss (20% vs 25%; p = 1.000) and high mortality (47% vs 19%; p = .135), and it was more likely to involve bacteremia (80% vs 31%; p = .011), concomitant distant abscesses (27% vs 0%; p = .043), and  underlying immunocompromising conditions (100% vs 63%; p = .018), compared with gas-nf. the isolated k. pneumoniae strains (n = 10) were of capsular polysaccharides genotype k1 (n = 4), k54/k20/k5 (n = 4), k2 (n = 1), and k16 (n = 1). all strains carried rmpa, iucabcdiuta, and iroa. genotype k1 strains had a significantly higher risk of concomitant distant abscesses, compared with non-k1  strains (75% vs 0%; p = .033). conclusions: k. pneumoniae has become a common pathogen of monomicrobial nf in taiwan. physicians treating patients with monomicrobial kp-nf should be aware of the risk of concomitant distant abscesses, particularly in cases caused by genotype k1.

AB  == the on time diagnostics of bacterial diseases is one of the essential steps in the foregoing treatment of such pathogens. here we sought to present an easy to use and robust method for the discrimination between gram-positive (enterococcus  faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae) bacterial genera based on surface enhanced raman scattering (sers) spectroscopy. the robustness of our approach lies in the novel  method for the production of the ser substrate based on silver nanoparticles and  their subsequent re-crystallization in solutions containing high concentrations of chloride ions. the method presented here could be an interesting alternative both to commonly used histochemical approaches and commercial sers substrates.

TI  == [taxonomic characteristics and mixed communities of wound infection agents in patients of reanimation and surgical departments of a hospital].
AB  == aim: study of taxonomical structure ofwound infection agents, prevalence of mixes, and detection of character of their possible connection with the results of various microorganisms population interaction in septic wounds. materials and  methods: a microbiological study of material from patients with wound infection (wi), 582 of those were cured in reanimation and intensive therapy departments (ritd; group 1) and 1455 - in surgical departments (sd; group 2), was performed.  taxonomic membership and ability to coexist was determined in 4129 microorganisms strains. etiological role of the agents was evaluated by using values of consistency rate (cr). species that were present in more than 50% of samples were considered consistent, in 25 to 50%--additional, and in less than 25%--random. frequency rates (fr) were also determined, that is the fraction of a certain species (genus) of the microorganism (in %) from all the isolated cultures that correspond to 100%. for the determination of the significance of individual species of the agent in the structure of mixed microorganism populations, fr - their fraction (%) in mixed population from the number of strains of this species that correspond to 100% - was calculated. results: a significant part of the microorganisms strains, more frequently in reanimation department (65.5%), caused wound suppuration in populations mixed with other species of the agents. in reanimation and surgical departments consistent species of wound infection agents were not detected. a leading etiological role of staphylococcus aureus (fr 19.2%  and 23.9%) was determined, and fr of s. aureus strains in mixes was 64.6% in ritd and 46.8% in sd. the parameters ofotheragents of wi in the comparison groups were similar. however fr among mixes in ritd were significantly higher for streptococci that do not belong to s. pyogenes species (72,5%), and also nonfermentative microorganisms (67,2%), and in sd - in klebsiella pneumoniae mixes. for agents of wound infection especially in ritd, low species diversity was characteristic and the number of mixes variants is significantly higher. in ritd mixed infections develop more frequently, and the ecological community of microorganisms reaches higher values than in sd. conclusion: during the analysis  of microbiologi-cal data in ritd and sd general patterns and specific features of taxonomical structure, prevalence of mixed populations and character of their ecological community in wound infection was determined.

TI  == minim typing--a rapid and low cost mlst based typing tool for klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == here we report a single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) based genotyping method for klebsiella pneumoniae utilising high-resolution melting (hrm) analysis of fragments within the multilocus sequence typing (mlst) loci. the approach is termed mini-mlst or minim typing and it has previously been applied to streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. six snps  were derived from concatenated mlst sequences on the basis of maximisation of the simpsons index of diversity (d). dna fragments incorporating these snps and predicted to be suitable for hrm analysis were designed. using the assumption that hrm alleles are defined by g+c content, minim typing using six fragments was predicted to provide a d = 0.979 against known sts. the method was tested against 202 k. pneumoniae using a blinded approach in which the mlst analyses were performed after the hrm analyses. the hrm-based alleles were indeed in accordance with g+c content, and the minim typing identified known sts and flagged new sts.  the tonb mlst locus was determined to be very diverse, and the two minim fragments located herein contribute greatly to the resolving power. however these fragments are refractory to amplification in a minority of isolates. therefore, we assessed the performance of two additional formats: one using only the four fragments located outside the tonb gene (d = 0.929), and the other using hrm data from these four fragments in conjunction with sequencing of the tonb mlst fragment (d = 0.995). the hrm assays were developed on the rotorgene 6000, and the method was shown to also be robust on the lightcycler 480, allowing a 384-well high through-put format. the assay provides rapid, robust and low-cost typing with fully portable results that can directly be related to current mlst data. minim typing in combination with molecular screening for antibiotic resistance markers can be a powerful surveillance tool kit.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == different potency of bacterial antigens tlr2 and tlr4 ligands in stimulating mature mast cells to cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis.
AB  == the aim of study was to compare the potency of different bacterial antigens to induce rat mature mast cell to cysteinyl leukotriene (cyslt) generation. we examined toll-like receptor (tlr)2 agonists, i.e. lipoteichoic acid (lta) staphylococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, lipoarabinomannan (lam) mycobacterium smegmatis, peptydoglican (pgn) staphylococcus aureus, as well as tlr4 agonists, i.e. lipopolysaccharide (lps) klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, pophyromonas gingivalis and escherichia coli. we also estimated the effect of tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-, interleukin (il)-6-, ccl5-, and il-10-priming on mast cell cyslt synthesis following bacterial antigen activation. we found that all bacterial antigens activated mast cells to cyslt generation; however, the extent of cyslt release in response to stimulation varied. out of the examined antigens lps p. gingivalis exhibited the highest potency, as it induced cyslt generation acting at a very low concentration (10(-4) ng/ml). other lpss affected mast cells at higher (up to 10(5) -fold) concentrations. ltas were the most effective at concentrations of 5 x 10(2) ng/ml, while lam and pgn stimulated mast cells to maximal cyslt generation at concentrations as high as 10(5) ng/ml. anti-tlr2 and anti-tlr4 antibodies, as well as nuclear factor kappab (nf-kappab) inhibitor significantly diminished cyslt generation in response to bacterial antigen stimulation. priming with tnf,  il-6 and ccl5 did not affect bacterial antigen-induced cyslt generation, while il-10-pretreatment caused significant decrease in cyslt synthesis by mast cells.  these observations might have a great pathophysiological importance; inasmuch cyslts strongly influence the development and intensity of inflammation during bacterial infection.

TI  == rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16s rdna sequences.
AB  == accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (hrma) of 16s rdna sequences. real-time pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene fragment, spanning the variable region v5 and v6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. first, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. six of the isolates, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus  uberis, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, arcanobacterium pyogenes, corynebacterium bovis and streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. four of the type strains, e. coli, s. agalactiae, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of a. pyogenes, e. coli, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, k. pneumoniae, s. uberis and s. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the hrma. next, the hrma was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. the three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. overall accuracy of the validation assay was  95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity  observed in the pcr amplicons of s. uberis. the present study revealed that broad-range real-time pcr with hrma can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost  tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.

TI  == multistep resistance development studies of ceftaroline in gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  == ceftaroline, the active component of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a novel  broad-spectrum cephalosporin with bactericidal activity against gram-positive and -negative isolates. this study evaluated the potential for ceftaroline and comparator antibiotics to select for clones of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis with elevated mics.  s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes isolates in the present study were highly susceptible to ceftaroline (mic range, 0.004 to 0.25 mug/ml). no streptococcal strains yielded ceftaroline clones with increased mics (defined as an increase in mic of >4-fold) after 50 daily passages. ceftaroline mics for h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were 0.06 to 2 mug/ml for four strains and 8 mug/ml for a beta-lactamase-positive, efflux-positive h. influenzae with a mutation in l22. one h. influenzae clone with an increased ceftaroline mic (quinolone-resistant, beta-lactamase-positive) was recovered after 20 days. the ceftaroline mic for this isolate increased 16-fold, from 0.06 to 1 mug/ml. mics for s. aureus ranged  from 0.25 to 1 mug/ml. no s. aureus isolates tested with ceftaroline had clones with increased mic (>4-fold) after 50 passages. two e. faecalis isolates tested had ceftaroline mics increased from 1 to 8 mug/ml after 38 days and from 4 to 32  mug/ml after 41 days, respectively. the parental ceftaroline mic for the one k. pneumoniae extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative isolate tested was 0.5 mug/ml and did not change after 50 daily passages.

TI  == bacteriological and clinical profile of community acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
AB  == the aim of our study was to obtain comprehensive insight into the bacteriological and clinical profile of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization. the patient population consisted of 100 patients admitted with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (cap), as defined by british thoracic society, from  december 1998 to dec 2000, at the sher- i-kashmir institute of medical sciences soura, srinagar, india. gram negative organisms were the commonest cause (19/29), followed by gram positive (10/29). in 71 cases no etiological cause was obtained. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest pathogen (10/29), followed by staphylococcus aureus (7/29), escherichia coli (6/29), klebsiella spp. (3/29), streptococcus pyogenes (1/29), streptococcus pneumoniae (1/29) and acinetobacter  spp. (1/29). sputum was the most common etiological source of organism isolation  (26) followed by blood (6), pleural fluid (3), and pus culture (1). maximum number of patients presented with cough (99%), fever (95%), tachycardia (92%), pleuritic chest pain (75%), sputum production (65%) and leucocytosis (43%). the commonest predisposing factors were smoking (65%), copd (57%), structural lung disease (21%), diabetes mellitus (13%), and decreased level of consciousness following seizure (eight per cent) and chronic alcoholism (one per cent). fourteen patients, of whom, nine were males and five females, died. staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in four, pseudomonas in two, klebsiella in one, and no organism was isolated in seven cases. the factors predicting mortality at admission were - age over 62 years, history of copd or smoking, hypotension, altered sensorium, respiratory failure, leucocytosis, and staphylococcus pneumonia and undetermined etiology. the overall rate of identification of microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia was 29%, which is very low, and if serological tests for legionella, mycoplasma and viruses are performed the diagnostic yield would definitely be better. this emphasizes the need for further studies (including the serological tests for legionella, mycoplasma and viruses) to identify the microbial etiology of cap.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory pathogens recently isolated in italy: focus on cefditoren.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory pathogens recently isolated in italy to commonly used antibiotics including cefditoren. six clinical microbiological laboratories collected, between january and september 2009, a total of 2,510 respiratory pathogens from subjects with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (carti). ceftditoren, out of all the beta-lactams studied, had the lowest mic(90 )against  965 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae examined, followed by cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (2% resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp)). against 470 haemophilus influenzae , independently of their production of beta-lactamases or ampicillin resistance, cefditoren was the oral cephalosporin with the best in  vitro activity, comparable to that of the injectable cephalosporins and levofloxacin. higher mic(90)s were found for the macrolides (4 - 16 mg/l) and cefaclor (4 - 32 mg/l). as was foreseeable, streptococcus pyogenes (225 strains)  was uniformly sensitive to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, but the elevated mic(90 )values reduced (<75%) susceptibility of this pathogen to macrolides. beta-lactamase-negative moraxella catarrhalis (100 strains) had reduced susceptibility only to the macrolides, while the 250 beta-lactamase-producing strains also had reduced susceptibility to cefuroxime. levofloxacin showed the lowest mic(50)/mic(90 )values in the producing strains, whereas cefditoren, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone in the non-producers. as regards the enterobacteriaceae, cefditoren and levofloxacin had the lowest mic(90)s against klebsiella pneumoniae. cefditoren and the third-generation injectable cephalosporins had the lowest mic(90)s against escherichia coli (100% susceptibility) while levofloxacin was less active (86% susceptibility).in conclusion, cefditoren's wide spectrum and high intrinsic activity, as well as its capacity to overcome most of the resistance that has become consolidated in some classes of antibiotics widely used as empiric therapy for carti, allows us to suggest that cefditoren might be included in the european guidelines as one of the first-choice antibiotics in the treatment of carti.

TI  == [immunization and bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx as risk factors for alopecia areata].
AB  == introduction: alopecia areata is an autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the hair follicles. researchers are currently interested in whether the presence of bacterial pathogens and/or a history of immunization can trigger an autoimmune response in patients who are genetically predisposed. objectives: this study aimed to determine whether there is an association between the development of alopecia areata and throat carriage of bacterial pathogens or a history of immunization. material and methods: sixty-five men and women with alopecia areata and 65 control patients with other skin diseases were studied at the dr ladislao  de la pascua dermatology clinic between september 2008 and february 2009. the patients ranged in age from 18-59 years. patients with scalp diseases were excluded from the control group. in all cases, the patient was questioned about immunizations received in the previous 6 months, and a throat swab was cultured.  results: a history of immunization (odds ratio [or], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.6-6.7; p=.001), the presence of bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx (or, 2.6; 95% ci, 1.1-6.2; p=.033), and being a carrier of streptococcus pyogenes (or, 2.1; 95% ci, 1.7-2.5; p=.042) were risk factors for alopecia areata. klebsiella pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli were isolated from cultures. conclusions: this is the first study to show an association between alopecia areata and throat carriage of bacterial pathogens or history of immunization, as  risk factors for development of the disease. given the characteristics of our study population, the association appears valid for patients with less than 25% hair loss and a course of disease under 1 year.

TI  == autoimmune diseases: solution of the environmental, immunological and genetic components with principles for immunotherapy and transplantation.
AB  == autoimmune diseases have environmental and genetic components. these are the microbial trigger, the immunity system component and the genetic component. here  we describe these components and how they interact. known microbial triggers are  streptococcus pyogenes for rheumatic carditis, proteus mirabilis for rheumatoid arthritis and klebsiella pneumoniae for ankylosing spondylitis. the immunity system component has been clarified by realisation that no autoimmune disease is  caused by loss of suppressor t cells. this leaves burnet's forbidden clones, clearly seen in graves' disease, as the immunological defect. with wide scope for clonal diversification by somatic gene mutations, to prevent frequent autoimmunity the immunity system is policed by the histocompatibility system. this dictates the immune response repertoire by deleting complementary clones (h  gene theory). we show molecular evidence of how specific histocompatibility antigens can predispose to an autoimmune disease by influencing choice of the microbial antigen to which the immunity system reacts. because of the unlucky random element in the somatic mutations involved in their development, forbidden  clones are unlikely to reappear in new immune repertoires developing after immune ablation and autologous bone marrow cell reconstitution, as observed clinically.  isolation of autoantigens and their attachment to cytotoxic moieties could provide specific immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases. kaplans's discovery that  xenografts can be accepted without rejection after immune ablation followed by autologous and xenogeneic bone marrow inoculation, could enable widespread use of pig grafts for humans.

TI  == microbial aetiologic agents associated with pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts.
AB  == pulmonary infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed patients. the aim of this study was to determine the etiologic agents and predisposing factors associated with pneumonia infections in immunocompromised patients. cross-sectional survey of 100 immunocompromised patients due to hiv and mycobacterium tuberculosis infections were enlisted for the study. the patients completed a structured questionnaire to abstract information on demographic features and risk factors. sputum samples were collected from the patients with clinical suspicion of having pneumonia and the sputa examined by cultural methods. the tuberculosis patients had the highest number of isolates, 119 (70%) while those with co-infections of hiv/aids and tuberculosis had 41(24.1%) and those with only hiv infection were 10 (5.9%). the  distribution of isolates were as follows, staphylococcus aureus 63 (37.9%), streptococcus pyogenes 44 (25.9%), streptococcus pneumoniae 27 (15.9%), candida albicans 24 (14.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae 7 (4.1%), proteus mirabilis 4 (2.4%) and escherichia coli 1 (0.5%). those with previous history of alcoholism and tobacco smoking had relatively high isolates. this study demonstrated that secondary infections are prevalent in the immunocompromised patients due to hiv/aids and tb or co-infection with tb/hiv-aids. this may lead to drug resistance, dots or haart programme, thereby leading to high mortality and morbidity.

TI  == a fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  == it is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. these structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the  bacteria from the mature biofilm. in the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have  identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. when added exogenously to p. aeruginosa pao1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nm, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies.  this molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast candida albicans. active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.

AB  == in this study we evaluated the in vitro activities of cefditoren--a broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin--and other comparator agents against 2,396 fresh isolates from community-acquired respiratory tract infections, collected from 6 clinical italian microbiology laboratories. on penicillin-susceptible pneumococci and streptococcus pyogenes, cefditoren demonstrated to be the most active antibiotic (mic(90)values of 0.03 and 0.06 mg/l respectively), showing only a slight decrease in potency on penicillin-intermediate and resistant pneumococci (mic(90)value 0.5 mg/l, 1.0 mg/l respectively). all the other comparators displayed mic(90 )values of 4 - 8 mg/l for penicillins and of 4 to >64 mg/l for the oral cephalosporins. cefditoren and levofloxacin were the most active against mssa (mic(90)0.5 mg/ml). cefditoren displayed a uniformly potent inhibitory activity (mic(90)of 0.03 mg/l) against all strains of haemophilus influenzae, regardless of their ampicillin resistance (mediated or not by beta-lactamase production), while against moraxella catarrhalis mic(90)values were higher against beta-lactamase-positive (0.25 mg/l). cefditoren was active also against klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli : in this case its activity was comparable with that of levofloxacin. in conclusion, cefditoren, due to its potent activity, is a new effective therapeutic option for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == [nationwide susceptibility surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antimicrobials against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--third ciproxan injection special survey (2005)].
AB  == we conducted 3 nationwide surveillance studies between 2001 and 2005 at 39 participating institutions throughout japan according to the special survey plan  to investigate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and various parenteral antimicrobials using clinical isolates from patients with severe infection during the reexamination period of parenteral cpfx. results of the first special survey  (2001) were already reported in this journal. the current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout japan to determine susceptibility to cpfx and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between january and june 2005. the results of cpfx in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. the minimum inhibitory concentration of cpfx at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (mic90) ranged from < or =0.063 to 2 microg/ml for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella spp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., serratia marcescens, and acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. however, the cpfx-susceptibility rate of escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. for morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic90 of cpfx tended to increase with time. the cpfx-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for p. aeruginosa and 67.9% for stenotrophomonas maltophilia. with the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of  respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for cpfx, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. these susceptibility rates for cpfx were similar to the rates for cefozopran and  imipenem. these values generally indicated favorable cpfx susceptibility testing  results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of cpfx particularly against gram-negative bacteria. further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of e. coli, m. morganii, and p. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time.

TI  == a study on nosocomial pathogens in icu with special reference to multiresistant acinetobacter baumannii harbouring multiple plasmids.
AB  == background & objectives: antibiotic resistant bacterial nosocomial infections are a leading problem in intensive care units (icu). present investigation was undertaken to know antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter baumannii and some other pathogens obtained from clinical samples from icu causing nosocomial infections. special emphasis was given on plasmid mediated transferable antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter. methods: the clinical specimens obtained  from icu, were investigated to study distribution of nosocomial pathogens (272) and their antibiotic resistance profile. acinetobacter isolates were identified by api2one system. antimicrobial resistance was studied with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) by double dilution agar plate method. the plasmid profile of  26 antibiotic resistant isolates of acinetobacter was studied. curing of r-plasmids was determined in three antibiotic resistant plasmid containing a. baumannii isolates. plasmid transfer was studied by transformation. results: major infections found in icu were due to acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. the infection rate was maximum in urinary tract (44.4%) followed by wound infections (29.4%), pneumonia (10.7%) and bronchitis (7.4%). acinetobacter isolates displayed high level of antibiotic resistance (up to 1024microg/ml) to most of antibiotics. more than 90 per cent isolates of acinetobacter were resistant to a minimum of 23 antibiotics. plasmid profile of acinetobacter isolates showed presence of 1-4 plasmids. ethidium bromide cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281, pupi282 with curing efficiencies 20, 16 and 11 per cent respectively while acridine orange cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281 with curing efficiencies 7 and 18 per cent retrospectively. transformation frequency of e. coli hb101 with pupi281 was 4.3 x 10(4) transformants/microg plasmid dna. interpretation & conclusions: a. baumannii was found to be associated with urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, septicaemia, bacteraemia, meningitis and wound infections. a. baumannii displayed higher resistance to more number of antibiotics than other nosocomial pathogens from icu. antibiotic sensitivity of a. baumannii cured isolates confirmed plasmid borne nature of antibiotic resistance markers. transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids from acinetobacter to other nosocomial pathogens can create complications in the treatment of the patient. therefore, it is very important to target acinetobacter which is associated with nosocomial infections.

TI  == inherent antibacterial activity of a peptide-based beta-hairpin hydrogel.
AB  == among several important considerations for implantation of a biomaterial, a main  concern is the introduction of infection. we have designed a hydrogel scaffold from the self-assembling peptide, max1, for tissue regeneration applications whose surface exhibits inherent antibacterial activity. in experiments where max1 gels are challenged with bacterial solutions ranging in concentrations from 2 x 10(3) colony forming units (cfus)/dm2 to 2 x 10(9) cfus/dm2, gel surfaces exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. results show that the hydrogel surface is  active against gram-positive (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli) bacteria, all prevalent in hospital settings. live-dead assays  employing laser scanning confocal microscopy show that bacteria are killed when they engage the surface. in addition, the surface of max1 hydrogels was shown to  cause inner and outer membrane disruption in experiments that monitor the release of beta-galactosidase from the cytoplasm of lactose permease-deficient e. coli ml-35. these data suggest a mechanism of antibacterial action that involves membrane disruption that leads to cell death upon cellular contact with the gel surface. although the hydrogel surface exhibits bactericidal activity, co-culture experiments indicate hydrogel surfaces show selective toxicity to bacterial versus mammalian cells. additionally, gel surfaces are nonhemolytic toward human  erythrocytes, which maintain healthy morphologies when in contact with the surface. these material attributes make max1 gels attractive candidates for use in tissue regeneration, even in nonsterile environments.

TI  == bacteriologic comparison of tonsil core in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy.
AB  == objectives: although many bacteriology studies on tonsillar diseases have been completed, all have been confined to children and were characterized by a paucity of cases. the purpose of this study was to analyze the underlying bacterial pathogens in tonsillar disease. methods: a retrospective study was performed on 824 patients who underwent elective tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy.  we analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy with regard to age, season, and antibiotic  sensitivity. results: among 824 cases, 966 bacterial strains from the tonsil core were isolated. in recurrent tonsillitis, staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen (30.3%), followed by haemophilus influenzae (15.5%) and group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (streptococcus pyogenes, 14.4%). in patients over 14 years of age, quite differently from other age groups, klebsiella pneumoniae was  isolated at a significantly higher percentage. in tonsillar hypertrophy, h. influenzae was isolated most commonly (31.4%) regardless of age, followed by s. pyogenes (24.2%), s. aureus (22.9%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (12.6%). furthermore, mixed infection was common because of its high resistance to penicillin. in both groups, s. pneumoniae was more common in younger patients, whereas k. pneumoniae was relatively common in adults. we found no differences in the detection rate by season; however, h. influenzae was frequently isolated in the tonsillar hypertrophy group regardless of seasonal variations. we also found  no difference in the antibiotic sensitivity between the two groups; however, strains resistant to penicillin were relatively prevalent and showed a high sensitivity to third-generation cephalosporin. conclusions: we observed some differences in the types of bacteria in the tonsillar core between the recurrent  tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy groups. our study indicates that essential  bacteria have been changing and, thus, we need to change our choice of antibiotics.

TI  == crystal structure of cefditoren complexed with streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin-binding protein 2x: structural basis for its high antimicrobial activity.
AB  == cefditoren is the active form of cefditoren pivoxil, an oral cephalosporin antibiotic used for the treatment of respiratory tract infections and otitis media caused by bacteria such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus. beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefditoren, target penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), which are membrane-associated enzymes that play essential roles in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic process. to envision the binding of cefditoren to pbps, we determined the crystal structure of a trypsin-digested form of pbp 2x from s. pneumoniae strain r6 complexed with cefditoren. there are two pbp 2x molecules (designated molecules 1 and 2) per asymmetric unit. the structure reveals that the orientation of trp374 in each molecule changes in a different way upon the formation of the complex, but each forms a hydrophobic pocket. the methylthiazole group of the c-3 side chain of cefditoren fits into this binding pocket, which consists of residues his394, trp374, and thr526 in molecule 1 and residues his394, asp375, and thr526 in molecule 2. the formation of the complex is also accompanied by an induced-fit conformational change of the enzyme in the  pocket to which the c-7 side chain of cefditoren binds. these features likely play a role in the high level of activity of cefditoren against s. pneumoniae.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == changes in pharyngeal aerobic microflora in oral breathers after palatal rapid expansion.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to investigate in oral breathing children the qualitative and quantitative effects on aerobic and facultatively anaerobic oropharyngeal microflora of respiratory function improved by rapid palatal expansion (rpe). methods: in an open clinical trial, we studied 50 oral breathers, aged 8 to 14 years and suffering from both maxillary constriction and  posterior cross-bite. at baseline, patients were examined by a single otorhinolaryngologist (ent), confirming nasal obstruction in all subjects by posterior rhino-manometric test. patients were evaluated three times by oropharyngeal swabs:1) at baseline (t = 0); 2) after palatal spreading out (t = 1); and 3) at the end of rpe treatment (t = 2). with regard to the microbiological aspect, the most common and potentially pathogenic oral microrganisms (i.e. streptococcus pyogenes, diplococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus spp, branhamella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans) were specifically detected in proper culture plates, isolated colonies were identified by means of biochemical tests and counted by calibrated loop. the data were analyzed by means of the following tests: chi-square test, fisher's exact test and wilcoxon's test. results: after the use of rme there was a statistically significant decrease of staphylococcus aureus stock at cfu/mlat t1(p = 0.0005; z = -3,455 by wilcoxon rank test) and t2  (p < 0.0001; z = -4,512 by wilcoxon rank test) vs t0. no significant changes were found for the other examined microrganisms. conclusion: our data suggest that rpe therapy in oral breathers may strongly reduce the pathogenic aerobic and facultatively anaerobic microflora in the oral pharynx after a normalization of the upper airways function, and may reduce the risk of respiratory infections.

TI  == bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  == bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in western countries. reports indicate that appropriate administration  of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio vulnificus, and salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. the phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of helicobacter pylori and p. aeruginosa, respectively. in addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such  as streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and group b streptococci. all phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against isolates from patients enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials of treatment for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 4913 baseline pathogens isolated from 1986 patients enrolled in 4 pivotal phase 3 clinical trials. the trials, which were conducted in 38 countries worldwide, involved patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections. tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens for each infection type, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (mics, < or =2 microg/ml for most  pathogens). the spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant s. aureus), streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides  fragilis. a few genera, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the tribe proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline than were other gram-negative pathogens. the susceptibility of the pathogens to tigecycline was similar for isolates obtained from patients enrolled in the studies of complicated skin and skin-structure infection or of complicated intra-abdominal infection. for most pathogens, the susceptibility to tigecycline was similar across all geographic regions. the excellent expanded broad-spectrum activity of  tigecycline demonstrated in vitro against clinical isolates confirmed its potential utility for pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bulgaria--a synopsis from bulstar 2003.
AB  == we introduce bulgarian surveillance tracking antimicrobial resistance (bulstar) and make the first report on surveillance data for 2003. this longitudinal surveillance programme monitors the isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility of all clinically significant microorganisms isolated from blood cultures, cerebrospinal fluid, upper and lower respiratory tract, urine and wound samples in the participating microbiology laboratories. twenty eight public, 45 hospital  and 6 private laboratories from all 28 counties of the republic of bulgaria participated in bulstar 2003. the total number of isolates from monitored sources during the surveillance period was 98 929. seven microorganisms represented 72% of all isolated bacteria in bulstar 2003: escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, proteus-providencia-morganella group, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas spp, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. generally the resistance of  clinically significant gram positive and gram negative bacteria in bulgaria was estimated to be at a medium level when compared with many other surveillance sources worldwide. a unique 32-year experiment on the population by treating all  severe infections with an ampicillin/gentamicin combination resulted in twofold higher levels of resistance to amynoglycosides compared with other countries worldwide. this is due to the extremely conservative treatment schemes used in the former socialist countries, based on national directives and cheap domestic production of gentamicin and ampicillin. the forthcoming introduction of a computer network and improvements in detecting mistakes are expected to increase  the sensitivity and the significance of bulstar surveillance system - an indispensable tool in the combat against increasing worldwide antibiotic resistance.

AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == concentrations of moxifloxacin in serum and synovial fluid, and ex vivo bactericidal activity against arthritis-causing pathogens.
AB  == three doses of moxifloxacin 400 mg qd were administered orally to 20 candidates for knee arthroscopy (mean age, 71.2 years). the procedure was scheduled at four  different points of time after the last dose: 2, 6, 12, and 24 h. five patients were studied at each point of time. drug levels were determined by the bioassay method. bactericidal activity against four bacterial pathogens (two strains of each) was studied on serum and synovial fluid samples obtained during arthroscopy using the nccls guidelines. mean (+/-s.d.) peak serum and synovial fluid concentrations were 3.46 +/- 0.78 mg/l and 3.42 +/- 0.51 mg/l, respectively. levels above 1.0 mg/l were detected as long as 24 h. the peak bactericidal titers were (in serum and synovial fluid, respectively) 1:18.3 and 1:32 against staphylococcus aureus, 1:18.3 and 1:22.6 against streptococcus pyogenes, 1:45.2 and 1:64.0 against klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1:2.3 and 1:1.7 against pseudomonas aeruginosa. bactericidal titers >1:2 were documented against the first three pathogens up to 24 h after dosing. on the basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, moxifloxacin seems to be an excellent candidate  for the treatment of joint infections, except those caused by p. aeruginosa.

TI  == bacteriology of mastoid subperiosteal abscess in children.
AB  == objective: subperiosteal abscess (sa) is the most frequent complication of acute  mastoiditis (am). of pathogens cultured from the external auditory canal or middle ear during myringotomy, 15% may be different from microorganisms isolated  from the sa. we suggest, therefore, that only cultures obtained from the abscess  cavity can truly reflect the bacteriology of this complication of am. the purpose of our study was to analyze the infectious agents which cause sa and mastoid cortex erosion in children. material and methods: the medical records of 35 children who underwent mastoidectomy for sa between may 1984 and april 2002 were  evaluated. results: mastoid cortex erosion was found at surgery in 72.7% of abscesses purulent discharge was obtained from the sa cavity in 28 cases. the commonest pathogens isolated in these cases, as well as in 18 cases of mastoid cortex erosion, were staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, followed by streptococcus pneumoniae. hemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sterile culture was found in 25% of cases. conclusions: mastoid sa is a unilateral disease that can recur. early administration of anti-staphylococcus medications should be considered for patients with sa as a complication of am.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == amoxicillin-sulbactam: a clinical and therapeutic review.
AB  == combinations of beta-lactamase inhibitors with penicillins, especially aminopenicillins, have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against most of the  common pathogens of the respiratory and urinary tracts. this means that they are  an ideal treatment for infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, special cases  of pharyngeal tonsillitis (recurring forms, indirect pathogenic action, or after  the failure of amoxicillin monotherapy), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, cystitis, urethritis, etc. the amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is active against both beta-lactamase producer and nonproducer strains, and is effective against gram-positive cocci (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus of nonhospital origin), gram-negative cocci (neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis and others), gram-negative bacilli  (nonhospital strains of haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae and others) and anaerobes. its antimicrobial activity means that it is indicated in the treatment of respiratory, ear, nose and throat, urinary, dermatological and gynecological infections caused by susceptible germs, as well  as in a variety of surgical situations (both as a treatment and as prophylaxis).  it is absorbed very well orally, and its pharmacokinetic profile is very favorable, with very good tissue penetration. it is reasonably well tolerated: in a variable percentage of cases it may cause modification of intestinal transit and/or fecal consistency, which usually abates spontaneously. the new formulation for administration at intervals of 12 h is easier to use, is better tolerated and favors completion of therapy. in summary, the amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is effective and well tolerated in most infections of nonhospital origin in adults and children.

AB  == as a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; activity against multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter and klebsiella species; low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. its spectrum is very large being very active against gram-negative bacilii: enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia, citrobacter, proteus mirabilis and less active against bacillus fragillis. cefepime is also very active against gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes. some of the methicillin-resistant strains of  staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; enterococcus is resistant. due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases cefepime (maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.

TI  == naturally occurring immune response against bacteria commonly involved in upper respiratory tract infections: analysis of the antigen-specific salivary iga levels.
AB  == lyophilized bacterial lysates, which actively stimulate the immune response, are  widely used as vaccines or 'biological response modifiers' in subjects with recurrent bacterial respiratory infections. since vaccines are indicated in the absence or in the presence of a weak constitutive immune response activity, a better knowledge on the 'naturally' occurring antibacterial immune response at the oropharingeal level should be helpful. a study was, therefore, designed to quantify the presence of salivary iga directed against surface antigens bacteria  frequently involved in the pathogenesis of upper respiratory tract infections: klebsiella pneumoniae (kp), staphylococcus aureus (sa), streptococcus pyogenes (spy), morraxella catarrhalis (mc), haemophylus influenzae (hi), and streptococcus pnumoniae (spn). in 34 volunteers (21 adults and 13 children), salivary fluid was collected and the presence of microorganism-specific iga antibodies evaluated by a novel enzyme immuno-assay. in the whole population only 29 and 24% of subjects had iga directed, respectively, to kp and sa, while the immune-response against other microbes was detectable in a small population ranging from 12 to 15% of all subjects studied. we found higher proportions of individuals with strain specific salivary iga in the adult than in the pediatric  population for all the microorganism evaluated. in addition, in children, the only strain inducing a significant production of specific iga at oropharingeal level was kp. interestingly, only ten out of 21 adults and two out 13 children have at least one significantly high antibody titer against one of the bacteria evaluated. nevertheless, when a group of healthy donors was treated with a polyvalent mechanical bacterial lysate (ismigen t.), the large majority developed a specific immune-response in the salivary fluid. these results are thus consistent with the good features of the novel enzyme-immunoassay and with a poor frequency of naturally induced specific anti-microbe antibodies in children and in adults despite the presence on recurrent respiratory infections in their clinical history.

AB  == pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters are increasingly recognized as important determinants of the therapeutic efficacy of an antibiotic. for beta-lactam antibiotics, the most important determinant of the antimicrobial efficacy, and hence predictor of therapeutic efficacy, is the length of time that serum concentrations exceed the mic. dosing schedules for beta-lactam antibiotics should maintain serum concentrations above the mic for the bacterial pathogen for at least 50% of the dosing interval to achieve therapeutic efficacy and prevent the development of resistance. this is a basic criterion for the clinical efficacy of beta-lactams. a combination of microbiological activity and pharmacokinetic characteristics was applied to calculate the time that serum antibiotic concentrations exceed the mic for the major respiratory tract pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae. in contrast with some other oral beta-lactam antibiotics, cefpodoxime 200 mg bd maintains serum concentrations above the mic for each organism for at least 50% of the dosing interval and may therefore be an attractive choice for empirical therapy of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.

TI  == antibacterial activity of oral antibiotics against community-acquired respiratory pathogens from three european countries.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is universally recognized as a major problem. a european resistance survey was established to monitor the activity of widely used oral antibiotics against common respiratory tract pathogens. studies were conducted in italy, spain and austria to monitor resistance patterns among respiratory streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae to amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, penicillin, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefalexin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefixime, ceftibuten, cefpodoxime, clarithromycin and azithromycin (the antibiotics tested varying slightly from country to country). minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the nccls-recommended broth microdilution method. among the antibiotics tested, cefpodoxime, an oral cephalosporin, was remarkably active against the major respiratory pathogens in all three countries. cefpodoxime was more potent than cefaclor, cefixime and ceftibuten against pneumococci, especially against strains with decreased sensitivity to penicillin, and more active than cefaclor and cefuroxime against gram-negative respiratory pathogens. pneumococci and staphylococci displayed a very high level of in vitro macrolide resistance. these data indicate that cefpodoxime represents an appropriate choice in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infection in the three countries surveyed.

TI  == ceftriaxone activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated in us clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa.
AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

TI  == in vitro action of carboxyfullerene.
AB  == fullerene compounds have avid reactivity with free radicals and are regarded as 'radical sponges'. the trimalonic acid derivative of fullerene is one of the water-soluble compounds that has been synthesized and found to be an effective antioxidant both in vivo and in vitro. carboxyfullerene has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both gram-positive and -negative infections, although its mode of action is poorly understood. we determined the mic and minimal bactericidal concentration of carboxyfullerene for 20 isolates, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae. we further investigated the action of carboxyfullerene using transmission electron microscopy (tem), anticarboxyfullerene antibody binding assay and a membrane perturbation assay. all gram-positive species were inhibited by < or = 50 mg/l of carboxyfullerene, whereas gram-negative species were not inhibited, even at 500 mg/l carboxyfullerene. bactericidal activity was demonstrated only for gram-positive species, particularly for streptococcus pyogenes a-20, which was killed rapidly. intercalation of carboxyfullerene into the cell wall of staphylococci and streptococci was demonstrated by tem and anti-carboxyfullerene  binding assay. damage to the cell membrane in gram-positive, but not gram-negative, bacteria was confirmed by the membrane perturbation assay. these findings indicate that the action of carboxyfullerene on gram-positive bacteria is achieved by insertion into the cell wall and destruction of membrane integrity.

TI  == present situation of antimicrobial resistance in korea.
AB  == resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. in korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, class c beta-lactamase-producing e. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa present new threats in korea.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  == an observational study on the epidemiology of respiratory tract bacterial pathogens and their susceptibility to four injectable beta-lactam antibiotics: piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  == bacterial infections of the respiratory tract account for a large proportion of total medical consultations in general practice. in recent years, antibiotic resistance has increased alarmingly in a number of bacterial species that are common causes of these infections. the aim of this observational study was to determine the antibiotic resistance of microbial agents isolated from patients with acute or acutely exacerbated respiratory infections. subjects recruited as potential sources of bacteria were either outpatients seen in a number of specialized clinics and hospital practices, or hospitalized patients. overall, 648 consecutive patients (67% male, mean age 48.1+/-27.0 years) with infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract were observed during a 13-month period. a total of 551 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated and tested for their in vitro susceptibility to piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. among all isolates, the four most frequent pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa (132 isolates, 24%), streptococcus pyogenes (99 isolates,  18%), staphylococcus aureus (93 isolates, 17%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (46 isolates, 8%). the susceptibility of gram-positive isolates ranged from 97.5% to  95.1%, and no remarkable difference was found in the antibacterial activity of tested b-lactam antibiotics. the susceptibility of gram-negative isolates to piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam was also similar: 96.5% and 97.1%, respectively. in contrast, differences were found between piperacillin (or piperacillin/tazobactam) and either ceftazidime (p=0.003) or ceftriaxone (p<0.0003) in gram-negative isolates. we conclude that, despite the extensive use of beta-lactam antibiotics (piperacillin, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone) in medical practice during the past three decades, the susceptibility of the most common pathogens involved in the etiology of upper and lower respiratory tract infections to these antibiotics is still high. in particular, bacterial resistance developed by gram-positive organisms against piperacillin is negligible and not alarming.

TI  == antibacterial activity of traditional australian medicinal plants.
AB  == fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional australian aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) and four gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. in a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. b. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. extracts from the leaves of eremophila species (myoporaceae) were the most active, with eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against gram-positive bacteria). the antibacterial effects of  e. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for b. cereus, e. faecalis and s. aureus and 2 h for s. pyogenes.

TI  == acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute  otitis media are treated with antibiotics. methods: a multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. setting: nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. results: prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. cultures were negative in 60 patients. the organisms isolated  in the 92 positive cultures were: streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), haemophilus influenzae (four patients), proteus mirabilis (two patients), escherichia coli (two patients), klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient),  enterobacter (one patient), acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative  bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). ten patients had mixed flora. sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). conclusions: antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. the distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.

AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of cefetamet against clinically isolated strains from community acquired respiratory tract infections. part iii].
AB  == antimicrobial activities of cefetamet (cemt) against clinically isolated strains  from patients with community acquired respiratory tract infections were investigated in comparison with those of other oral beta-lactam antibiotics during the period from january to march, 1998. the results are summarized as follows; 1. cemt showed strong antimicrobial activities against three major pathogens causing community acquired respiratory tract infections, streptococcus  pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. however, antimicrobial activities of cemt against penicillins (pcs)-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp) and pcs-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) were slightly weaker than those of some of the reference antibiotics. 2. no chronological changes of cemt-mic level were observed in the antimicrobial activities against s. pyogenes, h. influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis or klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae. in contrast to this, due to the increase of pisp and prsp strains, resistance to cemt appears increasing with time.

AB  == objective: to examine immunological parameters that might explain disease discordance in monozygotic twin pairs with ankylosing spondylitis (as). methods:  11 monozygotic twin pairs (nine with as, two with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy) were investigated. the peripheral t cell receptor vbeta repertoire was investigated using facs analysis and 14 different vbeta antibodies. in addition serum samples were tested for antibodies to klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, candida albicans, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli. peripheral blood lymphocyte reactivity against a number of bacteria was investigated by interferon gamma elispot assays. results: twins suffering from as showed cellular hyporeactivity against k pneumoniae, s pyogenes, c albicans in the elispot assays compared with healthy twins. in contrast with the antibody data, where no significant differences were observed between the two groups, as concordant twins showed the most pronounced differences in their vbeta repertoire on cd4+ and cd8+ lymphocytes. conclusions:  cellular hyporeactivity of peripheral blood cells to bacterial antigens might reflect defective t cell responses allowing bacterial antigens to persist in diseased patients. there are probably other environmental factors that influence  disease concordance.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == activity of cefepime compared with other antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background: cefepime is a new, parenteral, fourth-generation antibiotic that is stable in the presence of bush group 1 beta-lactamases. in vitro activity of cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem against gram-positive cocci and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacilli was studied. methods: the agar dilution method described by the us national committee for clinical laboratory standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics tested. these included cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem. the tested clinical isolates included gram-positive cocci (methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, viridans streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, group d enterococci) and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, burkholderia cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia). results:  the activity of cefepime against most gram-negative bacilli other than b cepacia  and x maltophilia is better than that of ceftazidime. however, cefepime is less active against these gram-negative bacilli than ciprofloxacin and imipenem. the activity of cefepime against b cepacia and x maltophilia is less than that of ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin. among gram-positive cocci, cefepime was active against most isolates of methicillin-sensitive staphylococci, s pyogenes, viridans streptococci and s pneumoniae. however, cefepime has poor activity against methicillin-resistant s aureus and enterococci. conclusions: due to its extended spectrum of activity, cefepime has potential use as suitable empiric monotherapy for the treatment of a variety of community- and hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == discovery of novel pyridinopolyamines with potent antimicrobial activity: deconvolution of mixtures synthesized by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry.
AB  == a 1638-member pyridinopolyamine library, consisting of 13 sublibraries of 126 members prepared by a solution-phase approach, was completely deconvoluted from orthogonally protected intermediates by a combination of iterative and positional scanning procedures. antibacterial assays against streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli imp- and a candida albicans yeast specificity assay were employed to follow the activity of sublibraries. screening of the 13 sublibraries, which were prepared by a synthetic method that places the differentiating functionality in a selected position a (secondary amine), at the  end of the synthesis (fix last), provided several first-round activities. subsequently, six single pyridinopolyamines (2-7) were prepared where the first-round winner, a hydrogen atom, is in the first deconvoluted position and the remaining three positions contained the same functionalities. the range of antibacterial and yeast activities of these single compounds suggested that a more active and selective compound may be discovered by completely deconvoluting  the first-round active sublibraries. pyridinopolyamine positions b (secondary benzylamine) and c (primary benzylamine) were then sequentially positionally scanned with a set of six meta-substituted benzyl functionalities to generate two sets of second/third-round sublibraries, containing 21 or 36 compounds in each sublibrary, respectively. high-throughput screening yielded sublibraries 15, 18,  and 21 with mics of 1-5 microm against s. pyogenes and e. coli imp-. using rounds 1 and 2/3 screening data, two sets of single compounds (22-27) and (28-32) with the combination of m-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl group at position c and m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl or m-methylbenzyl group at position b with position d (primary benzylamine) fixed were synthesized in the fourth round deconvolution. subsequently, broader screening of deconvoluted compounds against a tier ii panel of wild-type bacteria identified eight compounds (5, 7, 27, and 29-32) with approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, s. pyogenes, s. pyogenes (wild-type), streptomyces aureus, and enterococcus faecalis were inhibited at mics of 1-12 microm, whereas mics for e.  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were >  100 microm. these eight compounds were not active (> 100 microm) against fungus c. albicans.

TI  == role of coagulase in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads.
AB  == we describe a novel mouse model of acute staphylococcal pneumonia induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads. for comparison, we also used various strains of bacteria, including three strains of  s. aureus, two strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, one strain of streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one strain of klebsiella pneumoniae. all except two strains of s. aureus were cleared rapidly from the lungs. when s. aureus numr1 enmeshed in agar beads was injected intravenously, the organisms concentrated and remained in the lung for a period longer than several weeks. multiple lung abscesses were evident macroscopically, and histological examination of the infected lung showed multiple lung abscesses around the pulmonary arterioles, consisting of bacterial colonies encircled with  fibrin filaments and surrounded by inflammatory cells of neutrophils and macrophages. when 14 strains of clinically isolated s. aureus were injected intravenously, the number of bacteria recovered from the lung tissue 7 days after infection correlated with the titer of staphylocoagulase (p < 0.01) but not with  the titer of clumping factor. injection of coagulase-deficient mutant strain du5843 was associated with a markedly reduced number of viable bacteria isolated  from the lung, compared with its coagulase-positive parental strain du5789. our results suggest that coagulase may play a role in the development of blood-borne  staphylococcal pneumonia in our model. our animal model is simple and reproducible and resembles blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in humans, and it could be useful for investigating the pathogenicity or treatment of staphylococcal pulmonary infection, including infections with methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

AB  == a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of an immunostimulant, ribomunyl, in the prevention of recurrences of infectious rhinitis in adults. this trial involved 327 patients (168 ribomunyl treated and 159 placebo cases) with an average of 4.3 +/- 1.8 rhinitis episodes per patient recorded during the year preceding the study. the main criterion of efficacy was the cumulative number of recurrences of infectious rhinitis during a 6-month follow-up period, as analyzed by standard tests. an additional analysis of relative risk of recurrences used multivariate failure for time data. ribomunyl was effective throughout the study period, starting from the first month of treatment: a mean of 1.0 +/- 1.1 recurrences was recorded in the ribomunyl group as compared to 1.5 +/- 1.4 recurrences in the placebo group; this indicated one-third fewer infections (p = 0.001). the protective effect of ribomunyl on the relative risk for recurrences was estimated to be 0.58 by multivariate analysis (95% ci: 0.43-0.78, p = 0.0001). analysis of secondary criteria also favored ribomunyl: 38.5% less antibiotic courses per patient (0.8 +/- 1.3 vs 1.3 +/- 1.6; p = 0.002) and the number of days with antibiotics (5.6 +/- 9.3 vs 9.1 +/- 12.1; p = 0.002).

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in  our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december  of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the  range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp.  and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus  spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == a multinational european survey on the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin and other  comparative antibiotics on respiratory and urinary bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of rufloxacin was confirmed against a large number of  respiratory and urinary tract pathogens collected in five european countries. in  terms of both mic90 values and percentages of susceptible isolates found, this new quinolone showed useful in-vitro activity against mycoplasma catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, with a large proportion of staphylococcus aureus also covered, while, as expected streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were not included in its antibacterial spectrum. rufloxacin was comparable with the other antibiotics against these pathogens with the exception of streptococci. against these microorganisms, beta-lactams were the most active agents. against the urinary pathogens the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin is similar to that of norfloxacin although this latter drug is more active in terms of mic90 values and in percentages of strains inhibited. in many  cases more isolates were susceptible to the remaining comparator agents than to rufloxacin. however, there were no significant differences between the numbers of microorganisms inhibited by the various drugs and rufloxacin. the findings of this survey do not seem to modify the general picture which emerged in previous studies and further confirms its useful spectrum in different geographic settings.

TI  == brodimoprim: effects of subminimal inhibitory concentrations on virulence traits  of respiratory and urinary tract pathogens, and on plasmid transfer and stability.
AB  == the effects of brodimoprim, a new trimethoprim analogue, on several virulence traits of respiratory and urinary tract pathogens exposed to sub-lethal levels of the drug was studied. adherence to tracheal epithelial cells was inhibited by brodimoprim in klebsiella pneumoniae (41-67% reduction), moraxella catarrhalis (87-90%) and haemophilus influenzae (0-53%), while in streptococcus pneumoniae binding was unaffected. with buccal epithelial cells the comparison between treated and control bacteria indicated statistically significant reduction in adherence with both s.pneumoniae and h.influenzae, (p < 0.015). with m.catarrhalis and streptococcus pyogenes only marginal changes were detected (p > 0.05). exoenzyme and capsule production were assessed in at least three isolates  of diverse respiratory pathogens grown in the presence of sub-lethal levels of the new agent. the drug affected protease and beta-hemolysin (alpha-toxin) production in both oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant s.aureus. on the contrary, synthesis of lipase, dnase, coagulase, and beta-lactamase (s.aureus), pneumolysin (s.pneumoniae), streptolysin s, dnase, and protease (s.pyogenes), capsule (k.pneumoniae, h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae), and beta-lactamase (k.pneumoniae, h.influenzae and m.catarrhalis) were not inhibited by subminimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-mics) of the drug. finally, motility was blocked in urinary pathogens e.coli, p.mirabilis and p.aeruginosa, while in this latter microorganism pigment production was also affected. high molecular weight low-copy f'lac, and low molecular weight high-copy phsg298 plasmids were eliminated from e.coli treated with sub-mic concentrations of brodimoprim. the incidence and cured cells ranged from 9% for f'lac to 23% for phsg298. f'lac transfer was also inhibited by the drug. when conjugation was carried out with bacteria exposed to brodimoprim (5xmic), a reduction (50%) in the number of recombinants was noted in comparison to the control. the fact that brodimoprim interferes with the expression of some virulence traits, in particular with adherence, at sub-mic levels may assist the drug in eradicating respiratory pathogens from the epithelial lining, thus diminishing the probability of reinfection.

AB  == eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml,  enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, escherichia coli cs2(r+): 0.10 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, serratia marcescens:  1.56 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam  against gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria except p. aeruginosa. sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of pbps of s. aureus, e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. marcescens, even of p. aeruginosa. affinities of sulopenem to pbps-1 and -3 of s. aureus, pbp-2 of e. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (ipm). sulopenem generally has small ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to ia and iib types of beta-lactamases than ipm. no synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. however, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. the cells of e. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 mic of sulopenem. moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-is. sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (up-pcr) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. a  universal protocol of preparation of pcr samples from cultures representing escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. the bands of up-pcr  products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. the applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the dna bands obtained for different strains. three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis and m. bovis produced very similar dna banding patterns. they comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. the dna profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each  other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. the method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.

TI  == [stimulation of synthesis of secretory immunoglobulin a in the lung by oral immunization: an approach with therapeutic relevance?].
AB  == due to its strategic position on mucosal surfaces secretory immunoglobulin a (siga) is one of the first protective factors of the specific immune system against invading pathogens. as a factor of acquired immunity, the synthesis of siga can be modulated by various immunization strategies. our experiments aimed at the enhancement of the siga pool in the lungs by oral immunization. as reported previously, commercially available lw 50020, an immunomodulator consisting of lysates of seven common pneumotropic pathogens, is effective in inducing significant iga antibody responses in the lungs following oral immunization [1]. in the present study we developed new strategies to enhance this effect by encapsulating lw 50020 into microspheres and liposomes. microspheres and liposomes with entrapped immunomodulator each enhanced the effect of soluble lw 50020 by about 45% and 90%, respectively. in addition, microsphere based immunization induced a significantly increased immunoglobulin g (igg) response in the lungs. in further experiments we demonstrated that a similar effect could be achieved by administration of a high molecular weight conjugate of lipopolysaccharide from klebsiella pneumoniae (lps) and lipoteichoic acid from streptococcus pyogenes (lta). this conjugate enhanced the synthesis of  iga in the lungs by 45% and, furthermore, induced a significantly enhanced igg response in the lungs, without any obvious toxic or pyrogenic side effects. this  new conjugate possibly offers an opportunity to replace the complex immunomodulator lw 50020 by a less complex vaccine.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight european countries.
AB  == in this multicenter study conducted in eight european countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, five in germany, in the netherlands and switzerland, four in greece and spain, three in hungary and one in finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (sceptor system, bbl, heidelberg, germany) were used throughout all assays. the most frequently encountered species were: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus agalactiae, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus  vulgaris, moraxella catarrhalis and shigella spp. the percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and european-wide with all the data available. for many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. however, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-g-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates in hungary and spain; some of the low-level penicillin-g-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. the high frequency of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae isolates in spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. the penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.

(b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

AB  == in 5 mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime,  cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, 4 centers in greece, 3 centers in spain, and 1 center in lebanon and saudi arabia contributed  to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (sceptor, bbl, heidelberg, frg). the most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (n = 1267), proteus mirabilis (n = 843), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric salmonella spp. (n = 629), enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), citrobacter freundii (n = 383), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 246), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and shigella spp. (n = 185). statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. the penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the  gram-positive cocci, exceeding the mic90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. regarding the gram-negatives (above all klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (mic90 = 1 mg/l). regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. there was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates (mic90 = 2 mg/l). by far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies of sy5555 in pediatrics].
AB  == we assessed the in vitro antimicrobial activity and the clinical efficacy and safety of sy5555 in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained are summarized  below. 1. in vitro antibacterial activities of sy5555 against 52 clinical isolates were compared with those of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (cva/ampc), cefotiam (ctm), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefaclor (ccl) and cefdinir (cfdn). against gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, sy5555 displayed antimicrobial activities superior or nearly equivalent to those of the reference agents used in the study. in cases of gram-negative bacteria, the antimicrobial activity of sy5555 against haemophilus  influenzae was inferior to those of cpdx and cfdn. against klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of sy5555 was less potent than that of cpdx. 2. forty-seven children with infectious diseases were treated with sy5555 dry syrup  (powder dissolved just before use). the clinical results were excellent in 24 and good in 16, with an efficacy rate of 85.1%. 3. bacteriological screening identified 30 pathogenic organisms, and the eradication rate was 76.7%. 4. side effects consisted of diarrhea in 12.5% (6 cases), loose stools in 4.2% (2 cases)  and urticaria in 2.1% (1 case) of the patients. the only abnormal laboratory test value observed was an increase in eosinophil count in one child. 5. the palatability of sy5555 dry syrup was very good; it was very easily ingestable or  easily ingestable by 32 of the 48 children. from the above results, sy5555 dry syrup appears to be a useful drug with a preferable safety profile in the treatment of pediatric patients with infectious diseases.

TI  == development of a polymerase chain reaction assay to detect the presence of streptococcus pneumoniae dna.
AB  == in this study, we have developed a chemically sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay to detect the presence of streptococcus pneumoniae genomic dna. the target dna sequence was a 322-base pair segment of the s. pneumoniae dna polymerase i gene (pol i). pcr products of pure cultures of a set  of pneumococcal serotypes commonly associated with human infection could be amplified in water and in blood cultures of clinical isolates containing s. pneumoniae. we were able to detect 2 fg of purified s. pneumoniae dna. there were no false-positive reactions when the assay was performed on samples containing the following clinically encountered bacteria: haemophilus influenzae type b, neisseria meningitidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas spp. nontypeable h. influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and streptococcus pyogenes. the addition of edta and citrate-anticoagulated whole blood to the pcr reaction mixture inhibited the pcr  assay, whereas the addition of lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and sodium polyanetholesulfonate-anticoagulated whole blood to pcr reaction mixture did not  interfere with the ability to detect the presence of s. pneumoniae dna.

TI  == acute mastoiditis--revisited.
AB  == the clinical course and causative organisms were studied in 18 patients with acute mastoiditis, 13 of whom (72%) had no previous history of middle ear disease. their age ranged from 5 months to 21 years, and duration of middle ear symptoms immediately prior to admission ranged from 1 to 45 days (average 9.7 days). none had undergone a myringotomy prior to admission, while 13 (72%) had been receiving antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media. three were admitted with intracranial complications. bacteria were isolated in 10 of the 16 patients  in whom samples were available for bacterial culture, and included streptococcus  pneumonia (2), streptococcus pyogenes (2), staphylococcus aureus (2), staphlococcus coagulase negative (2), klebsiella pneumonia (1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). of the 17 patients treated by us, 11 received surgery. acute otitis media, secretory otitis media, acute mastoiditis, subacute mastoiditis and masked mastoiditis create a continuum. antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media cannot be considered as an absolute safeguard against acute mastoiditis. when antibiotics are prescribed for acute mastoiditis before culture result is available, an anti-staphylococcal agent should be included. at least some patients with acute mastoiditis develop a primary infection of the bony framework of the middle ear cleft. the prevalence of the intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis is still high and may appear soon after or concomitant with the first sign of acute mastioditis.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. the study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). in addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent  of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. the organisms tested  were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups c and g, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis. minimal inhibitory concentrations of  the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. cefpodoxime  showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral  beta-lactam antibiotics examined. the drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.

TI  == compartmentalization of specific b-cells in sheep mucosae associated lymphoid organs.
AB  == numerous studies have shown that peyer's patches (pp) contribute to the seeding of other lymphoid organs in sheep. this was demonstrated by perfusing labeled lymphocytes in pp, and later investigating their presence in drainage lymph nodes, spleen, peripheral blood or bone marrow. these data showed that pp export  considerable numbers of cells every day, but provided no information as to their  specificity. in this work, we used the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)  spot method to investigate, in the peripheral blood, mesenteric and cervical lymph nodes and tonsils from ten sheep, the numbers of specific b-cells, directed to four common bacteria of the oro-pharyngeal area of mammals: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae or klebsiella pneumoniae. the data were obtained from five sets of monozygous sheep, one animal of each pair being previously fed ribosomal preparations of these bacteria. both  prior to and after oral challenge, specific b-cells could be found in all the tissues tested. they were mostly igg-producing cells and preferentially located in oro-pharyngeal drainage lymph nodes and tonsils. their numbers increased in these lymph nodes after stimulation, while they decreased in mesenteric lymph nodes. these observations are consistent with the current hypothesis suggesting intestinal sensitization, proliferation and fast emigration of specific b-cells after oral challenge.

TI  == cefuroxime axetil.
AB  == cefuroxime is the first commercially-available second-generation cephalosporine to be widely used in therapy; it is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin obtained from  the 7-cephalosporanic acid nucleus of cephalosporin c. cefuroxime axetil is the acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime. the majority of micro-organisms associated with respiratory infections are highly sensitive to cefuroxime. these include haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and the  other streptococci (excluding group d streptococci), and moraxella catarrhalis. bacteria sensitive to cefuroxime include the enterobacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella and shigella and straphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive strains). the pharmacokinetic studies show that the maximum plasma concentration of cefuroxime after oral administration of 250 mg and 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil after a meal are respectively 4.6 and 7.9 mg/l. the absolute bioavailability of tablets is 68% (extremes 63-73%) after oral administration of 500 mg cefuroxime axetil. the protein binding is 33+/-5.7%. tissue diffusion was studied in the interstitial fluid, the bronchial mucosa, the tonsils, and the bronchial secretions. cefuroxime axetil is available as capsule-shaped tablets containing 125, 250 or 500 mg. an oral suspension dosage form for paediatric purposes is also available  as granules in multidose bottles and sachets. constitution gives a suspension containing 125 mg or 250 mg cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil). cefuroxime axetil  is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. indications include: lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute and chronic  bronchitis and pneumonia); upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., ear, nose and throat infections such as otitis media, sinusitis tonsillitis and pharyngitis); genito-urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis, cystitis and urethritis, gonorrhoea, acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis); and skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., furunculosis, pyoderma and impetigo). for most infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily is appropriate.  in some urinary tract infections, 125 mg twice daily has been shown to be effective. if pneumonia is suspected or in more severe lower respiratory tract infection, doses of 500 mg bd should be used. uncomplicated gonorrhoea has been shown to respond to a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil. adverse reactions to  cefuroxime have generally been mild and transient in nature (gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent  clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90 0.015-2 mg/l). cefixime was the most active agent against hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris (mic90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). the activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against s. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (mic90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to  cefixime against s. pyogenes (mic90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, klebsiella spp. and proteus spp. (mic90 <  0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). the activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against enterococcus faecalis (mic90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). none of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 >  64 mg/l). overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. at 24 h at 1 x mic, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x mic, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.

TI  == in-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  == in-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. mics for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, several enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas hydrophila and campylobacter jejuni were determined. mic values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae. for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, p. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-mic concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of  cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. evaluation of bactericidal  activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large  bacterial populations of s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. the bactericidal activity was apparently lower against m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, s. aureus, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae.

TI  == immune response in the lungs following oral immunization with bacterial lysates of respiratory pathogens.
AB  == we have investigated the local immune response of the balb/c mouse respiratory tract after oral immunization with a bacterial lysate of seven common respiratory pathogens. after two immunization on five consecutive days, we examined the immunoglobulin (immunoglobulin g [igg], igm, and iga) secretion rates of cells isolated from the lungs and compared them with those of spleen cells of orally immunized and nonimmunized animals by using a new test system based on time-resolved fluorescence. the procedure followed the principle of the classical elispot test with nitrocellulose-bottomed microtiter plates, but europium (eu3+)-linked streptavidin rather than enzyme-conjugated streptavidin was used, with the advantage of quantifying secreted immunoglobulins instead of detecting single antibody-secreting cells. lymphocytes isolated from the lungs of treated animals revealed significant increases in total and antigen-specific iga synthesis compared with the rates of the controls, whereas igg and igm production rates showed no remarkable differences. in addition, the sera of treated mice revealed higher antigen-specific iga titers but not increased igm and igg levels. we conclude that priming the gut-associated lymphoid tissue with bacterial antigens of pneumotropic microorganisms can elicit an enhanced iga response in a  distant mucosal effector site, such as the respiratory tract, according to the concept of a common mucosa-associated immune system.

TI  == antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  == cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of escherichia coli (98 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (98 strains), haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), enterococcus spp. (45 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (group a; 19 strains) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b; 36 strains). cefepime showed excellent activity against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. the in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation  cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. against h. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. all 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. this in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the  potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.

TI  == rabbit cap18 derived peptides inhibit gram negative and gram positive bacteria.
AB  == cap18 (cationic antimicrobial protein of 18 kda) was originally isolated from rabbit granulocytes using as an assay the agglutination of re-lipopolysaccharide  coated erythrocytes. the c-terminal 37 amino acids of cap18 comprise the lps-binding domain called rnip, reactive nitrogen inhibitory peptide. synthetic rnip has broad antimicrobial activity versus both gram positive [ic50 = 130-200 nm] and gram negative bacteria [ic50 = 20-100 nm). susceptible strains include staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes. antimicrobial activity is highly dependent upon peptide structure. although a 32  amino peptide resulting from truncation of five amino acids from the c terminus of rnip is highly active, other fragments of rnip including truncation of its n-terminus do not exhibit antimicrobial activity. unlike previously characterized antimicrobial peptides derived from granulocyte proteins rnip is active in serum. rnip or a derivative peptide may have therapeutic potential for bacterial sepsis.

TI  == induction of the release of prostaglandin e2 from polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes by bacteroides fragilis: its possible role in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.
AB  == the presence of anaerobic bacteria, especially of bacteroides (b.) fragilis, in abdominal abscesses, infected decubitus ulcera, and the infected foot of diabetic patients is well documented. the importance, however, of these microorganisms in  the pathogenesis of deep tissue infections has still to be evaluated. therefore,  the aim of this study was to evaluate the potency of b. fragilis as compared to aerobic bacteria widely known for causing inflammation, in inducing the release of prostaglandin e2 from polymorphonuclear granulocytes. prostaglandin e2 is a potent vasodilator and contributes to edema and erythema, which are part of the inflammatory response. furthermore, the camp-content of the neutrophils was determined after stimulation of the cells with the various bacteria. of the bacterial species tested, b. fragilis proved to be one of the most potent triggers for prostaglandin e2 release from neutrophils indicating a possible major role of this microorganism in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.

AB  == a bacterial lysate (om-85 bv), a preparation of purified bacterial ribosomes (d53) and a placebo were tested for ability to induce the local appearance of specific antibody-containing cells. the three compounds were given orally to 90 children who required tonsillectomy. surgery was carried out after 1 month of therapy. frozen-cut sections of each tonsil were tested in indirect immunofluorescence. cells containing antibodies directed to streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae or klebsiella pneumoniae were enumerated. lowest values were noted in the placebo group. slightly higher numbers were observed after treatment with om-85 bv, but significant increases were noted only for the elevated numbers of specific antibody-containing cells observed after d53 therapy. bacterial ribosomal preparations thus contribute efficient induction of specific local immune responses in man.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == in order evaluate antimicrobial activities of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of cdzm and other control drugs were determined against various clinical isolates, that were sent to our center from nation-wide  medical institutions or were isolated and identified in our laboratory from various specimens of infected patients. the followings are a summary of the results: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cephems including cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter diversus, most of klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. some strains of klebsiella oxytoca were resistant to cephems increases in beta-lactams resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and cephem resistant escherichia coli seemed likely. among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. belonging to a category of so-called "mildly toxic bacteria", high portions of the strains examined were resistant to cephems including cdzm and these strains were also resistant to new quinolones, thus they showed multiple drug resistance. 2. mic90's of cdzm against streptococcus spp., h. infleunzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp. and p. mirabilis, frequently found in daily treatment of infections, were less than < or = 0.025 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. this indicates that cdzm would be expected to have enough antibiotic activity in infections caused by above mentioned bacteria. however, cautions are needed in the treatment of infections by beta-lactam resistant s. pneumoniae, cephem resistant e. coli and cephem resistant k. oxytoca with cdzm. 3. among the above mentioned "mildly toxic bacteria", many multiple drug resistant strains exist. therefore, we evaluated an usefulness of concomitant use of cdzm with aminoglycosides in the treatment of infections by these bacteria, using other reports which indicates the usefulness in vitro and in vivo. 4. antibacterial activities of cdzm we observed in this study seem to indicate that  cdzm concentrations in infected areas are maintained at above mic levels for relatively long periods of time.

AB  == a prospective study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ampicillin as an initial therapy in 60 adult patients with community acquired pneumonia. bacteriological etiology was obtained only in 24 (40pc) patients by microscopic examination, culture and antigen detection. streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading causative agent identified in 15 cases. other etiologies were klebsiella  pneumoniae (3), streptococcus pyogenes (2) staphylococcus aureus (2), haemophilus influenzae (1) and moraxella catarrhails (1). patients were started on ampicillin one gram twice daily, empirically, and treated for 10 days. there were 52(86.7pc) patients cured, two(3.3pc) patients improved and six (10pc) were therapeutic failures. the causative agents in patients with failures were: klebsiella pneumoniae (1), staphylococcus aureus (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (1) and unknown in three cases. only six of 60 patients still febrile after three days were switched to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid or cefaclor according to culture results and susceptibilities or to roxythromycin because no organisms were isolated. side effects were observed in only one (1.7pc) patient who developed a  mild skin rash. due to its low cost and its high efficacy, ampicillin still appears to be the drug of choice in adult community acquired pneumonia in our region.

TI  == post-antibiotic effects of ofloxacin on escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae,  staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == a viable counting technique was used to determine the post-antibiotic effect (pae) of ofloxacin against four bacterial species, treated with either once of four times the minimum inhibitory concentration for 1 or 3 h. similar to the results obtained previously with ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin gave pae values with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. cell division of klebsiella pneumoniae was inhibited on removal of ofloxacin, but no clear pae was demonstrated with this species because once replication recommenced, the mean generation times of drug-treated cultures were much shorter than those of untreated controls. therefore, although the results obtained with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin imply a consistency of pae for 4-quinolones within a  species, the response to dna damage induced by 4-quinolones is multifaceted and species dependent. 4-quinolones inhibit both dna replication and cell division, whilst at the same time stimulating dna repair pathways. thus, in some cases paes result from an increased post-treatment lag phase which may be followed by nearly normal multiplication, whereas in other cases a long lag may be followed by abnormally rapid cell division, with the generation times of treated cultures being shorter than those of corresponding drug-free controls. the pae of a drug-induced lag may thus be masked by rapid cell division once growth resumes.

(b) catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae, for a duration of approximately 9 and 11 hours, respectively, after single doses of 250 and 500 mg. this suggests that cfmt could remain above the mics for a sufficient time period with twice daily dosages of normal dose levels. 4. it is concluded that cfmt-pi will be useful for treating urban rtis.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

TI  == in vitro activity of loracarbef and effects of susceptibility test methods.
AB  == loracarbef is a new oral antimicrobial of the carbacephem class with in vitro activity against the common pathogens associated with skin infections, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchopulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. a review of the literature shows the following ranges for 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) values (microgram/ml) against the organisms that commonly cause these illnesses: streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.25-2.0; moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-8.0; m. catarrhalis (beta-lactamase negative), 0.12-0.25; haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-16.0; h. influenzae (beta-lactamase negative), 0.25-8.0; escherichia coli, 2.0-25; klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.25-8.0; proteus mirabilis, 1.0-8.0; streptococcus pyogenes, less than or equal to 0.06-1.0; staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase positive), 8.0; s. aureus (beta-lactamase negative), 1.0-2.0. the in vitro activity of loracarbef against these common outpatient pathogens is similar to that of other oral antimicrobials such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the results of in vitro susceptibility tests with  any antimicrobial, including loracarbef, are somewhat dependent on the specific test method that is employed in the laboratory. this is particularly true with h. influenzae. furthermore, the results of loracarbef susceptibility tests are of uncertain value in predicting therapeutic outcome.

TI  == [acute suppurative thyroiditis and klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis. a case report and review of the literature].
AB  == the acute suppurative thyroiditis is a rare infection. it affects specially patients with preexisting thyroid gland pathology and its frequency is higher in  women. in childhood it's linked to local anatomic defects. the infection used to  be located in left thyroid lobe and it's much less usual in right lobe, in both or in isthmus. the most important causal microorganisms are staphylococci (staphylococcus aureus overcoat) and streptococci (usually streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae), with frequent isolation of mixed flora and anaerobes in the last reported cases. we present the case of a male patient, without previous thyroid disease, who suffered an acute suppurative thyroiditis and sepsis due to klebsiella pneumoniae, with right lobe abscess and secondary septic focus formation (kidneys, spleen, lungs), with fatal course despite of medical treatment, favoured or precipitated by the development of serious alcoholic abstinence.

AB  == quantification of bacteria in various types of middle ear effusion (mee) obtained during current acute otitis media (aom), otitis media with effusion (ome) and chronic suppurative otitis media (com) was performed. the bacteria were stained with acridine orange and their number per ml effusion evaluated under the fluorescence microscope according to a method described in detail elsewhere. during aom, 53% of the mee samples were culture-positive and contained 10(6)-10(8) bacteria per ml (median value 10(7) per ml). during ome, serous effusion and 78% of the mucoid effusions contained no bacteria whatsoever, whereas the remaining mucoid effusions contained 10(4)-5 x 10(5) bacteria per ml  (median value 10(4) per ml). mucopurulent effusions contained 6 x 10(5)-10(8) bacteria per ml (median value 5 x 10(6) per ml). during com, purulent mee had 6 x 10(6)-10(9) bacteria per ml (median value 10(8) per ml). quantification of bacteria involved in middle ear diseases provides further information about the etiopathogenesis and appropriate management of various pathological conditions of the middle ear.

TI  == effects of growth factors, hormones, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and lipotechoic acids on the clonal growth of normal ureteral epithelial cells in serum-free culture.
AB  == in vitro tissue culture techniques were employed to study the effects of bacterial endotoxins on the growth of normal epithelial cells from the human ureter (nhu). primary cultures of nhu cells were initiated from explant outgrowth cultures of human ureteral tissue and cultured on collagen gel in f-12* medium containing 1% fetal calf serum (fcs). optimal clonal growth of secondary cultures of nhu cells seeded at relatively low seeding cell densities, directly on plastic dishes, was achieved in f-12* medium containing bovine pituitary extract (0.5% bpe) and 0.05% bsa. results indicated that insulin in the f-12* medium could be replaced by three orders of magnitude less igf-1. further clonal growth experiments demonstrated that pge1 is growth stimulatory and can replace bpe as a growth factor requirement. this finding was in agreement with the fact that bpe growth requirement could be replaced by cholera toxin or dibutyryl camp. these results suggested that both bpe and cholera toxin operated by activation of a camp-dependent mitogenic pathway. seven gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps) and three gram-positive bacterial lipotechoic acids (lt) were tested for their effects on nhu clonal growth. three out of the five lps derived from escherichia coli (strains 055:b5, 0128:b12, and 0127:b8), lps from klebsiella pneumoniae, and lps from pseudomonas aeruginosa all showed significant growth inhibitory effects at minimally effective doses ranging from 5 to 25 micrograms/ml. lps derived from e. coli strain (0111:b4) had no growth effects at the highest concentration tested (100 micrograms/ml). in contrast, lt  derived from streptococcus pyogenes, s. faecalis, staphylococcus aureas, and bacillus subtilis all markedly enhanced clonal growth at concentrations ranging from 1 microgram/ml less than [lt] less than 50 micrograms/ml. lt from strep. pyogenes was inhibitory to clonal growth at 100 micrograms/ml. the growth inhibitory effects of lps were shown to be sensitive to the presence of hydrocortisone in the growth medium, indicating that lps effects on growth are mediated via the arachidonic acid cascade. we speculate that these results indicate a link between the susceptibility of uroepithelial tissue to the pathogenic microflora seen in urinary tract diseases and the differential sensitivity of proliferation-competent uroepithelial cells to growth inhibition by lps produced by gram-negative bacteria. however, further studies with uropathogenic serotypes will be necessary to corroborate this possibility. the growth-stimulating activity of lts produced by gram-positive bacteria may be due  to their ability to bind to cell-associated fibronectin and to activate the fibronectin receptor as part of ligand receptor-induced mitogenic transmembrane signalling pathway.

AB  == the authors present the first results on the utilization of fish infusion (ifp) as a basic medium for the cultivation of bacteria. the infusion was obtained from a common marine fish, corvina (micropogonias furnieri) according to the technique used in the preparation of beef infusion broth. streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis were cultured in liquid and solid media prepared with ifp as well as in recommended standard media. solid media used for cultivation of s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, n. meningitidis and c. jejuni were supplemented with 5% of defibrinated sheep blood and for the latter, substances recommended to increase aerotolerance were included in solid and liquid media. all of these strains grew on the media prepared with ifp except s.  pneumoniae when cultured in ifp diluted 1:2 with a sodium chloride solution. only s. pyogenes produced colonies smaller than those of the standard medium. no more  differences were detect in the observation of colony morphology. the growth of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and b. subtilis was  measured in liquid media after 8 hours. in solid media, the growth index was expressed by dividing the number of colonies produced in ifp-agar and nutriente agar by the number of colonies on trypticase soy agar plates. some differences were observed in colonial size and morphology when compared with those generated  in standard media. the average value obtained from the analyses of total proteins by biuret reaction in twelve batches of ifp was 5.03 mg/ml. the experiments showed that culture media prepared with ifp supported the growth of bacterial strains used in this work. it suggests that fish infusion has promising conditions of being an alternative substrate for cultural purposes.

TI  == [bactericidal effect of cefadroxil, amoxicillin alone or in combination with clavulanic acid in sera of healthy volunteers].
AB  == determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) provides data on the susceptibility or resistance of a bacteria; however, in susceptible bacteria this parameter is not predictive of effectiveness of the antimicrobial agent. bactericidal activities of cefadroxil, of amoxicillin, and of the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination on bacteria commonly found in ent and lower respiratory tract disease were studied comparatively. the antibiotics were  given by the oral route to six healthy volunteers. with beta-lactamase-producing  and non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of escherichia coli, amoxicillin produced mics consistent with susceptibility but failed to exhibit a bactericidal effect, whereas cefadroxil was bactericidal. combination of amoxicillin with an inhibitor did not modify this activity on e. coli and failed to produce a bactericidal effect on klebsiella pneumoniae similar to that seen with cefadroxil. amoxicillin with and without clavulanic acid exhibited comparable effectiveness on streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae. the bactericidal effect of cefadroxil on s. pneumoniae was of similar magnitude but shorter duration than that of amoxicillin. cefadroxil and the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination had similar bactericidal effects against staphylococcus aureus. these antibiotics exhibited a time-dependent effect on gram positive microorganisms. these pharmacodynamic data, together with measures of bactericidal activity, may  be very helpful for selecting the appropriate antibiotic and dosage.

AB  == ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were  inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime  against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.

TI  == [bacteriological and clinical studies of cefodizime in pediatrics].
AB  == bacteriological and clinical studies on cefodizime (cdzm, thr-221), a new cephem  developed by hoechst ag and roussel uclaf, were carried out and the results are summarized below: 1. against gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae, antibacterial activities of  cdzm were similar to those of cefotaxime (ctx), cefazolin, cefotiam and piperacillin. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia sp., antibacterial activities of cdzm were similar to that of ctx, and superior to those of other tested antibiotics. especially against haemophilus influenzae and  branhamella catarrhalis, it showed an excellent antibacterial activity. 2. although the clinical efficacy was poor in 1 patient with sepsis caused by salmonella marcescens and in another with cervical lymphadenitis, in 5 patients with upper respiratory tract infection, 4 patients with bronchitis, 6 patients with bronchopneumonia, 18 patients with pneumonia, 5 patients with urinary tract  infection and 1 patient with enteritis, the clinical efficacy was excellent or good and the efficacy rate was 95.1% (39/41) including excellent efficacies in 25 cases. 3. bacteriologically, all identified causative bacteria were eradicated except for 1 case of salmonella sp., thus the eradication rate was 97.4% (38/39). especially s. pneumoniae in 10 cases, h. influenzae in 12 cases and b. catarrhalis in 3 cases were eradicated totally. 4. adverse reactions were studied in 46 cases, and digestive symptoms were observed in 9 cases (diarrhea 5 cases, loose stools 4 cases). eruption and vascular pain were observed in 1 case each. as digestive symptoms in 9 cases were mild, the treatment were not suspended. in  laboratory test values, elevation of got, elevation of gpt, elevation of bilirubin, and eosinophilia were observed in 1 case each. influences on blood coagulation parameters were studied. no change was observed between the beginning and the end of the treatment. from above results, we have concluded that cdzm is  a useful and safe antibiotic in pediatrics, administered at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg divided into 3 or 4 doses and administered intravenously.

TI  == activity of temafloxacin against respiratory pathogens.
AB  == the activity of the quinolone temafloxacin against respiratory pathogens was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. mics for 90% of strains tested indicated that temafloxacin was at least two- to fourfold more potent than the other two quinolones against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and legionella pneumophila. temafloxacin had potency equal to that of ciprofloxacin and was twofold more active than ofloxacin against streptococcus pyogenes. moraxella catarrhalis, and bordetella pertussis. against haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, temafloxacin was four- and twofold less potent than ciprofloxacin, respectively. when administered orally in mouse protection tests against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and s. pyogenes, temafloxacin  was at least eight times more potent than ciprofloxacin and was two to four times more active than ofloxacin. against h. influenzae, temafloxacin was as active as  ofloxacin and was two times less active than ciprofloxacin following oral administration in mice. in treating l. pneumophila in guinea pigs and h. influenzae otitis media in gerbils, temafloxacin and ofloxacin were more effective than ciprofloxacin. against s. pneumoniae otitis media in gerbils, temafloxacin and ciprofloxacin were more active than ofloxacin. following subcutaneous administration in mice, temafloxacin achieved higher lung levels than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin did.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of gr69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  == gr69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (mic90). it had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and e-1040. against cephalosporinase-producing enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens, mics ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and  cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to gr69153, and for this organism the mic90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the e-1040 mic90, but most pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. gr69153 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. for staphylococcus aureus gr69153 mics were similar to those of ceftazidime and e-1040. enterococci and listeriae were resistant to gr69153, but streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. the activity of gr69153 was not affected by serum. gr69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, and bro-1, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-9, and morganellae. gr69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. it is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. gr69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of a new quinolone, win 57273, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, win 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. agar inclusion and broth dilution  in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the  staphylococci. the mic for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (mic90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the mic90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. against enterococci the mic90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group a and group b streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. in general, the mic90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. exceptions were serratia marcescens (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), citrobacter freundii (mic90,  4 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). the greatest potency was observed against haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp., with mic90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with mic90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. the in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for  all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. with the exception of the pseudomonas  infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. win 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial  infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).

AB  == the bacteriology of the isolates from the sputum or the throat swab of patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice in sendai city  during the period from march in 1988 to february in 1989 was documented, and their sensitivity to 45 antimicrobial agents was determined. of the 568 patients, 514 cases had acute pharyngitis, 8 cases each had acute tonsillitis and acute bronchitis, 7 cases were acute pneumonia, 6 cases had herpangina, 18 cases had hand-foot-mouth disease with the signs of respiratory infections, 5 cases had varicella with the signs of respiratory infections and 2 cases were mumps with the signs of respiratory infections. three hundred strains of potential (greater  than or equal to 10(7) cfu/ml) pathogens were recovered from 293 of the 568 cases, which consisted of 124 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 58 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 45 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 26 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 strains of other species, not including non-fermentile gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. staphylococcus aureus and other strains were documented simultaneously in 6 out of 7 cases in which multi-organisms were recovered. many strains of staphylococcus aureus were isolated from young patients throughout the year. on the other hand many strains of branhamella catarrhalis were isolated from elderly patients in winter. the sensitivity of 45  antimicrobial agents of 231 of 300 strains was determined by sensitivity disks (eiken, japan). no strain of the haemophilus influenzae in this study was resistant to ampicillin. none of the streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes was resistant to ampicillin or cefazolin. none of the staphylococcus aureus was resistant to cloxacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin or ofloxacin. we conclude from the above results that antibiotic-resistant strains are found presumably only in a very few cases in primary care clinic.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of a dual-action antibacterial, ro 23-9424, compared to cefotaxime and fleroxacin.
AB  == the dual-action antibacterial r 23-9424 (desacetylcefotaxime linked to the quinolone fleroxacin) is a new antibacterial agent with excellent in vitro activity. it was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in comparison with the cephalosporin cefotaxime and the quinolone component, fleroxacin. ro 23-9424 demonstrated significant activity against all strains tested in systemic infections, including those strains resistant in vivo to cefotaxime (staphylococcus aureus 753, serratia marcescens sm and pseudomonas aeruginosa 8780) and fleroxacin (streptococcus pneumoniae 6301 and streptococcus pyogenes. in prophylactic studies, ro 23-9424 compared favorably with fleroxacin against escherichia coli and with cefotaxime against s. pyogenes, but ro 23-9424 was considerably more active than cefotaxime against e. coli and more active than fleroxacin against s. pyogenes. in a murine pneumonia model, ro 23-9424 was equivalent in activity to cefotaxime against s. pneumoniae and more active than cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae. fleroxacin was inactive against s. pneumoniae and about 20-fold more active than ro 23-9424 against k. pneumoniae. in a murine meningitis infection caused by s. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was 3 times  as active as cefotaxime, while fleroxacin was inactive. when meningitis was induced by k. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was as active as the quinolone, while cefotaxime was inactive. in a neutropenic (immunocompromised) model, ro 23-9424 was more active than cefotaxime against p. aeruginosa and 5-fold less active than fleroxacin. in the control normal (immunocompetent) mouse infection, ro 23-9424 was 3-fold more active than cefotaxime, but 10-fold less active than fleroxacin.

AB  == pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr, cs-807), a newly developed oral cephem, were carried out in the treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics. 1. since cpdx demonstrates very powerful antimicrobial actions against such gram-negative bacilli as escherichia coli, salmonella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia sp., such gram-positive cocci as streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase producing branhamella catarrhalis and haemophilus  influenzae, this drug was thought to be useful for the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases when main causative bacteria in the field of pediatrics were  taken into account. 2. when changes in blood and urine concentrations of cpdx following the administration of this drug at 3.7 mg/kg before meal were determined, cmax and t1/2 were found to be 2.98 micrograms/ml at 2-hour and 1.73  hours, respectively; an urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours and a maximum urine concentration were 32.5% and 52 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. clinically, 8 of 8 patients with the upper respiratory tract infections (100%), 28 of 29 patients with bronchitis and/or pneumonia (96.6%), 3 of 4 patients with otitis media (75%), 2 of 2 patients with sinusitis (100%), 3 of 3 patients with the skin soft tissue infections (100%), 1 of 1 patient with bacterial enteritis (100%) and 11 of 14 patients with urinary tract infections (78.6%) responded well to the treatment with cpdx-pr, showing a 91.8% efficacy rate in all the patients treated. 4. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, b. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, e. coli and salmonella typhimurium were all eradicated from 5, 1, 4, 6, 1, 5, 5, 11 and 1 patient, respectively. an eradication rate in all the patients examined was 97.5% (39/40). 5. gastrointestinal symptoms appeared as side effects in 2 of 71 patients (vomiting in 1 and diarrhea in 1), hence, an incidence of side effects was 2.8% (2/71). as for abnormal laboratory findings, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and increases in got and gpt were observed in 3 of 39 patients examined (7.7%), 1 of 39 patients (2.6%) and 2 of 34 patients (5.9%), respectively. in addition, we also examined the effect of the drug on the hemostatic system, but found no changes upon the treatment. based on these results, it appeared that cpdx-pr was a useful and safe drug in treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics when administered 2-3 times a day  at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg.

AB  == to study the mechanism of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous (igiv) complement consumption and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmnl) membrane receptor (fcrlo, cr1, and cr3)-mediated phagocytosis of staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and groups a and b streptococci were examined. igiv alone did not consume complement and showed no opsonic activity by itself for these organisms. when these bacteria were preopsonized in igiv, significant amounts of complement were consumed (44%-94%) and the uptake and killing of bacteria occurred. the in vitro opsonic activity of igiv for these organisms was significantly correlated with the amount of complement consumed by  the igiv-opsonized bacteria (r = .85, p less than .05). the in vivo protective efficacy of igiv also appeared to be directly associated with its ability to activate and consume complement (r = 1.0, p less than .001). antibodies to fcrlo  (leu 11) markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized in igiv but not that of bacteria opsonized in specific igm. both cr1 and cr3 receptors on pmnls were involved in uptake, but the contribution of each is different with different organisms.

(ii) of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were  gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) of these gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were enterobacteriaceae were enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious gram negative bacilli. (iv) the more common species among the members of enterobacteriaceae were escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). the other common species included enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii and proteus vulgaris. the frequencies of salmonella species and shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. the most common isolate among other glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli was aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). the finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in taiwan. (v) of these glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) pseudomonas species. (vi) the most common bacteria among fastidious gram negative bacilli was haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) of these gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) n. meningitidis. (viii) the more common isolates of gram positive bacilli included bacillus species and corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) of these gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of staphylococcus species and streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. the most common isolate among gram positive cocci was staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then s. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). the less common isolates were streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and s. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == stimulation of cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic functions of natural killer cells by bacterial membrane proteoglycans and ribosomes.
AB  == the present study was designed to investigate the effect of membrane proteoglycans (mpg) from klebsiella pneumoniae on the function of human natural killer (nk) cells. mpg combined with bacterial ribosomes from klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae, constitute a bacterial immunomodulator (ms d 53), currently in clinical use. human peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) exposed in vitro to mpg or ms d 53 for 20 h showed enhanced nk cytotoxicity. augmentation of nk cytotoxicity depended upon a direct effect on nk cells, inasmuch as these compounds were also  effective on highly purified large granular lymphocytes (lgl). we also studied the effects of mpg on non-cytotoxic functions of nk cells, namely in vitro locomotion and production of il-1. mpg (and ms d 53) induced il-1 release in lgl. moreover, mpg-treated lgl showed enhanced locomotory activity, as assessed by measuring the penetration into nitrocellulose filters. the capacity of mpg (and ms d 53) to activate cytotoxic and noncytotoxic functions of nk cells may contribute to enhancement of nonspecific resistance in vivo after treatment with  this agent.

TI  == immunomodulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes by d53 immucytal and its constitutive fractions.
AB  == d53 (immucytal) is a compositive vaccine made of immunogenic ribosomes extracted  from 4 bacterial species (klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae) associated with a membrane proteoglycan from a non-encapsulated strain of klebsiella pneumoniae (mpg-kp). in this work we have studied the effect of the compound on human polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) function "in vitro". we have demonstrated that d53 was able to significantly increase fc- receptor dependent phagocytosis without modify the c3-receptor dependent activity. furthermore d53 enhanced the oxidative metabolism (evaluated by chemiluminescence) both using cells in resting conditions or after  stimulation with phagocytable or soluble stimuli. on the contrary d53 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of pmn migration toward different chemoattractants. using the two constitutive fractions of the compound (ribosomes and proteoglycans) we have observed that the mpg-kp component was mainly responsible  for the modulating activity of the drug on human pmns.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the therapeutic activities of orally administered fk482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of  bacteria in mice and rabbits. in systemic infections in mice, oral fk482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (ccl) and more effective than oral cephalexin (cex) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis infections. however, fk482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against e. coli infection in mice,  and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given ccl. in comparison with ccl, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given fk482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. in local infections in rabbits, a species in which fk482 was better absorbed than in mice, fk482 was more effective than ccl, cex or amoxicillin (ampc). against pneumonia induced by s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, fk482 was as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. in the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, fk482 was superior to ccl and ampc against methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection, as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl against enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (cfix) and more effective than ccl and ampc against e. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.

AB  == to interpret of the cefoperazone (cpz) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in japan, but a 3 category system is used in the u.s.a. and europe. in the 4 category interpretation system of showa cpz disc the following classification is used: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible mic less than  or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible mic less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. reliability of the cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate mics by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and  75 micrograms. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. a good negative correlation was observed between  inhibitory zone diameters and mics, showing reliability of the test using these discs. the results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of cpz were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. some strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. when different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. with 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which mics of cpz were below 3 micrograms/ml. however, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which mics were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. the fact that most frequent values of mics of cpz against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. according to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates from upper respiratory tract infections].
AB  == sultamicillin (sbtpc) is a mutual prodrug in which ampicillin (abpc) and a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam (sbt) are ester-bound in an equimolar ratio. sbtpc is hydrolyzed during absorption after oral administration to provide abpc and sbt for systemic circulation. in the present study, the antimicrobial activities of sbtpc against 50 isolates each of 6 species (staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes) of bacteria freshly obtained from upper respiratory tract infections were examined in relation to their bacterial beta-lactamase producing abilities. beta-lactamase producing strains were identified using the acidometry disc method with benzylpenicillin (pcg) of cefazolin (cez) as a substrate, and their frequencies of appearance were calculated as follows: s. aureus 86%; k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae 100%; b. catarrhalis 68%; h. influenzae 24%. fourteen per cent of s. aureus strains examined were beta-lactamase positive using both pcg and cez acidometry discs. sbtpc, however, demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activities even against these beta-lactamase producing strains. good activities were observed especially against those bacterial strains producing penicillinase (pcase). average mic80 values of sbtpc were 3.13 micrograms/ml for s. aureus and  k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, 0.39 micrograms/ml for b. catarrhalis and h. influenzae, 0.05 micrograms/ml for s. pneumoniae and 0.025 micrograms/ml for s. pyogenes. as sbtpc was shown to possess excellent antimicrobial activities against pcase producing strains, the enhancement in activities of sbtpc compared  to abpc alone can be attributed to the inhibition of beta-lactamase by sbt which, as noted above, is a component of sbtpc in an equimolar ratio to abpc.

TI  == many pulmonary pathogenic bacteria bind specifically to the carbohydrate sequence galnac beta 1-4gal found in some glycolipids.
AB  == pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the united states. to examine the possible role of carbohydrates as adhesion receptors for infection, several pulmonary pathogenic bacteria were studied for binding to glycosphingolipids. radiolabeled bacteria were layered on thin-layer chromatograms of separated glycosphingolipids, and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. the classic triad of infectious bacteria found in cystic fibrosis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria commonly implicated in typical pneumonia, such  as streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and certain escherichia coli, bind specifically to fucosylasialo-gm1 (fuc alpha 1-2gal beta 1-3galnac beta 1-4gal beta 1-4cer), asialo-gm1 (gal beta 1-3galnac beta 1-4gal beta-1-4galc beta 1-1cer), and asialo-gm2 (galnac beta 1-4gal beta 1-4glc beta 1-1cer). bacteria maintained in nutrient medium bind better than the same cells suspended in buffer. they do not bind to galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, paragloboside, forssman glycosphingolipid, or several other glycosphingolipids tested, including the gangliosides gm1, gm2, gm3, gd1a, gd1b, gt1b, and cad. the finding that these pathogens do not bind to lactosylceramide suggests that beta 1-4-linked galnac, which is positioned internally in fucosylasialo-gm1 and asialo-gm1 and terminally in asialo-gm2, is required for binding. beta-n-acetylgalactosamine itself, however, is not sufficient for binding, as the bacteria did not bind to globoside, which contains the terminal sequence galnac beta 1-3gal. these data suggest that these bacteria require at least terminal or internal galnac beta 1-4gal sequences unsubstituted with sialyl residues for binding. other bacteria,  including mycoplasma pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella species, and  some e. coli, do not bind to the galnac beta 1-4gal sequence. the biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that substantial amounts of asialo-gm1 occur in human lung tissue.

TI  == inactivation of bacteria by purogene.
AB  == the bacteriocidal efficacy of purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (clo2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. the organisms tested were: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, yersinia enterocolitica, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes group a, salmonella typhimurium and bacillus subtilis. the test organisms responded differently to inactivation by purogene. at least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. since purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of clo2 in this solution. this was done by varying the ph of purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (ph of purogene is 8.6) while keeping the ph of the experimental medium constant (ph 7.0). the results showed that purogene was most efficacious at the lowest ph tested (ph 3.5). this indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at ph 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide  as the active disinfecting species.

TI  == in vivo postantibiotic effect in a thigh infection in neutropenic mice.
AB  == the postantibiotic effect (pae) is the suppression of bacterial growth that persists after limited exposure of organisms to antimicrobial agents. we demonstrated and standardized the in vivo pae in a thigh infection model in neutropenic mice. inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced paes of 1.4-7.5 h against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, whereas beta-lactam antibiotics did not induce significant paes. against aerobic gram-positive cocci, cell wall-active agents and inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced paes of 1.2-7.1 h, except for penicillins, which did not induce paes against streptococci. with few exceptions the in vivo pae correlated well with the pae reported in prior in vitro studies. residual drug in thigh tissue did not cause the pae. theoretically, the presence of a pae may allow antimicrobial agents to be given more intermittently without organism regrowth after drug levels fall below the minimal inhibitory concentration.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. the bmy-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by bmy-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus supp., streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, serogroup c and g streptococci, listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. bmy-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. bmy-28100 was generally bactericidal, but mics for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml was used. strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, shv, hms) were susceptible to bmy-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. bmy-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (types i and iv). bmy-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but  was destroyed by type i cephalosporinases and klebsiella k1 enzymes.

AB  == fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (l-105, czon), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. antibacterial activities of czon against clinically isolated strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and h. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (cmx), latamoxef (lmox), cefoperazone (cpz), cefmetazole (cmz), cefotiam (ctm) and cefazolin (cez). czon was nearly as active as cez against s. aureus and s. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other gram-positive cocci. against gram-negative rods, czon was as active as cmx and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of czon at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. mean serum concentrations of czon at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. mean cumulative urinary excretion rates  within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2,  acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, uti 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with czon at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. the overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. no adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of got and gpt in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. these results clearly indicate the usefulness of czon in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

TI  == microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  == the potential of octenidine hydrochloride (win 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. semilogarithmic survival curves were  plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against staphylococcus aureus. the microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and candida albicans. death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microm (0.94 microgram/ml)  caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and e. coli and c. albicans were the least susceptible. octenidine was more active than  chlorhexidine against each test strain. skin-degerming activities of aqueous and  formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. aqueous  octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.

AB  == a model for contact transfer of micro-organisms by hand has been extended to include representatives of bacterial species responsible for a majority of hospital-acquired infections. the ability of the organisms to transfer from contaminated fabrics to hands and from hands to sterile fabrics was measured, as  was their ability to survive on the skin of the hands. there were differences between the species. staphylococcus saprophyticus transferred well to the hand but not as well from hand to fabric as the other species; it survived well on skin. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella aerogenes and serratia marcescens transferred moderately well overall and also survived on the skin. these results  were in contrast to those obtained with a strain of escherichia coli and one of streptococcus pyogenes. the contact transfer model was used to investigate the use of small volumes of alcohol in preventing transfer via the hands. an alcohol  handrub of either 0.3 ml 80% ethanol or 0.3 ml 70% isopropanol gave reductions in transfer slightly less than that of a soap and water wash. raising the volume, and consequently the contact time, to 0.5 ml 70% isopropanol gave a 14000-fold reduction in transfer, statistically indistinguishable from that of a thorough soap and water wash (9800-fold reduction).

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (cmx) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. cmx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and haemophilus influenzae and also streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae with mic values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. against staphylococci and serratia marcescens, cmx showed the antimicrobial activity with mic90 6.25 micrograms/ml. however, cmx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against streptococcus faecalis. reliability of cmx disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of cmx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, capable of utilizing cmx disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of cmx. using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms cmx, fuchs et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm =  mic 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = mic 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. in this investigation, the  following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = mic greater than 3  to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = mic greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = mic greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). based on cmx pharmacokinetic data currently available, mic break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.

TI  == chemiluminescent response to pathogenic organisms: normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == chemiluminescence (cl) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal cl response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. we investigated the luminol-enhanced cl response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. we analyzed  the cl response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees c.  the cl response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees c. variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced cl. each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. in the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in cl: enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and zymosan. in the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pyogenes. the cl response also reflected serum opsonic activity. the effect of inactivated complement, factor b, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak cl; however, a strain of e. coli caused a variation in  peak time rather than peak height. different cl kinetics were shown for three strains of k. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or  cell wall characteristics. this study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal cl response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  == in a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics90) against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter aerogenes. subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized,  crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. the 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. the area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at  least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the mic90 for all seven groups of pathogens;  at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the mic90 against the majority of bacterial groups. in contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the mic90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin  were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. these data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the mics90  longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == [susceptibility of clinical isolates in pediatrics to cefpiramide].
AB  == cefpiramide (cpm, sm-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. antibacterial activities of cpm against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis and proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (cpz). antibacterial activities of cpm against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of cpz, but antibacterial activity of  cpm against pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of cpz and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. antibacterial activity of cpm has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (pcase type) producing s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, etc. it is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of cpm against pathogenic organisms but also the  beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of cpm.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the alpha-hemolytic streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains  of serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium diphtheriae. however, strans of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. the mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical studies on cefoxitin in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  == studies on antimicrobial activity, absorption and excretion and clinical use of cefoxitin in pediatric field were performed. 1. mic of cefoxitin was compared with that of cefazolin and/or ampicillin for clinical isolates of staphylococcus  aureus (36 strains), escherichia coli (35 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (34 strains) and haemophilus influenzae (80 strains). mic of cefoxitin against s. aureus was approximately 1-2 tubes higher than that of cefazolin. many strains of e. coli and k. pneumoniae that showed high mic to cefazolin were sensitive to cefoxitin. it is presumed that the results are due to the strong resistance of cefoxitin to beta-lactamase degradation. mic of cefoxitin against h. influenzae was approximately 1-2 tubes lower than that of cefazolin, but approximately 4 tubes higher than that of ampicillin. 2. serum level and urinary recovery rate of cefoxitin after one shot i.v. injection of 25 mg/kg were examined. the serum mean levels were 33.8 microgram/ml at 1/2 hour, 7.0 microgram/ml at 1 hour and 2.9 microgram/ml at 2 hours after the injection, respectively, and the drug was not detected in serum at 4 and 6 hours after the injection. the mean half-life of serum level was 27.1 minutes. the mean urinary recovery rate within 6 hours after injection was 96.0% and most of the drug were excreted into urine within 2 hours  after the injection. 3. in order to evaluate clinical response, bacteriological response and side effects, cefoxitin was applied to 19 cases, i.e., 12 cases of either acute lobar pneumonia or acute bronchopneumonia, 2 cases of acute pyelitis, 1 case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent arthritis, acute orbital phlegmon and acute buccal abscess. as for clinical response, the overall efficacy rate (the percentage of cases showed excellent and good efficacy) was 88.9%. as for bacteriological response, among the 13 strains which were determined or supposed to be causative organisms, i.e., 6 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of h. influenzae and 1 strain each of streptococcus pyogenes, alpha-streptococcus, enterococcus, e. coli and neisseria sp., all strains were disappeared except for enterococcus which was reduced by the treatment with cefoxitin. no side effect was observed in any case. abnormalities of laboratory findings were observed in 3 cases, i.e., 1 case each  of reduction of rbc and hb, elevation of got and gpt and elevation of gpt, but all of them returned to normal following completion of the dosage term.

AB  == nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in zaria have been identified. the work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. the isolates in order of prevalence were: candida albicans (20.9%), klebsiella sp (15.0%), escherichia coli (9.1%), streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), streptococcus viridans (2.1%), staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), proteus mirabilis (1.1%), peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus sp, lactobacillus sp, and clostridium sp were sought but not found. chlamydia, viruses, and t-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. it appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. for this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.

TI  == cefmenoxime (sce-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  == the activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1h-tetraz ol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, and enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive proteus, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. variation in ph, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. in escherichia coli cefmenoxime  showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (pbp-3), followed by pbp-1 (1a and 1b). this affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. the high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by proteus mirabilis.

TI  == interaction between environmental pollutants and respiratory infections.
AB  == the major aspects that must be considered in studies of the health effects of environmental pollutants are: the direct damage due to the exposure, the role of  pre-existing disease, and effects of the exposure on the response to secondary stresses. in experimental studies at concentrations of air pollutants found in urban environments frank toxicological responses are rarely observed. however, exposure to a secondary stress, i.e. respiratory challenge with infectious bacteria, can exacerbate the response of the experimental host. changes in the resistance to respiratory infections provide a highly sensitive experimental animal model system, which is increasingly used in studies of health effects of air pollutants. this model indicates the impairment of the basic defense mechanisms of the respiratory system by the combined exposure to low concentrations of pollutants and the superimposed bacterial infection. changes in the resistance to respiratory infections were studied in various species of laboratory animals. s. pyogenes and k. pneumoniae are the bacteria of choice to induce the pulmonary infection. included in the studies are short-term single and multiple exposures as well as long-term exposures to gaseous pollutants such as o3 and no2 and particulate pollutants such as sulfates and nitrates. changes in the resistance are measured as excess mortalities and reduced survival time as compared to those in infected animals not exposed to the pollutants. other parameters measured ranged from changes in the immune response to changes in retention rates of bacteria in lungs.

TI  == biphasic protection against bacterial infection in mice induced by vaccination of propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == a single intraperitoneal injection of the phenol-treated cells of propionibacterium acnes into mice showed nonspecific resistance against subsequent lethal doses of an intraperitoneal challenge of klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. the protection showed a biphasic pattern. the maximum protection, designated as the early phase protection, was seen in mice injected with p. acnes vaccine 1 to 2 days before the challenge, whereas the late phase protection was seen in mice vaccinated 16 to 22 days before the challenge. the activity of the reticuloendothelial system in mice after vaccination also showed a biphasic pattern with the peak on days 4  and 12. the delayed activation of the reticuloendothelial system lasted up to 3 weeks and coincided with the period of the late phase protection. the early phase resistance was markedly impaired by the treatment with hydrocortisone and carrageenan, but not by the treatment with anti-thymocyte serum, actinomycin d, or cyclophosphamide. the number of peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vaccinated mice increased on days 1 to 2. the number of macrophages also increased at 2 to 21 days after vaccination and reached its maximum on day 14. total activities of acid phosphatase, nitro blue tetrazolium reduction, and the phagocytic activities of peritoneal exudate cells were also enhanced on and after day 1 after the injection of p. acnes vaccine.

AB  == a total of 91 multiply resistant bacterial strains, including klebsiella pneumoniae (32 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 strains), and serratia marcescens (43 strains), were collected during hospital epidemics of nosocomial infection from 1975 to 1979. these strains were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. their susceptibility to three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams, ly127935 (a 1-oxa-beta-lactam), cefotaxime (hr 756), and cefoperazone (t 1551), was compared with the susceptibility of random strains of nine species of aerobic gram-negative bacilli collected in the  same hospital in 1979. susceptibility to cefamandole and ticarcillin was also determined. strains of staphylococci and streptococci from that hospital and two  nearby city-county hospitals were also compared for the three new cephalosporins  and other effective antibiotics. the agar dilution method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration for each antibiotic. the multiply resistant strains (minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin >/= 8 mug/ml) usually were as susceptible to the three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams as were non-multiply resistant strains. both klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens, including multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains, were most susceptible to the 1-oxa-beta-lactam ly127935 and cefotaxime. p. aeruginosa  (both multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains) were most susceptible to cefoperazone. all three new beta-lactams were active against non-multiply resistant strains of escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., and citrobacter spp. providencia stuartii were most susceptible to cefotaxime and the 1-oxa-beta-lactam ly127935. the three new beta-lactams were all less active against staphylococci (especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) than cephalothin. streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae were very susceptible to cefotaxime and cefoperazone, though less susceptible to  ly127935. none of the three new beta-lactams was active against s. faecalis. all  were very active against both penicillinase-positive and -negative strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae.

AB  == cefadroxil (duricef, mead johnson and company), resembles cephalexin and cephradine in spectrum of antibacterial activity but differs in human pharmacokinetic properties. whether the latter are likely to affect activity in vivo was assessed by determining bactericidal activity against clinical isolates  under conditions simulating the variation of drug concentration in the blood stream after an oral dose of 500 mg to adults. in this kinetic model, cefadroxil  was more active than cephalexin or cephradine against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and one of two strains of escherichia coli. the other strain of e. coli was virtually unaffected by the cephalosporins. s. pyogenes was equally susceptible to all three cephalosporins. analysis of the results suggest that the pharmocokinetic properties of an antibiotic affect its activity in the blood stream, provided the susceptibility of the infecting organism is concentration-dependent within the range of drug concentration occurring in serum.

TI  == general principles of antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == in the initial therapy of life-threatening infections in which a bacterial cause  is suspected, the emphasis should be on broad antibiotic coverage in contrast to  definitive therapy, which is dependent on microbial isolation and, when indicated, in vitro susceptibility tests. in severe infections, antimicrobial agents should be given parenterally, at least initially. the need for optimal dosage is emphasized. this is particularly important when aminoglycosides are administered, for there is a tendency to use inadequate dosage because of concern for potential side effects with these agents. the problems leading to recurrence  and persistence of fever during antimicrobial therapy include failure to diagnose and drain abscesses, superinfection, drug fever, and clinical or microbiologic errors. combinations of antibiotics are indicated in severe infections in severe  infections due to pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcal group d streptococci, klebsiella pneumoniae, and cryptococcus neoformans. laboratory aid for the selection of antimicrobial therapy can be of great value but need not always be done, because certain microorganisms have stable, predictable susceptibilities, for example, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. cautious conservatism is advocated with regard to the use of new antimicrobial agents.

TI  == ceftezole, a new cephalosporin c derivative i. in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity.
AB  == ceftezole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic similar to cefazolin, has the following chemical structure: (6r,7r)-8-oxo-7[2-(1h-tetrazol-1-yl)acetamido]-3-[(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)meth yl]-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-carboxylic acid. ceftezole was found to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic, active in vitro against many species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia  marcescens and proteus vulgaris. the activity of ceftezole against clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. appeared to be nearly equal to that of cefazolin and higher than those of cephaloridine and cephalothin. cross-resistance was observed between ampicillin and cephaloridine, but not between ampicillin and ceftezole, in susceptibility tests on clinical isolates of p. mirabilis. the in vitro activity was little affected by the inoculum size, the presence of human serum or the test medium. ceftezole exhibited apparent bactericidal activity at the concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against both s. aureus and e. coli. the development in vitro  of resistance by s. aureus 209p and e. coli nihj to ceftezole after 16 transfers  was similar to or somewhat slower than that to other drugs tested. ceftezole was  relatively stable in nutrient broth and minimally degraded in the serum or tissue homogenates of rats. ceftezole, in a single subcutaneous administration, exhibited somewhat less efficacy in mice against intraperitoneal infections with  streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae or p. mirabilis than either cephaloridine or cefazolin. however, ceftezole exhibited efficacy similar to that of cephaloridine or cefazolin when administered in three doses. furthermore, ceftezole was as effective as cefazolin in the treatment of experimental abscesses in mice caused by subcutaneous inoculation with s. aureus.

TI  == effect of capsular polysaccharide of klebsiella pneumoniae on host resistance to  bacterial infections. i. induction of increased susceptibility to infections in mice.
AB  == when klebsiella pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide (cps-k) from type 1, kasuya strain, was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) immediately before i.p. bacterial challenge, the survival time of mice infected with salmonella enteritidis nub 1 (virulent strain) was shortened and the mortality rate for mice infected with s.  enteritidis nub 31 (avirulent strain) was enhanced. the promotion of infection with s. enteritidis nub 1 by cps-k depended upon its dose, the effect of cps-k being demonstrable up to as little as 0.2 mug per mouse. in the case of s. enteritidis nub 31, the effect of cps-k was detectable only when more than 20 mug per mouse was injected. as a result of enumeration of bacterial populations in the peritoneal washing, blood, liver and spleen, it was revealed that cps-k promoted in vivo growth of s. enteritidis nub 1 and nub 31. in addition, cps-k enhanced the mortality rate in mice infected with streptococcus pyogenes or streptococcus pneumoniae. the peak cps-k effect on infection with s. enteritidis  nub 1 was seen when given immediately before bacterial challenge. the active substance responsible for the infection-promoting effect of cps-k was neutral cps-k, which is distinct from the o antigen and from acidic cps-k (the type-specific capsular antigen). preparations of neutral cps-k isolated from the  other three strains of k. pneumoniae exhibited a marked infection-promoting effect comparable with that of preparations from the kasuya strain. neutral cps-k, with identical antigenicity to that from the kasuya strain, has already been found to exert a strong adjuvant effect on antibody responses to various antigens in mice. no parallelism exists between infection-promoting activity and  adjuvant activity of neutral cps-k.

TI  == adherence of bacteria to heart valves in vitro.
AB  == the abilities of 14 strains of aerobic gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli to adhere in vitro to human or canine aortic valve leaflets were compared. 2-mm sections of excised valve leaflets were obtained by punch biopsy and were incubated under standardized conditions in suspensions of bacteria. valve sections were subsequently washed and homogenized, and quantitative techniques were used to determine the proportions of bacteria from the initial suspensions that had adhered to the valve sections. comparable results were obtained when these adherence ratios were determined by two independent methods based either on measurements of bacterial viability or of radioactivity in 51cr-labeled bacteria. for each bacterial strain, the adherence ratio was constant over a wide range of concentrations of bacteria in the incubation medium. strains of enterococci, viridans streptococci, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa (adherence ratios 0.003-0.017) were found to adhere more readily to valve sections than strains of  escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (adherence ratios 0.00002-0.00004). the organisms that most frequently cause bacterial endocarditis were found to adhere best to heart valves in vitro, suggesting that the ability to adhere to valvular endothelium may be an important or essential charcteristic of bacteria that cause endocarditis in man.

TI  == systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof n6-methylated adenine. it was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, staphylococcus aureus, sarcina lutea, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium, contain neither n6-monomethyl adenine (m6a) nor n6-dimethyladenine (m26a) in 23s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna). in the case of s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26a. (ii) the gram-negative strains salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6a but  not m23a in 23s rrna. these observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. because of the demonstrated relationship between n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23s rrna and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed  systematic differences found in rrna methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

AB  == bl-s 339 is a new broad-spectrum, parenterally effective cephalosporin whose expression of antibacterial activity in vitro is markedly affected by the nature  of the assay medium. when assayed in nutrient agar, bl-s 339 was more active than cephalothin against strains of diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter, and indole-positive proteus sp. however, when assayed in mueller-hinton medium, its activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria, was reduced substantially, whereas the activity of cephalothin was virtually unaffected by the assay medium. the in vivo activity of bl-s 339 correlated well with its activity in nutrient agar; when administered subcutaneously to mice, it was therapeutically more efficacious than cephalothin in infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. when bl-s 339 was administered intramuscularly to mice, the concentrations achieved in the blood were three times those achieved with cephalothin. bl-s 339 was bound to human serum proteins to the same extent as cephalothin. recovery of bl-s 339 in the urine within the 24-hr period after intramuscular administration to rats was three times that of cephalothin.

TI  == in vitro action of carbenicillin against bacteria isolated from clinical material.
AB  == more than 500 bacteria isolated from patient material were tested against carbenicillin (disodium alpha-carboxybenzylpenicillin) by diffusion and dilution  modalities. the same bacteria, which included pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella-aerobacter-enterobacter group, various species of proteus, staphylococcus aureus and epiddermidis, enterococci, pneumococci, streptococcus pyogenes, etc., were examined for susceptibility to other antibiotics commonly used with special emphasis on ampicillin and cephalothin. the responses of pyocine-typed p. aeruginosa were the most remarkable. the majority of these bacteria displayed susceptibility to carbenicillin by both the dilution and the diffusion techniques. the concentrations of this antibiotic used in the laboratory were of the same order of magnitude as that of the other drugs. the laboratory behavior of the other bacteria, toward this new semisynthetic penicillin derivative approximated their response to ampicillin and cephalothin.

TI  == antipseudomonal activity of alpha-sulfoaminopenicillins.
AB  == a series of penicillins characterized by the presence of a sulfoamino or a modified sulfoamino group in the side chain was subjected to in vitro antimicrobial screening tests. although the most potent members of the series were less active than benzylpenicillin against gram-positive bacteria and comparably active against most gram-negative bacteria, they were, on the average, 8 to 16 times more effective against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. in other  comparative laboratory tests against p. aeruginosa, these compounds were about as active as carbenicillin and four to eight times more active than ampicillin. an examination of structure-activity relationships indicated that maximal potency was obtained with penicillins having an alpha-(aromatic or heteroaromatic)-alpha-sulfoaminoacetamido side chain. the compound with an alpha-phenyl group was comparable in activity to those having an alpha-(2- or 3-thienyl) group, whereas any modification in position or structure of the alpha-sulfoamino group reduced activity. results of studies with a cell-free p. aeruginosa beta-lactamase suggest that the marked inhibitory effects of alpha-sulfoamino penicillins for p. aeruginosa can be attributed, at least in part, to their high degree of resistance to this enzyme. some derivatives, however, had weak antipseudomonal activity, despite possessing a high degree of beta-lactamase resistance.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephalexin, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin c antibiotic.
AB  == concentrations of cephalexin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) in serum and urine were determined in normal volunteers and patients. the in vitro antibacterial activity was also studied. all strains of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml. of the staphylococcus aureus strains, 88% were inhibited by 6.3 mug/ml, and 12.5 mug/ml was inhibitory for all s. aureus, 80% of escherichia coli, 72% of klebsiella-aerobacter, and 56% of proteus mirabilis strains. about 90 to 96% of e. coli, klebsiella aerobacter, and p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug of cephalexin per ml. pseudomonas and indole-positive proteus strains proved to be quite resistant to cephalexin. cephalexin was well absorbed after oral administration. a peak serum concentration of cephalexin of at least 5 mug/ml was achieved in each volunteer with 250 and 500-mg doses. a mean peak serum concentration of 7.7 mug/ml was achieved with 250-mg doses; 12.3mug/ml was achieved with 500-mg doses of antibiotic. food did not interfere with absorption. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. over 90% of the administered dose was excreted  in the urine within 6 hr. the mean peak serum concentration of cephalexin after an oral dose of 500 mg was adequate to inhibit all group a streptococci, d. pneumoniae, and s. aureus, 85% of e. coli, and about 40 to 75% of klebsiella-aerobacter and p. mirabilis strains. levels of cephalexin in urine were adequate to inhibit over 90% of e. coli, and p. mirabilis and 80 to 96% of klebsiella-aerobacter strains.

TI  == effects of indomethacin on acute, subacute, and latent infections in mice and rats.
AB  == the comparative effect of indomethacin and hydrocortisone on the resistance of mice or rats to various acute, subacute, and latent bacterial infections was investigated. large daily doses of indomethacin and hydrocortisone administered to mice challenged with bacterial pathogens, including klebsiella pneumoniae ad,  salmonella schottmuelleri 3010, staphylococcus aureus (smith), streptococcus pyogenes c203, salmonella pullorum #2, proteus vulgaris 1810, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 2616, revealed that in essentially all of these acute infections, the  mortality of the infected mice treated with indomethacin was essentially identical to that found in the infected controls. in contrast, hydrocortisone often lowered the resistance of mice to these acute infections. in a more chronic bacterial infection due to corynebacterium kutscheri, hydrocortisone produced striking deleterious effects on resistance, whereas indomethacin administration in doses approaching the maximal tolerated level caused no observable adverse effects on host resistance. indomethacin fed continuously to rats for 80 days, at maximal tolerated levels, caused no observable adverse effects on the host-parasite relationship of rats which were shown to harbor various latent infections. hydrocortisone administration, however, lowered the resistance of rats as evidenced by increased mortality related directly to extensive bacterial  infection. insofar as infection is concerned, indomethacin behaved like other nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agents such as aspirin and phenylbutazone.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephaloglycin.
AB  == serum and urine concentrations of cephaloglycin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) were determined in normal volunteers and in patients. the in vitro activity of cephaloglycin was also studied. all strains of group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes) and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.4 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. eighty per cent of the staphylococcus aureus  strains and about 50% of the escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis strains were  inhibited by 1.6 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. klebsiella-aerobacter species were  more resistant to cephaloglycin and 12.5 mug per ml was required to inhibit 70% of these strains. when single doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg of cephaloglycin were administered to fasting volunteers, a peak serum concentration of at least 0.5 mug per ml was achieved. a full breakfast did not interfere with absorption of cephaloglycin. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. serum concentrations of cephaloglycin were even higher in patients who were receiving repeated doses. the peak serum concentrations of cephaloglycin in all volunteers and patients were adequate to inhibit all strains of group a streptococci and d. pneumoniae. many of the peak serum concentrations were adequate to inhibit some strains of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. mirabilis. urine levels of cephaloglycin were high enough in all volunteers and patients to inhibit more than 90% of the e. coli and p. mirabilis strains and over 70% of the strains of klebsiella-aerobacter.

TI  == effect of naturally occurring xanthines on bacteria. i. antimicrobial action and  potentiating effect on antibiotic spectra.
AB  == the effect of xanthines on various microorganisms was studied. the antibacterial  effect was not high; most of the test organisms could easily withstand a concentration of 2,500 mug/ml. caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. the effect was both bacteriostatic and  bactericidal against susceptible organisms. the susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. the morphology of aerobacter  aerogenes and a. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. this potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.

AB  == horse blood agar containing polymyxin b sulphate, neomycin sulphate, and fusidic  acid inhibited the growth of staph. aureus, ps. pyocyanea, proteus mirabilis, e.  coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae but allowed good growth of, and haemolysis by, str. pyogenes. in a comparison with blood agar, blood 4% agar, and gentian violet blood agar, the selective medium (p.n.f.) yielded a significantly higher proportion of streptococci than the other media, both by aerobic and by anaerobic culture, from burn swab extracts deliberately contaminated with str. pyogenes; p.n.f. culture was more effective with dilute than with heavy inocula of str. pyogenes, allowing from three to seven times as many recoveries of str. pyogenes  from swabs contaminated with 10(-3) dilution of streptococcal cultures than cultures of the same material on the other media. haemolytic streptococci of groups a, c, d, g, and others were isolated by aerobic culture from burns in a consecutive series of 1,277 swabs more often on p.n.f. medium than on blood 4% agar. viable counts of 12 strains (including 11 different serological types) of str. pyogenes showed some reduction in the numbers of colonies compared with counts on blood agar, and some strains grew more slowly on p.n.f. medium. these limitations, however, were offset and outweighed by the higher final yield of streptococci on the selective medium.

TI  == pharmacology and chemotherapy of ampicillin--a new broad-spectrum penicillin.
AB  == the pharmacology and chemotherapy of a new penicillin, 6[d(-)-alpha-aminophenylacetamido] penicillanic acid, are described. it is non-toxic, is absorbed orally and is distributed throughout the body in a manner  similar to other penicillins. it is eliminated unchanged from the body in high concentrations in the bile and urine. almost all of the antibiotic can be accounted for in the urine and intestinal contents 2 hr after intramuscular administration but not after oral administration. it is concluded that the antibiotic is not metabolized within the body. studies with infected animals show that it is as effective as the existing oral penicillins against staphylococcus pyogenes smith (penicillin sensitive), streptococcus pyogenes group a and diplococcus pneumoniae. it is ineffective against penicillin-resistant staphylococci. when tested in mice infected with the gram-negative organisms, salmonella tryphimurium and klebsiella pneumoniae, it was considerably more active than tetracycline and chloramphenicol.
