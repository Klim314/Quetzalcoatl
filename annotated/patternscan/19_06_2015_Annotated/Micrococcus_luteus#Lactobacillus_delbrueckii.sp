TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  == a total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. for detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. lactobacillus sake lb790, listeria monocytogenes li6, staphylococcus aureus st44 and escherichia coli nrrl b-3704 were used as indicator organisms. strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against clostridium perfringens 4ttk, clostridium botulinum type a. 7948,  bacillus cereus nrrl b-3711, micrococcus luteus nrrl b-4376 and yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following:  19 lactobacillus plantarum, 4 l. curvatus, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 p. acidilactici, 2 l. pentosus, 2 l. sake, 1 l. delbrueckii, 1 l. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified lactobacillus spp. p. pentosaceus 416, p. acidilactici 413, 419 and  446, l. curvatus 348, l. plantarum 452 and 495, and lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
