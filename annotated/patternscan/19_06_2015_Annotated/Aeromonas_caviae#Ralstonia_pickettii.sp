TI  == comonomer compositional distribution, physical properties, and enzymatic degradability of bacterial poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxy-4-methylvalerate)  copolyesters.
AB  == poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxy-4-methylvalerate) (p(3hb-co-3h4mv)) was synthesized by using ralstonia eutropha strain phb(-)4 (pha-negative mutant) harboring with the n149s/d171g double mutation of pha synthase gene from aeromonas caviae (phac(ac) nsdg mutant) with 4-methylvaleric acid and fructose as the carbon sources. because the microbially synthesized p(3hb-co-3h4mv) samples were found to have broad comonomer compositional distribution, p(3hb-co-3h4mv) samples with 3h4mv content of 7, 11, and 35 mol % were fractionated into several  fractions with different comonomer composition ranging from 2 to 47 mol % by using a chloroform/n-hexane mixture. it was confirmed that a series of well-fractionated p(3hb-co-3h4mv) samples had a statistically random distribution. physical properties and structure of the fractionated p(3hb-co-3h4mv) random copolymers were investigated. both the melting temperature and glass-transition temperature of p(3hb-co-3h4mv) copolymers decreased with an  increase in the 3h4mv composition. the degree of x-ray crystallinity of fractionated p(3hb-co-3h4mv) films decreased from 60 to 13% as the 3h4mv fraction increased from 0 to 39 mol %. enzymatic degradation test for fractionated p(3hb-co-3h4mv) films was carried out at 37 degrees c in the presence of phb depolymerase from ralstonia pickettii t1. the rates of enzymatic erosion markedly increased with an increase in the 3h4mv composition to reach the highest one at 7 mol % of 3h4mv, followed by a decrease in erosion rate.
