TI  == telavancin activity tested against gram-positive clinical isolates from european, russian and israeli hospitals (2011-2013) using a revised broth microdilution testing method: redefining the baseline activity of telavancin.
AB  == objectives: to reassess the activity of telavancin when tested against gram-positive clinical pathogens recovered from hospitalized patients in european and adjacent regions using a revised broth microdilution method. methods: 11 601  consecutive, non-duplicate isolates originating from 36 institutions among 18 countries recovered between 2011 and 2013 were tested for susceptibility using a  revised broth microdilution method for telavancin. interpretive telavancin breakpoints appropriate for the method were those recently approved by the fda and eucast, as available. results: telavancin (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) was equally potent against methicillin-susceptible ((mssa) and methicillin-resistant (mrsa) staphylococcus aureus. all enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to telavancin (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mg/l) and inhibited at the susceptibility breakpoint (i.e. </= 0.25 mg/l), except for vana-phenotype vancomycin-resistant isolates (telavancin mic, >1 mg/l). telavancin ( </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l) was active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium,  while higher mic values were obtained for vana strains. telavancin (both mic50 and mic90, </= 0.015 mg/l) was potent against streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic50/90, </= 0.015/0.06 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (mic50/90, </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l). conclusions: telavancin exhibited potent activity against this contemporary (2011-2013) collection of organisms, inhibiting indicated pathogens at or below the fda/eucast-approved breakpoints for susceptibility. vana-phenotype enterococci were less susceptible to telavancin, a feature observed using the previous testing method. these results redefine telavancin's activity against isolates from europe.

TI  == evaluation of regional antibiograms to monitor antimicrobial resistance in hampton roads, virginia.
AB  == we studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the hampton roads area, virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated  with eastern virginia medical school. the data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. staphylococcus aureus was the most common gram- positive and e. coli the  most common gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. overall 53% of s.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. there was a broad scatter of mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and mic of 4 mug/ml was reported in 2012. penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of streptococcus pneumoniae. vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of enterococcus faecium and 2%  of enterococcus faecalis respectively. acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant gram negative organism in the data compiled. among the escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( sxt) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. we found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of plectasin nz2114 in combination with cell wall targeting antibiotics against vana-type enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == antimicrobial peptide plectasin targeting bacterial cell wall precursor lipid ii  has been reported to be active against benzylpenicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae but less potent against vancomycin-resistant enterococci than their susceptible counterparts. the aim of this work was to test plectasin nz2114 in combination with cell wall targeting antibiotics on vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. the activity of antibiotic combinations was evaluated against vana-type vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis strain bm4110/pip816-1 by disk agar-induction, double-disk assay, determination of fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) index, and time-kill curve. the results indicated that plectasin nz2114 was synergistic in combination with teicoplanin, moenomycin, and dalbavancin but not with vancomycin, telavancin, penicillin g, bacitracin, ramoplanin, daptomycin, and fosfomycin. to gain an insight into the synergism, we tested other cell wall antibiotic combinations. interestingly, synergy was observed between teicoplanin or moenomycin and the majority of the antibiotics tested; however, vancomycin was only synergistic with penicillin g. other cell wall active antibiotics such as ramoplanin, bacitracin, and fosfomycin did not synergize. it appeared that most of the synergies observed involved inhibition of the transglycosylation step in peptidoglycan synthesis. these results suggest that teicoplanin, dalbavancin, vancomycin, and telavancin, although they all bind to the c-terminal d-ala-d-ala of lipid ii, might act on different stages of cell  wall synthesis.

TI  == [analysis of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in neonatal purulent meningitis].
AB  == objective: to study the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotics resistance of neonatal purulent meningitis in order to provide the guide for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. method: a retrospective review was performed and a total of 112 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis (male 64, female 58) were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit of yuying children's hospital of wenzhou medical university seen from january 1, 2004 to december 31, 2013. the clinical information including pathogenic bacterial distribution, drug sensitivity, head imageology and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. numeration data were shown in ratio and chi square test was applied for group comparison. result: among 112 cases, 46 were admitted from 2004 to 2008 and 66 from 2009 to 2013, 23 patients were preterm and 89 were term, 20 were early onset (occurring within 3 days of life) and 92 were late onset meningitis (occurring after 3 days of life). in 62 (55.4%) cases the pathogens were gram-positive bacteria and in 50 (44.6%) were gram-negative bacteria. the five most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (32 cases, 28.6%),  coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns, 20 cases, 17.9%), streptococcus (18 cases, 16.1%, streptococcus agalactiae 15 cases), enterococci (13 cases, 11.6%),  staphylococcus aureus (9 cases, 8.0%). comparison of pathogenic bacterial distribution between 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 showed that gram-positive bacteria accounted for more than 50% in both period. escherichia coli was the most common  bacterium, followed by streptococcus in last five years which was higher than the first five years (22.7% (15/66) vs. 6.5% (3/46), chi(2) = 5.278, p < 0.05). klebsiella pneumoniae was more common isolate in preterm infants than in term infants (13.0% (3/23) vs. 1.1% (1/89), chi(2) = 7.540, p < 0.05). streptococcus (most were streptococcus agalactiae) was the most common bacteria in early onset  meningitis and higher than those in late onset meningitis (35.0% (7/20) vs. 12.0% (11/92), chi(2) = 4.872, p < 0.05). drug sensitivity tests showed that all the gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive to linezolid. staphylococci were  resistant to penicillin, and most of them were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin and cefazolin; 77.8%of cns isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. no streptococcus and enterococcus faecalis was resistant to penicillin. none of enterococci was resistant to vancomycin. among the gram-negative bacterial isolates, more than 40% of escherichia coli were resistant to commonly used cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and all of them were sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone sulbactam and imipenem. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were all resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none of them was resistant to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. of the 112 patients, 69 were cured, 23 improved, 9 uncured and 11 died. there were 47 cases (42.0%) with poor prognosis, they had abnormal head imageology, severe complications and some cases died, 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients with meningitis caused by streptococcus died. conclusion:  escherichia coli, cns and streptococcus are the predominant pathogens responsible for neonatal purulent meningitis over the past ten years. there were increasing numbers of cases with streptococcus meningitis which are more common in early onset meningitis with adverse outcome, therefore careful attention should be paid in clinic. linezolid should be used as a new choice in intractable neonatal purulent meningitis cases caused by gram positive bacteria.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 leader surveillance program.
AB  == the 2013 leader surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the united states. a total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. the groups were staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. the mic90 value for each of the 6  pathogen groups was 1 mug/ml. susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was  99.83%. only 12 isolates (2 s. aureus, 3 staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 streptococcus sanguinis, 5 enterococcus faecium, and 1 enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). three of these (2 s. aureus and 1 e. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. the findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.

TI  == synthesis of silver nanoparticles using solanum trilobatum fruits extract and its antibacterial, cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer cell line mcf 7.
AB  == in the present study, we have synthesized silver nanoparticles by a simple and eco-friendly method using unripe fruits of solanum trilobatum. the aqueous silver ions when exposed to unripe fruits extract were reduced and stabilized over long  time resulting in biosynthesis of surface functionalized silver nanoparticles. the bio-reduced silver nanoparticles were characterized by uv-visible spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), scanning electron microscopy (sem), transmission electron microscopy (tem), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (edx) and x-ray diffraction (xrd). these biologically synthesized silver nanoparticles were tested for its antibacterial activity against few human pathogenic bacteria including gram-positive (streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. in addition, we also demonstrated anticancer activity of these nanoparticles in vitro against human breast cancer cell line (mcf 7) using mtt, nuclear morphology assay, western blot and rt-pcr expression. these results taken together show the  potential applications of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles using s. trilobatum fruits.

TI  == antibiotic resistance prevalence in routine bloodstream isolates from children's  hospitals varies substantially from adult surveillance data in europe.
AB  == background: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (amr) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing amr levels. it is unclear whether childhood amr patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult  patients. methods: resistance percentages of nonduplicate staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the antibiotic resistance and prescribing in european children (arpec) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network (ears-net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. in addition, resistance percentages were compared between arpec isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. results: resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for arpec isolates compared with ears-net. e. coli and k. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone  resistance percentages were substantially lower in arpec (13.4% and 17.9%) than in ears-net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in p. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in arpec, 19.3% in ears-net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in arpec and 20.5% in ears-net), and for s. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. for many gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. conclusions: age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.

AB  == the synthesized schiff base, 4-[(4-hydroxy-3-fluoro-5-methoxy-benzylidene)amino]-1,5-dimethyl-2-phenyl-1,2-dih ydro-pyrazol-3-one (i), has been characterized by (13)c nmr, (1)h nmr, 2d nmr ((1)h-(1)h cosy and (13)c apt), ft-ir, uv-vis and x-ray single-crystal techniques. molecular geometry of the compound i in the ground state, vibrational frequencies and chemical shift values have been calculated by using the density functional method (dft) with 6-311++g(d,p) basis set. the obtained results indicate that optimized geometry can well reflect the crystal structural parameters. the differences between experimental and calculated results of ft-ir  and nmr have supported the existence of intermolecular (o-hcdots, three dots, centeredo type) and intramolecular (c-hcdots, three dots, centeredo type) hydrogen bonds in the crystal structure. molecular electrostatic potential (mep), frontier molecular orbital analysis (homo-lumo) and electronic absorption spectra were carried out at b3lyp/6-311g++(d,p). homo-lumo electronic transition of 3.92ev is due to contribution of the bands the n-->pi *. the antimicrobial activity of the compound i was determined against the selected 11 bacteria and 8  fungi by microdilution broth assay with alamar blue. in vitro studies showed that the compound i has no antifungal effect for selected fungal isolates. however, the compound i shows remarkable antibacterial effect for the bacteria; streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and enterococcus faecalis.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using ethanolic petals extract of rosa indica and characterization of its antibacterial, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  == the present study was aimed at biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (agnps) using ethanolic extract of rose (rosa indica) petals and testing their potential antibacterial activity using selective human pathogenic microbes, anticancer activity using human colon adenocarcinoma cancer cell line hct 15 as well as anti-inflammatory activity using rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. the biologically synthesized agnps were also characterized by uv-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (sem), transmission electron microscopy (tem), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (edx) and x-ray diffraction (xrd). the characterized agnps showed an effective antibacterial activity against gram negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae) than gram positive (streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis) bacteria. mtt assay, analysis of nuclear morphology, mrna expression of bcl-2, bax and protein expression of caspase 3 as well as 9, indicated potential anticancer activity. in addition, green synthesized agnps also attenuated cytotoxicity, nuclear morphology and free radical generation (o2(-) and no) by rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. the results of our study show the potential green synthesis of silver nanoparticles in mitigating their toxicity while retaining their antibacterial activities.

TI  == bacteriocin protein bacl1 of enterococcus faecalis targets cell division loci and specifically recognizes l-ala2-cross-bridged peptidoglycan.
AB  == bacteriocin 41 (bac41) is produced from clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis and consists of two extracellular proteins, bacl1 and baca. we previously reported that bacl1 protein (595 amino acids, 64.5 kda) is a bacteriolytic peptidoglycan d-isoglutamyl-l-lysine endopeptidase that induces cell lysis of e. faecalis when an accessory factor, baca, is copresent. however,  the target of bacl1 remains unknown. in this study, we investigated the targeting specificity of bacl1. fluorescence microscopy analysis using fluorescent dye-conjugated recombinant protein demonstrated that bacl1 specifically localized at the cell division-associated site, including the equatorial ring, division septum, and nascent cell wall, on the cell surface of target e. faecalis cells. this specific targeting was dependent on the triple repeat of the sh3 domain located in the region from amino acid 329 to 590 of bacl1. repression of cell growth due to the stationary state of the growth phase or to treatment with bacteriostatic antibiotics rescued bacteria from the bacteriolytic activity of bacl1 and baca. the static growth state also abolished the binding and targeting  of bacl1 to the cell division-associated site. furthermore, the targeting of bacl1 was detectable among gram-positive bacteria with an l-ala-l-ala-cross-bridging peptidoglycan, including e. faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, or streptococcus pneumoniae, but not among bacteria with alternate peptidoglycan structures, such as enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus aureus, or listeria monocytogenes. these data suggest that bacl1 specifically targets the l-ala-l-ala-cross-bridged peptidoglycan and potentially  lyses the e. faecalis cells during cell division.

TI  == inspecting the potential physiological and biomedical value of 44 conserved uncharacterised proteins of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: the major gram-positive coccoid pathogens cause similar invasive diseases and show high rates of antimicrobial resistance. uncharacterised proteins shared by these organisms may be involved in virulence or be targets for antimicrobial therapy. results: forty four uncharacterised proteins from streptococcus pneumoniae with homologues in enterococcus faecalis and/or staphylococcus aureus were selected for analysis. these proteins showed differences in terms of sequence conservation and number of interacting partners. twenty eight of these proteins were monodomain proteins and 16 were modular, involving domain combinations and, in many cases, predicted unstructured regions. the genes coding for four of these 44 proteins were essential. genomic and structural studies showed one of the four essential genes to code for a promising antibacterial target. the strongest impact of gene removal was on monodomain proteins showing high sequence conservation and/or interactions with many other proteins. eleven out of 40 knockouts (one for each gene) showed growth delay and  10 knockouts presented a chaining phenotype. five of these chaining mutants showed a lack of putative dna-binding proteins. this suggest this phenotype results from a loss of overall transcription regulation. five knockouts showed defective autolysis in response to penicillin and vancomycin, and attenuated virulence in an animal model of sepsis. conclusions: uncharacterised proteins make up a reservoir of polypeptides of different physiological importance and biomedical potential. a promising antibacterial target was identified. five of the 44 examined proteins seemed to be virulence factors.

TI  == revised reference broth microdilution method for testing telavancin: effect on mic results and correlation with other testing methodologies.
AB  == the reference broth microdilution (bmd) antimicrobial susceptibility testing method for telavancin was revised to include dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) as a solvent and diluent for frozen-form panel preparation, following the clsi recommendations for water-insoluble agents. polysorbate 80 (p-80) was also added  to the test medium to minimize proven drug losses associated with binding to plastic surfaces. four hundred sixty-two gram-positive isolates, including a challenge set of organisms with reduced susceptibilities to comparator agents, were selected and tested using the revised method for telavancin, and the mic results were compared with those tested by the previously established method and  several sensititre dry-form bmd panel formulations. the revised method provided mic results 2- to 8-fold lower than the previous method when tested against staphylococci and enterococci, resulting in mic50 values of 0.03 to 0.06 mug/ml for staphylococci and 0.03 and 0.12 mug/ml for enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, respectively. less-significant mic decreases (1 to 2 log2  dilution steps) were observed when testing streptococci in broth supplemented with blood, which showed similar mic50 values for both methods. however, streptococcus pneumoniae had mic50 results of 0.008 and 0.03 mug/ml when tested by the revised and previous methods, respectively. highest essential agreement rates (>/=94.0%) were noted for one candidate dry-form panel formulation compared to the revised test. the revised bmd method provides lower mic results for telavancin, especially when tested against staphylococci and enterococci. this is secondary to the use of dmso for panel production and the presence of p-80, which ensure the proper telavancin testing concentration and result in a more accurate  mic determination. moreover, earlier studies where the previous method was applied underestimated the in vitro drug potency.

TI  == determination of kinetics and the crystal structure of a novel type 2 isopentenyl diphosphate: dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase from streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (idi) is a key enzyme in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway and is required for all organisms that synthesize isoprenoid metabolites from mevalonate. type 1 idi (idi-1) is a metalloprotein that is found in eukaryotes, whereas the type 2 isoform (idi-2) is a flavoenzyme found in bacteria that is completely absent from human. idi-2 from the pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae was recombinantly expressed in escherichia coli. steady-state kinetic studies of the enzyme indicated that fmnh2 (km =0.3 mum) bound before isopentenyl diphosphate (km =40 mum) in an ordered binding mechanism. an x-ray crystal structure at 1.4 a resolution was obtained for the holoenzyme in the closed conformation with a reduced flavin cofactor and two sulfate ions in the active site. these results helped to further approach the enzymatic mechanism of idi-2 and, thus, open new possibilities for the rational design of antibacterial compounds against sequence-similar and structure-related  pathogens such as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-lipl32-coupled gold nanoparticles for leptospira detection.
AB  == detection of antibody specific to leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. however, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. molecular techniques  are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. in this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to lipl32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic leptospira. this coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for leptospira detection. we demonstrated that the sensitivity of leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). there was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic leptospira, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group b, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. these data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to lipl32 could  be used for leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.

TI  == colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-s. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of streptococcus suis.
AB  == a rapid diagnosis kit that detects streptococcus suis (s. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ics) test was developed in this study. the ics test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pabs) against s. suis. the pabs were developed from rabbits immunised with s. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (cps). development of the pabs was investigated to establish their binding to cps and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ics test. the results of the ics optimisation revealed that the combinations of pab c-n1 and pab c-n2 had the  highest sensitivity to cps. the minimum limitation of ics sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) and a cps concentration of 0.05 microg. the assay time for detection of s. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. a cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae). the cross-reactivity of other serotypes in s. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. this study presents the first report of a development of an ics that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. the s. suis ics provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.

TI  == mechanism for transfer of transposon tn2010 carrying macrolide resistance genes in streptococcus pneumoniae and its effects on genome evolution.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to identify the mechanism responsible for the horizontal transfer of transposon tn2010 in streptococcus pneumoniae, and the genomic alterations introduced by the transfer process. methods: tn2010 was identified using pcr in 15 clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae with erythromycin resistance. s. pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis isolates were used as recipient cells in mating and transformation experiments to test the conjugative  transferability and transformability of tn2010. whole-genome sequencing was used  to assess the effects of the tn2010 transfer on recipient genomes. the biological cost of the horizontal acquisition of tn2010 and additional genomic changes was investigated by growth competition experiments. results: tn2010 was transformed at a frequency of 3 x 10(-7) transformants per cfu, whereas no transconjugants were detected using s. pneumoniae or e. faecalis as recipient cells. genome analysis showed that many other recombinations were scattered throughout the genome of the transformants in addition to transposon tn2010. the transformants demonstrated a negligible fitness cost compared with the wild-type strain. conclusions: tn2010 tended to be transferred by transformation rather than conjugation in s. pneumoniae, and the spread of tn2010 could have a profound effect on the evolution of the genome. the acquisition of tn2010 with negligible  fitness cost may facilitate spread of the transposon.

TI  == restriction of the conformational dynamics of the cyclic acyldepsipeptide antibiotics improves their antibacterial activity.
AB  == the cyclic acyldepsipeptide (adep) antibiotics are a new class of antibacterial agents that kill bacteria via a mechanism that is distinct from all clinically used drugs. these molecules bind and dysregulate the activity of the clpp peptidase. the potential of these antibiotics as antibacterial drugs has been enhanced by the elimination of pharmacological liabilities through medicinal chemistry efforts. here, we demonstrate that the adep conformation observed in the adep-clpp crystal structure is fortified by transannular hydrogen bonding and can be further stabilized by judicious replacement of constituent amino acids within the peptidolactone core structure with more conformationally constrained counterparts. evidence supporting constraint of the molecule into the bioactive conformer was obtained by measurements of deuterium-exchange kinetics of hydrogens that were proposed to be engaged in transannular hydrogen bonds. we show that the rigidified adep analogs bind and activate clpp at lower concentrations in vitro. remarkably, these compounds have up to 1200-fold enhanced antibacterial activity when compared to those with the peptidolactone core structure common to two adep natural products. this study compellingly demonstrates how rational modulation of conformational dynamics may be used to improve the bioactivities of natural products.

TI  == functional diversity of tandem substrate-binding domains in abc transporters from pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter glnpq is an essential uptake system for amino acids in gram-positive pathogens and related nonpathogenic bacteria. the transporter has tandem substrate-binding domains (sbds) fused to each transmembrane domain, giving rise to four sbds per functional transporter complex. we have determined the crystal structures and ligand-binding properties  of the sbds of glnpq from enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and lactococcus lactis. the tandem sbds differ in substrate specificity and affinity, allowing cells to efficiently accumulate different amino acids via a single abc transporter. the combined structural, functional, and thermodynamic analysis revealed the roles of individual residues in determining the substrate affinity.  we succeeded in converting a low-affinity sbd into a high-affinity receptor and vice versa. our data indicate that a small number of residues that reside in the  binding pocket constitute the major affinity determinants of the sbds.

TI  == direction of aminoacylated transfer rnas into antibiotic synthesis and peptidoglycan-mediated antibiotic resistance.
AB  == prokaryotic aminoacylated-transfer rnas often need to be efficiently segregated between translation and other cellular biosynthetic pathways. many clinically relevant bacteria, including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa direct some aminoacylated-trna species into peptidoglycan biosynthesis and/or membrane phospholipid modification. subsequent indirect peptidoglycan cross-linkage or change in membrane permeability is often a prerequisite for high-level antibiotic resistance. in streptomycetes, aminoacylated-trna species are used for antibiotic synthesis as well as antibiotic resistance. the direction of coding aminoacylated-trna molecules away from translation and into antibiotic resistance and synthesis pathways are discussed in this review.

TI  == lysins: the arrival of pathogen-directed anti-infectives.
AB  == lysins represent a novel class of anti-infectives derived from bacteriophage. lysins are bacterial cell-wall hydrolytic enzymes that selectively and rapidly kill (>/=3 log c.f.u. in 30 min) specific gram-positive bacteria providing a targeted therapeutic approach with minimal impact on unrelated commensal flora. the potential for bacterial resistance to lysins is considered low due to targeting of highly conserved peptidoglycan components. through cutting-edge genetic engineering, lysins can be assembled into large libraries of anti-infective agents tailored to any bacterium of interest including drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens such as meticillin- and vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. lysins can eliminate bacteria systemically and topically from mucosal surfaces and biofilms, as evidenced by experimental models of sepsis, endocarditis, pneumonia, meningitis, and nasopharyngeal, skin and vaginal decolonization. furthermore, lysins can act synergistically with antibiotics and, in the process, resensitize bacteria to non-susceptible antibiotics. clinical trials are being prepared to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of  lysins in humans.

TI  == volatile metabolites of pathogens: a systematic review.
AB  == ideally, invading bacteria are detected as early as possible in critically ill patients: the strain of morbific pathogens is identified rapidly, and antimicrobial sensitivity is known well before the start of new antimicrobial therapy. bacteria have a distinct metabolism, part of which results in the production of bacteria-specific volatile organic compounds (vocs), which might be used for diagnostic purposes. volatile metabolites can be investigated directly in exhaled air, allowing for noninvasive monitoring. the aim of this review is to provide an overview of vocs produced by the six most abundant and pathogenic bacteria in sepsis, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. such vocs could be used as biological markers in the diagnostic approach of critically ill patients. a systematic review of existing literature revealed 31 articles. all six bacteria of interest produce isopentanol, formaldehyde, methyl mercaptan, and trimethylamine. since humans do not produce these vocs, they could serve as biological markers for presence of these pathogens. the following volatile biomarkers were found for identification of specific strains: isovaleric acid and 2-methyl-butanal for staphylococcus aureus; 1-undecene, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptane, 2-butanone, 4-methyl-quinazoline, hydrogen cyanide, and methyl thiocyanide for pseudomonas aeruginosa; and methanol, pentanol, ethyl acetate, and indole for escherichia coli. notably, several factors that may effect voc production were not controlled for, including used culture media, bacterial growth phase, and genomic variation within bacterial strains. in conclusion, vocs produced by bacteria may serve as biological markers for their presence. goal-targeted studies should be performed to identify potential sets of volatile biological markers and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these markers in critically ill patients.

TI  == evaluation of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test for rapid detection of bacteria and resistance determinants.
AB  == rapid identification of pathogens from blood cultures can decrease lengths of stay and improve patient outcomes. we evaluated the accuracy of the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) nucleic acid test for investigational use only (nanosphere, inc., northbrook, il) for the identification of gram-positive bacteria from blood cultures. the detection of resistance genes (meca in staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and vana or vanb in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis) by the bc-gp assay also was assessed. a total of 186 positive blood cultures (in bact/alert fa bottles) with  gram-positive cocci observed with gram staining were analyzed using the bc-gp assay. the bc-gp results were compared with the identification and susceptibility profiles obtained with routine methods in the clinical laboratory. discordant results were arbitrated with additional biochemical, cefoxitin disk, and repeat bc-gp testing. the initial bc-gp organism identification was concordant with routine method results for 94.6% of the blood cultures. only 40% of the streptococcus pneumoniae identifications were correct. the detection of the meca  gene for 69 blood cultures with only s. aureus or s. epidermidis was concordant with susceptibility testing results. for 3 of 6 cultures with multiple staphylococcus spp., meca detection was reported but was correlated with oxacillin resistance in a species other than s. aureus or s. epidermidis. the detection of vana agreed with susceptibility testing results for 45 of 46 cultures with e. faecalis or e. faecium. comparison of the mean times to results  for each organism group showed that bc-gp results were available 31 to 42 h earlier than phenotypic identifications and 41 to 50 h earlier than susceptibility results.

TI  == cd137 expressed on neutrophils plays dual roles in antibacterial responses against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  == severe sepsis and septic shock caused mainly by bacterial infections are life-threatening conditions that urge the development of novel therapies. however, host responses to and pathophysiology of sepsis have not been clearly understood, which remains a major obstacle for the development of effective therapeutics. recently, we have shown that stimulation of a costimulatory molecule, cd137, enhanced survival of mice infected with the gram-positive (g(+)) intracellular bacterium listeria monocytogenes but decreased survival in a polymicrobial sepsis model. herein, we report that cd137 deficiency or blocking of cd137 signaling decreased antibacterial responses of mice infected with g(+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis) but increased these responses in mice infected with gram-negative (g(-)) bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium). consistent with these findings, stimulation of cd137 by administration of agonistic antibody enhanced responses against g(+) bacteria, whereas it decreased these responses against g(-) bacteria. neutrophils were responsible for cd137-mediated opposite roles in control of g(+) and g(-) bacterial infections. stimulation of cd137 enhanced activities of neutrophils against s. aureus but decreased these activities against e. coli, while cd137 blocking produced opposite results with the stimulation of cd137 in vivo and in vitro. furthermore, we found that combined signaling of cd137 and toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) induced synergistic production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6) by neutrophils, but combined signaling of cd137 and tlr4 did not. our data strongly suggest that cd137 may play a dual role in sepsis in association with tlrs.

TI  == infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  == the present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. the waste  was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in penang island, malaysia. the presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste  was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. the presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rdna analysis. in this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, lysinibacillus sphaericus, serratia marcescens, and staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. the present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or  either of the clinical wastes.

AB  == ethylcellulose microparticles containing metronidazole and propolis extractive solution were prepared and evaluated in vitro against periodontal pathogens. scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis, drug entrapment efficiency  and drug release of microparticles were determined. the antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of periodontal importance (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli). it was obtained particles with regular morphology, mean diameter of 1.23 microm, and entrapment efficiency for propolis and metronidazole were 91.41% and 22.23%, respectively. in vitro release studies of propolis and metronidazole from microparticles showed prolonged drug release and controlled by fickian diffusion. both propolis and metronidazole displayed activity against the tested strains. moreover, the results showed that the strains of e. faecalis, s. pyogenes and s.  mutans were more susceptible to the propolis and e. faecalis to the metronidazole. it was also observed that the amount of metronidazole to inhibit the microorganism strains in the physical mixture with propolis was smaller than  in the metronidazole alone, suggesting potentiation effect between propolis and metronidazole. these microparticles would be useful for developing intermediary or eventual dosage form to be administered into the periodontal pocket more easily and safely.

TI  == in vitro activity of telavancin and comparators against selected groups of gram-positive cocci.
AB  == telavancin is a novel, rapidly cidal, dual-action glycopeptide. this study examined its in vitro activity against relevant gram-positive pathogens, comprising 99 meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 40 meticillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), 79 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 45 enterococcus faecalis, 60 enterococcus faecium, 40 beta-haemolytic streptococci and 60 streptococcus pneumoniae. except with vana enterococci, telavancin mics were tightly clustered and unimodal. telavancin mics for staphylococci ranged from </=0.03 mg/l to 0.5mg/l, with no shift for mrsa or mssa in relation to vancomycin mic. nevertheless, and independently of species, cons with raised vancomycin mics had reduced susceptibility to telavancin, however this was much more marked for teicoplanin. modal telavancin mics were 0.5mg/l and </=0.03 mg/l for glycopeptide-susceptible e. faecalis and e. faecium, respectively, with no rise for vanb isolates, but ranges rose to 4-16 mg/l and 1-4 mg/l for vana isolates, respectively. streptococci were consistently susceptible, with mics of </=0.06 mg/l. telavancin mics by etest agreed within 1  doubling dilution with those found previously by bsac agar dilution in 96.2% of cases, although with slight bias towards lower values. in the few cases (13/345)  where telavancin mics by etest were >/=2 doubling dilutions different from those  by agar dilution, the etest value was always lower; this effect was greater for the other antibiotics tested. telavancin had excellent activity, except against enterococci with vana, with no erosion of this activity against mrsa with raised  vancomycin mics. mics by etest were nearly always within 1 dilution of those by bsac agar dilution.

TI  == novel carbapenem antibiotics for parenteral and oral applications: in vitro and in vivo activities of 2-aryl carbapenems and their pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals.
AB  == sm-295291 and sm-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such  as methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with mic(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. unlike tebipenem (mic(50), 8 mug/ml), sm-295291 and sm-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(50), >/=  128 mug/ml). the bactericidal activities of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. the therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. sm-295291 and sm-369926 showed intravenous  pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase i. sm-368589 and sm-375769, which are medoxomil esters of sm-295291 and sm-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral,  oral, and switch therapies.

TI  == rapid identification of gram-positive pathogens and their resistance genes from positive blood culture broth using a multiplex tandem rt-pcr assay.
AB  == the early initiation of targeted antibiotic therapy in patients with bacteraemia  and septic shock impacts favourably on outcomes. rapid methods are therefore increasingly employed for bacterial identification directly from positive blood culture bottles, but with variable success. we evaluated the performance of the gram positive 12 multiplex tandem pcr (mt-pcr) assay (ausdiagnostics; catalogue no. 6202, version 07) containing targets for the identification of staphylococci  including staphylococcus aureus, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci including enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and their common antibiotic resistance genes (meca, vana, vanb). a total of 673 aerobic and anaerobic blood culture broths demonstrating gram-positive cocci on microscopy were analysed in parallel with traditional phenotypic methods. amplification of the internal control was inhibited in 79/673 (11.7 %) samples; however, mt-pcr identification was in concordance with phenotypic identification to the genus level in 96.6 % (537/556) of the remaining monomicrobial specimens and to the species level, where applicable, in 100 % (172/172) of samples. mt-pcr identification for 94.7 % (36/38) of polymicrobial samples matched traditional phenotypic identification. meticillin and vancomycin susceptibility results determined by mt-pcr in blood culture broths demonstrated complete agreement with those determined by phenotypic methods in all 143 staphylococcus aureus isolates  and eight e. faecium isolates, respectively. gram-positive pathogens and their key antibiotic resistance markers were reliably identified with the mt-pcr assay  within 3 h of a positive blood culture result.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == the changing epidemiology of bacteraemias in europe: trends from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system.
AB  == we investigated bacteraemia trends for five major bacterial pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and determined how expanding antimicrobial resistance influenced the total burden of bacteraemias in europe. aetiological fractions of species and antibiotic phenotypes were extracted from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (earss) database for laboratories, which consistently reported between 2002 and 2008. trend analyses used generalized linear models. robustness of results was assessed by iterative analysis for different geographic regions. from 2002 to 2008, the overall number  of reports increased annually by 6.4% (95% confidence interval (ci) 6.2-6.5%), from 46 095 to 67 876. in the subset of laboratories providing denominator information, the overall incidence increased from 0.58/1000 patient-days to 0.90/1000 patient-days (7.2% per year; 95% ci 6.9-7.5%). the frequency of reported bacteraemia isolates of s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae increased moderately, while increase in e. coli and enterococcus faecium was more pronounced. bacteraemias caused by methicillin-resistant s. aureus increased until 2005 (7.6% per year; 95% ci 6.1-9.1%), and then decreased (-4.8% per year;  95% ci -6.1 to -3.5%), whereas the number attributable to methicillin-sensitive s. aureus increased continuously (3.4% per year; 95% ci 3.0-3.7). increasing rates of e. coli were mainly caused by antibiotic-resistant phenotypes. our data  suggest that the burden of bacterial bloodstream infection has been increasing for all species during earss surveillance. trends were mainly driven by resistant strains and clearly dissociated between resistant and susceptible isolates. it appears that infections with resistant clones add to rather than replace infections caused by susceptible bacteria. as a consequence, expansion of antibiotic resistance creates an additional strain on healthcare systems.

AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187  strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the  ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm), linezolid (lzd) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 microg/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. cefpirome, carbapenems, vcm, teicoplanin (teic), lzd and qpr/dpr had mic90s of <  or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of e. faecalis strains and 1.2% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate to lzd. 17.1% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr.  against all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm was under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity. carbapenems showed good activity against clostridiales, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp., but one strain of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. and so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting  continuously.

TI  == molecular basis for different levels of tet(m) expression in streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates.
AB  == seventy-four unrelated clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae harboring the tet(m) gene were studied. seven strains with low tetracycline (tc) mics (0.25 to 0.5 mug/ml) were found to harbor truncated tet(m) alleles that were inactivated by different frameshift mutations. in contrast, five strains bore deletions in the tet(m) promoter region, among which four displayed increased tc  mics (16 to 64 mug/ml). the same promoter mutations were detected in tc-resistant mutants selected in vitro from various susceptible strains. sequence analysis revealed that these deletions might impede the formation of the transcriptional attenuator located immediately upstream of tet(m). expression in enterococcus faecalis of a tet(m) reporter gene transcribed from these promoter mutants conferred a level of tc resistance similar to that observed in the parental s. pneumoniae strains. these results show that different levels of tc susceptibility found in clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae can be explained by frameshift mutations within tet(m) and by alterations of the upstream transcriptional attenuator.

TI  == the pava-like fibronectin-binding protein of enterococcus faecalis, efba, is important for virulence in a mouse model of ascending urinary tract infection.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis is an established nosocomial pathogen, yet the pathogenesis of enterococcal infections, particularly of urinary tract infections (utis), remains to be fully elucidated. fibronectin-binding proteins have been identified as potent adhesins in pathogenic gram-positive cocci. here, we characterized efba, which is encoded by the enterococcal orthologue of streptococcus pneumoniae pava. similar to pava, the anchorless efba protein was localized to the enterococcal cell outer surface and bound to immobilized human fibronectin. in addition to abrogated efba expression, deletion of the efba gene eliminated efba  from the cell surface and drastically reduced the enterococcal cell binding to immobilized fibronectin. the deltaefba deletion mutant was highly attenuated vs wild-type in a murine ascending uti model, consistent with an increased tropism for the kidney relative to the bladder. these results provide the first evidence  that efba of e. faecalis plays a role in utis, probably contributing to the pathogenesis in this site.

TI  == ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == ceftaroline fosamil is a cephalosporin antibacterial approved by the us food and  drug administration (fda) for use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). after intravenous administration, ceftaroline fosamil is rapidly converted to its bioactive metabolite, ceftaroline. ceftaroline has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including contemporary resistant gram-positive phenotypes, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. because of its unique spectrum of activity, the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) designated ceftaroline as a member of a new subclass of beta-lactam antimicrobials, cephalosporins with anti-mrsa activity. the activity of ceftaroline against s. aureus extends to heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates. ceftaroline has low  minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for all tested species of streptococci,  and has potent activity against s. pneumoniae isolates with varying degrees of penicillin resistance. the activity of ceftaroline is limited against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis. the in vitro activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens, but does not extend to bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, class b metallo-beta-lactamases or ampc cephalosporinases, or to most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline  fosamil has been studied for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi) and community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in phase iii randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre noninferiority clinical trials. two identical trials (canvas 1 and canvas 2) compared the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam in 1378 adults with csssi. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 91.6% in the ceftaroline fosamil group (pooled analysis) achieving clinical response compared with 92.7% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam  group (difference -1.1%, 95% ci -4.2, 2.0). an additional analysis evaluated clinical cure in a subgroup of patients who met the fda guidance definition of absssi at treatment day 3. clinical response, defined as cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever, was 74.0% in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared  with 66.2% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (treatment difference 7.8%, 95% ci 1.3, 14.0). clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in 1240 hospitalized adults with cap was compared with that of ceftriaxone in two additional phase iii trials (focus 1 and focus 2). of note, because ceftriaxone does not have activity against mrsa, patients with confirmed or suspected mrsa cap were excluded from the focus trials. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone, with 84.3% in the ceftaroline fosamil group achieving clinical cure  compared with 77.7% in the ceftriaxone group (difference 6.7%, 95% ci 1.6, 11.8). an additional analysis of the trials was conducted in patients with moderate to severe cap and at least one proven typical bacterial pathogen at baseline (i.e. cabp). day 4 clinical response rates were 69.5% for ceftaroline and 59.4% for ceftriaxone (difference 10.1%, 95% ci -0.6, 20.6). in the phase iii trials, adverse event rates were similar between groups. overall, ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin with excellent in vitro activity against resistant gram-positive pathogens, including mrsa, as well as many common gram-negative organisms. it is a welcome treatment option for absssi and cabp.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-positive pathogens in saudi arabia.
AB  == several species of gram-positive cocci are major nosocomial or community pathogens associated with morbidity and mortality. here, we review the antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens in saudi arabia. in the last decades, antimicrobial resistance has increased among staphylococcus aureus in the kingdom with a growing prevalence of both nosocomial and community methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) isolates. as yet, no vancomycin-resistant  mrsa have been reported, although isolates with reduced susceptibility to the drug have been noted. currently, the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant entrococci (vre) is low; however, vre has been described in the kingdom as well as enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolates with high-level resistance to penicillin, sulfamethoxazole, macrolides, tetracycline, and aminoglycosides. in recent decades, the prevalence and rate of penicillin resistance and non-susceptibility among streptococcus pneumoniae isolates have increased in saudi arabia. the organism remains, however, susceptible to other beta-lactams and to quinolones. on the other hand, resistance to co-trimoxazole and tetracyclines is high and resistance to macrolides is on the increase.

TI  == lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. however, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded  as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of gram positive pathogens, including strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. it is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting  a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.

TI  == gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. escherichia coli is the most common uti pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. in this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. a total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. overall escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). data stratification  according to both age and gender showed e. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom p. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was  shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). susceptibility of e. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as  follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). in conclusion,  both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining utis etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.

TI  == reproducible discrimination between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria using surface enhanced raman spectroscopy with infrared excitation.

TI  == sensitivities of major causative organisms isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis against various antibacterial agents: results of subanalysis based on the presence of menopause.
AB  == we investigated whether the presence of menopause influenced the species and distribution of causative bacteria isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis (the most common urinary tract infection), and we also investigated the sensitivity of the isolated species to antibacterial agents. using multivariate analysis, we also investigated risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant escherichia coli, because its frequency has increased and it  is now a clinical problem in japan. six hundred and thirty-four strains were isolated from 489 premenopausal patients (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.1 years). major causative bacteria detected were escherichia coli (65.0 %), enterococcus faecalis (12.0 %), streptococcus agalactiae (5.5 %), and klebsiella pneumoniae (1.6 %). from 501 postmenopausal patients (mean age 68.7 +/- 10.29 years), 657 strains were isolated, and the major causative bacteria detected were e. coli (61.5 %), e. faecalis (13.7 %), k. pneumoniae (5.2 %), and s. agalactiae (4.0 %). the sensitivities to fluoroquinolones (fqs) and cephems of e. coli isolated from premenopausal patients were both >/=90 %, while the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli isolated from postmenopausal patients were about 5 % lower. in regard to infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli (minimal inhibitory concentration of levofloxacin [lvfx] >/=4 mug/ml), significant risk factors were observed in patients with more than two episodes of cystitis within a year (p = 0.0002), patients to whom antibacterial agents were used previously for this episode of cystitis (p = 0.0175), and patients who had a history of fq administration within 1 month. although the species and distribution of causative bacteria of acute uncomplicated cystitis were the same regardless of the presence of menopause, the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli detected in postmenopausal patients were significantly lower than those in the premenopausal women. the major risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli were a history of fq administration and the morbidity of cystitis rather than the menopausal status. it was considered that taking an appropriate history including the morbidity of cystitis and history of fq administration, and the appropriate selection of an antibacterial agent, would be important when empirical therapy is required.

TI  == lif reduces mics of antibiotics against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is an ever-growing problem yet the development of new antibiotics has slowed to a trickle, giving rise to the use of combination therapy to eradicate infections. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined inhibitory effect of lithium fluoride (lif) and commonly used antimicrobials on the growth of the following bacteria: enterococcus faecalis, staphyloccoccus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, streptomycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, alone or combined with lif were performed by microdilution method. mics were determined visually following 18-20 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. we observed reduced mics of antibiotics associated with lif ranging from two-fold to sixteen-fold. the strongest decreases of mics observed were for streptomycin and erythromycin associated with lif against acinetobacter baumannii and streptococcus pneumoniae. an eight-fold reduction was recorded for streptomycin against s. pneumoniae whereas an eight-fold and a sixteen-fold reduction were obtained for erythromycin against a. baumannii and s. pneumoniae. this suggests that lif exhibits a synergistic effect with a wide range of antibiotics and is indicative of its potential as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy.

TI  == microbial spectrum and resistance patterns in endophthalmitis: a 21-year (1988-2008) review in northeast united states.
AB  == purpose: to study the microbial spectrum and antibacterial susceptibility of vitreous cultures in a tertiary referral center in northeast united states. methods: all vitreous samples sent to the microbiology laboratory at a tertiary referral center from january 1988 to december 2008 were included in the study. the distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of all isolates from culture-positive samples were compared across 3 equal time periods 1988-1994, 1995-2001, and 2002-2008. results: one hundred forty-three positive cultures, where 11.9% (n=17) were polymicrobial, yielded a total of 160 isolates that consisted of 80.6% (n=129) gram-positive isolates, 12.5% (n=20) gram-negative isolates, and 6.9% (n=11) fungal isolates. the most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons) (37.5%, n=60), viridans streptococcus (11.3%, n=18), and streptococcus pneumoniae (6.9%, n=11). other common gram-positive isolates include propionibacterium acnes (5.6%, n=9), other streptococcus species (4.4%, n=7), staphylococcus aureus (4.4%, n=7), and enterococcus faecalis (3.8%, n=6). the most common gram-negative isolates were klebsiella species (3.1%, n=5), moraxella species (3.1%, n=5), and haemophilus species (2.5%, n=4). vancomycin was effective against all cons, sta. aureus, viridans streptococcus, and e. faecalis tested, and all sta. aureus isolates were oxacillin sensitive. of all cons isolates, 83.3% during 1988-1994, 73.1% during 1995-2001, and 100% during 2002-2008 were resistant to at least 1 of the antibiotics tested in the study with the last time period showing an increase in  resistance (p=0.021, adjusted standard residual=2.0). cons showed a decreasing resistance over time to chloramphenicol and gentamicin (p=0.010, p=0.007, respectively) and an increase in resistance to penicillin and tetracycline during 2002-2008 (p=0.003, p=0.040, respectively). susceptibility to other antibiotics did not show significant dependence on time. conclusion: bacteria causing endophthalmitis showed variable resistance to antibiotics over time. the importance of adequately treating endophthalmitis in the setting of these resistance pattern changes stresses the importance of periodic evaluation of causative organisms to ensure appropriate empiric treatment.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of chinfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of chinfloxacin, a novel fluoroquinolone, in murine systemic and local infection models. methods: the efficacy of chinfloxacin in systemic infection was evaluated in a mouse peritonitis model using isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, n = 3), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 1), penicillin-intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp; n = 1), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp; n = 2), vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (vse; n = 1), vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis (vre; n = 2), escherichia coli (n = 3) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2). the local infections included mouse pulmonary infections caused by penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae (pssp; n = 1), prsp (n = 1) and k. pneumoniae (n = 2). results: in  the mouse systemic infection model, chinfloxacin demonstrated potent activity against mssa [50% effective dose (ed(50)) 2.28-4.15 mg/kg], mrsa (ed(50) 14.75 mg/kg), pisp (ed(50) 6.20 mg/kg), prsp (ed(50) 3.51-5.03 mg/kg), vse (ed(50) 25.02 mg/kg), vre (ed(50) 5.18-15.39 mg/kg), e. coli (ed(50) 1.25-1.90 mg/kg) and k. pneumoniae (ed(50) 2.92-8.28 mg/kg). the therapeutic efficacy of chinfloxacin  was generally similar to (p > 0.05) that of moxifloxacin, significantly higher (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05) than that of levofloxacin in gram-positive isolate infections (mssa, mrsa, pisp, prsp, vse and vre), and less than that of levofloxacin against e. coli and k. pneumoniae infections (p < 0.01). in the mouse pulmonary infection model, chinfloxacin showed potent activity towards s. pneumoniae (higher than levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and k. pneumoniae (lower than levofloxacin and similar to or higher than ciprofloxacin) infections. conclusions: the results validated the potent efficacy of chinfloxacin in vivo. the high efficacy of chinfloxacin in murine systemic and local infections warrants investigation of its clinical use.

AB  == the results comparison is made between pcr polymerase chain reaction techniques in real-time mode and cultural techniques of analysis of blood samples in patients with suspicion of bacteriemia during early postoperational period. from  september to december 2009 43 blood samples from 37 adult patients aged 59+9.2 years were analyzed on suspicion of bacteriemia. the blood samples for pcr analysis (septifast technique roche diagnostics, switzerland) were taken parallel to the inoculation. among 43 samples 20 (46.5%) were positive. the species structure of identified germs was as follows: enteroccocus faecalis - 2, klebsiella pneumonia - 2, enteroccocusfaecium - 1, pseudomonas aeruginosa - 2, coagulase negative staphilococcus - 11. all cases of seeding of coagulase negative staphilococcus were interpreted using pcr techniques as negative or contamination. in four cases a full matching of results of compared techniques was obtained. in cases when hemoculture was negative (n = 23) the pcr techniques  permitted to detect two positive results (staphilococcus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia). in three cases of positive hemoculture the pcr techniques brought negative result and at that in two cases the causative agents  (pseudomonas fluorescens and ralstonia mannitolilytica) were out of specter of pathogens detected by this method. the pcr techniques in real-time mode permit to reduce significantly time of pathogen investigation and to detect the false positive results conditioned by contamination. this techniques has to be applied  in parallel with cultural technique because only this approach provide a possibility to get the clinically needed data related to the sensitivity of causative agent to antibacterial preparations.

TI  == vancomycin tolerance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  == vancomycin, a glycopeptide antimicrobial agent, represents the last line of defence against a wide range of multi-resistant gram-positive pathogens such as enterococci, staphylococci and streptococci. however, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and staphylococci, along with vancomycin-tolerant clinical isolates,  are compromising the therapeutic efficacy of vancomycin. it is conceivable that tolerance may emerge during prolonged vancomycin use. it has not been until recently, however, that the molecular basis of this tolerance began to be understood. superoxide anions might be involved in the bactericidal activity of vancomycin in enterococci, and recent evidence suggests that the stringent response is partly responsible for vancomycin tolerance in enterococcus faecalis. the mechanism of vancomycin tolerance in staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus  pneumoniae is sometimes associated with a reduction of autolysin activity. vancomycin tolerance in s. aureus and s. pneumoniae also appears to be somehow related with the two-component regulatory systems linked to cell envelope stress, although the precise molecular regulatory pathways remain poorly defined.

TI  == synthesis, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of novel silver(i) tris(pyrazolyl)methanesulfonate and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphadamantane complexes.
AB  == five new silver(i) complexes of formulas [ag(tpms)] (1), [ag(tpms)(pph(3))] (2),  [ag(tpms)(pcy(3))] (3), [ag(pta)][bf(4)] (4), and [ag(tpms)(pta)] (5) {tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, pph(3) = triphenylphosphane, pcy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, pta = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)h, (13)c, and (31)p nmr, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms), and ir spectroscopic techniques. the single crystal x-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the tpms ligand acting in the n(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a n(2)o-coordination is found, with the so(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant  free pyrazolyl ring. features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. a detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. they were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29922), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), streptococcus pneumoniae (atcc  49619), streptococcus pyogenes (sf37), streptococcus sanguinis (sk36), streptococcus mutans (ua159), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), and the fungus candida albicans (atcc 24443). complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. interaction of ag  complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (eb) as a fluorescence probe of  dna. the decrease in the fluorescence of dna-eb system on addition of ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of dna-eb complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (a375) with an activity often higher than that of agno(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on dna, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > agno(3)>> 4.

TI  == synergistic and antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  == the effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains on tyramine (tyr) and also other biogenic amines (ba) production by eight common food-borne pathogen (fbp) in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (tdb) was investigated by using a rapid hplc method. significant differences were observed among the fbp strains in ammonia (amn) and  ba production apart from tryptamine, histamine (his) and spermine formation (p<0.05). salmonella paratyphi a was characterised as the main amine producer. lab had an important synergetic role in some ba production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria, although the effect of some lab strains on ba production was strain-dependent. lactococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. resulted in significantly higher tyr accumulation by aeromonas hydrophila and enterococcus faecalis in tdb. the presence of lactococcus and/or lactobacillus in tdb significantly increased his production by a. hydrophila, escherichia coli, ent. faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas his accumulation was significantly reduced by staphylococcus aureus, s. paratyphi a and listeria monocytogenes.

TI  == population biology of gram-positive pathogens: high-risk clones for dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == infections caused by multiresistant gram-positive bacteria represent a major health burden in the community as well as in hospitalized patients. staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are well-known pathogens of hospitalized patients, frequently linked with resistance  against multiple antibiotics, compromising effective therapy. streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes are important pathogens in the community and s. aureus has recently emerged as an important community-acquired pathogen. population genetic studies reveal that recombination prevails as a driving force  of genetic diversity in e. faecium, e. faecalis, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, and thus, these species are weakly clonal. although recombination has a relatively modest role driving the genetic variation of the core genome of s. aureus, the horizontal acquisition of resistance and virulence genes plays a key  role in the emergence of new clinically relevant clones in this species. in this  review, we discuss the population genetics of e. faecium, e. faecalis, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. aureus. knowledge of the population structure of these pathogens is not only highly relevant for (molecular) epidemiological research but also for identifying the genetic variation that underlies changes in clinical behaviour, to improve our understanding of the pathogenic behaviour of particular clones and to identify novel targets for vaccines or immunotherapy.

TI  == tn916-like genetic elements: a diverse group of modular mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria are responsible for morbidity and mortality in healthcare environments. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae can all exhibit clinically relevant multidrug resistance phenotypes due to acquired resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. it is possible that clinically relevant multidrug-resistant clostridium difficile strains will appear in the future, as the organism is adept at acquiring mobile genetic elements (plasmids and transposons). conjugative transposons of the tn916/tn1545 family, which carry major antibiotic resistance determinants, are transmissible between these different bacteria by a conjugative mechanism during which the elements are excised by a staggered cut from donor cells, converted to a circular form, transferred by cell-cell contact and inserted into recipient cells by a site-specific recombinase. the ability of these conjugative transposons to acquire additional, clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes importantly contributes to the emergence of multidrug resistance.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  == the rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. we have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (no-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. although the prior findings suggest that the no-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of no-np has yet to be fully elucidated. in the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a no-np against several gram-positive and -negative  clinical isolates. we found that the no-np were uniformly active against all of the streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. we concluded that the no-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.

AB  == mx-2401 is an expanded-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic selective for gram-positive bacteria that is a semisynthetic analog of the naturally occurring  lipopeptide amphomycin. it was active against enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus (vse), vana-, vanb-, and vanc-positive vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), linezolid- and quinupristin-dalfopristin-resistant isolates (mic(90) of 4 mug/ml), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) (mic(90) of 2 mug/ml), coagulase-negative staphylococci, including  methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse) (mic(90) of 2 mug/ml), and streptococcus spp. including viridans group streptococci, and penicillin-resistant, penicillin-sensitive, penicillin-intermediate and macrolide-resistant isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) of 2 mug/ml). mx-2401 demonstrated a dose-dependent postantibiotic effect varying from 1.5 to 2.4 h. furthermore, mx-2401 was rapidly bactericidal at 4 times the mic against s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis, with more than 99.9% reduction in viable bacterial attained at 4 and 24 h, respectively. the mics of mx-2401 against mrsa, mssa, vse, and vre strains serially exposed for 15 passages to sub- to supra-mics of mx-2401 remained within three dilutions of the original mic. in contrast to that of the lipopeptide daptomycin, the antibacterial activity of mx-2401 was not affected in vitro by the presence of lung surfactant, and mx-2401 was active in vivo in the bronchial-alveolar pneumonia mouse model, in which daptomycin failed to show any  activity. moreover, the activity of mx-2401 was not as strongly dependent on the  ca(2+) concentration as is the activity of daptomycin. in conclusion, mx-2401 is  a promising new-generation lipopeptide for the treatment of serious infections with gram-positive bacteria, including hospital-acquired pneumonia.

TI  == [trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in romania. experience of participation in earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system), 2002-2008].
AB  == earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial  resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and csf), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: s. aureus, e. coli, e. faecium/faecalis,  str. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae. romania reported data to earss since 2002 so far. though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for earss. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. this issue is related to the particular position of romania in the european  context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the  indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. during the 2002-2008 interval, romania reported to earss a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 s aureus, 369 e. coli, 128 streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 enterococcus spp.. 71 klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 pseudomonas aeruginosa. klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the  earss protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. it is difficult to describe trends, specially in enterococcus, streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in  invasive isolates is a real problem in romanian hospitals, like in other central, southern and south eastern european countries: more than 25% of s. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all  staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </=  0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus  pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the  broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == multistep resistance development studies of ceftaroline in gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  == ceftaroline, the active component of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a novel  broad-spectrum cephalosporin with bactericidal activity against gram-positive and -negative isolates. this study evaluated the potential for ceftaroline and comparator antibiotics to select for clones of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis with elevated mics.  s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes isolates in the present study were highly susceptible to ceftaroline (mic range, 0.004 to 0.25 mug/ml). no streptococcal strains yielded ceftaroline clones with increased mics (defined as an increase in mic of >4-fold) after 50 daily passages. ceftaroline mics for h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were 0.06 to 2 mug/ml for four strains and 8 mug/ml for a beta-lactamase-positive, efflux-positive h. influenzae with a mutation in l22. one h. influenzae clone with an increased ceftaroline mic (quinolone-resistant, beta-lactamase-positive) was recovered after 20 days. the ceftaroline mic for this isolate increased 16-fold, from 0.06 to 1 mug/ml. mics for s. aureus ranged  from 0.25 to 1 mug/ml. no s. aureus isolates tested with ceftaroline had clones with increased mic (>4-fold) after 50 passages. two e. faecalis isolates tested had ceftaroline mics increased from 1 to 8 mug/ml after 38 days and from 4 to 32  mug/ml after 41 days, respectively. the parental ceftaroline mic for the one k. pneumoniae extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative isolate tested was 0.5 mug/ml and did not change after 50 daily passages.

AB  == background: intermittent preventive treatment of malaria with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) is recommended for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in sub-saharan africa. increasing drug resistance necessitates the urgent evaluation of alternative drugs. currently, the most promising candidates  in clinical development are mefloquine and azithromycin. besides the anti-malarial activity, sp is also a potent antibiotic and incurs significant anti-microbial activity when given as iptp - though systematic clinical evaluation of this action is still lacking. methods: in this study, the intrinsic anti-bacterial activity of mefloquine and azithromycin was assessed in comparison to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine against bacterial pathogens with clinical importance in pregnancy in a standard microdilution assay. results: sp was highly active against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. all tested gram-positive bacteria, except enterococcus faecalis, were sensitive to azithromycin. additionally, azithromycin was active against neisseria gonorrhoeae. mefloquine showed good activity against pneumococci but lower in vitro action against all other tested pathogens. conclusion: these data indicate  important differences in the spectrum of anti-bacterial activity for the evaluated anti-malarial drugs. given the large scale use of iptp in africa, the need for prospective clinical trials evaluating the impact of antibiotic activity of anti-malarials on maternal and foetal health and on the risk of promoting specific drug resistance of bacterial pathogens is discussed.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of nemonoxacin, a novel non-fluorinated quinolone.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of nemonoxacin, a novel c8-methoxy non-fluorinated quinolone in murine systemic and local infection models. methods: the efficacy of nemonoxacin in systemic infections was evaluated in mouse peritonitis models using isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, n=1), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa, n=1), methicillin- and levofloxacin-resistant staphylococcus capitis (levofloxacin-resistant mrsc, n=1), penicillin-intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp, n=1), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp, n=2), enterococcus faecalis (n=2, including 1 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, vre) and escherichia coli (n=3). the local infections included mouse pulmonary infections caused by prsp (n=1), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1) and mouse ascending  urinary tract infection caused by e. coli (n=1). results: in the mouse systemic infection model, nemonoxacin demonstrated potent activity against mssa (ed(50) =2.08 mg/kg), mrsa (ed(50) =2.59 mg/kg), levofloxacin-resistant mrsc (ed(50) =2.52 mg/kg), pisp (ed(50) =5.47 mg/kg), prsp (ed(50) =3.68-5.28 mg/kg) and e. coli (ed(50) =3.13-5.28 mg/kg), and moderate activity towards e. faecalis infection (ed(50) =8.48-15.16 mg/kg). the therapeutic efficacy of nemonoxacin was significantly higher (p<0.01) than that of levofloxacin in infections caused by gram-positive isolates (mssa, mrsa, levofloxacin-resistant mrsc, pisp, prsp and e. faecalis), but less potent than that of levofloxacin against e. coli infection (p<0.01). nemonoxacin in vivo efficacy results with gram-positive isolates (2- to 5-fold ed(50) advantage over levofloxacin) are consistent with the mic data (4- to 16-fold mic advantage of nemonoxacin over levofloxacin). in the mouse pulmonary infection model, nemonoxacin showed potent activity towards prsp (higher than levofloxacin) and k. pneumoniae (lower than levofloxacin) infections. in the mouse ascending urinary tract infection model, nemonoxacin exhibited potent activity against e. coli infection (lower than levofloxacin). conclusions: the results validated the potent efficacy of nemonoxacin in vivo. the higher efficacy of nemonoxacin than of levofloxacin towards infections caused by gram-positive cocci (especially mrsa, levofloxacin-resistant mrsc, prsp and vre) warrants investigation of its clinical use.

AB  == promoter-probe and terminator-probe plasmid vectors make possible to rapidly examine whether particular sequences function as promoter or terminator signals in various genetic backgrounds and under diverse environmental stimuli. at present, such plasmid-based genetic tools are very scarce in the gram-positive pathogenic bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. hence, we developed novel promoter-probe and terminator-probe vectors based on the streptococcus agalactiae pmv158 plasmid, which replicates autonomously in numerous gram-positive bacteria. as reporter gene, a gfp allele encoding a variant of the green fluorescent protein was used. these genetic tools were shown to be suitable to assess the activity of promoters and terminators (both homologous and heterologous) in s. pneumoniae and e. faecalis. in addition, the promoter-probe vector was shown to be a valuable tool for the analysis of regulated promoters in vivo, such as the promoter of the pneumococcal fuculose kinase gene. these new plasmid vectors will be very useful for the experimental verification of predicted promoter and terminator sequences, as well as for the construction of new inducible-expression vectors. given the promiscuity exhibited by the pmv158 replicon, these vectors could be used in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == standardized comparison of antiseptic efficacy of triclosan, pvp-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide and chlorhexidine digluconate.
AB  == background: this study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial  efficacy of the antiseptics pvp-iodine, triclosan, chlorhexidine, octenidine and  polyhexanide used for pre-surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, wounds and mucous membranes based on internationally accepted standards. methods: mics and mbcs were determined in accordance with din 58940-7 and 58940-8 using staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus), streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, haemophilus influenzae and candida albicans. the microbicidal efficacy was determined in accordance with din en 1040 and 1275 using s. aureus,  p. aeruginosa and c. albicans. results: for chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide, mic(48) and mbc(24) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/l. maximum values for triclosan ranged from 256 to 512 mg/l, with an efficacy gap against p. aeruginosa, while the maximum values of pvp-iodine were 1024 mg/l, with a gap against s. pneumoniae. comparing the minimal effective concentrations, octenidine was most effective. after 1 min, only octenidine and pvp-iodine fulfil the requirements for antiseptics. conclusions: tests under standardized and harmonized conditions help to choose the most efficacious agent. when a prolonged contact time is feasible, ranking of agents would be polyhexanide = octenidine >  chlorhexidine > triclosan > pvp-iodine. this is consistent with the recommendations for antisepsis of acute wounds. polyhexanide seems to be preferable for chronic wounds due to its higher tolerability. if an immediate effect is required, ranking would be octenidine = pvp-iodine>> polyhexanide > chlorhexidine > triclosan.

AB  == the tn916-like genetic element tn5251 is part of the composite conjugative transposon (ctn) tn5253 of streptococcus pneumoniae, a 64.5-kb chromosomal element originally called omega(cat-tet) bm6001. dna sequence analysis showed that tn5251 is 18 033-bp long and contains 22 orfs, 20 of which have the same direction of transcription. annotation was possible for 11 out of 22 orfs, including the tet(m) tetracycline resistance gene and int and xis involved in the integration/excision process. autonomous copies of tn5251 were generated during matings of tn5253-containing donors with s. pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. tn5251 was shown to integrate at different sites in the bacterial chromosome. it  behaves as a fully functional ctn capable of independent conjugal transfer to a variety of bacterial species including s. pneumoniae, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, e. faecalis and bacillus subtilis. the excision of tn5251 produces a circular intermediate and a deletion  in tn5253 at a level of 1.2 copies per 10(5) chromosomes.

TI  == [interpretive reading of the antibiogram in gram positive cocci].
AB  == resistance to methicillin in staphylococcus is related to the expression of the meca gene, and involves resistance to all beta-lactams, with the exception of the new cephalosporins, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. breakpoints for interpretation  of this mechanism differ in s. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. for macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins b, (mls(b)) the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump nora determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences in the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. strains of s. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (gisa strains) have been described, as well as highly-vancomycin-resistant isolates (vana isolates). in spain, there is a high percentage of s. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, due to mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. the most frequent phenotype of resistance to mls(b) in this species is caused by methylase production. resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is mainly related to mutations in parc/pare (low level) and in gyra. it is important to detect low level resistance due to its clinical implications. no strains of s. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. in spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in s. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. e. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to e. faecium. enterococci show intrinsic  low-level resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (high-level resistance) became resistant to the combination. glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in spain, but nosocomial outbreaks due to vana enterococci and case reports due to vanb2 enterococci have been recently reported.

TI  == abundance of type i toxin-antitoxin systems in bacteria: searches for new candidates and discovery of novel families.
AB  == small, hydrophobic proteins whose synthesis is repressed by small rnas (srnas), denoted type i toxin-antitoxin modules, were first discovered on plasmids where they regulate plasmid stability, but were subsequently found on a few bacterial chromosomes. we used exhaustive psi-blast and tblastn searches across 774 bacterial genomes to identify homologs of known type i toxins. these searches substantially expanded the collection of predicted type i toxins, revealed homology of the ldr and fst toxins, and suggested that type i toxin-antitoxin loci are not spread by horizontal gene transfer. to discover novel type i toxin-antitoxin systems, we developed a set of search parameters based on characteristics of known loci including the presence of tandem repeats and clusters of charged and bulky amino acids at the c-termini of short proteins containing predicted transmembrane regions. we detected srnas for three predicted toxins from enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, and showed  that two of the respective proteins indeed are toxic when overexpressed. we also  demonstrated that the local free-energy minima of rna folding can be used to detect the positions of the srna genes. our results suggest that type i toxin-antitoxin modules are much more widely distributed among bacteria than previously appreciated.

TI  == detecting related cases of bloodstream infections using time-interval distribution modelling.
AB  == an algorithm was designed to highlight related bloodstream infections using data  from a nosocomial infection surveillance system to help local public health authorities direct specific measures towards clusters of cases. the approach was  based on a two-step procedure. the first was a test to identify pathogens with an abnormal number of close cases. the second modelled, for the identified pathogens, the distribution of time intervals between successive cases as a mixture of two theoretical distributions in order to determine a threshold below  which a specific investigation is required. the algorithm was applied to bloodstream infection surveillance data collected during a 10-year period (1996-2005) in an 878-bed teaching hospital (24 wards) in lyon, france. the first step identified seven pathogens among the 18 being studied. the modelling succeeded in setting time thresholds to spot clusters of cases requiring further  investigation with defined sensitivity and specificity. setting the sensitivity level at 95%, the threshold values ranged from 24 days (acinetobacter baumannii)  to 294 days (enterobacter cloacae); the specificity was higher than 70% (up to 97.5% for a. baumannii) except for e. cloacae (52.1%). setting the specificity level at 95% resulted in a decrease in sensitivity except for a. baumannii (it reached nearly 100%); it fell below 50% for three pathogens: around 40% for streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis and 25% for enterobacter cloacae. the threshold values then ranged from 8 days (s. pneumoniae) to 67 days  (streptococcus pyogenes). the approach proved promising though further refinements are needed before routine use.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo properties of dihydrophthalazine antifolates, a novel family of antibacterial drugs.
AB  == racemic 2,4-diaminopyrimidine dihydrophthalazine derivatives bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 exhibited low in vitro mics toward small, selected panels of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae,  moraxella catarrhalis, and mycobacterium avium, though the compounds were less active against haemophilus influenzae. the constellation of dihydrofolate reductases (dhfrs) present in 20 enterococci and 40 staphylococci was analyzed and correlated with the antibacterial activities of the dihydrophthalazines and trimethoprim. dhfrs encoded by dfrb, dfra (s1 isozyme), dfre, and fola were susceptible to the dihydrophthalazines, whereas dhfrs encoded by dfrg (s3 isozyme) and dfrf were not. studies with the separated enantiomers of bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 revealed preferential inhibition of susceptible dhfrs  by the (r)-enantiomers. bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 were well tolerated by mice during 5- and 10-day oral toxicity studies at doses of up to 400 mg/kg of body weight. using a nonoptimized formulation, the dihydrophthalazines displayed acceptable oral bioavailabilities in mice, and efficacy studies with a septicemia model of mice infected with trimethoprim-resistant, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus gave 50% effective dose values in the range of 1.6 to 6.25 mg/kg.

TI  == ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssi), including those caused by meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and community-acquired pneumonia (cap). ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (pbp)2a, an mrsa-specific pbp that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. the high binding affinity of  ceftaroline to pbp2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/ml) correlates  well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for mrsa. ceftaroline is active in vitro against gram-positive cocci, including mrsa, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (not e. faecium). the broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or ampc-derepressed enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug)  is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. for multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/ml and 21.0 microg/ml for first and  last dose, respectively. ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 l/kg (28.3 l), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. no drug  accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through  renal excretion (49.6%). based on monte carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. a phase ii study randomized 100 patients with csssi to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. in a phase iii trial, 702 patients with csssi were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating csssi caused by both gram-positive and -negative pathogens. adverse event rates were similar between groups. ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is  consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for csssi and cap, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == combinatorial expression of bacterial whole mevalonate pathway for the production of beta-carotene in e. coli.
AB  == the increased synthesis of building blocks of ipp (isopentenyl diphosphate) and dmapp (dimethylallyl diphosphate) through metabolic engineering is a way to enhance the production of carotenoids. using e. coli as a host, ipp and dmapp supply can be increased significantly through the introduction of foreign mva (mevalonate) pathway into it. the mva pathway is split into two parts with the top and bottom portions supplying mevalonate from acetyl-coa, and ipp and dmapp from mevalonate, respectively. the bottom portions of mva pathway from streptococcus pneumonia, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and saccharomyces cerevisiae were compared with exogenous  mevalonate supplementation for beta-carotene production in recombinant escherichia coli harboring beta-carotene synthesis genes. the e. coli harboring the bottom mva pathway of s. pneumoniae produced the highest amount of beta-carotene. the top portions of mva pathway were also compared and the top mva pathway of e. faecalis was found out to be the most efficient for mevalonate production in e. coli. the whole mva pathway was constructed by combining the bottom and top portions of mva pathway of s. pneumoniae and e. faecalis, respectively. the recombinant e. coli harboring the whole mva pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced high amount of beta-carotene even without  exogenous mevalonate supplementation. when comparing various e. coli strains - mg1655, dh5alpha, s17-1, xl1-blue and bl21 - the dh5alpha was found to be the best beta-carotene producer. using glycerol as the carbon source for beta-carotene production was found to be superior to glucose, galactose, xylose and maltose. the recombinant e. coli dh5alpha harboring the whole mva pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced beta-carotene of 465mg/l at glycerol concentration of 2% (w/v).

TI  == antimicrobial activity of doripenem tested against prevalent gram-positive pathogens: results from a global surveillance study (2003-2007).
AB  == doripenem is a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem recently approved in the united states for treatment of complicated urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections. although pronounced doripenem antimicrobial activity against various  gram-negative pathogens, including anaerobes, has been confirmed, limited information has been forthcoming on the activity of this agent against leading gram-positive species. we evaluated the activity of doripenem using reference broth microdilution procedures against a large collection of staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci collected as part of a global (north america, 43.0%; latin america, 11.7%; europe, 31.3%; and asia-pacific, 14.0%) doripenem surveillance program for the years 2003 to 2007. doripenem was confirmed to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (22 389 isolates) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2444 isolates; mic(90) values, <or=0.06 microg/ml), with no differences noted between geographic regions. against enterococcus faecalis (8714 isolates), doripenem displayed modest activity (mic(50), 4 microg/ml) but was largely inactive against enterococcus faecium (4233 isolates). although not currently approved for treatment of respiratory tract infections in the united states, doripenem was highly active against streptococcus pneumoniae (10 260 isolates; mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml) and 2-fold more active than either ceftriaxone or cefepime. doripenem activity was even more noteworthy against beta-hemolytic streptococci (4598 isolates; mic(90), <or=0.06 microg/ml, similar to that of penicillin) and viridans group streptococci (1887 isolates; mic(90), 0.25 microg/ml). doripenem appears broadly  active in vitro against gram-positive pathogens, a potency similar to that of other carbapenems, a distinct advantage that complements other attributes including beta-lactamase and dehydropeptidase stability and activity against emerging multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == what's new and not so new on the antimicrobial horizon?
AB  == despite increasing antimicrobial resistance and multiple drug resistance in clinical isolates of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, there are few novel antimicrobial agents in development. the few new agents that have been recently licensed have tended to have narrow spectra of activity, focused on gram-positive pathogens, especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). this situation is rightly causing concern among clinicians and public health authorities worldwide. this article reviews available data on three new antibacterials currently in development. the cephalosporin ceftobiprole is active against mrsa, enterococcus faecalis and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, but otherwise has a spectrum of activity similar to that of other recent cephalosporins. in a clinical trial, ceftobiprole was non-inferior to vancomycin for the treatment of mrsa-associated complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis). doripenem, a new carbapenem, has some activity against mrsa, but otherwise has an anti-gram-positive spectrum of activity similar to that of imipenem and an anti-gram-negative spectrum similar to that of meropenem. in a clinical trial, it was non-inferior to meropenem for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections. iclaprim is a dihydrofolate  reductase inhibitor with greatly enhanced activity, as compared with trimethoprim, against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. the limited literature concerning this agent has concentrated on its potential role in the treatment of infections with gram-positive bacteria. a clinical trial has  demonstrated the non-inferiority of iclaprim, as compared with linezolid, in the  treatment of csssis, including those associated with mrsa.

TI  == lagging-strand dna replication origins are required for conjugal transfer of the  promiscuous plasmid pmv158.
AB  == the promiscuous streptococcal plasmid pmv158 is mobilizable by auxiliary plasmids and replicates by the rolling-circle mechanism in a variety of bacterial hosts. the plasmid has two lagging-strand origins, ssoa and ssou, involved in the conversion of single-stranded dna intermediates into double-stranded plasmid dna  during vegetative replication. transfer of the plasmid also would involve conversion of single-stranded dna molecules into double-stranded plasmid forms in the recipient cells by conjugative replication. to test whether lagging-strand origins played a role in horizontal transfer, pmv158 derivatives defective in one or in both sso's were constructed and tested for their ability to colonize new hosts by means of intra- and interspecies mobilization. whereas either sso supported transfer between strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, only plasmids that had an intact ssou could be efficiently mobilized from s. pneumoniae to enterococcus faecalis. thus, it appears that ssou is a critical factor for pmv158 promiscuity and that the presence of a functional sso plays an essential role in  plasmid transfer.

TI  == characterization of guanylate kinase from gram positive and gram negative microorganisms; preliminary results.
AB  == guanylate kinase is a member of the nucleoside monophosphate (nmp) kinase family, a family of enzymes that despite having a low primary structure identity share a  similar fold, which consists of three structurally distinct regions termed the core, lid, and nmp-binding regions. guanylate kinase (gmpk) is an essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of gtp and dgtp by catalyzing the phosphoryl transfer from atp to (d)gmp resulting in adp and (d)gdp. despite the similar fold of the monomer there is an important difference between gmpks from prokaryotes and eukaryotes: eukaryotes gmpk are monomers while prokaryotes gmpk are dimmers, tetramers or hexamers. for this reason bacterial gmpks are possible targets for new antibacterial drugs. finding new targets for antibacterial therapies is a prior subject in today's medical research. the purpose of this work was to characterize guanylate kinases from both gram positive and gram negative pathogenic bacteria. we started with gmpk from enterococcus faecalis as gram positive microorganism and pseudomonas aeruginosa as gram negative representative.

TI  == large-scale filter mating assay for intra- and inter-specific conjugal transfer of the promiscuous plasmid pmv158 in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == many conjugative or mobilizable plasmids from gram-positive bacteria can be transferred mainly on filter-based surfaces. such is the case of the streptococcal promiscuous plasmid pmv158 which can be mobilized by functions provided by auxiliary plasmids of the inc18 family. we have developed a new large scale method consisting of a 96-well microtiter plate coupled with a filter so that we could perform several mating assays between strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and between s. pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis cells. transfer was monitored by employment of a derivative plasmid from pmv158 tagged with the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein. several experimental conditions, like different ratios donor to recipient cells, could be tested, thus allowing us to perform multiple mating assays in a single experiment.

TI  == pharmacodynamic activity of the lantibiotic mu1140.
AB  == this study evaluated the pharmacodynamics of the lantibiotic mu1140 and the ability of selected organisms to develop resistance to this antibiotic. mu1140 demonstrated activity against all gram-positive organisms tested, including oxacillin- and vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vref). no activity was observed against gram-negative bacteria or yeast. time-kill studies revealed that mu1140 was rapidly bactericidal against streptococcus pneumoniae and multidrug-resistant s. aureus, whilst it was bacteriostatic against vref. in vitro resistance development to mu1140, tested by sequential subculturing in subinhibitory concentrations of mu1140, revealed a stable threefold increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for s. aureus and s. pneumoniae. subsequent subculturing of the strains with elevated mics in antibiotic-free media for 7 days did not result in a reduction of their mic values for mu1140. collectively,  our findings illustrate the therapeutic potential of mu1140 for management of gram-positive infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in greece.
AB  == a total of 10420 gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to  daptomycin. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by the broth microdilution method. daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against enterococcus faecalis (mic at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (mic50) =  1mg/l and mic at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (mic90) = 1.36 mg/l), enterococcus faecium (mic50 = 1.36 mg/l and mic90 = 1.90 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (mic50 = 0.12 mg/l and mic90 = 0.50mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50 = 0.09 mg/l and mic90 = 0.12 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic50 = 0.24 mg/l and mic90 = 0.5 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (mic50 = 0.50 mg/l and mic90 = 0.89 mg/l). resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. on the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic50 = 0.44 mg/l and mic90 = 0.78 mg/l) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic50 = 0.24 mg/l and mic90 = 0.44 mg/l); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an mic > 1mg/l, which is the clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. for all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.

TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) accelerates identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures.
AB  == sepsis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. rapid identification of blood culture isolates plays a crucial role in adequate antimicrobial therapy in sepsis patients. to accelerate microbiological diagnosis, a comprehensive panel of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) targeting gram-positive cocci was compiled and evaluated on 428 positive blood culture specimens. by combining genus-specific and species-specific probes, the assay allowed discrimination of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci as well as differentiation of therapy-relevant pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium/durans. furthermore, the newly designed fish probes strep2, enco and granu targeted streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis, enterococcus spp. (except e. faecalis) and granulicatella adiacens group, respectively. the fish assay achieved an overall sensitivity of 98.65% and a specificity of 99.0% and therefore allowed rapid and  reliable molecular identification of gram-positive cocci in blood culture specimens.

TI  == differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. there have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (nt), nonencapsulated pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. the use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. in this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between nt s. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cpnc) and other known typeable or  nt pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including pnc tigr4 and r6, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cpnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kda were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. additionally random forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cpnc isolates was tentatively identified. information gained from this  study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cpnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.

TI  == mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  == the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis),  11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and  cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7  microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against  l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.

TI  == novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases with broader substrate specificity.
AB  == in an effort to identify novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases (endo-alpha-galnacases), four potential genes were cloned. three of the expressed proteins engef from enterococcus faecalis, engpa from propionibacterium acnes, and engcp from clostridium perfringens were purified and characterized. their substrate specificity was investigated and compared to the commercially available endo-alpha-galnacases from streptococcus pneumoniae (engsp) and alcaligenes sp. (engal). all enzymes were incubated with various synthetic substrates, and natural glycoproteins and the released sugars were detected by colorimetric assay and thin layer chromatography analysis. the core 1 disaccharide gal beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was the most rapidly hydrolyzed substrate by all enzymes tested. engef exhibited the highest k(cat) for this substrate. engef and engpa were also able to fully hydrolyze the core 3 disaccharide glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp. this is the first report of endo-alpha-galnacases engef and engpa acting on core 3 in addition to core 1 o-glycans. interestingly, there were no significant differences in transglycosylation activities when gal beta 1,3galnac  alpha 1pnp or glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was incubated with various 1-alkanols in the presence of the endo-alpha-galnacases tested in this work.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as evaluated by broth microdilution and etest.
AB  == the current surveillance establishes the activity profile of tigecycline against  recent clinical u.s. isolates of target pathogens. findings from a distributed surveillance that utilized etest yielded a tigecycline activity profile that varied from that observed in a separate centralized broth microdilution (bmd) surveillance (d. c. draghi et al., poster d-0701, 46th intersci. conf. antimicrob. agents chemother., san francisco, ca). differences were noted among acinetobacter spp. and serratia marcescens and, to a lesser extent, with streptococcus pyogenes. to address whether these differences were due to discordance in testing methodology or to variations among the analyzed populations, isolates from the current surveillance were concurrently tested by bmd and etest. in all, 1,800 staphylococcus aureus, 259 s. pyogenes, 226 streptococcus pneumoniae, 93 enterococcus faecalis, 1,356 enterobacteriaceae, and 227 acinetobacter baumannii strains were evaluated. tigecycline had potent activity by bmd, with >99.6% susceptibility (%s) observed for all pathogens with  interpretive criteria, excluding enterobacter cloacae (98.3% s) and e. faecalis (86.0% s), and mic(90)s ranged from 0.03 mug/ml (s. pyogenes/s. pneumoniae) to 1  mug/ml (enterobacteriaceae/a. baumannii). similar profiles were observed by etest, with the exception of a. baumannii, although for most evaluated pathogens  etest mics trended one doubling-dilution higher than bmd mics. major or very major errors were infrequent, and a high degree of essential agreement was observed, excluding a. baumannii, s. marcescens, and s. pneumoniae, for which >/=4-fold differences in mics were observed for 29, 27.1, and 34% of the isolates, respectively. further analysis regarding the suitability of the tigecycline etest for testing s. marcescens, acinetobacter spp., and s. pneumoniae is warranted.

TI  == ceftobiprole: an extended-spectrum anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to summarize and evaluate the literature concerning ceftobiprole. data sources: literature identification was conducted through medline (1966-february 2008) and international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970-february 2008) using the terms ceftobiprole, medocaril, bal 5788, ro-5788, bal 9141, ro 63-9141, pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, mrsa, complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssis), community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia. additional publications were identified through a review of articles and abstracts from infectious disease meetings. study selection and data extraction: all articles in english were evaluated and all pertinent information was included. data synthesis: ceftobiprole medocaril is an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. inactivity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecium. preliminary data suggest that ceftobiprole may be effective with a 1-hour infusion of 500 mg every 12 hours for gram-positive infections and 500 mg every 8 hours with a 2-hour infusion for polymicrobial infections. two clinical trials support these dosing regimens for csssis. ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin in suspected gram-positive csssis, with cure rates of 93.3% and 93.5%, respectively. furthermore, ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin and ceftazidime in polymicrobial csssis (cure rates 90.5% vs 90.2%, respectively). although the total number of adverse effects was similar to those of the comparator, more patients in the ceftobiprole group experienced nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia. conclusions: the  activity of ceftobiprole and limited clinical data suggest that it may be useful  as empiric monotherapy for csssi and in combination with other antimicrobials in  lower respiratory tract infections for which phase 3 clinical trials are currently exploring. although not shown in vitro, ceftobiprole may induce resistance due to its broad spectrum of activity. approval is expected for the treatment of csssi.

AB  == from 1911 outpatients, who addressed a timisoara private clinical laboratory, from january to december 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. sensitivity testing to  antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion kirby-bauer method and the automatic analyzer osiris, also. the main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by enterobacteriaceae, head of the  list being escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and proteus mirabilis (3.02%). we also isolated gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), streptococcus agalactiae, and also gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). as soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them  in resistance phenotypes: most of the enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. an e. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). as for staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a k (nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase  only. antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians,  healthcare managers, and policymakers. the use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2005-2006).
AB  == ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for  broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested  against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and  < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae,  beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at <  or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were  inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against  enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold  more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa  may be prevalent.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of dx-619, a novel des-f (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in china.
AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of dx-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in china. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of antimicrobials were determined by a clsi recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs)  were examined by the broth dilution method. time-kill curves against representative isolates of staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. dx-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant gram-positive cocci. the mic(90)s of dx-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. the mic(90)s of dx-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. the mic(90)s of dx-619 against enterobacteriaceae (except for escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/l, which were comparable to other comparators. mbcs and time-kill curves showed that dx-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. there was no significant inoculum effect on mics. but the activities of dx-619 against s. aureus, k. pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic ph and  human serum. dx-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including gram-positive cocci, such as s. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.

TI  == linezolid in children: recent patents and advances.
AB  == linezolid is the first approved member of a new generation of antibiotics, the synthetic oxazolidinones, to become available, with a broad spectrum of in vitro  activity against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. it has an excellent bioavailability both intravenously and orally and a very good safety profile both in adults and in children. with regards to its antimicrobial action, linezolid has a predominantly bacteriostatic action, rather than a bacteriocidal effect and is active against gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. linezolid is currently showing great promise for the treatment of multi-resistant gram-positive infections, both in the community and in a hospital setting. clinical indications so far include skin and soft tissue infections, community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia due to mrsa, vre bacteremia and community-acquired pneumonia due to penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. we anticipate that this new generation of antimicrobial agents will provide adequate cover in the future for infections that cause significant treatment failures so far, such as vre- associated endocarditis, bone and joint multi-drug resistant infections and possibly central nervous system infections, both in adult and children populations. some patents on linezolid are also discussed in this review.

TI  == crystal structure of the ydjc-family protein tthb029 from thermus thermophilus hb8: structural relationship with peptidoglycan n-acetylglucosamine deacetylase.
AB  == the ydjc-family protein is widely distributed, from human to bacteria, but so far no three-dimensional structure and functional analysis of this family of proteins has been reported. we determined the three-dimensional structure of the ydjc homolog tthb029 at a resolution of 2.9a. the overall structure of the monomer consists of (betaalpha)-barrel fold forming a homodimer. asp21, his60, and his127 residues coordinate to mg(2+) as a possible active site. tthb029 shows structural similarity to the peptidoglycan n-acetylglucosamine deacetylase from streptococcus pneumoniae (sppgda). the active site groove of sppgda includes the  zn(2+) coordinated to asp276, his326, and his330. despite the low sequence identity, metal-binding residues of asp-his-his were conserved among the two enzymes. there were definitive differences, however, in that one of the histidines of the metal-binding site was substituted for the other histidine located on the other loop. moreover, these important metal-binding residues and the residues of the presumed active site are fully conserved in ydjc-family protein.

TI  == inhibitory effect of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  == objectives: to determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several gram-negative  and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. methods: the in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against h. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. time-kill assay was performed with two staphylococcus spp. strains. results: anti-h. pylori activity was detected with saccharomyces cerevisiae, bacillus spp., 1 enterococcus faecium and 2 lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 h. pylori strains tested. all staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-h. pylori effect: one staphylococcus auricularis and two staphylococcus epidermidis against all h. pylori tested; staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hominis and s. auricularis against six, five and seven h. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative staphylococcus against one h. pylori strain. an inhibitory effect was detected with one escherichia coli against one h. pylori. klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four h. pylori strains, and enterobacter cloacae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14  h. pylori isolates. no anti-h. pylori activity was detected with one lactobacillus spp., two lactococcus lactis, four streptococcus spp., one bacillus cereus, one e. faecium, one enterococcus faecalis, one e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two staphylococcus spp. strains tested. conclusions: several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit h. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of rwj-54428 against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model.
AB  == rwj-54428 (also known as mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with promising activity against gram-positive bacteria. the pharmacodynamics (pds) of rwj-54428  against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis were studied in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model. the rwj-54428 mics ranged from 0.25 to 1 mg/liter. mice with ca. 10(6) cfu/thigh at the initiation of therapy were treated intraperitoneally with rwj-54428 at doses that ranged from 3 to 1,200 mg/kg of body weight/day (in 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 divided doses) for 24 h. the maximal reductions in bacterial counts in thigh tissues at 24 h for the methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, and e. faecalis strains were -2.8, -3.8, and -1.7 log10 cfu/thigh, respectively.  the percentage of a 24-h dosing interval that the unbound serum rwj-54428 concentrations exceeded the mic (ft>mic) was the pharmacokinetic (pk)-pd parameter that best described the efficacy of rwj-54428. the ft>mics for a bacteriostatic effect (no net change in the numbers of cfu/thigh over 24 h) ranged from 14 to 20% for staphylococci and streptococci; for maximal reductions  in the numbers of cfu/thigh, the ft>mics ranged from 22 to 36% for these strains. for e. faecalis, the ranges of ft>mics for static and maximal effects were 30 to  46% and 55 to 60%, respectively. these data show that treatment with rwj-54428 results in marked antibacterial effects in vivo, with the pk-pd parameters for efficacy being comparable to those for the efficacy of penicillins and carbapenems active against staphylococci and pneumococci.

TI  == postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections: an unsolved problem in  thoracic surgery.
AB  == background: antibiotics currently recommended for prophylaxis in thoracic surgery are first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins. despite this prophylaxis, postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections remains frequent and severe. however, in the medical literature, the origin of these infections is poorly documented. methods: to evaluate the efficiency of current prophylactic regimens, we retrospectively analyzed 312 consecutive cases of major pulmonary resection, performed between january 2000 and december 2004. for patients who experienced postoperative pulmonary infection, the microbiologic agents and their antibiotic susceptibility were studied. results: a postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed in 76 patients (24.4% +/- 0.43%). sixty patients (78.9%)  experienced the infection in the first 5 postoperative days. a microbiologic documentation was obtained in 44 cases (57.9%) with 56 microorganisms involved. pathogens responsible for the infections were staphylococcus aureus (n = 10), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 8), group b streptococcus organisms (n = 1), nongroupable streptococcus organisms (n = 2), enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), haemophilus spp. (n = 9), branhamella catarrhalis (n = 2), enterobacteriaceae (n  = 15), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), and candida spp. (n = 4). according to the antibiotic susceptibility testings, the prophylactic regimen by cefazolin proved ineffective for 84% of the microbiologically documented cases. conclusions: this study confirmed the inefficiency of current prophylaxis against pathogens involved in postoperative pneumonia after major lung resections. evaluation of new and more-adapted approaches of antibiotic prophylaxis should be the subject of prospective multicenter trials.

TI  == isolation and characterization of unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == unsaturated fatty acid (ufa) biosynthesis is essential for the maintenance of membrane structure and function in many groups of anaerobic bacteria. like escherichia coli, the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae produces straight-chain saturated fatty acids (sfa) and monounsaturated fatty acids. in e. coli ufa synthesis requires the action of two gene products, the essential isomerase/dehydratase encoded by faba and an elongation condensing enzyme encoded by fabb. s. pneumoniae lacks both genes and instead employs a single enzyme with  only an isomerase function encoded by the fabm gene. in this paper we report the  construction and characterization of an s. pneumoniae 708 fabm mutant. this mutant failed to grow in complex medium, and the defect was overcome by addition  of ufas to the growth medium. s. pneumoniae fabm mutants did not produce detectable levels of monounsaturated fatty acids as determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and thin-layer chromatography analysis of the radiolabeled phospholipids. we also demonstrate that a fabm null mutant of the cariogenic organism streptococcus mutants is a ufa auxotroph, indicating that fabm is the only enzyme involved in the control of membrane fluidity in streptococci. finally we report that the fabn gene of enterococcus faecalis, coding for a dehydratase/isomerase, complements the growth of s. pneumoniae fabm  mutants. taken together, these results suggest that fabm is a potential target for chemotherapeutic agents against streptococci and that s. pneumoniae ufa auxotrophs could help identify novel genes encoding enzymes involved in ufa biosynthesis.

AB  == we evaluated the usefulness of an early-harvested bacterial cell suspension to the fully automated raisus (nissui pharmaceuticals co., ltd., tokyo) to provide the results of species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testings within a day after overnight-incubation of the primary cultures. a single, well-separated colony appeared on the primary culture plate was transferred onto  a blood agar or chocolate agar plates, then incubated for 3 to 6 hours. the cell  suspension to the raisus was properly prepared to the mcfarland 0.5 turbidity from the early-harvested bacterial cells. when the five atcc reference strains, consisting of staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, escherichia coli atcc 25922 and pseudomonas  aeruginosa atcc 27853, were repeatedly tested for the species-identification, all the identification results were acceptable. antimicrobial susceptibility tests were evaluated with the above five strains and haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247. the results obtained indicated that the most susceptibility test results were comparable to those mics obtained by the standard test procedure, but some strains, in particular, h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa gave significantly discrepant mics for certain antimicrobial agents. the significant discrepancy in  mic determinations regarded the difference of viable cell concentrations in the cell suspension prepared respectively. through the analysis of laboratory workflow, it became to apparent that 18s to 20s of the tests were completed by 5:00 p.m., and it required to wait until 3:00 a.m. to complete 90s of the tests.  with these results, the early-harvested bacterial cell suspension is applicable to species-identification by raisus, but it is necessary to adjust viable cell concentrations to antimicrobial susceptibility test. also, it is urgent to reconstitute a daily workflow to improve the rapidity of raisus test function.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis constitutes an unusual bacterial model in lysozyme resistance.
AB  == lysozyme is an important and widespread compound of the host constitutive defense system, and it is assumed that enterococcus faecalis is one of the few bacteria that are almost completely lysozyme resistant. on the basis of the sequence analysis of the whole genome of e. faecalis v583 strain, we identified two genes  that are potentially involved in lysozyme resistance, ef_0783 and ef_1843. protein products of these two genes share significant homology with staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan o-acetyltransferase (oata) and streptococcus  pneumoniae n-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (pgda), respectively. in order to determine whether ef_0783 and ef_1843 are involved in lysozyme resistance, we constructed their corresponding mutants and a double mutant. the deltaef_0783 mutant and deltaef_0783 deltaef_1843 double mutant were shown to be more sensitive to lysozyme than the parental e. faecalis jh2-2 strain and deltaef_1843 mutant were. however, compared to other bacteria, such as listeria monocytogenes  or s. pneumoniae, the tolerance of deltaef_0783 and deltaef_0783 deltaef_1843 mutants towards lysozyme remains very high. peptidoglycan structure analysis showed that ef_0783 modifies the peptidoglycan by o acetylation of n-acetyl muramic acid, while the ef_1843 deletion has no obvious effect on peptidoglycan structure under the same conditions. moreover, the ef_0783 and ef_1843 deletions  seem to significantly affect the ability of e. faecalis to survive within murine  macrophages. in all, while ef_0783 is currently involved in the lysozyme resistance of e. faecalis, peptidoglycan o acetylation and de-n-acetylation are not the main mechanisms conferring high levels of lysozyme resistance to e. faecalis.

TI  == qsar studies on benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as inhibitors of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase iii.
AB  == fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for most of the bacterial survival. components of this biosynthetic pathway have been identified as attractive targets for the development of new antibacterial agents. fabh, beta-ketoacyl-acp  synthase iii, is a attractive target since it is central to the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis. quantitative structure-activity relationship (qsar) studies have been carried out on a series of benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as potent inhibitors of fabh and antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis,  neisseria meningitidis and escherichia coli, which demonstrate fabh inhibitory activity in cell free and whole cell system. the qsar studies revealed that inhibitory activity increases with increase in hydrophobicity, molar refractivity, aromaticity, and presence of oh group (on x position of the nucleus). on the other side presence of hetero-atoms like n, o, or s at r(1) position of the nucleus decreases the inhibitory activity. the comparison of qsar between the fabh inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, n. meningitidis also demonstrates that the hydrophobicity, aromaticity and presence of oh group (on x  position of the nucleus) are conducive for the inhibitory activity.

TI  == factors influencing broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility test results for dalbavancin, a new glycopeptide agent.
AB  == performance of antimicrobial susceptibility tests with new agents requires careful consideration of the properties of the antimicrobial to ensure that the tests are standardized, reproducible, and reflect the true potency of the drug. dalbavancin is a new glycopeptide with potent activity against gram-positive bacterial species. the investigations described here demonstrated that methodologic modifications of procedures are necessary to ensure consistent test  results, both for quality control and for routine testing of clinical isolates. dimethyl sulfoxide is the preferred primary solvent. the addition of 0.002% polysorbate-80 (a surfactant) to dalbavancin-containing wells in the reference broth microdilution assay resulted in consistent and reproducible mic results for three quality control strains: staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, and streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619. the same degree of  consistency was observed among clinical isolates of gram-positive bacterial species tested in several clinical laboratories. these results indicate that the  addition of 0.002% (final concentration) of the surfactant in broth microdilution tests produces optimal dalbavancin mics required for accurate and reproducible clinical laboratory tests, without untoward influences of substrate binding or media constituents.

TI  == characterization and mechanistic studies of type ii isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase from staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the recently identified type ii isopentenyl diphosphate (ipp):dimethylallyl diphosphate (dmapp) isomerase (idi-2) is a flavoenzyme that requires fmn and nad(p)h for activity. idi-2 is an essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids in several pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis, and thus is considered as a  potential new drug target to battle bacterial infections. one notable feature of  the idi-2 reaction is that there is no net change in redox state between the substrate (ipp) and product (dmapp), indicating that the fmn cofactor must start  and finish each catalytic cycle in the same redox state. here, we report the characterization and initial mechanistic studies of the s. aureus idi-2. the steady-state kinetic analyses under aerobic and anaerobic conditions show that fmn must be reduced to be catalytically active and the overall idi-2 reaction is  o2-sensitive. interestingly, our results demonstrate that nadph is needed only in catalytic amounts to activate the enzyme for multiple turnovers of ipp to dmapp.  the hydride transfer from nad(p)h to reduce fmn is determined to be pro-s stereospecific. photoreduction and oxidation-reduction potential studies reveal that the s. aureus idi-2 can stabilize significant amounts of the neutral fmn semiquinone. in addition, reconstitution of apo-idi-2 with 5-deazafmn resulted in a dead enzyme, whereas reconstitution with 1-deazafmn led to the full recovery of enzyme activity. taken together, these studies appear to support a catalytic mechanism in which the reduced flavin coenzyme mediates a single electron transfer to and from the ipp substrate during catalysis.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) against bacteria with defined resistance mechanisms and phenotypes.
AB  == background: ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an n-phosphono prodrug. we investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. methods: mics were determined by clsi agar dilution, but with varied inocula. mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. results: mics for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were 0.5-2 mg/l, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible s. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/l, respectively. even with 2% nacl added, all mrsa were susceptible at 2 mg/l. mics for enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/l; e. faecium was resistant. mics for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., morganella morganii and proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/l versus 0.12-1 mg/l for enterobacter, serratia and citrobacter  spp. and 2-8 mg/l for acinetobacter spp. mics rose to 1-2 mg/l for many enterobacteriaceae with classical tem beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), hyperproduced ampc or k1 enzymes. mics for strains with classical tem/shv beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with esbls. resistance due to class a beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. geometric mean mics were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised mics for beta-lactamase-positive moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. ceftaroline selected ampc-derepressed enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected esbl variants of blatem in e. coli. resistance selection was not seen with s. aureus, h. influenzae or pneumococci. conclusions: ceftaroline has impressive anti-mrsa and anti-pneumococcal activity. slight lability to classical tem and shv beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible  with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by esbls. resistance selection occurred with enterobacteriaceae, not mrsa.

TI  == drug susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of streptococci and enterococci  by the phoenix automated microbiology system.
AB  == background: drug resistance is an emerging problem among streptococcal and enterococcal species. automated diagnostic systems for species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) have become recently available. we evaluated drug susceptibility of clinical isolates of streptococci and enterococci using the recent phoenix system (bd, sparks, md). diagnostic tools included the new smic/id-2 panel for streptococci, and the pmic/id-14 for enterococci. two-hundred and fifty isolates have been investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 65), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 50), viridans group streptococci (n = 32), enterococcus faecium (n = 40), enterococcus faecalis (n = 43), other catalase-negative cocci (n = 20). when needed, species id was determined using molecular methods. test bacterial strains were chosen among those carrying clinically-relevant resistance determinants (penicillin, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides). ast results of the phoenix system were compared to minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values measured by the etest method (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). results: streptococci: essential agreement (ea) and categorical agreement (ca) were 91.9% and 98.8%, respectively. major (me) and minor errors (me) accounted for 0.1% and 1.1% of isolates, respectively. no very major errors (vme) were produced. enterococci: ea was 97%,  ca 96%. small numbers of vme (0.9%), me (1.4%) and me (2.8%) were obtained. overall, ea and ca rates for most drugs were above 90% for both genera. a few vme were found: a) teicoplanin and high-level streptomycin for e. faecalis, b) high-level gentamicin for e. faecium. the mean time to results (+/- sd) was 11.8  +/- 0.9 h, with minor differences between streptococci and enterococci. conclusion: the phoenix system emerged as an effective tool for quantitative ast. panels based on dilution tests provided rapid and accurate mic values with regard to clinically-relevant streptococcal and enterococcal species.

TI  == comparative in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline compound, in freshly prepared medium and quality control.
AB  == the in vitro spectra of activity of tigecycline and tetracycline were determined  for 2,490 bacterial isolates representing 50 different species or phenotypic groups. all isolates were tested simultaneously by broth microdilution using freshly prepared mueller-hinton broth and by disk diffusion. portions of these data were submitted to the food and drug administration (fda) in support of the sponsor's application for new drug approval. in a separate study, mic and disk diffusion quality control ranges were determined. the tigecycline mics at which 50%/90% of bacteria were inhibited were (in microg/ml) as follows: for streptococcus spp., 0.06/0.12; for moraxella catarrhalis, 0.06/0.12; for staphylococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for enterococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for listeria monocytogenes, 0.12/0.12; for neisseria meningitidis, 0.12/0.25; for haemophilus  spp., 0.25/0.5; for enterobacteriaceae, 0.05/2.0; for non-enterobacteriaceae, 0.5/8.0. tigecycline was consistently more potent than tetracycline against all species studied. the data from this study confirm the fda-approved mic and disk diffusion breakpoints for tigecycline for streptococcus spp. other than streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, and enterobacteriaceae. provisional breakpoints for haemophilus spp. and s. pneumoniae are proposed based on the data from this study. the following mic and/or disk diffusion quality control ranges are proposed: staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml; s. aureus atcc 25923, 20 to 25 mm; escherichia coli atcc 25922, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml and  20 to 27 mm; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, 9 to 13 mm, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, 0.03 to 0.12 microg/ml; s. pneumoniae atcc 49619, 0.015 to 0.12 microg/ml and 23 to 29 mm; haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247, 0.06 to 0.5 microg/ml and 23 to 31 mm; and neisseria gonorrhoeae atcc 49226, 30 to 40 mm.

TI  == in-vitro profile of a new beta-lactam, ceftobiprole, with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in-vitro activity against common gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. it forms a stable inhibitory complex with staphylococcus aureus penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 2' (2a), resulting in enhanced activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). in recent studies of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, the ceftobiprole  mic(90) value was most frequently < or =1.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.25-1.0 mg/l). for mrsa, mic(90) values were generally 2.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.06-4.0 mg/l). mics for all streptococcal species, except penicillin-resistant streptococcus viridans but including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ranged from < or =0.008 to 2.0 mg/l. ceftobiprole is active against enterococcus faecalis (mic(90) = 4 mg/l), but not generally active against enterococcus faecium (mic(90) > 16 mg/l). ceftobiprole displayed bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogens comparable to that of cefepime, ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam in early studies. however, recent data show activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of cefepime but less than that of  ceftazidime. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is stable in the presence of most class a non-extended spectrum beta-lactamases and inducible class c beta-lactamases. ceftobiprole is a poor inducer of ampc beta-lactamase and a poor substrate for hydrolysis by ampc beta-lactamase. studies of ceftobiprole in several animal models have demonstrated potent in-vivo efficacy against infections caused by mrsa, including strains intermediately resistant to vancomycin. it was also efficacious in murine infections caused by gram-negative bacteria with mic values < or =2 mg/l. the broad spectrum of activity demonstrated by ceftobiprole in vitro and in vivo suggests that it may have potential for empirical treatment of  suspected gram-negative and gram-positive infections, including those caused by mrsa.

TI  == new tn916-related elements causing erm(b)-mediated erythromycin resistance in tetracycline-susceptible pneumococci.
AB  == objectives: to analyse the as yet unexplored genetic elements encoding erm(b)-mediated erythromycin resistance in tetracycline-susceptible pneumococci.  methods: sixteen streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates sharing erm(b)-mediated erythromycin resistance and susceptibility to tetracycline were used. gene detection was performed by pcr using both established and specially designed primers. s. pneumoniae r6, streptococcus pyogenes 12rf and enterococcus  faecalis jh2-2 were used as recipients in mating experiments. results: of the 16  test strains, 14 bore an unexpressed tet(m) gene which in 13 strains had a genetic linkage with erm(b). three isolates yielded a 3.2 kb and 10 an 11.9 kb erm(b)/tet(m) amplicon. the former three showed genetic organizations similar to  that of the composite element tn3872, where the erm(b)-carrying tn917 transposon  is inserted into a tn916-like element. of the latter 10 isolates, 9 showed genetic organizations substantially overlapping with that of tn6002, a newly sequenced erm(b)-containing tn916-related transposon. the tenth isolate carried a novel composite element (designated tn6003) resulting from the insertion into a tn6002-like transposon of a fragment [designated macrolide-aminoglycoside-streptothricin (mas) element] containing a second erm(b) (lacking the stop codon) and a variant of the aade-sat4-apha-3 cluster. the two tet(m)-negative isolates had different tn3872-related elements, one containing a  complete and one a deleted mas fragment. conjugative transfer was obtained from donors carrying tn6002-related elements, not from donors carrying tn3872-related  elements. conclusions: in tetracycline-susceptible pneumococci with erm(b)-mediated erythromycin resistance, the erm(b) gene is carried on a variety  of tn916-related genetic elements either lacking tet(m) or, more often, carrying  an unexpressed tet(m) gene.

TI  == synthesis and in vitro evaluation of substituted phenyl-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinones against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == with the incidence of linezolid-resistant enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and staphylococcus aureus, modification of linezolid at the 5- and/or 3-positions led to the development of a series of 3-(methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinone analogues. these compounds were tested in vitro against six gram-positive standard organisms (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. pneumoniae, s. albus, streptococcus enteridis and s. nonhemolyticus). 5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinones bearing fluorine at 3'-position of phenyl ring showed activities against several gram-positive bacteria (mic: 3.13-6.25 mug/ml). the position of methoxyl group on the phenyl ring of piperazine group affected antibacterial spectrum. 3-(4'- (para-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active against 5 gram-positive organisms except s. nonhemolyticus, whereas 3-(4'-(ortho-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active only against 2 gram-positive organisms, namely s.  albus, s. enteridis.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == reversal of resistance in microorganisms by help of non-antibiotics.
AB  == intracellular efflux pumps have been largely the research focus in multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms and parasites including cancers. however, drug efflux mechanisms other than pumps per se have been observed, supported by the effects of isomeric, non-antibiotic depressant (dpr), phenothiazines and thixenes, and antidepressant (adpr) phenylpiperidine neurotropic drugs, alone or in combination with classical antimicrobials on mdr staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. of the non-antibiotics we investigated, the dpr l-thioridazine, trans-clopenthixol and isomers of phenylpiperidines nnc 20-4962 (isomer of femoxetine) and nnc 20-7052 (isomer of paroxetine) were potent antimicrobials with the least neurotropic activity, pointing to a possible general isomeric structure-activity  relationship. these compounds may be regarded as new efflux inhibitors. moreover, these isomers have considerably reduced, in some cases absent, neurotropism and reduced mammalian toxicity. this may alleviate concerns about adverse effects and therapeutic safety for infected patients in life-threatening situations where the non-antibiotic dosage would be in the lower, non-chronic dosage ranges generally  prescribed for individuals with mild mental health problems. the results point to the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms' phospholipid/protein domain involvement of the cationic, amphiphilic, non-antibiotic dpr and adpr, with the phospholipids being the initial sites attracting and concentrating the neurotropes to induce a form of suspended animation, followed by gross changes of cell wall and membrane structure, and thereby potentiating their destructive or immobilizing effects on various as yet only hinted at resistance and efflux mechanisms. combination of appropriate isomeric non-antibiotic dpr and adpr of low neurotropism and toxicity with conventional and classical antimicrobials promises early, new therapeutic strategies salutary against microbial resistance, resistance development, pathogenicity and virulence.

AB  == notification of bacterial meningitis (bm) is likely to be incomplete, and a recent danish study indicated that unbalanced notification may bias expected aetiology of bm. therefore the danish bacterial meningitis group initiated a national registration of culture-positive bm. methods: laboratory data on all bacterial isolates from cerebrospinal fluid deemed to be clinically relevant were identified on a national basis during 2002 and 2003. bacterial findings were compared to cases notified during the same period. results: a total of 404 bm cases were identified. the distribution of bacterial species differed from the national notification data during the same period especially with respect to staphylococcus aureus (6.7% vs. 0.6%), escherichia coli (3.5% vs. 0%) and non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci (10% vs. 1.9%). the overall notification-rate was 66%, and was below 20% for s. aureus, e. coli, enterococcus faecalis, non-s. pneumoniae streptococci and for 13 cases of "other bacteria". sensitivity to antibiotics in the bm cases was as expected for northern europe. reduced sensitivity to penicillin was found in 2/202 s. pneumoniae, in 2/10 listeria monocytogenes, and 21/27 s. aureus were penicillin resistant. e. coli was resistant to ampicillin in 5 of 13 cases and to gentamicin in 1 of 11 cases.  discussion: a suboptimal notification rate with an unbalanced species distribution was found. laboratory based data thus constitute an improved basis for future recommendations for empirical treatment of bm. a continued national collaboration may promote the development of quality indicators for diagnosis and initial treatment of bm.

AB  == background: glycopeptide antibiotics are considered by many investigators to be the last resort in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections. objective: the aim of this review was to assess the place of glycopeptides in the treatment of common gram-positive bacteria in accordance with the current epidemiologic data in turkey. methods: a search of both the english- and turkish-language literature indexed on medline, ulakbim (turkey), and pleksus (turkey) was performed using the terms: vancomycin, teicoplanin, and glycopeptides, or their turkish-language counterparts. the complete texts of the  articles found in these databases were obtained from the electronic library of gulhane medical academy, ankara, turkey. articles from regional journals, without the support of an electronic format, were obtained by direct communication. articles of interest were those based on studies occurring in turkish populations, with special consideration given to publications in press after 2002. results: staphylococci were the most frequent gram-positive pathogens encountered in turkish hospitals. studies have found that approximately 74% of strains were staphylococcus aureus and the remaining strains were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons). overall methicillin resistance in staphylococci was reported as approximately 60%. in turkey, s aureus was one of the most common infectious agents found inside hospitals and is deemed a growing  threat in the community. while the rate of methicillin resistance in community-acquired isolates is approximately 4%, the data from hospitals suggest  that reduced resistance comprises most of the isolates. in the studies reviewed,  older quinolones like ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin seem to be ineffective in nearly half of the s aureus isolates. alternatives like rifampicin, gentamicin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx), clindamycin, and erythromycin have had substantial resistance profiles in >50% of the strains. in  recent turkish studies, in vitro profiles of linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin (qd), and daptomycin have had positive results. as in the s aureus isolates, resistance trends have been observed in the cons group of pathogens. the possible use of beta-lactams seems restricted, and alternative approaches have become necessary. quinolones, gentamicin, tetracycline, tmp/smx, clindamycin, and erythromycin have resistance profiles of >50%. although glycopeptide resistance was not detected, the frequency of heterogenous vancomycin-intermediate s aureus, a precursor to future resistance, was 13% in 1 study. current studies in turkey have found that enterococcus faecalis comprises three quarters of enterococci while the rest are comprised of enterococcus faecium. initial studies performed with linezolid, qd, and daptomycin suggest that these drugs might be effective alternatives for future enterococcal infections that may have high glycopeptide resistance. approximately 8% of the streptococcus pneumoniae strains had high-level resistance in turkey. however, 10 million units of crystallized penicillin or 3 g of oral amoxicillin maintains the optimum treatment of pneumococcal infections outside the central nervous system (cns). resistance profiles in third-generation cephalosporins in turkey range between 2% and 2.5%.  conclusions: in turkey, a review of the existing literature found that the current use of glycopeptides in pneumococcal infections is restricted to cns infections facing therapeutic failure in due course. however, the belief that these drugs are the last resort, either in staphylococcal or enterococcal infections, is no longer valid. if a patient has a critical status due to probable gram-positive microorganisms, clinicians should consider the empiric use of glycopeptides. however, new molecules such as linezolid, qd, and daptomycin, offered for use in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial diseases, should be reserved for the future, when glycopeptides eventually become obsolete.

TI  == exploring the antibacterial and hemolytic activity of shorter- and longer-chain beta-, alpha,beta-, and gamma-peptides, and of beta-peptides from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids bearing proteinogenic side chains--a survey.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of 31 different beta-, mixed alpha/beta-, and gamma-peptides, as well as of beta-peptides derived from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids were assayed against six pathogens (enterococcus  faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the results were compared with literature data. the interaction of these peptides with mammalian cells, as  modeled by measuring the hemolysis of human erythrocytes, was also investigated.  in addition to those peptides designed to fold into amphiphilic helical conformations with positive charges on one face of the helix, one new peptide with hemolytic activity was detected within the sample set. moreover, it was demonstrated that neither cationic peptides used for membrane translocation (beta3-oligoarginines), nor mixed alpha/beta- or gamma-peptides with somatostatin-mimicking activities display unwanted hemolytic activity.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant  enterococci.
AB  == tigecycline is a glycylcycline with promising broad-spectrum activity, including  resistant gram-positive organisms. this study characterizes in vitro activity of  tigecycline against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (qrsp), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre). an in vitro pharmacodynamic model generated specific bacterial kill profiles for tigecycline against clinical isolates of qrsp, mrsa and vre. tigecycline produced a 6.6 log total reduction and cleared qrsp from the pharmacodynamic model by 18 h. tigecycline and vancomycin were unable to achieve  3-log reductions in the mrsa and vre isolates; log reductions in mrsa and vre were 1.5 and 1.2 logs for tigecycline and 2.8 and zero for vancomycin, respectively. area under the concentration time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (auc/mic) values for tigecycline ranged from 79 to 158 microg h/ml  and tigecycline concentrations remained above the mic (t>mic) throughout the simulated dosing interval. tigecycline showed in vitro activity against the qrsp, mrsa and vre isolates studied. low mic values, prolonged elimination half-life and the associated post-antibiotic effect (pae) observed with tigecycline are desirable attributes that make it a potentially attractive option for treating resistant gram-positive organisms.

TI  == comparison of bactec plus blood culture media to bact/alert fa blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  == blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. this study compared the ability  of becton dickinson (sparks, md) bactec plus bottles and biomerieux (durham, nc)  bact/alert fa bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow.  each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. the organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, enterococcus  faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 cfu/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. overall, the bact/alert fa system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the bactec plus system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. both systems performed well in the detection of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. in the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover streptococcus pneumoniae. the ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. the results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the bact/alert system. for the bactec system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. under these simulated conditions, the bactec plus system was superior to the bact/alert fa system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.

TI  == dual targeting of gyrb and pare by a novel aminobenzimidazole class of antibacterial compounds.
AB  == a structure-guided drug design approach was used to optimize a novel series of aminobenzimidazoles that inhibit the essential atpase activities of bacterial dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv and that show potent activities against a variety of  bacterial pathogens. two such compounds, vrt-125853 and vrt-752586, were characterized for their target specificities and preferences in bacteria. in metabolite incorporation assays, vrt-125853 inhibited both dna and rna synthesis  but had little effect on protein synthesis. both compounds inhibited the maintenance of negative supercoils in plasmid dna in escherichia coli at the mic. sequencing of dna corresponding to the gyrb and pare atp-binding regions in vrt-125853- and vrt-752586-resistant mutants revealed that their primary target in staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae was gyrb, whereas in streptococcus pneumoniae it was pare. in enterococcus faecalis, the primary target of vrt-125853 was pare, whereas for vrt-752586 it was gyrb. dna transformation experiments with h. influenzae and s. aureus proved that the mutations observed in gyrb resulted in decreased susceptibilities to both compounds. novobiocin resistance-conferring mutations in s. aureus, h. influenzae, and s. pneumoniae were found in gyrb, and these mutants showed little or no cross-resistance to vrt-125853 or vrt-752586 and vice versa. furthermore, gyrb and pare double mutations increased the mics of vrt-125853 and vrt-752586 significantly, providing evidence of dual targeting. spontaneous frequencies of resistance to vrt-752586 were below detectable levels (<5.2x10(-10)) for wild-type e. faecalis but were significantly elevated for strains containing single and double target-based mutations, demonstrating that dual targeting confers low levels of resistance emergence and the maintenance of susceptibility  in vitro.

TI  == antimicrobial therapy of multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == antibiotic resistance among pneumococci, enterococci, and staphylococci has become increasingly important in recent decades. clinicians should be familiar with the nuances of antibiotic susceptibility testing and interpretation in selecting antibiotics for these infections. the clinical significance of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, macrolide-resistant s pneumoniae,  and multidrug-resistant s pneumoniae is discussed. the clinical spectrum and therapeutic approach to enterococcus faecalis (i.e., vancomycin-sensitive enterococci) and e faecium (i.e., vancomycin-resistant enterococci) are discussed. differences in therapeutic approach between methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) infections are reviewed. differences between in vitro susceptibility testing and in vivo effectiveness of antibiotics for hospital-acquired mrsa (ha-mrsa) are described.  finally, the clinical features of infection and therapy of ha-mrsa and community-acquired mrsa (ca-mrsa) infections are compared.

AB  == a nationwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted since 1997  in korea. in this study, susceptibility test data generated in 2004 by konsar group hospitals were analyzed and compared to those at a commercial laboratory. in hospitals, the rank orders of organisms in 2004 were identical to those in 2003. the most prevalent species was staphylococcus aureus (20.2%) in hospitals,  but escherichia coli (29.7%) in the commercial laboratory. the proportions of enterococcus faecium to all isolates of enterococcus faecalis plus e. faecium were 47.2% in hospitals and 24.9% in the commercial laboratory. the mean resistance rates of significant antimicrobial-organism combinations in hospitals  were: oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (68%), oxacillin-resistant (penicillin- nonsusceptible) streptococcus pneumoniae (68%), vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (25%), cefotaxime-resistant e. coli (14%), ceftazidime- and cefoxitin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (34% and 32%, respectively), and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 24%, respectively). in conclusion, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant k. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp.  and p. aeruginosa were prevalent in 2004. increasing trends were observed for vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, cefoxitin- resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae,  and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. certain antimicrobial- organism combinations were also prevalent among the commercial laboratory-tested strains.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of poland.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of poland in years 2003-2005. bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from california mastitis test (cmt) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of api tests (analytical profile index). it was found that 32.7% of samples that were cmt positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (cns) (14.6%), staph. aureus (8.6%), gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among gram-negative bacilli followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), serratia marcescens (3.1%), pasteurella multocida (3.1%), acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria  species. stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), staph. hyicus (12.2%), staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), staph. sciuri (11.6%), staph. chromogenes (8.8%), staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent cns. streptococcus uberis (50%), str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), str. acidominimus (6.6%) and enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among camp-negative streptococci. an increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, staph. aureus, a. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.

TI  == topoisomerase mutations and efflux are associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == to understand better the mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in enterococcus faecalis, fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants isolated from ent. faecalis atcc 29212 by stepwise selection with sparfloxacin (spx) and norfloxacin (nor) were analysed. the results showed the following. (i) in general, fluoroquinolone-resistance mechanisms in ent. faecalis are similar to those in other gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, namely, mutants with amino acid changes in both gyra and parc exhibited high fluoroquinolone resistance, and single gyra mutants and a single parc mutant were more resistant to spx and nor, respectively, than the parent strain, indicating that the primary targets of spx and nor in ent. faecalis are dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv, respectively. (ii) alterations in gyrb (deltakga, residues 395-397) and pare (glu-459 to lys) were associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in some mutants. moreover, the facts that the nor mic, but not the spx mic, decreased in the presence of multidrug efflux pump inhibitors, that nor accumulation decreased in the cells, and that the emea mrna  expression level did not change, strongly suggested that a nora-like efflux pump, rather than emea, was involved in resistance to nor.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in the southeastern mediterranean--preliminary results from the armed project.
AB  == sporadic reports from centres in the south and east of the mediterranean have suggested that the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in this region appears to  be considerable, yet pan-regional studies using comparable methodology have been  lacking in the past. susceptibility test results from invasive isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium and faecalis routinely recovered from clinical samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid within participating laboratories situated in algeria, cyprus, egypt, jordan, lebanon, malta, morocco, tunisia and turkey were collected as part of the armed project. preliminary data from the first two years of the project showed the prevalence of penicillin non-susceptibility in s. pneumoniae to range from 0% (malta) to 36% (algeria) [median: 29%] whilst methicillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus varied from 10% in lebanon to 65% in jordan [median: 43%]. significant country specific resistance in e. coli was also seen,  with 72% of isolates from egyptian hospitals reported to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins and 40% non-susceptible to fluoroquinolones in turkey.  vancomycin non-susceptibility was only reported in 0.9% of e. faecalis isolates from turkey and in 3.8% of e. faecium isolates from cyprus. the preliminary results from the armed project appear to support previous sporadic reports suggesting high antibiotic resistance in the mediterranean region. they suggest that this is particularly the case in the eastern mediterranean region where resistance in s. aureus and e. coli seems to be higher than that reported in the  other countries of the mediterranean.

AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

TI  == coenzyme q10 production in recombinant escherichia coli strains engineered with a heterologous decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene and foreign mevalonate pathway.
AB  == in the present work, escherichia coli dh5alpha was metabolically engineered for coq(10) production by the introduction of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene (ddsa) from agrobacterium tumefaciens. grown in 2ytg medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% nacl, and 0.5% glycerol) with an initial ph of 7, the recombinant e. coli was capable of coq(10) production up to 470 microg/gdcw (dry  cell weight). this value could be further elevated to 900 microg/gdcw simply by increasing the initial culture ph from 7 to 9. supplementation of 4-hydroxy benzoate did not improve the productivity any further. however, engineering of a  lower mevalonate semi-pathway so as to increase the isopentenyl diphosphate (ipp) supply of the recombinant strain using exogenous mevalonate efficiently increased the coq(10) production. lower mevalonate semi-pathways of staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested. among these, the pathway of streptococcus pneumoniae proved to be superior, yielding coq(10) production of 2,700+/-115 microg/gdcw when supplemented with exogenous mevalonate of 3 mm. in order to construct a complete mevalonate pathway, the upper semi-pathway of the same bacterium, streptococcus pneumoniae, was recruited. in a recombinant e. coli dh5alpha harboring three plasmids encoding for upper and lower mevalonate semi-pathways as well as ddsa enzyme, the heterologous mevalonate pathway could convert endogenous acetyl-coa to ipp, resulting in coq(10) production of up to 2,428+/-75 microg/gdcw, without mevalonate supplementation. in contrast, a whole  mevalonate pathway constructed in a single operon was found to be less efficient. however, it provided coq(10) production of up to 1,706+/-86 microg/gdcw, which was roughly 1.9 times higher than that obtained by ddsa alone.

AB  == the isoelectric points of many microbial cells lie within the ph range spanning from 1.5 to 4.5. in this work, we suggest a cief method for the separation of cells according to their isoelectric points in the ph range of 2-5. it includes the segmental injection of the sample pulse composed of the segment of the selected simple ampholytes, the segment of the bioanalytes and the segment of carrier ampholytes into fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycole). this polymer dissolved in the catholyte, in the anolyte and in the injected sample pulse was used for a prevention of the bioanalyte adsorption on the capillary surface and for the reduction of the electroosmotic flow. between each focusing run, the capillaries were washed with the mixture of  acetone/ethanol to achieve the reproducible and efficient cief. in order to trace of ph gradients, low-molecular-mass pi markers were used. the mixed cultures of microorganisms, escherichia coli ccm 3954, candida albicans ccm 8180, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, candida tropicalis, ccm 8223, proteus vulgaris, klebsiela pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus ccm 3953, streptococcus agalactiae ccm 6187, enterococcus faecalis ccm 4224 and staphylococcus epidermidis ccm 4418, were focused and separated by the cief method suggested here. this cief method enables the separation and detection of the microbes from the mixed cultures within several minutes. the minimum detectable number of microbial cells was less than 10(3).

TI  == dna microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  == a dna microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. a database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available dna sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with dna templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected dna templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(sa) in b. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == [antibiotic-resistance in italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project ar-iss].
AB  == the antibiotic resistance surveillance project ar-iss, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country.  the laboratories collect and transmit data to the istituto superiore di sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis/faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed escherichia coli. they also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study earss-italia and from other european countries. oxacillin resistance in s. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in europe (41,5%). no strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. in s. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several european countries. unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in e. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in europe. presumptive esbl production in gram-negative organisms can be  estimated at 20% in klebsiella and 1% in e. coli. ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in europe. in conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. although some activities of ar-iss  need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and  representative data about antibiotic resistance in italy that can be used for comparison at the european level.

TI  == in vitro characterization of the antibacterial spectrum of novel bacterial type ii topoisomerase inhibitors of the aminobenzimidazole class.
AB  == antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action are becoming increasingly important in the battle against bacterial resistance to all currently used classes of antibiotics. bacterial dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv (topoiv) are the familiar  targets of fluoroquinolone and coumarin antibiotics. here we present the characterization of two members of a new class of synthetic bacterial topoii atpase inhibitors: vrt-125853 and vrt-752586. these aminobenzimidazole compounds  were potent inhibitors of both dna gyrase and topoiv and had excellent antibacterial activities against a wide spectrum of problematic pathogens responsible for both nosocomial and community-acquired infections, including staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, and mycobacteria. consistent with the novelty of their structures and mechanisms of action, antibacterial potency was unaffected by commonly encountered resistance phenotypes, including fluoroquinolone resistance. in time-kill assays, vrt-125853 and vrt-752586 were bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and haemophilus influenzae, causing 3-log reductions in viable cells within 24 h. finally, similar to the fluoroquinolones, relatively low frequencies of spontaneous resistance to vrt-125853 and vrt-752586 were found, a property consistent with their in vitro dual-targeting activities.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, lbm415, tested against respiratory tract and cutaneous infection pathogens: a global surveillance report (2003-2004).
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the spectrum of activity and potency of lbm415, the first of the peptide deformylase inhibitor (pdfi) class to be developed for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (ussti), against a large, contemporary international collection of targeted pathogens collected during 2003-2004. methods: a total of  21,636 isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution methods as part of a longitudinal international antimicrobial resistance surveillance study. characteristics of the organism collection included resistance to oxacillin among 35.0% of staphylococcus aureus and 76.0% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons); resistance to penicillin (mic > or = 2 mg/l) among 18.0% of streptococcus pneumoniae; vancomycin resistance among 20.0% of enterococcus spp. and ampicillin resistance among 22.0% of haemophilus influenzae. results: lbm415 displayed potent activity against staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus faecium and moraxella catarrhalis, with > or = 99.0% of strains being inhibited at < or = 4 mg/l; 97.0% of enterococcus faecalis isolates and 92.0% of h. influenzae isolates were also inhibited at this concentration. seventy-seven percent of burkholderia  cepacia and 82.0% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia were inhibited at < or = 8 mg/l. no differences in lbm415 activity against s. aureus, cons, s. pneumoniae, enterococcus spp. and h. influenzae were detected for subsets susceptible or resistant to antimicrobials such as oxacillin, penicillin, ampicillin, macrolides, vancomycin and fluoroquinolones. while regional differences were apparent with some comparator agents, sensitivity to lbm415 did not vary significantly among strains from the various geographic areas sampled. one isolate of s. aureus displayed high-level resistance to lbm415 owing to multiple  sequence changes in resistance phenotype genes (defb and fmt), despite the absence of the compound in clinical practice. this isolate remained susceptible to all other antimicrobials tested except for penicillin. conclusions: with few differences detected among strains from various geographic regions, the first pdfi class agent to enter clinical development has consistently demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against commonly isolated pathogens associated with uncomplicated respiratory and cutaneous infections. these compounds represent a significant therapeutic advance owing to their novel mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum, including activity against resistant organisms, should pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters support their continued development. given the detection of a pre-existing pdfi-resistant isolate of s. aureus as demonstrated here, surveillance for resistance among the pdfi-targeted  pathogens following introduction of this class of agent into clinical usage will  be an important component of future studies.

TI  == activity of gatifloxacin tested against isolates from pediatric patients: report  from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (north america, 1998-2003).
AB  == the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program has monitored the activity of antimicrobial agents worldwide since 1997. the increasing number of clinical failures with established anti-infectives (penicillins, other beta-lactams, macrolides) among pediatric patients has stressed the importance for alternative  therapeutic options. ciprofloxacin has been recently approved for expanded use as treatment of complicated urinary tract infections in children, and gatifloxacin has been used successfully in clinical trials in selected children with severe or refractory otitis media. we evaluated the activity of gatifloxacin against strains isolated from children < 7 years of age and compared this to the general  patient population (all ages included) using the sentry program database. a total of 59826 north american isolates were collected, of which 4641 were from children (< 7 years old); all isolates were tested using reference broth microdilution methods. in contrast to the general population (gp), gatifloxacin resistance rates were very low among isolates from this younger patient group. gatifloxacin  susceptibility rates were > 84% for all pathogens evaluated in younger patients.  all streptococcus pneumoniae strains from children < 7 years old were susceptible to gatifloxacin, and susceptibility among the enterobacteriaceae species was > 98%. the greatest difference in susceptibility rates between the younger children and the gp was observed among nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (95.0-100% versus 64.8-83.7%, respectively) and enterococcus faecalis (94.7% versus 58.4%).  gatifloxacin susceptibilities of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. isolates from the pediatric population were > or = 95% (> 97% for ciprofloxacin)  compared to the gp at only 64.8-69.1%. in conclusion, gatifloxacin remains very active against bacterial isolates from children < 7 years, indicative of the limited exposure of this population to fluoroquinolones. continued resistance surveillance will be necessary to monitor the activity of the fluoroquinolone class as they are introduced for specific clinical indications into the pediatric age groups, especially if re-studied against s. pneumoniae (refractory otitis media) and p. aeruginosa (cystic fibrosis associated pneumonia).

TI  == promotion of opsonization by antibodies and phagocytosis of gram-positive bacteria by a bifunctional polyacrylamide.
AB  == this paper describes the application of a bifunctional polyacrylamide (pa-v-f) presenting both vancomycin and fluorescein groups, to modify the surfaces of multiple species of gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis) to control molecular recognition of these surfaces. the vancomycin groups allowed the specific recognition of a structural component of the bacterial cell wall: peptides terminated in d-ala-d-ala. the fluorescein groups allowed the imaging of binding of polymer to the surfaces of bacteria by fluorescence, and are representative, low molecular weight haptens; their recognition by anti-fluorescein antibodies provides proof-of-principle that bifunctional polymers can be used to introduce haptens onto the surface of the bacteria. flow  cytometry revealed that polymer-labeled s. aureus and s. pneumoniae were opsonized by anti-fluorescein antibodies approximately 20-fold more than were untreated bacteria; nearly all ( approximately 92%) polymer-labeled s. aureus, and a large (76%) fraction of polymer-labeled s. pneumoniae were opsonized. the bound antibodies then promoted phagocytosis of the bacteria by cultured j774 macrophage-like cells. flow cytometry revealed that macrophages ingested s. aureus decorated with the polymer-antibody complexes approximately 2-fold more efficiently than s. aureus in control groups, in spite of the high background (caused by efficient antibody-independent ingestion of s. aureus by macrophages). this paper, thus, demonstrates the ability of a bifunctional polymer to carry out three distinct functions based on polyvalent molecular recognition: (i) recognition of the surface of gram-positive bacteria, (ii) modification of this surface to generate specific binding sites recognized by an antibody, and (iii) promotion of phagocytosis of the opsonized bacteria.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel c12 vinyl ketolides.
AB  == a novel series of c12 vinyl erythromycin derivatives have been discovered which exhibit in vitro and in vivo potency against key respiratory pathogens. the c12 modification involves replacing the natural c12 methyl group in the erythromycin  core with a vinyl group via chemical synthesis. from the c12 vinyl macrolide core, a series of c12 vinyl ketolides was prepared. several compounds were found  to be potent against macrolide-sensitive and -resistant bacteria. the c12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k showed a similar antimicrobial spectrum and comparable activity to the commercial ketolide telithromycin. however, the pharmacokinetic profiles of c12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k in rats differ from that of telithromycin by having higher lung-to-plasma ratios, larger volumes of distribution, and longer half-lives. these pharmacokinetic differences have a pharmacodynamic effect as both 6j and 6k exhibited better in vivo efficacy than telithromycin in rat lung infection models against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae.

TI  == bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab: no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound t cell depletion.
AB  == background: alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against cd52, a cell surface antigen expressed on b and t lymphocytes, monocytes and nk cells.  its use results in a profound decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. we followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. patients and methods: fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. however, no patient had bacteremia with streptococcus pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal salmonella or mycobacterium avium complex. fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. the most common organisms isolated from the blood  were staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative staphylococcus (14 episodes), klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and escherichia coli (7 episodes). discussion: we conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound cd4 positive t lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of cd4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

TI  == pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the south american bullfrog leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  == norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the south american bullfrog, leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. the primary structure of a  previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as gly-leu-leu-asp-thr-leu-lys-gly-ala-ala-lys-asn-val-val-gly-ser-leu-ala-ser-lys-v al-met-glu-lys-leu.nh2. the second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the caribbean mountain chicken frog l. fallax. pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus group b) but potencies were relatively low (mic values in the range 25-200 microm). the peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (ld50>400 microm).

TI  == enterococcus faecalis sex pheromone plasmid pam373: analyses of traa and evidence for its interaction with rpob.
AB  == the enterococcus faecalis plasmid pam373 (36.7kb) encodes a mating response to the sex pheromone cam373 secreted by recipient (plasmid-free) bacteria. like certain other conjugative enterococcal plasmids, a key regulator of the pheromone response is a negatively acting protein, traa, which is believed to interact with internalized pheromone to influence expression from a key transcriptional promoter p(0). an earlier report showed that in the case of pam373 most, but not  all, transposon-insertion mutations in traa differed from those in the case of pad1 and pcf10 in that they did not give rise to the normally characteristic constitutive clumping. we show here that this phenomenon relates to a host effect involving an rpob-related mutation associated with rifampin resistance. when harboring traa mutants, rifampin-sensitive hosts exhibited constitutive clumping, whereas rifampin-resistant hosts did not-despite the fact that the latter host exhibited a normal pheromone-inducible clumping response when harboring a wild-type plasmid. the data imply that traa normally remains associated with the  transcription complex after induction. in addition the promoter of traa, designated p(a), was shown to be located about 600bp upstream of the translational start site, as clones containing traa required this site to complement traa mutants in trans. transcription from p(a) also gave rise to a short (130 nt) transcript, md, expressed at a high level in uninduced cells. an earlier observation suggesting that traa negatively affected transcriptional readthrough into the 3' end of traa from the t(ac) intrinsic bidirectional terminator between traa and the opposing, adjacent trac was supported by traa complementation studies. evidence is also presented suggesting that this regulation at t(ac) also involves an additional, possibly cis-acting, element.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis diviva: an essential gene involved in cell division, cell growth and chromosome segregation.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis diviva (divivaef) is an essential gene implicated in cell division and chromosome segregation. this gene was disrupted by insertional inactivation creating e. faecalis jhsr1, which was viable only when a wild-type copy of divivaef was expressed in trans, confirming the essentiality of the gene. the absence of divivaef in e. faecalis jhsr1 inhibited proper cell division, which resulted in abnormal cell clusters possessing enlarged cells of altered shape instead of the characteristic diplococcal morphology of enterococci. the lower viability of the divivaef mutant is caused by improper nucleoid segregation and impaired septation within the numerous cells generated in each cluster. overexpression of divivaef in escherichia coli kjb24 resulted in enlarged cells with disrupted cell division, suggesting that this round e. coli mutant strain could be used as an indicator for functionality of divivaef. a bacillus subtilis  diviva mutant was not complemented by divivaef, indicating that this protein does not recognize diviva-specific target sites in b. subtilis, or that it does not interact with other proteins of the cell division machinery of this micro-organism. divivaef also failed to complement a streptococcus pneumoniae diviva mutant, supporting the phylogenetic distance between enterococcus and streptococcus. our results indicate that diviva is a species-specific multifunctional protein implicated in cell division and chromosome segregation in e. faecalis.

AB  == a surveillance study was performed throughout germany from november 2001 to june  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for mic determination. susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. the prevalence of  linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in streptococcus agalactiae. linezolid resistance was not detected in streptococcus pneumoniae or  in viridans group streptococci. sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (mic90, 1-2 mg/l). the prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in germany. organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an  alternative method or in a reference laboratory.

TI  == [effect of delay of blood cultures on positive detection by automated blood culture system].
AB  == the effect of entry delayed blood culture bottles until the start of incubation for mechanical detection of organism were compared using 2 major blood culture systems; bactec 9240 system and bact/alert 3d system. total of 13 bacterial strains; 5 gram-positive cocci, 7 gram-negative bacilli and candida parapsilosis  which were isolated mainly from blood cultures were used as the test strains. bactec 92f, 93f and bact/alert fa, fn bottles were used as the blood culture bottles. all the bottles inoculated with the test strains were incubated and evaluated immediately after standing at room temperature for 24, 42, 48, 54 or 72 hours, using the respective automated blood culture systems. all the bottles were subcultured. the effect of entry delay the blood culture bottles for the mechanical detection was observed in many gram-negative organisms in bactec 9240  system. the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 4 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the bactec 92f bottles inoculated with escherichia coli. in serratia marcescens, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the bactec 92f bottles. in klebsiella pneumoniae, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 9 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. in enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5-6 of the 10 samples on  delaying for 42 hours. on the other hand, the blood cultures were evaluated to be positive in most of the samples of acinetobacter calcoaceticus (except 3 of the 10 samples which were evaluated not to be positive) on delaying for 42 hours in bact/alert 3 d system. the samples except part of streptococcus spp. were detected by subculture in both the bottles. these results indicate that the delayed time of blood culture bottles before inoculation with the test bacterial  samples affects the positive detection of blood cultures markedly in the blood culture system. therefore, the immediate incubation was considered to be necessary.

TI  == in vitro activities of tigecycline against clinical isolates from shanghai, china.
AB  == to evaluate the in vitro activity of tigecycline, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of tigecycline against 1,201 strains of recent clinical isolates from 10 hospitals in shanghai, china were determined and compared with selected comparators. results showed that tigecycline had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. it was highly active against gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., penicillin-intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. tigecycline also  had good activity against most strains of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis. however, it was poorly active against acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. tigecycline was highly active against anaerobic gram-positive cocci such as peptococcus spp. the in vitro activity of tigecycline was significantly better than that of minocycline and tetracycline. it was as active as or slightly more active than vancomycin and teicoplanin in the activity against resistant aerobic  gram-positive cocci. tigecycline was bactericidal against all gram-positive cocci tested except enterococcus spp. inoculum size but not ph of medium or concentration of human serum in broth had significant effect on the in vitro activity of tigecycline. aged media (48-72 hours after preparation) used in the test and specific resistance problem in china may have some effects on mic values of tigecycline.

TI  == potent antibacterial activity of halogenated compounds against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == common gram-positive clinical pathogens are showing an increasing trend for resistance to conventional antimicrobial agents. new drugs with potent antibacterial activities are urgently needed to remediate this problem. halogenated compounds isolated from several species of the red algae genus laurencia were examined for their antibacterial activity against 22 strains of human pathogenic bacteria, 7 strains of which were antibiotic-resistant bacteria. four phenolic sesquiterpenes and a polybrominated indole showed wide spectra of antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium (vre). in addition, laurinterol and allolaurinterol displayed potent bactericidal activity against three strains of mrsa at 3.13 microg ml(-1), and three strains of vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus, at 3.13 microg ml(-1) and 6.25 microg ml(-1), respectively.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against multidrug-resistant gram-positive strains collected worldwide.
AB  == daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide recently released for clinical use in the treatment of serious gram-positive infections in hospitalized patients. we evaluated the in vitro activity of daptomycin tested against recently isolated multidrug-resistant gram-positive clinical strains. a total of 386 isolates were  selected from a large collection of strains from more than 70 centers located in  europe, north america, and south america. the strains were tested by reference broth microdilution methods in mueller-hinton broth with 50 mg/l ca++ against daptomycin. daptomycin was the most potent compound tested against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae with mic50/90 values at < or =0.12  and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. daptomycin was also highly active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci and staphylococcal strains with various resistance patterns. enterococcus faecium showed higher daptomycin mic values (mic90, 4 microg/ml) when compared to e. faecalis (mic90, 1 microg/ml). in summary, resistance to vancomycin, teicoplanin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, or penicillin among the gram-positive isolates did not adversely influence daptomycin activity. daptomycin showed a significant potency and spectrum against gram-positive species, including multidrug-resistant strains, and may represent a reasonable therapeutic option for infections caused by these important pathogens.

AB  == owing to the predominance of gram-positive pathogens in neutropenic cancer patients, newer generation quinolones with an expanded gram-positive spectrum and enhanced potency, may have a role to play for prophylaxis and/or empiric therapy  in such patients. the in vitro activity of gatifloxacin was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trovafloxacin against 848 recent clinical isolates from cancer patients. against gram-positive organisms, gatifloxacin was  the most active agent tested inhibiting all aerococcus, listeria monocytogens, micrococcus, stomatococcus mucilaginous, bacillus, and rhodococcus equi strains at < or =2 mg/l, its designated susceptibility breakpoint. it was also very active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococcus spp. (including penicillin nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci). it had moderate activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococcus faecalis, inhibiting 68-80% of these strains at <  or =2 mg/l. gatifloxacin also had good activity against the enterobacteriaceae (although ciprofloxacin was more potent) inhibiting >95% of isolates at < or =1 mg/l. nonfermentative gram-negative organisms were less susceptible to all 4 agents. gatifloxacin was very active against acinetobacter lwoffi (mic100 0.12 mg/l) and had moderate activity against acinetobacter baumanii, chryseobacterium  spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas  species. alcaligenes xylosoxidans strains were relatively resistant to all 4 agents.

TI  == characterisation of viridans group streptococci with different levels of tet(m)-mediated tetracycline resistance.
AB  == streptococcus oralis 264-3, streptococcus mitis 254-1 and s. mitis 264-1, isolated from the oral cavities of two children were each found to carry the tet(m) gene but exhibited different degrees of reduced susceptibility to tetracycline (tetracycline mics of 2, 8 and 64 mg/l, respectively). the aim of this study was to determine the molecular basis for the different levels of tetracycline resistance (tc(r)) observed. escherichia coli hb101 carrying the cloned tet(m) genes exhibited similar levels of tetracycline susceptibility to those observed in the parental streptococcal strains (mics of 1, 16, and 64 mg/l  for tet(m) genes from s. oralis 264-3, s. mitis 254-1 and s. mitis 264-1, respectively). dna sequencing revealed that s. oralis 264-3 had a tet(m) gene highly homologous to tet(m) carried by tn916 from enterococcus faecalis (99.6% identity), while the intermediate- and high-level tc(r) strains had tet(m) sequences that resembled the tet(m) gene of tn5251 from streptococcus pneumoniae  (99.3% and 99.4% identity, respectively). no differences were observed in the upstream attenuator structure for each of the strains and differences in reduced  tetracycline susceptibilities could be attributed to changes in the deduced amino acid sequences of the tet(m) proteins.

TI  == [surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: vira study 2004].
AB  == introduction: the objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the vira study carried out in 2001.  methods: the 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in february 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium (89) and enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli (346), pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and acinetobacter baumannii (130). the hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. results: the number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). global methicillin-resistance in s. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the e. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. one p. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the e-test mbl assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. the strains of imipenem-resistant a. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. conclusion: these results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. this emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use  of antimicrobial agents.

AB  == inhibitors of mammalian multidrug efflux, such as the plant alkaloid reserpine, are also active in potentiating antibiotic activity by inhibiting bacterial efflux. based on this precedent, two novel mammalian multiple drug resistance inhibitors, biricodar (vx-710) and timcodar (vx-853), were evaluated for activity in a variety of bacteria. both vx-710 and vx-853 potentiated the activity of ethidium bromide (etbr), a model efflux substrate, against three clinically significant gram-positive pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. similar to reserpine, vx-710 and vx-853 directly blocked etbr efflux in s. aureus. furthermore, these compounds were effective in lowering the mics of several clinically used antibiotics, including  fluoroquinolones, suggesting that vx-710 and vx-853 are representatives of a new  class of bacterial efflux inhibitors with the potential for use in combination therapy.

TI  == use of simulated blood cultures for antibiotic effect on time to detection of the two blood culture systems bact/alert and bactec 9240.
AB  == to avoid the influence of pre-analytical steps, this study was performed using sterile blood spiked with defined loads of microorganisms as inoculum. time-to-detection (ttd) was evaluated for the most frequently encountered bacteria comparing two commercially available blood culture systems, bd bactec 9240 (becton dickinson) and bact/alert (organon teknika). the effect of the most  widely used antibiotics on ttd was evaluated on both systems. ttd was measured with antibiotics at their trough and at increasing concentrations. the results show that the bactec plus system recovers more pathogens with shorter time to detection than the bact/alert fan system when beta-lactam antibiotics (ampicillin, cefotaxime) are present at their respective trough concentration corresponding to parenteral therapy. the two systems seem to be equally efficient when gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are used; in the case of vancomycin, bactec seems more effective than bact/alert.

TI  == emerging resistance among bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit--a european and north american surveillance study (2000-2002).
AB  == background: globally icus are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. methods: antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant icu pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from the surveillance network (tsn) databases in europe (france, germany and italy), canada, and the united states (us). results: oxacillin resistance rates among staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. penicillin resistance  rates among streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in germany to as high as 20.2% in the us; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in germany to 3.4% in italy. vancomycin resistance rates among enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in france to 76.3% in the united states. putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production among enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among escherichia coli in the five countries studied. ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower  than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the enterobacteriaceae species examined. fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for e. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). p. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. imipenem was the most active compound tested against acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. conclusion: there was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. compared with other countries, italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of enterococcus spp., which were highest in the us. this data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in europe and north america and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of telavancin (td-6424), a novel bactericidal agent, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == telavancin (td-6424) is a novel lipoglycopeptide that produces rapid and concentration-dependent killing of clinically relevant gram-positive organisms in vitro. the present studies evaluated the in vivo pharmacodynamics of telavancin in the mouse neutropenic thigh (mnt) and mouse subcutaneous infection (msi) animal models. pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies in the mnt model demonstrated that the 24-h area under the concentration-time curve (auc)/mic ratio was the best predictor of efficacy. telavancin produced dose-dependent reduction of thigh titers of several organisms, including methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), penicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. the 50% effective dose (ed50) estimates for telavancin ranged from 0.5 to 6.6 mg/kg of body weight  (administered intravenously), and titers were reduced by up to 3 log10 cfu/g from pretreatment values. against mrsa atcc 33591, telavancin was 4- and 30-fold more  potent (on an ed50 basis) than vancomycin and linezolid, respectively. against mssa atcc 13709, telavancin was 16- and 40-fold more potent than vancomycin and nafcillin, respectively. telavancin, vancomycin, and linezolid were all efficacious and more potent against mrsa atcc 33591 in the msi model compared to  the mnt model. this deviation in potency was, however, disproportionately greater for vancomycin and linezolid than for telavancin, suggesting that activity of telavancin is less affected by the immune status. the findings of these studies collectively suggest that once-daily dosing of telavancin may provide an effective approach for the treatment of clinically relevant infections with gram-positive organisms.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland 2001-2002: the bsac bacteraemia resistance surveillance programme.
AB  == objectives: to describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. methods: in 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the uk and ireland. a single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured mics by the bsac agar dilution method. results: oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group b isolates (82% resistant). nine  percent of s. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (mics 0.12-1 mg/l), but none required >/=2 mg/l for inhibition. high-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin mics (>/=32 mg/l), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of enterococcus faecium. vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of e. faecium, 3% of e. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, mic of 8 mg/l). escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of e. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of klebsiella spp. and 8% of enterobacter spp. resistance rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in gram-positive organisms. ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. mics of tigecycline were low for gram-positive species and enterobacteriaceae except proteeae and enterobacter spp. conclusion: antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. an important exception was oxacillin resistance in s. aureus.

TI  == in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ac98-6446, a novel cyclic glycopeptide,  in experimental infection models.
AB  == ac98-6446 is a novel semisynthetic derivative of a natural product related to the mannopeptimycins produced by streptomyces hygroscopicus. naturally occurring esterified mannopeptimycins exhibited excellent in vitro activity but only moderate in vivo efficacy against staphylococcal infection. the in vivo efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of ac98-6446 were investigated in murine acute lethal, bacterial thigh and rat endocarditis infections. pharmacokinetics were performed  in mice, rats, monkeys, and dogs. acute lethal infections were performed with several gram-positive isolates: staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococci), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the 50% effective dose for all isolates tested ranged from 0.05 to 0.39 mg/kg of body weight after intravenous (i.v.) administration. vancomycin was more than fivefold less efficacious against all of these same infections. results of the thigh infection with s. aureus showed a static dose for ac98-6446 of 0.4 mg/kg by i.v.  administration. reduction of counts in the thigh of >2 log(10) cfu were achieved  with doses of 1 mg/kg. i.v. administration of 3 mg/kg twice a day for 3 days resulted in a >3 log(10) reduction in bacterial counts of vancomycin-susceptible  and -resistant e. faecalis in a rat endocarditis model. pharmacokinetics of ac98-6446 showed an increase in exposure (area under the concentration-time curve) from mouse to dog species. the i.v. half-life (t(1/2)) increased threefold between rodents and the higher species dosed. efficacy of ac98-6446 has been demonstrated in several models of infection with resistant gram-positive pathogens. this glycopeptide exhibited bactericidal activity in these models, resulting in efficacy at low doses with reduction in bacterial load.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of three new quinolones and azithromycin against  aerobic pathogens causing respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections.
AB  == background: in our study the in vitro susceptibility of common pathogens that cause respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections was tested against two newer fluorquinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) as well as levofloxacin and azithromycin. methods: 50 isolates each of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus  influenzae isolated from the respiratory tract and from wounds were tested for their susceptibility to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and azithromycin. results: moxifloxacin proved to be the most active substance against the tested gram-positive pathogens. gatifloxacin was the most active against p. aeruginosa. moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin proved to be comparably active against the clinical isolates of e. coli and h. influenzae. conclusions: moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin display excellent activity against respiratory pathogens as well as nosocomial pathogens causing abdominal wound infections. when treating infections caused by p. aeruginosa the earlier fluorquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are the substances of choice.

TI  == comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492.
AB  == objectives: the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492, was determined. methods: mics were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. the effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. results: mic data indicate that abt-492 has potent activity against gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis but not enterococcus  faecium. abt-492 was the most active agent tested against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. good activity was observed for abt-492 amongst the enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of proteus, morganella and providencia, as well as  for pseudomonas spp. in common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms  with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised mic(90)s to abt-492. the  one isolate of h. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an abt-492 mic close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. abt-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against chlamydia spp. an inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, e. faecium, klebsiella spp. and  escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised mics in the presence of 70% serum protein. the clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. conclusions: abt-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.

TI  == activity of linezolid against gram-positive cocci isolated in french hospitals as determined by three in-vitro susceptibility testing methods.
AB  == in total, 844 strains of gram-positive cocci were collected from six university hospitals in france between september 1999 and january 2000. mics of linezolid were determined: (i) for all strains by agar dilution (method a); (ii) by broth microdilution (method b) for staphylococci and enterococci; (iii) by etest (method e) for beta-haemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. susceptibility to other antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method.  mic50 and mic90 values were identical (2 mg/l) for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n = 179) by methods a and b. linezolid was active against  methicillin-resistant s. aureus (n = 117), with an mic90 of 2 mg/l (methods a and b), but with a lower mic50 of 1 mg/l by method a. of the 200 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 56.5% were methicillin-resistant and 43.5% were methicillin-susceptible. linezolid had similar in-vitro activity by methods a and b (mic50 and mic90 values of 1-2 mg/l), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility. the mic90 of linezolid for all enterococci (150 enterococcus faecalis and 50 enterococcus faecium) was 2 mg/l by both methods. mics of linezolid for beta-haemolytic streptococci had a narrow range of 0.5-2 mg/l (method a) and 0.125-2 mg/l (method e). pneumococci (n = 118), including 67 penicillin g-intermediate and -resistant strains, were all inhibited by linezolid 2 mg/l (mic90 of 2 mg/l by methods a and e). no strain had an mic of > 2 mg/l by  agar dilution or etest, or of > 4 mg/l by broth microdilution. overall, the study confirmed the good in-vitro activity of linezolid and the very narrow range of mics for gram-positive cocci susceptible or resistant to other antibiotics, irrespective of the method used.

TI  == [nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first ciproxan iv special investigation in 2001].
AB  == the parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (cpfx), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in september 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. as a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this  drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx. this time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to cpfx with those to other antimicrobial drugs. gram-positive bacteria  were less susceptible to cpfx than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), staphylococcus epidermidis  and enterococcus faecalis to cpfx were comparable to those to cefozopran. susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to cpfx did not differ among ampicillin (abpc)-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic of abpc: < 0.25 microgram/ml), abpc-intermediate s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and abpc-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) mic90 of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with cpfx. gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to cpfx similarly to carbapenems and the mic90 values of cpfx were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except stenotrophomonas maltophilia and burkholderia cepacia. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to cpfx among the antibacterial drugs examined and the mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cpfx also showed the lowest mic90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. when extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production and class b beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of  glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing esbl and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class b beta-lactamase were found. the mic range of cpfx to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (mic of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) based on the nccls breakpoint. cpfx also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of japan society of chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. furthermore, susceptibilities  of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we  conducted in 1997. thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of cpfx was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of ac98-6446, a novel semisynthetic glycopeptide  derivative of the natural product mannopeptimycin alpha, and other antimicrobial  agents against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == ac98-6446 is a novel semisynthetic cyclic glycopeptide antibiotic related to the  natural product mannopeptimycin alpha (ac98-1). in the present study the activity of ac98-6446 was evaluated against a variety of recent clinical gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains. ac98-6446 demonstrated similar potent activities against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococci and glycopeptide-intermediate staphylococcal isolates (mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [mic(90)s], 0.03 to 0.06 microg/ml). ac98-6446 also demonstrated good activities against both vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible strains of enterococci (mic(90)s, 0.12 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively) as well as against streptococcal strains (mic(90)s, <or= 0.008 to 0.03 microg/ml). ac98-6446 demonstrated bactericidal activity in terms of the reduction in the viable counts (>3 log(10) cfu/ml) of staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates and a marked decrease in the viable counts of most enterococcal strains (from 0.2 to 2.5 log(10) cfu/ml). unlike vancomycin, which demonstrates time-dependent killing, ac98-6446 demonstrated concentration-dependent killing. the potent activity, novel structure, and bactericidal activity demonstrated by ac98-6446 make it an attractive candidate for further development.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

AB  == the interactions between the phenothiazine dyes, methylene blue (mb) and toluidine blue (tb), and bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were studied spectrophotometrically. this demonstrated that a metachromatic reaction took place between the dyes and bacteria. furthermore, bacteria induced additional dimerization of mb and tb. the effective dimerization constants of mb and tb were evaluated in the presence of each bacterial strain at a concentration of 10(8) cfu/ml. the analysis of the effective dimerization constants for mb and tb in the presence of bacteria indicated that the ability to form dimers was greater for tb than for mb. gram-negative bacteria induced the dye dimerization more intensely than gram-positive bacteria. there was a correlation between the ability of each dye to form dimers in the presence of bacteria and the relative photobactericidal efficacy of each dye against these bacteria. these results provide evidence confirming the essential role of the dye dimers in bacterial photodamage.

AB  == several semi-synthetic bis- and mono-o-alkyl nocathiacin derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity. mono-o-alkyl n-hydroxyindole analogues 3a-l were prepared by regioselective alkylation. bis-o-alkyl nocathiacins 4a-f were obtained by treatment with base and excess electrophile. a one-pot protection-alkylation-deprotection strategy was developed for the preparation of mono-o-alkyl hydroxypyridine analogues 5a,b. most of the bis- and mono-o-alkyl nocathiacins maintained good in vitro activity but showed reduced in vivo efficacy when compared with the natural product. the excellent in vivo activity and improved water solubility of phosphate analogues 3m and 4g suggest their use as potential pro-drugs.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of extracts of local cough mixtures on upper respiratory tract bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the punched-hole and the paper disc diffusion methods were used in screening for  the antimicrobial activity of six common ingredients used locally in cough mixtures, against the following bacteria: klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus. enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, salmonella spp, salmonella paratyphi, shigella dysenteria, shigella sonnei and candida albicans. the results, evaluated as the diameter of zone of inhibition of microbial growth, showed that lime, garlic onion, onion and honey were active against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, candida albicans, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella spp and shigella dysenteriae. bitter-kola nut extract and palm kernel oil showed no antimicrobial activities against any of the tested organisms. none of the extracts inhibited the growth of salmonella paratyphi and shigella sonnei and the most susceptible organisms were escherichia coli and salmonella spp.

TI  == acquired macrolide resistance genes in pathogenic neisseria spp. isolated between 1940 and 1987.
AB  == seventy-six neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates, isolated between 1940 and 1987, and seven neisseria meningitidis isolates, isolated between 1963 and 1987, were screened for the presence of acquired mef(a), erm(b), erm(c), and erm(f) genes by using dna-dna hybridization, pcr analysis, and sequencing. the mef(a), erm(b), and erm(f) genes were all identified in a 1955 n. gonorrhoeae isolate, while the  erm(c) gene was identified in a 1963 n. gonorrhoeae isolate. similarly, both the  mef(a) and erm(f) genes were identified in a 1963 n. meningitidis isolate. all four acquired genes were found in later isolates of both species. the mef(a) gene from a 1975 n. gonorrhoeae isolate was sequenced and had 100% dna and amino acid  identity with the mef(a) gene from a 1990s streptococcus pneumoniae isolate. selected early isolates were able to transfer their acquired genes to an enterococcus faecalis recipient, suggesting that these genes are associated with  conjugative transposons. these isolates are the oldest of any species to carry the mef(a) gene and among the oldest to carry these erm genes.

TI  == in vitro activities of garenoxacin (bms-284756) against streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis compared to those of six other quinolones.
AB  == the activity of garenoxacin, a new quinolone, was determined in comparison with other quinolones against different strains of s. pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci (vgs), and enterococcus faecalis. strains were quinolone-susceptible clinical isolates and quinolone-resistant strains with defined mechanisms of resistance obtained from either clinical isolates or derivatives of s. pneumoniae r6. clinical quinolone-susceptible strains of s. pneumoniae, vgs and e. faecalis  showed garenoxacin mics within a range of 0.03 microg/ml to 0.25 micro g/ml. garenoxacin mics increased two- to eightfold when one mutation was present in the parc quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr), fourfold when one mutation was present in the gyra qrdr (s. pneumoniae), 8- to 64-fold when two or three mutations were associated in parc and gyra qrdr, and 2,048-fold when two mutations were present in both the gyra and parc qrdrs (streptococcus pneumoniae). increased active efflux had a moderate effect on garenoxacin mics for s. pneumoniae and vgs. against s. pneumoniae, garenoxacin behaved like moxifloxacin and sparfloxacin, being more affected by a single gyra mutation than by a single parc mutation. although garenoxacin was generally two- to fourfold more active than moxifloxacin against the different wild-type or mutant strains of s. pneumoniae, vgs, and e. faecalis, it was two- to fourfold less active than  gemifloxacin. at four times the respective mic for each strain, the bactericidal  effect of garenoxacin, observed at 6 h for s. pneumoniae and at 24 h for s. oralis and e. faecalis, was not influenced by the presence of mutation either in  the parc or in both the parc and gyra qrdrs.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases  in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of moxifloxacin compared to other quinolones against recent clinical bacterial isolates from hospitalized and community-based  cancer patients.
AB  == the in vitro spectrum of moxifloxacin (a c-8-methoxyquinolone) was compared to that of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against 924 recent clinical isolates from  cancer patients. moxifloxacin was more active than the comparator agents against  gram-positive pathogens, with potent activity against aerococcus spp., listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus spp., rhodococcus equi, and stomatococcus mucilaginous, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus spp., all beta hemolytic streptococci, viridans streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. it also had good to moderate activity against bacillus spp., corynebacterium spp., enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. although ciprofloxacin was the most active agent tested against the enterobacteriaceae, moxifloxacin inhibited the majority of these isolates at < or =2.0 microg/ml. moxifloxacin was the least active of the three agents tested against pseudomonas  aeruginosa, but had significant activity against other non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli including acinetobacter spp., flavobacterium spp., pseudomonas spp. other than p. aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. the  overall broad spectrum of moxifloxacin, and its availability for both oral and parenteral administration, warrants its evaluation for the prevention and treatment of infections in cancer patients.

TI  == dna binding ligands targeting drug-resistant bacteria: structure, activity, and pharmacology.
AB  == we describe the lead optimization and structure-activity relationship of dna minor-groove binding ligands, a novel class of antibacterial molecules. these compounds have been shown to target a/t-rich sites within the bacterial genome and, as a result, inhibit dna replication and rna transcription. the optimization was focused on n-terminal aromatic heterocycles and c-terminal amines and resulted in compounds with improved in vivo tolerability and excellent in vitro antibacterial potency (mic >/= 0.031 microg/ml) against a broad range of gram-positive pathogens, including drug-resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant stapylococcus aureus (mrsa), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre). in a first proof-of-concept study, a selected compound (35) showed in vivo efficacy in a mouse peritonitis model against methicillin-sensitive s. aureus infection with an ed(50) value of 30 mg/kg.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == a comparison of the antimicrobial resistance patterns of gram-positive cocci isolated from community-private and university-affiliated hospitals from puerto rico.
AB  == the antimicrobial resistance patterns of 2,462 selected gram-positive cocci obtained from three community-private hospitals (cph) and three university-affiliated hospitals (uah) were evaluated utilizing the institutions'  antimicrobial susceptibility reports for the year 2000. the objectives of this study were: 1) to evaluate the in vitro resistance to selected standard antibiotics of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates, and 2) to compare the antimicrobial resistance patterns between community-private (cph) and university-affiliated hospitals (uah). staphylococcus aureus was the most common  gram-positive isolated organism in cph (63.3%) followed by e. faecalis (31.0%). in uah, the most prevalent cocci were e. faecalis (51.7%) followed by s. aureus (43.9%). enterococcus faecium represented 2.3% and 4.4% of cph and uah isolates,  respectively. streptococcus pneumoniae represented 3.4% of the total gram-positive isolates from cph, no s. pneumoniae was reported in uah. the antimicrobial susceptibility results showed that for staphylococcus aureus there  was a statistically significant higher resistance to methicillin and thrimethoprim sulfamethoxazole in uah, while resistance to erythromycin was significantly higher in cph. there was no difference in the resistance of s. aureus to other antimicrobial agents between hospitals groups. a statistically significant resistant to vancomycin was found between enterococcal isolates from  uah (43%) and cph (12.7%). high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) was observed among uah enterococcal isolates with e. faecium showing a higher resistance than e. faecalis, no data for hlar in cph could be obtained. for pneumococci 46% of cph isolates were resistant to penicillin. in summary, there are important differences in the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance between  the gram-positive bacteria isolated from community and teaching hospitals.

TI  == the world health organization's external quality assurance system proficiency testing program has improved the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and reporting among participating laboratories using nccls methods.
AB  == a total of 150 laboratories in 33 countries that followed the nccls testing procedures participated in the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eqas-ast) from january 1998 through march 2001. laboratories tested seven bacterial isolates for antimicrobial resistance and reported the results to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) in atlanta, ga. the results were compared to the results generated at the cdc with the nccls broth microdilution and disk diffusion reference methods. although there were few testing errors with salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, drugs that are not appropriate for therapy of salmonella infections were tested and reported by 136  (91%) of 150 laboratories. in addition, 29 (20%) of 150 laboratories used the staphylococcus aureus breakpoints to report oxacillin results for staphylococcus  saprophyticus. for a vanb-containing enterococcus faecalis strain, 124 (83%) of 150 laboratories correctly reported vancomycin results that were +/-1 doubling dilution from the reference mic or +/-3 mm from the reference disk diffusion result. of the laboratories that tested streptococcus agalactiae by disk diffusion, 17% reported nonsusceptible results for penicillin in error. while 110 laboratories (73%) tested the s. pneumoniae challenge isolate against a fluoroquinolone, 83% tested it against ciprofloxacin, for which there are no nccls interpretive criteria. ten of 12 laboratories testing levofloxacin and 4 of 4 laboratories testing ofloxacin by an mic method correctly reported resistant results for the isolate. feedback letters sent to participating laboratories highlighted areas of susceptibility testing in individual laboratories that needed improvement. the positive impact of the feedback letters and the overall effectiveness of the eqas program were documented in repeat testing challenges with pneumococci and staphylococci. the 31 and 19% increases in the numbers of laboratories using appropriate testing methods for pneumococci and staphylococci, respectively, in 2000 versus 1998 indicate that laboratory performance is improving.

AB  == bacterial enoyl-acp reductase (fabi) is responsible for catalyzing the final step of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of novel antibacterial agents. previously we reported the development of fabi inhibitor 4 with narrow spectrum antimicrobial activity and in vivo efficacy against staphylococcus aureus via intraperitoneal (ip) administration. through iterative medicinal chemistry aided by x-ray crystal structure analysis,  a new series of inhibitors has been developed with greatly increased potency against fabi-containing organisms. several of these new inhibitors have potent antibacterial activity against multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus, and compound 30 demonstrates exceptional oral (po) in vivo efficacy in a s. aureus infection model in rats. while optimizing fabi inhibitory activity, compounds 29  and 30 were identified as having low micromolar fabk inhibitory activity, thereby increasing the antimicrobial spectrum of these compounds to include the fabk-containing pathogens streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. the results described herein support the hypothesis that bacterial enoyl-acp reductases are valid targets for antibacterial agents.

TI  == multicentre assessment of linezolid antimicrobial activity and spectrum in europe: report from the zyvox antimicrobial potency study (zaps-europe).
AB  == objective: to evaluate the in vitro spectrum and activity of linezolid, a recent  oxazolidinone, according to well-controlled surveillance data from 42 medical centers in 13 countries throughout europe. methods: participants tested the susceptibility of 125 clinical strains of enterococcal and staphylococcal species against 13 drugs using reference broth microdilution trays or the standardized disk diffusion method of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). streptococcal species (n = 25 at each center) were tested against six drugs using e test (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). quality assurance testing was conducted using nccls-recommended strains and verification of resistance to linezolid and other selected agents was performed by retesting strains at the regional (europe) and international (usa) monitor sites. results: a total of 5598 strains from throughout europe (91% compliance) were tested. vancomycin resistance was reported in only 0.6 and 3.0% of enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, respectively. penicillin resistance occurred in 25.1% of streptococcus pneumoniae; 4.9% at the high-level (> or =2 mg/l). the mic90 for linezolid was 1  mg/l for streptococci and 2 mg/l for enterococci and staphylococci. using the us  fda- and eucast-recommended susceptible breakpoints for linezolid, there were no  confirmed reports of linezolid resistance [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), > or =8 mg/l]. the distribution of linezolid mic values was unimodal and varied between 0.25 and 1 mg/l for streptococci (>90% of isolates), and between 1 and 2 mg/l for staphylococci (>90%) and enterococci (>95%). there were no differences in linezolid susceptibility in the vancomycin-, oxacillin-, or penicillin-resistant subsets of strains when compared to susceptible organism populations. conclusions: compared to the north american component of this study, there was substantially less vancomycin resistance among e. faecium isolates (europe 3.0% vs. north america 63.4%). while the occurrence of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae in europe and north america was similar (25.1% vs. 29.7%), the recovery of high-level penicillin-resistant strains was nearly three-fold higher in north america (4.9% vs. 13.2%). only linezolid was universally active against all the tested gram-positive isolates at </=4 mg/l.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == [interpretative reading of the antibiogram in gram-positive cocci].
AB  == resistance to methicillin in staphylococcus is related to expression of the gene  meca, and implies resistance to all beta-lactams. breakpoints for interpretation  of this mechanism differ in s. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. in relation to macrolides-lincosamides-streptograminsb, the most frequent mechanism  among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump nora determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences on the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. strains of s. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (gisa strains) have been recently described. in spain, there is a high percentage of s. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage  of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, because  of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. the most frequent phenotype of resistance to macrolides in this species is caused by methylase production. resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is related to the mechanisms previously indicated for staphylococcus, but clinical interpretation of the antibiograma for this organism is even more complex. no strains of s. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. in spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in s. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. e. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to e. faecium. enterococci show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes became resistant to the combination. glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in our country, but several genotypes, of which vana is the most relevant from a clinical point of view, have been described in other regions.

AB  == bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein (acp) reductase (fabi) catalyzes the final step in each elongation cycle of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of new antibacterial agents. high-throughput screening of the staphylococcus aureus fabi enzyme identified a novel, weak inhibitor with no detectable antibacterial activity against s. aureus. iterative medicinal chemistry and x-ray crystal structure-based design led to the identification of compound 4 [(e)-n-methyl-n-(2-methyl-1h-indol-3-ylmethyl)-3-(7-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,8-na phthyridin-3-yl)acrylamide], which is 350-fold more potent than the original lead compound obtained by high-throughput screening in the fabi inhibition assay. compound 4 has exquisite antistaphylococci activity, achieving mics at which 90%  of isolates are inhibited more than 500 times lower than those of nine currently  available antibiotics against a panel of multidrug-resistant strains of s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. furthermore, compound 4 exhibits excellent in vivo efficacy in an s. aureus infection model in rats. biochemical and genetic approaches have confirmed that the mode of antibacterial action of compound 4 and related compounds is via inhibition of fabi. compound 4 also exhibits weak fabk inhibitory activity, which may explain its antibacterial activity against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, which depend on fabk and both fabk and fabi, respectively, for their enoyl-acp reductase function. these results show that compound 4 is representative of a new, totally synthetic series of antibacterial agents that has the potential to provide novel alternatives for  the treatment of s. aureus infections that are resistant to our present armory of antibiotics.

TI  == the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase motif is lacking in pmpa, the prsa-like protein involved in the secretion machinery of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the prsa-like gene from lactococcus lactis encoding its single homologue to prsa, an essential protein triggering the folding of secreted proteins in bacillus subtilis, was characterized. this gene, annotated pmpa, encodes a lipoprotein of  309 residues whose expression is increased 7- to 10-fold when the source of nitrogen is limited. a slight increase in the expression of the prsa-like protein (plp) in l. lactis removed the degradation products previously observed with the  staphylococcus hyicus lipase used as a model secreted protein. this shows that pmpa either triggers the folding of the secreted lipase or activates its degradation by the cell surface protease htra. unlike the case for b. subtilis, the inactivation of the gene encoding pmpa reduced only slightly the growth rate  of l. lactis in standard conditions. however, it almost stopped its growth when the lipase was overexpressed in the presence of salt in the medium. like prsa of  b. subtilis and prtm of l. lactis, the l. lactis pmpa protein could thus have a foldase activity that facilitates protein secretion. these proteins belong to the third family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerases (ppiases) for which parvulin is the prototype. almost all plp from gram-positive bacteria contain a domain with the ppiase signature. an exception to this situation was found only in streptococcaceae, the family to which l. lactis belongs. plp from streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis possess this signature, but those of l. lactis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus mutans do not. however, secondary structure predictions suggest that the folding of plp is conserved over the entire length of the proteins, including the unconserved signature region. the activity associated with the expression of pmpa in l. lactis and these genomic data show that either the ppiase motif is not necessary for ppiase activity or, more likely, pmpa foldase activity does not necessarily require ppiase activity.

TI  == in vitro activity of a novel oxazolidinone, azd2563, against randomly selected and multiresistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the in vitro activity of azd2563, a novel oxazolidinone, was assessed against 595 gram-positive cocci, comprising recent surveillance isolates and a collection of  resistant (including multiresistant), epidemiologically diverse isolates. the mics of azd2563 for staphylococci, pneumococci and enterococci had narrow ranges, 0.25-2 mg/l, with modal mics of 1 mg/l for staphylococci and pneumococci, and 1-2 mg/l for enterococci. azd2563 was equally active against the surveillance isolates and those that had been selected for their multiresistance to other agents. the mics of azd2563 were either the same as those of linezolid or two-fold lower.

TI  == antibiotic resistance as an indicator of bacterial chlorhexidine susceptibility.
AB  == the antibiotic and chlorhexidine (chx) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus (not mrsa), streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (mbc) and/or minimal inhibitory (mic) concentrations. non-fermentative bacteria tolerated chx at high concentrations; gram-positive cocci, especially s. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. we found a good correlation between chx and  antibiotic susceptibility in both mic and mbc among gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in mbc among gram-positive bacteria. resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate  increased chx resistance among gram-negative bacteria. this finding gives clinicians the ability to predict chx susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 127), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 123), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), enterococcus faecium (n = 50), enterococcus avium (n = 50), and peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros, p. prevotii; n = 125). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also  observed with ceftazidime (caz), cpr, cfpm, fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. the decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual mic range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.

TI  == a multicenter evaluation of linezolid antimicrobial activity in north america.
AB  == overall, 141 centers in north america enrolled in this international surveillance study designed to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and spectrum of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone. each participant tested the susceptibility of clinical isolates of staphylococcal species (n = 85) against 12 drugs, and enterococcal species (n = 40) against 6 drugs using reference broth microdilution trays; and of streptococcal species (n = 25) against 6 drugs using etests (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). quality control testing was conducted using recommended  strains, and verification of resistance to linezolid and select other agents was  performed by a regional monitor. of the 20,161 isolates collected from sites across the united states (us; n = 132) and canada (n = 9), 18,307 were included in this analysis. oxacillin resistance occurred in 38.7 and 70.6% of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal (cons) isolates, respectively. vancomycin resistance was reported in 65.9 and 2.6% of enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis, respectively. penicillin resistance occurred in 37.2% of streptococcus pneumoniae, 17.5% constituting high-level resistance (mic, > or =2  microg/ml). the mic(90) for linezolid was 1 microg/ml for streptococci, 2 microg/ml for enterococci and cons isolates, and 4 microg/ml for s. aureus. using the us fda-recommended susceptible breakpoints for linezolid, there were no confirmed reports of linezolid resistance (i.e., mic > or =8 microg/ml). the occurrence of linezolid mics was unimodal and generally varied between, 1-4 microg/ml for staphylococci (94% of recorded results), 1-2 microg/ml for enterococci (93%), and 0.5-1 microg/ml for streptococci (85%). susceptibility to  linezolid was not influenced by susceptibility to other antiicrobials such as vancomycin, beta-lactams or macrolides. only linezolid was universally active against essentially all tested gram-positive specimens. the unimodal susceptibility pattern is indicative of excellent and near complete activity against key gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains, but surveillance for emerging resistances (rare) and the performance of routine susceptibility tests to guide patient therapy seems prudent.

TI  == antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

TI  == evaluation of the vitek 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == a study was conducted to evaluate the new vitek 2 system (biomerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (n = 100), enterococcus spp. (n = 89), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the id-gpc identification card and with the ast-p515 (for staphylococci), ast-p516 (for enterococci and s. agalactiae) and ast-p506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. the identification comparison methods were the api staph for staphylococci and the api 20 strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) was used. the vitek 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of s. aureus, 96.5% of s. agalactiae, 96.9% of s. pneumoniae, 92.7% of enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). more than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. according to the nccls breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the vitek 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for s. aureus, from 90 to 100% for cns, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for s. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for s. pneumoniae. microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were cns-erythromycin, cns-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. major errors were observed for cns-oxacillin and s. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. in conclusion the results of this study indicate that the vitek 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.

TI  == [therapeutic impact of streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in hematology patients].
AB  == from january 1999 to may 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. they concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. these patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. during 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to  antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. in six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten streptococcus mitis, five s. oralis, two s. sanguis, three s. pneumoniae). a single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the enterococci were one strain of enterococcus  faecalis and three e. faecium. ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l of  penicillin g, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = mic < 32 mg/l), and a strain  was resistant (mic = 32 mg/l). eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. for three strains, the mics of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l and 8-32 mg/l, respectively) were higher. levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. all species were susceptible to glycopeptides. three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. this results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial sensitivity for czop were  also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen  species (1,913 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 178), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse; n = 98), methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse; n = 164), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), enterococcus faecium (n  = 91), enterococcus avium (n = 72), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp; n = 100), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp; n = 29), streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). czop possessed comparable antibacterial activities against mssa and msse to other cephems, and was also effective on mrse but not on mrsa. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. czop, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. an antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (cpr) and higher than other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, just like other drugs. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (ctm), cefepime (cfpm) and cpr, and that against s. agalactiae was also preferable. czop and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against s. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. an antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, ctm and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint mic of czop was 96.5% in mrsa, 93.1% in prsp, 60.0% in  pisp, 40.3% in s. haemolyticus, 22.3% in e. faecalis, and 15.9% in mrse. those resistance ratios were similar to those for cfpm, but e. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. in conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria was observed. the sensitivities of pisp and prsp to czop, however, was suggested to be decreasing.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == in vitro action of carboxyfullerene.
AB  == fullerene compounds have avid reactivity with free radicals and are regarded as 'radical sponges'. the trimalonic acid derivative of fullerene is one of the water-soluble compounds that has been synthesized and found to be an effective antioxidant both in vivo and in vitro. carboxyfullerene has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both gram-positive and -negative infections, although its mode of action is poorly understood. we determined the mic and minimal bactericidal concentration of carboxyfullerene for 20 isolates, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae. we further investigated the action of carboxyfullerene using transmission electron microscopy (tem), anticarboxyfullerene antibody binding assay and a membrane perturbation assay. all gram-positive species were inhibited by < or = 50 mg/l of carboxyfullerene, whereas gram-negative species were not inhibited, even at 500 mg/l carboxyfullerene. bactericidal activity was demonstrated only for gram-positive species, particularly for streptococcus pyogenes a-20, which was killed rapidly. intercalation of carboxyfullerene into the cell wall of staphylococci and streptococci was demonstrated by tem and anti-carboxyfullerene  binding assay. damage to the cell membrane in gram-positive, but not gram-negative, bacteria was confirmed by the membrane perturbation assay. these findings indicate that the action of carboxyfullerene on gram-positive bacteria is achieved by insertion into the cell wall and destruction of membrane integrity.

TI  == grepafloxacin: pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration.
AB  == pharmacokinetic and tissue penetration studies of grepafloxacin, a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, show that it has useful properties for the treatment of respiratory tract infections. grepafloxacin has a volume of distribution that is larger than those of many of the other fluoroquinolones and  is concentrated in alveolar macrophages, bronchial mucosa and epithelial lining fluid to a greater extent than are certain other fluoroquinolones. grepafloxacin  concentrations achieved in plasma after a 400-mg oral dose are well in excess of  those required to inhibit the respiratory pathogens staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococcus pneumoniae is also covered for most of the dosing interval, but at normal dose levels grepafloxacin might not inhibit enterococcus faecalis. the maximum plasma concentrations and area under the concentration---time curve achieved with grepafloxacin suggest that it will be effective for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. the pharmacokinetics of fluoroquinolones are among their most useful properties. the  aim of this paper is to demonstrate whether the differences between grepafloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones are of therapeutic significance.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin  inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not  included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe  nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.

TI  == in vitro activity of cephalosporin rwj-54428 (mc-02479) against multidrug-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02479) is a novel cephalosporin that binds to penicillin-binding protein (pbp) pbp 2' (pbp 2a) of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. its in vitro activity was assessed against 472 gram-positive cocci, largely selected as  epidemiologically unrelated isolates with multidrug resistance. the mic at which  50% of isolates are inhibited (mic(50)) and mic(90) of rwj-54428 for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were 1 and 2 microg/ml, respectively, whereas they were 0.5 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible s. aureus. the mic(50) and mic(90) were 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcons), whereas they were 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible isolates. the highest mics for mrsa and mrcons isolates were 2 and 4 microg/ml, respectively. the mic(50) and mic(90) of rwj-54428 for enterococcus faecalis were 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, but they were 4 and 8 microg/ml, respectively, for enterococcus faecium. for penicillin-susceptible,  -intermediate, and -resistant pneumococci, the mic(90)s of rwj-54428 were 0.03, 0.25, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, with the highest mic for a pneumococcus being 1 microg/ml, recorded for a strain for which penicillin and cefotaxime mics were 8 and 4 microg/ml. mics for lancefield group a, b, c, and g streptococci were < or =0.008 microg/ml; those for viridans group streptococci, including isolates not susceptible to penicillin, were from 0.015 to 0.5 microg/ml. rwj-54428 did not select resistant mutants of mrsa or enterococci in challenge experiments and has the potential to be useful for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive cocci.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1998  and march 1999].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from april 1998 to march 1999). the number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. a total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. on the whole, among gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from  postoperative infections. among gram-positive anaerobes, peptostreptococcus spp.  and streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. among gram-negative aerobes,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. among gram-negative anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of gram-positive and gram-negative  anaerobes have gradually declined. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. the percentage of mrsa among s. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. the susceptibilities of b. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. among other bacteria in b. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. e. coli and k. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. we found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

AB  == a total of 3,981 isolates from patients treated at intensive care units were collected in 25 european university hospitals during 1997 and 1998 as part of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. overall, the most important species isolated were staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), enterobacter spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. thirty-nine percent of all staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. all staphylococcus aureus isolates were fully susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin. moreover, all cns isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and minocycline. all enterococcus faecalis isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, and 99% of these isolates were also susceptible to ampicillin. the antimicrobial  agents most effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, and cefepime, with 87, 85, 84, and 83% of isolates being susceptible, respectively. escherichia coli isolates were fully susceptible to carbapenems, and at least 99% of these isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefepime, and amikacin. the enterobacter spp. were also highly susceptible to carbapenems, amikacin, and cefepime, with 99, 97, and 96% of isolates being susceptible, respectively. haemophilus influenzae was susceptible  to most of the antibiotics tested. only 68% of the pneumococcal isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin, yet 100% were susceptible to a number of fluoroquinolones and vancomycin. there are still sufficient treatment options for patients infected with the most important bacterial species involved in infections in intensive care units. however, the situation for patients with pseudomonas aeruginosa infections is critical.

TI  == fractional maximal effect method for in vitro synergy between amoxicillin and ceftriaxone and between vancomycin and ceftriaxone against enterococcus faecalis  and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == in the present study we assessed the use of a new in vitro testing method and graphical representation of the results to investigate the potential effectiveness of combinations of amoxicillin (amz) plus ceftriaxone (cro) and of  cro plus vancomycin (van) against strains of streptococcus pneumoniae highly resistant to penicillin and cephalosporins (prp strains). we used the fractional  maximal effect (fme) method of time-kill curves to calculate adequate concentrations of the drugs to be tested rather than relying on arbitrary choices. the concentrations obtained, each of which corresponded to a fraction of the maximal effect, were tested alone and in combination with the bacterial strains in a broth medium. synergy was defined as a ratio of observed effect/theoretical effect, called fme, of greater than 1, additivity was defined  as an fme equal to 1, and antagonism was defined as an observed effect lower than the best effect of one of the antibiotics used alone. the area between antagonism and additivity is the indifference zone. the well-known synergy between amoxicillin and gentamicin against a reference strain of enterococcus faecalis was confirmed, with a best fme equal to 1.07. two strains of prp, strains prp-1 and prp-2, were studied. the mics for prp-1 and prp-2 were as follows: penicillin, 4 and 16 microg/ml, respectively; amz, 2 and 8 microg/ml, respectively, cro, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; and van, 0.5 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. for prp-1 the best fme for the combination amz-cro was 1.22 with drug concentrations of 1.68 mg/liter for amz and 0.17 mg/liter for cro; the best fme for the combination van-cro was 1.75 with van at 0.57 mg/liter and cro at 0.17 mg/liter. for prp-2 the best fme obtained for the combination amz-cro was 1.05 with drug concentrations of 11.28 mg/liter for amz and 0.64 mg/liter for cro; the best fme obtained for the combination van-cro was 1.35 with van at 0.25  mg/liter and cro at 1.49 mg/liter. these results demonstrated the synergy of both combinations, amz-cro and van-cro, against prp strains at drug concentrations achievable in humans. consequently, either of the combinations can be proposed for use for the treatment of prp infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

TI  == the pava gene of streptococcus pneumoniae encodes a fibronectin-binding protein that is essential for virulence.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae colonizes the nasopharynx in up to 40% of healthy subjects, and is a leading cause of middle ear infections (otitis media), meningitis and pneumonia. pneumococci adhere to glycosidic receptors on epithelial cells and to immobilized fibronectin, but the bacterial adhesins mediating these reactions are largely uncharacterized. in this report we describe a novel pneumococcal protein pava, which binds fibronectin and is associated with pneumococcal adhesion and virulence. the pava gene, present in 64 independent isolates of s. pneumoniae tested, encodes a 551 amino acid residue polypeptide with 67% identical amino acid sequence to fbp54 protein in streptococcus pyogenes. pava localized to the pneumococcal cell outer surface, as demonstrated  by immunoelectron microscopy, despite lack of conventional secretory or cell-surface anchorage signals within the primary sequence. full-length recombinant pava polypeptide bound to immobilized human fibronectin in preference to fluid-phase fibronectin, in a heparin-sensitive interaction, and blocked binding of wild-type pneumococcal cells to fibronectin. however, a c-terminally truncated pava' polypeptide (362 aa residues) failed to bind fibronectin or block pneumococcal cell adhesion. expression of pava in enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 conferred > sixfold increased cell adhesion levels to fibronectin over control jh2-2 cells. isogenic mutants of s. pneumoniae, either abrogated in pava expression or producing a 42 kda c-terminally truncated protein, showed up to 50% reduced binding to immobilized fibronectin. inactivation of pava had no effects on growth rate, cell morphology, cell-surface physico-chemical properties, production of pneumolysin, autolysin, or surface proteins pspa and psaa. isogenic pava mutants of encapsulated s. pneumoniae d39 were approximately 104-fold attenuated in virulence in the mouse sepsis model. these results provide evidence that pava fibronectin-binding protein plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of  pneumococcal infections.

TI  == a simple model host for identifying gram-positive virulence factors.
AB  == we demonstrate the use of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans as a facile and inexpensive model host for several gram-positive human bacterial pathogens. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus, but not bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecium, or streptococcus pyogenes, kill adult c. elegans. focusing our studies on the enterococcal species, we found that both e. faecalis and e. faecium kill c. elegans eggs and hatchlings, although only e. faecalis kills the adults. in the case of adults, a low inoculum of e. faecalis grows to a high titer in the c. elegans intestine, resulting in a persistent infection that cannot be eradicated by prolonged feeding on e. faecium. interestingly, a high titer of e. faecium also accumulates in the nematode gut, but does not affect the longevity of the worms. two e. faecalis virulence-related factors that play an important role in mammalian models of infection, fsr, a putative quorum-sensing system, and cytolysin, are also important for nematode killing. we exploit the apparent parallels between gram-positive infection in simple and more complex organisms by using the nematode to identify an e. faecalis virulence factor, scrb, which is relevant to  mammalian pathogenesis.

TI  == determination of enterococcus faecalis groesl full-length sequence and application for species identification.
AB  == amplification of the partial cpn60 (or groel) gene segment has been used for identification of many bacteria, including enterococcus species. to obtain more sequence data from groesl genes of enterococcus faecalis, the full-length sequence of the e. faecalis groesl genes containing groes (285 bp), spacer (57 bp), and groel (1,626 bp) was determined. a database search of genbank revealed that the deduced e. faecalis groes and groel proteins show significant homology to the groes and groel proteins of other bacteria. the groel (groel) of e. faecalis had the highest identity with streptococcus pneumoniae (81.8% amino acid sequence identity and 73.0% nucleotide sequence identity), followed by lactococcus zeae, while groes (groes) had 60.2% (64.6%) identity with lactobacillus zeae and 58.5% (66.2%) identity with lactococcus lactis, followed by 57.0% (65.5%) identity with bacillus subtilis. based on the groes sequence, an e. faecalis-specific pcr assay was developed, and this pcr assay was positive for all the e. faecalis strains tested. dot blot hybridization using either groes or  groel as the probe distinguished e. faecalis clearly from other species, indicating that both genes can be used as suitable targets for e. faecalis identification. moreover, broad-range pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism of groesl was designed to differentiate eight commonly encountered enterococcus species. the enterococcus species of reference strains could be easily differentiated on the basis of restriction patterns produced by haeiii and rsai. the dna-based assays developed in this study provide an alternative to currently used methods of identification for clinically important enterococcal species.

TI  == comparative killing kinetics of the novel des-fluoro(6) quinolone bms-284756, fluoroquinolones, vancomycin and beta-lactams.
AB  == the primary bactericidal classes used therapeutically as single agents, are the quinolones and the cell-wall active agents. in this study, their rates of killing were compared. the des-fluoro(6) quinolone bms-284756 (t-3811me), fluoroquinolones (trovafloxacin, levofloxacin) and cell wall-active agents (beta-lactams, vancomycin) were evaluated against enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis. time-kill analysis was done at 10x the mic, using mueller-hinton broth (supplemented with 7% lysed horse blood for streptococcus pneumoniae and the viridans streptococci), or brain heart infusion broth for beta-haemolytic streptococci. using a 3-log(10) decrease in viable count as an index of bactericidal activity, bms-284756 and the fluoroquinolones killed enterobacteriaceae rapidly, requiring < 2 h versus > or =6 h for beta-lactams. the staphylococcal cell counts generally decreased more rapidly with quinolone exposure, compared with those treated with vancomycin or the beta-lactams. the antimicrobial agents killed streptococci and enterococci more slowly, requiring > 6 h to decrease the viable count by 99.9%. in summary, bms-284756 killing rates are similar to those of recent fluoroquinolones and are  bacterial group-dependent. overall, the quinolones are more rapidly bactericidal  than vancomycin and the beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == multi-laboratory assessment of the linezolid spectrum of activity using the kirby-bauer disk diffusion method: report of the zyvox antimicrobial potency study (zaps) in the united states.
AB  == the in vitro activity of linezolid against common gram-positive pathogens was compared to that of penicillin or ampicillin or oxacillin (depending upon genus), cefazolin, erythromycin, clindamycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, levofloxacin, nitrofurantoin and vancomycin by disk diffusion methods. one hundred and six centers (31 states in us) tested recent clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and other streptococci. testing was conducted using the standardized disk diffusion method and concurrent quality control testing was performed. strains with linezolid zone diameters of < or = 20 mm were requested for referral to the microbiology monitor for confirmation. a total of 3,100 isolates (97% compliance) were tested. susceptibility (zone diameters, > or = 21  mm) of staphylococci and streptococci to linezolid was reported in 100% and 99.4% of staphylococci and streptococci, respectively. susceptibility (zone diameters,  > or = 23 mm) of enterococci to linezolid was 96.0% with only three isolates (0.4%) reported as resistant (zone diameters, < or = 20 mm; unconfirmed). among a total of nine isolates (0.3%) reported to have zone diameters 20 mm, six were not submitted for further testing, two were contaminated with gram-negative bacilli and one was determined to be linezolid-susceptible. there were no differences in  linezolid susceptibility in the vancomycin- or oxacillin- or penicillin-resistant subsets of strains. this susceptibility pattern for us medical centers is indicative of the excellent and nearly complete in vitro activity against the key gram-positive pathogens for which linezolid has received us food and drug administration indications for clinical use.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of certain quinolone derivatives.
AB  == a number of 7-substituted quinolone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial and cytotoxic activities. preliminary results indicated that most compounds tested in this study demonstrated better activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus than norfloxacin. among them, 1-(4-amino-2-fluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-[4-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-hydro xyiminoethyl]-1-piperazinyl]-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid (11d) and its ketone precursor 10d exhibited significant activities against klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, erythromycin- and ampicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. due to strong cytotoxicities of 11d (a mean log gi(50) of  -5.40), compound 10d, with good antibacterial activities and low cytotoxicities (a mean log gi(50) of -4.67), is a more potential drug candidate.

TI  == characterization of selected strains of pneumococcal surface protein a.
AB  == several proteins, in addition to the polysaccharide capsule, have recently been implicated in the full virulence of the streptococcus pneumoniae bacterial pathogen. one of these novel virulence factors of s. pneumoniae is pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa). the n-terminal, cell surface exposed, and functional part of pspa is essential for full pneumococcal virulence, as evidenced by the fact that antibodies raised against this part of the protein are protective against pneumococcal infections. pspa has recently been implicated in anti-complementary function as it reduces complement-mediated clearance and phagocytosis of pneumococci. several recombinant n-terminal fragments of pspa from different strains of pneumococci, rx1, bg9739, bg6380, ef3296, and ef5668, were analyzed using circular dichroism, analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity and equilibrium methods, and sequence homology. uniformly, all strains of pspa molecules studied have a high alpha-helical secondary structure content and they adopt predominantly a coiled-coil structure with an elongated, likely rod-like shape. no beta-sheet structures were detected for any  of the pspa molecules analyzed. all pspas were found to be monomeric in solution  with the exception of the bg9739 strain which had the propensity to partially aggregate but only into a tetrameric form. these structural properties were correlated with the functional, anti-complementary properties of pspa molecules based on the polar distribution of highly charged termini of its coiled-coil domain. the recombinant rx1 pspa is currently under consideration for pneumococcal vaccine development.

TI  == [pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility in uropathogen isolates from children].

TI  == identification of novel essential escherichia coli genes conserved among pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == we deleted a subset of 27 open reading frames (orfs) from escherichia coli which  encode previously uncharacterized, probably soluble gene products homologous to proteins from a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis and only distantly related to eukaryotic proteins. six novel bacteria-specific genes essential for growth in complex medium could be identified through a combination of bioinformatics-based and experimental approaches. we also compared our data to published results of gene inactivation projects with mycoplasma genitalium and bacillus subtilis and looked for homologs in all known prokaryotic genomes. such analyses highlight the enormous metabolic  flexibility of prokaryotes. six of 27 studied genes have been functionally characterized up to now, amongst these four of the essential genes. the gene products ygbp, ygbb and ychb are involved in the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. kdtb is characterized as the posphopantetheine adenylyltransferase coad. there are indications that the other two essential gene products yjee and yqgf, which we have identified, also possess enzymatic functions. these findings demonstrate the potential of such proteins to be used in screening of large chemical libraries for inhibitors which could be further developed to novel broad-spectrum antibiotics.

TI  == in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in europe and australia.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

TI  == resistance studies with daptomycin.
AB  == we studied the in vitro emergence of resistance to daptomycin using three methods: spontaneous resistance incidence, serial passage in the presence of increasing drug concentrations, and chemical mutagenesis. no spontaneously resistant mutants were obtained for any organism tested (<10(-10) for staphylococcus aureus, <10(-9) for staphylococcus epidermidis, <10(-9) for enterococcus faecalis, <10(-9) for enterococcus faecium, <10(-8) for streptococcus pneumoniae). population analysis demonstrated that bacterial susceptibility to daptomycin is heterogeneous. assay results were sensitive to calcium concentration and culture density, both of which can affect apparent resistance rates. stable s. aureus mutants were isolated by both serial passage in liquid media and chemical mutagenesis. the daptomycin mics for these isolates  were 8- to 32-fold higher than for the parental strain. many mutants with high mics (>12.5 microg/ml) had significant growth defects but did not display phenotypes typical of s. aureus small colony variants. the voltage component (delta psi) of the bacterial membrane potential was increased in three independent resistant isolates. in vivo data showed that some daptomycin-resistant mutants had lost significant virulence. for other mutants, the degree of in vitro resistance was greater than the change in in vivo susceptibility. these results suggest that infection with some daptomycin-resistant organisms may still be easily treatable.

TI  == linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

TI  == [identification of microbial subtypes from antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical laboratory for nosocomial infection surveillance].
AB  == we developed an algorism to identify microbial subtypes automatically from daily  antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical microbiology laboratory. the susceptibility pattern was expressed as a string of digits, each consisting of 0(resistant), 1(intermediate) or 2(susceptible) to respective antibiotics. any two patterns were regarded identical and combined if the difference at each digit never exceeds 1. the combined pattern was expressed as an array of digit-by-digit weighted averages of the two. the second combination was based on a degree of similarity among the numerical patterns using a formula, which was designed to emphasize differences in highly variable elements. this subgrouping procedure was done every three months. identity of the detected subtypes between the intervals  was determined using the same algorism as for the second combination. the algorism was applied to data of clinical isolates of mrsa, pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa), klebsiella pneumoniae (kp), enterococcus faecalis (ef), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), escherichia coli (ec) that were obtained over a period of 4 years. three major subtypes of mrsa, kp and ef were consistently detected with shifting mutual frequencies. most of ec isolates belonged to two consistent subtypes. although pa and sp had one or two consistent subtypes, there were multiple minor subtypes of varying frequencies. this analysis is regarded as an "infotyping", in contrast to serotype or genotype, of clinical microbial isolates, which is useful for nosocomial infection surveillance.

TI  == in vitro activities of rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32  times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than  methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428  had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.

AB  == the influence of non-quinolone antimicrobial agents on the antibacterial activities of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin was determined using chequerboard, fractional inhibitory concentration, (fic) and time-kill analysis methods. in the chequerboard method, the quinolones were tested in combination with ten antimicrobial agents (macrolides, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, vancomycin, rifampicin and chloramphenicol) against five bacterial strains (one strain each of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus  faecalis and streptococcus pneumoniae). in no incidence was antagonism (fic > or  = 4) or synergy (fic < or = 0.5) observed; all dual drug combinations involving gatifloxacin or ciprofloxacin showed additivity/indifference (fic > 0.5, < 4). by time-kill analysis, the strains were tested at a quinolone concentration equal to 8 x mic in combination with a second antibiotic at 0.5xits mic. these combinations killed non-enterococcal strains at rates similar to those with quinolones alone. however, rifampicin and chloramphenicol were often antagonistic (100-fold lesser killing) to the lethal action of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin  against e. faecalis. these findings indicate that, with the exception of e. faecalis, the antibacterial activities of quinolones are generally additive/indifferent to those of other antimicrobial agents.

TI  == use of preclinical data for selection of a phase ii/iii dose for evernimicin and  identification of a preclinical mic breakpoint.
AB  == one of the most challenging issues in the design of phase ii/iii clinical trials  of antimicrobial agents is dose selection. the choice is often based on preclinical data from pharmacokinetic (pk) studies with animals and healthy volunteers but is rarely linked directly to the target organisms except by the mic, an in vitro measure of antimicrobial activity with many limitations. it is the thesis of this paper that rational dose-selection decisions can be made on the basis of the pharmacodynamics (pds) of the test agent predicted by a mathematical model which uses four data sets: (i) the distribution of mics for clinical isolates, (ii) the distribution of the values of the pk parameters for the test drug in the population, (iii) the pd target(s) developed from animal models of infection, and (iv) the protein binding characteristics of the test drug. in performing this study with the new anti-infective agent evernimicin, we  collected a large number (n = 4,543) of recent clinical isolates of gram-positive pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus aureus) and determined the mics using e-test methods  (ab biodisk, stockholm, sweden) for susceptibility to evernimicin. population pk  data were collected from healthy volunteers (n = 40) and patients with hypoalbuminemia (n = 12), and the data were analyzed by using npem iii. pd targets were developed with a neutropenic murine thigh infection model with three target pathogens: s. pneumoniae (n = 5), e. faecalis (n = 2), and s. aureus (n =  4). drug exposure or the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve/mic (auc/mic) was found to be the best predictor of microbiological efficacy. there were three possible microbiological results: stasis of the initial inoculum at 24 h (10(7) cfu), log killing (pathogen dependent, ranging from 1 to 3 log(10)), or  90% maximal killing effect (90% e(max)). the levels of protein binding in humans  and mice were similar. the pk and pd of 6 and 9 mg of evernimicin per kg of body  weight were compared; the population values for the model parameters and population covariance matrix were used to generate five monte carlo simulations with 200 subjects each. the fractional probability of attaining the three pd targets was calculated for each dose and for each of the three pathogens. all differences in the fractional probability of attaining the target auc/mic in this pd model were significant. for s. pneumoniae, the probability of attaining all three pd targets was high for both doses. for s. aureus and enterococci, there were increasing differences between the 6- and 9-mg/kg evernimicin doses for reaching the 2 log killing (s. aureus), 1 log killing (enterococci), or 90% e(max) auc/mic targets. this same approach may also be used to set preliminary in vitro mic breakpoints.

AB  == the prevalence of antibiotic resistance amongst gram-positive cocci from 25 uk hospitals was studied over an 8 month period in 1999. a total of 3770 isolates were tested by the sentinel laboratories using the etest; these bacteria comprised 1000 pneumococci, 1005 staphylococcus aureus, 769 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and 996 enterococci. to ensure quality, 10% of the isolates were retested centrally, as were any found to express unusual resistance patterns. the prevalence of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) varied widely amongst the sentinel laboratories. the resistance rates to methicillin among s. aureus and cns were 19.2 and 38.9%, respectively, with mrsa  rates in individual sentinel sites ranging from 0 to 43%. no glycopeptide resistance was seen in s. aureus, but 6.5% of cns isolates were teicoplanin resistant and 0.5% were vancomycin resistant. vancomycin resistance was much more frequent among enterococcus faecium (24.1%) than e. faecalis (0.5%) (p<0.05), with most resistant isolates carrying vana. the rate of penicillin resistance in  pneumococci was 8.9%, and this resistance was predominantly intermediate (7.9%),  with only six hospitals reporting isolates with high level resistance. the prevalence of erythromycin resistance among pneumococci was 12.3%, with the majority of resistant isolates having the macrolide efflux mechanism mediated by  mefe. all the organisms tested were susceptible to linezolid with mics in the range 0.12-4 mg/l. the modal mics of linezolid were 1 mg/l for cns and pneumococci, and 2 mg/l for s. aureus and enterococci. linezolid was the most potent agent tested against gram-positive cocci, including multiresistant strains, and as such may prove a valuable therapeutic option for the management of gram-positive infections in hospitals.

AB  == to understand quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance among clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria in taiwan, where this agent is not yet available for clinical use, we evaluated 1,287 nonduplicate isolates recovered from january 1996 to december 1999 for in vitro susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and other newer antimicrobial agents. all methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus  aureus (mssa) isolates were susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. high rates  of nonsusceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin (mics, >/=2 microg/ml) were demonstrated for the following organisms: methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa)  (31%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (16%), streptococcus pneumoniae (8%), viridans group streptococci (51%), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (85%), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (100%), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (66%), leuconostoc spp. (100%), lactobacillus spp. (50%), and pediococcus spp. (87%). all isolates of mssa, mrsa, s. pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. the rates of nonsusceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin were 5 and 7%, respectively, for cons, ranging from 12 and 18% for s. simulans to 0 and 0% for s. cohnii and s. auricularis. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin had good activities  against these isolates except for ciprofloxacin-resistant vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. in taiwan, virginiamycin has been used in animal husbandry for more than 20 years, which may contribute to the high rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == we investigated activity of piperacillin (pipc) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. the following results were obtained: 1. pipc had  its mic90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in gram-positive bacteria (methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis) and showed its mic of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible prsp strains out of 38 isolates of s. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. pipc showed favorable antibacterial activities as its mic90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae), except for p. mirabilis in which its mic90  was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of p. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as pipc, abpc, ctm and czop. 3. pipc had its mic90  of > 128 micrograms/ml in bacteroides fragilis. from these results, pipc was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when  20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1997  and march 1998].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during the period from april 1997 to march 1998. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. a total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rate  of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic gram-positive bacteria and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated  from primary infections, followed by p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. we found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of s.  aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of enterococcus spp. the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of b. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of 9 antimicrobials against bacterial strains isolated from patients in intensive care units in brazil: mystic antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == multi-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly prevalent in hospital environments. bacterial resistance is an important problem, especially for practitioners in intensive care units (icus) because of the selective pressure on the prevalent bacteria in these environments. the mystic (meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection) study has been monitoring the performance of carbapenems and other antibiotics in different hospitals for at least 3 years. the in vitro activities of meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacilin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin were compared against 452 recent clinical aerobic isolates. the isolates consisted of 19 species of gram-negative bacteria (n=290) including k. pneumoniae (n=49), e. coli (n=48), a. baumannii (n=47), enterobacter spp. (n=41), and p. aeruginosa (n=33) and 9 species of gram-positive bacteria (n=162) including staphylococcus aureus (n=63), enterococcus faecalis (n=22), streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22) and coagulase negative staphylococci (n=21). all  isolates were collected from icu patients. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by etest methodology, using standardized and controlled procedures. meropenem and imipenem showed the lowest mic(90) for all species tested. gram-negative isolates showed the following overall resistance percentages to the other 7 drugs: tobramycin (43.1%), cefotaxime (38.6%), gentamicin (34.1%), ceftazidime (31.7%), ciprofloxacin (25.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26.9%), and cefepime (18.6%). carbapenems were the most  active drugs overall and only p. aeruginosa presented some degree of resistance (18.2%). we also evaluated the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) among all enterobacteriaceae members (n=176) by etest/esbl strip. esbl production was detected in 51 strains (29.0%). among them, klebsiella pneumoniae  was the most prevalent at 59.2%, followed by enterobacter spp. (19.5%) and e. coli (14.6%). the high level of resistance against several antimicrobials and the alarming rate of esbl production may restrict therapeutic choice to the carbapenems in this selected group of patients.

TI  == in vitro activity of monoclonal and recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antibodies against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == background: monoclonal (mabkt) and recombinant single-chain (scfvkt) anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced to represent the internal image of a yeast killer toxin (kt) characterized by a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including gram-positive cocci. pathogenic eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, and a multidrug-resistant strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis, presenting specific, although yet undefined, kt-cell wall receptors (ktr), have proven to be killed in vitro by mabkt and scfvkt. mabkt and scfvkt exert a therapeutic effect in vivo in experimental models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis by mimicking the functional activity of protective antibodies naturally produced in humans against ktr of infecting microorganisms. the swelling tide of concern over increasing bacterial  resistance to antibiotic drugs gives the impetus to develop new therapeutic compounds against microbial threat. thus, the in vitro bactericidal activity of mabkt and scfvkt against gram-positive, drug-resistant cocci of major epidemiological interest was investigated. materials and methods: mabkt and scfvkt generated by hybridoma and dna recombinant technology from the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with a kt-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mab kt4) were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay to determine, from a qualitative point of view, their bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae strains. these bacterial strains are characterized by different patterns of resistance to antibiotics, including methicillin, vancomycin, and penicillin. results: according to the experimental conditions adopted, no bacterial isolate proved to be resistant to the activity of mabkt and scfvkt. conclusions: scfvkt exerted a microbicidal activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, which may represent the basis for the drug modeling of new antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra to tackle the emergence of microbial resistance.

AB  == the mef gene, originally described for gram-positive organisms and coding for an  efflux pump, has been identified in clinical isolates of acinetobacter junii and  neisseria gonorrhoeae. these strains could transfer the mef gene at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) into one or more of the following recipients: gram-negative moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria perflava/sicca and neisseria mucosa and gram-positive enterococcus faecalis. three streptococcus pneumoniae strains could transfer the mef gene into eikenella corrodens, haemophilus influenzae, kingella denitrificans, m. catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, n. perflava/sicca, and n. mucosa at similar frequencies. the mef gene can thus be transferred to and expressed in a variety of gram-negative recipients.

AB  == in response to conflicting reports on the chemical stability of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a study was designed to assess the in vitro longevity  and effects of media and storage conditions on this streptogramin combination. broth microdilution trays containing parenteral (quinupristin/dalfopristin) and oral (rpr 106972) streptogramin combinations as well as pristinomycin components  (p-i and p-ii) were preincubated at 35 degrees c for 12-72 h before inoculation with control strains (streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213) and five clinical isolates with various drug resistance phenotypes. overall, the  mean quinupristin/dalfopristin activity loss was 24%/12 h, 41%/18 h, 43%/24 h, 69%/48 h and 79%/72 h with no detected loss of potency when measured by e. faecalis until 18 h. rpr 106972 mean activity loss was 6%/12 h, 19%/18 h, 19%/24  h, 56%/48 h and 71%/72 h with no loss of potency as measured by s. aureus until 48 h. overall, p-i components had greater stability as compared with p-ii for both drug combinations. bioassays showed similar trends in decreased activity. bioassay differences among media types were only significant (> 3 mm; greater loss of potency) for haemophilus test media for both p-ii components at 72 h. the presence of an organism in the medium had no effect on stability assay results. the effect of storage temperature (4, 25 degrees c) on quinupristin/dalfopristin  and rpr 106972 stability was also detrimental to drug potency indicating the requirement for rigid quality assurance for streptogramin diagnostic reagents when determining activity by reference or standardized susceptibility tests.

AB  == resistance among commonly isolated gram-positive cocci have compromised the available therapeutic regimens and require structured monitoring at the local, regional, national, and international levels. two popular treatment classes of antimicrobials (macrolides-lincosamines-streptogramins [mls], fluoroquinolones) have been tested against 3, 049 isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. the strains were  obtained from clinical cases in hospitals in the united states, canada, and six nations (10 medical centers )in latin america. mls and fluoroquinolone compounds  had moderate activity against vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis only (gatifloxacin, and trovafloxacin mic(50), 0.5 microg/ml), and quinupristin/dalfopristin was potent only against e.faecium isolates (mic(90), 1  microg/ml(-2) microg/ml). when tested against pneumococci, gatifloxacin, trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90), < or = 1 microg/ml)were most active among the newer drugs, but vancomycin and clindamycinn inhibited > or =99.8% and 84.7% to 99.1% of strains, respectively. these results  from a global resistance monitoring program should encourage rapid drug development. based on in vitro sensitivity testing, they indicate a promising role for the treatment of emerging resistant gram-positive cocci. the clinical role for each new agent will depend on safety profiles, rates of administration,  and other issues identified during development in the clinical trials process.

TI  == the gene encoding iiab(man)l in streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-pts (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic iiab protein, called iiab(man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. this paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the  specific components of the mannose-pts of streptococcus salivarius. the man operon was composed of four genes, manl, manm, mann and mano. these genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mrna that contained a 5'-utr (untranslated region). the predicted manl gene product encoded a 35.5 kda protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the iia and  iib phosphorylation sites already determined from purified s. salivarius iiab(man)l. expression of manl in escherichia coli generated a 35 kda protein that reacted with anti-iiab(man)l antibodies. the predicted manm protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kda. manm had similarity with iic domains of the mannose-eii family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-iic proteins from gram-negative bacteria. from multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified iic(man) signature is proposed: gx3g[dnh]x3g[livm]2xg2[stl][lt][eq]. the deduced product of mann was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kda. the mann protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the iid domains of the mannose-eii family. mano encoded a 13.7 kda protein. this gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mrna from a promoter located in the mann-mano intergenic region. a search of current databases revealed the presence of iiab(man)l, manm, mann and mano orthologues in streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. this work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose pts in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (mano) within the man operon.

AB  == in this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (lvfx) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (cpfx), ampicillin (abpc), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. the clinical isolates except vibrio cholerae were collected in japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. mics  were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the japan society of chemotherapy. some isolates of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and coagulase negative staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the mic50 of lvfx against mrsa was 6.25 micrograms/ml. lvfx was the most active against mrsa among the antibiotics tested. most of staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. lvfx showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. in particular, all streptococcus pneumoniae strains including prsp were susceptible to lvfx at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. among enterococcus, abpc showed superior activity against enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of enterococcus species were resistant to abpc. lvfx was more active against to these enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. on the other hand, lvfx and cpfx showed similar activity against isolates of enterobacteriaceae. cpfx had an mic50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and lvfx showed an mic50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa. lvfx (mic50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against acinetobacter species than cpfx (mic50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). haemophilus influenzae, branhamella (moraxella) catarrhalis and v. cholerae were  inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. the mic90 of lvfx  and cpfx were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. some isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae and campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the mic50 of lvfx and cpfx were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. among anaerobes, propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than  peptostreptococcus species, and the mic90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. in conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of lvfx compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. and  our results suggest that lvfx may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of mefloquine and a series of related compounds.
AB  == mefloquine was found to have bactericidal activity against methicillin- and fluoroquinolone-susceptible and -resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and gentamicin- and vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. the mics were 16 microg/ml, and the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were 16 to 32 microg/ml. these concentrations cannot be achieved in serum. mefloquine was active at a more achievable concentration against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with mics of 0.2 to 1.5 microg/ml. mefloquine was not active against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. in an attempt to find more active derivatives, 400 mefloquine-related compounds were selected from the chemical inventory of the walter reed army institute of research. we identified a series of compounds containing a piperidine methanol group attached to pyridine,  quinoline, and benzylquinoline ring systems. these had activities similar to that of mefloquine against s. pneumoniae but were far more active against other gram-positive bacteria (mics for staphylococci, 0.8 to 6.3 microg/ml). they had activities similar to that of amphotericin b against candida spp. and cryptococcus neoformans. combinations of the compounds with gentamicin and vancomycin were additive against staphylococci and pneumococci. the mic and mbc of gentamicin were decreased by four- to eightfold when this drug was combined with limiting dilutions of the compounds. there was no antagonism with other antimicrobial drugs. the compounds were rapidly bactericidal. they appear to act  by disrupting cell membranes. combinations of the compounds with aminoglycoside antibiotics may have potential for therapeutic use.

TI  == a comparison of antimicrobial resistance rates in gram-positive pathogens isolated in the uk from october 1996 to january 1997 and october 1997 to january  1998.
AB  == rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 teaching, nine associate teaching and nine district general hospitals) in the uk were compared.  combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in teaching  hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for associate teaching and district  general hospitals rates fell (associate teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; district general 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). using conventional methodology to determine mics, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. for streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). for enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year  1, 15.1% year 2, p = 0.0388). for enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin  and rifampicin.

TI  == quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. the combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), drug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus spp. the combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including moraxella catarrhalis, legioniella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against e. faecalis. the  combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. as for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against e. faecium. in patients with methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) or vref infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5  mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with vref infections. quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall  incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome p450 3a4 and therefore has  the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. conclusions: quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. in serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. however, in vref or unresponsive mrsa infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.

TI  == structure-activity relationships of novel 2-substituted quinazoline antibacterial agents.
AB  == high-throughput screening of in-house compound libraries led to the discovery of  a novel antibacterial agent, compound 1 (mic: 12-25 microm against s. pyogenes).  in an effort to improve the activity of this active compound, a series of 2-substituted quinazolines was synthesized and evaluated in several antibacterial assays. one such compound (22) displayed improved broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of bacterial strains. this molecule also inhibited transcription/translation of bacterial rna, suggesting a mechanism for its antibiotic effects. structure-activity relationship studies of 22 led to the synthesis of another 24 compounds. although some of these molecules were found to be active in bacterial growth assays, none were as potent as 22. compound 22 was  tested for its ability to cure a systemic k. pneumonia infection in the mouse and displayed moderate effects compared with a control antibiotic, gentamycin.

TI  == in vitro activity of levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of levofloxacin was investigated against 256 clinical strains of four gram-positive genera (staphylococcus, streptococcus, enterococcus, and listeria). ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used as comparators. uniform susceptibility to levofloxacin was recorded among methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae, regardless of their being susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to  penicillin (s. pneumoniae) or erythromycin (s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae), in enterococci other than enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, and in listeria monocytogenes isolates. moreover, 1 of 22 s. agalactiae isolates and 1 of 19 e. faecium isolates was resistant, and 2 of 19 were intermediate. resistances to levofloxacin with mic90s in the resistance range were only observed in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and e. faecalis isolates. in any case, the mics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were usually 2-4 times higher than those of levofloxacin. in time-kill assays using three test strains (a methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus isolate, a penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae isolate, and an e. faecalis isolate), the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.

AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. we compared the  in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. the susceptibility of 37 staphylococcus aureus (14 ms, 23 mr), 26 staphylococcus epidermidis (16 ms, 10 mr), 20 streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 group  a streptococcus pyogenes, 15 streptococcus agalactiae, 10 enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 enterococcus faecium (9 van a) was evaluated. quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all gram-positive species tested, including met-r s. aureus (mic < or = 2 mg/l), met-r s. epidermidis (mic < or = 2 mg/l), s. pneumoniae (mic < or = 1 mg/l), ery-r and ery-s streptococci (mic < or  = 1 mg/l). the strains of e. faecalis were generally less susceptible. time-kill  studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x mic concentration showed  a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. a post-antibiotic effect (pae) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x mic concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. a prolonged pae was obtained for s. pneumoniae (8 h), s. pyogenes (9 h) and s. agalactiae (7  h), while the shortest pae was seen for e. faecalis and e. faecium (about 4 h).

AB  == a series of analogues of, and potential pro-drugs derived from, the potent antibacterial diterpene totarol (1) were synthesized in order to elucidate the minimum structural requirements for antibacterial activity and to seek compounds  with good bioavailability in vivo. these analogues varied in the structural features of their aromatic rings and the prodrugs were o-glycosylated derivatives. they were tested in vitro against three gram-positive bacteria: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa); and against the gram-negative multi-drug-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae. none of the analogues was more potent than totarol itself, which is effective against these gram-positive bacteria at mic values of 7 microm. the results were evaluated in terms of a structure-activity relationship and this showed that a phenolic moiety was essential for potent antibacterial activity. amongst the pro-drugs, totaryl alpha-d-mannopyranoside (22) proved the most active in vitro (mic 18 microm). the in vivo antibacterial activities of compounds 1, 22 and totarol beta-lactoside (23) were assessed in a mouse model of infection, but they were found to be ineffective. compounds 1 and 22 were shown to be cytotoxic towards proliferating  human cell cultures, ch 2983, hela, and mg 63, but only at concentrations of > 30 microm.

AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == clpe, a novel type of hsp100 atpase, is part of the ctsr heat shock regulon of bacillus subtilis.
AB  == clp atpases, which include the ubiquitous hsp100 family, are classified according to their structural features and sequence similarities. during the course of the  bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project, we identified a gene encoding a new  member of the hsp100 family. we designated this protein clpe, as it is the prototype of a novel subfamily among the clp atpases, and have identified homologues in several bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, lactobacillus sakei and clostridium acetobutylicum. a unique feature of these hsp100-type clp atpases is their amino-terminal zinc finger motif. unlike the other class iii genes of b. subtilis (clpc and clpp ), clpe does not appear to be required for stress tolerance. transcriptional analysis revealed two sigmaa-type promoters, expression from which was shown to be inducible by heat shock and puromycin treatment. investigation of the regulatory mechanism controlling clpe expression  indicates that this gene is controlled by ctsr and is thus a member of the class  iii heat shock genes of b. subtilis. ctsr negatively regulates clpe expression by binding to the promoter region, in which five ctsr binding sites were identified  through dnase i footprinting and sequence analysis.

AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (gpc), gram-negative  bacillary (gnb), and fungal blood-stream infections (bsis) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. study design: case series. methods: demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven bsis was analyzed. early-onset bsis were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset bsis as those that occurred thereafter. suspected early-onset bsis were treated with ampicillin and  gentamicin, and suspected late-onset bsis with vancomycin and gentamicin. antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. results: early-onset bsis were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. gpc (83% due to group b streptococcus [gbs]) accounted for approximately one half of  early-onset bsi cases and gnb (68% enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. early-onset gbs declined from 24 to 11 cases (p=.04) and late-onset bsi increased from 111 to 230 cases (p<.01) from the first to the last study period. sixty-eight percent of late-onset bsis were due to gpc (primarily coagulase-negative staphylococcus), 18% to gnb, and 14% to fungus. over the study period, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and  gentamicin. although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn bsi cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 enterococcus faecalis isolates. all fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. conclusion: we observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset bsis due to gbs and an increase in late-onset bsis due to gpc, gnb, and fungi. the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset bsis and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset bsis has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.

TI  == an operon that confers uv resistance by evoking the sos mutagenic response in streptococcal conjugative transposon tn5252.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae rx1 is capable of repairing lesions caused by dna-damaging agents in an error-free manner but lacks a uv-inducible error-prone  repair system due to the absence of chromosomally encoded umudc-like proteins. we have identified an operon-like structure 8 kb from the left end of the pneumococcal conjugative transposon tn5252 that confers sos function in the host  cells. dna sequence analysis of this region revealed the presence of four open reading frames (orfs). the deduced amino acid sequence of one of them, orf13, which is capable of encoding a protein of 49.7 kda, showed significant homology to umuc, mucb, and other proteins involved in the sos response. the carboxy-terminal region of another, orf14, which is predicted to encode a 26-kda  polypeptide, shared similarity with umud- and muca-like proteins that carry the amino acid residues recognized by the activated reca* protein for proteolytic cleavage. the presence of plasmids carrying subcloned dna from this region was found to restore uv-inducible mutagenic repair of chromosomal dna in escherichia  coli cells defective in error-prone repair as well as in pneumococcus and enterococcus faecalis uv202. mutations within orf13 abolished uv-induced mutagenesis but did not affect the conjugal transposition of the element.

TI  == in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against clinical isolates of common gram-positive bacteria in taiwan.
AB  == the mics of quinupristin/dalfopristin against common gram-positive bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens at a university hospital in taiwan were  determined by the agar dilution method. the tested bacteria included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (msse), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. with the exception of e. faecalis all bacteria were susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. the mic50 and mic90 were, respectively, 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml for both mrsa and mssa; 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml for mrse; 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.25 microgram/ml for msse; 0.125 microgram/ml and 0.125 microgram/ml for s.  pyogenes; and < or = 0.03 microgram/ml and 0.25 microgram/ml for s. pneumoniae. eighty-two percent of the tested e. faecalis isolates were intermediately resistant or resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, with an mic50 of 2 micrograms/ml and an mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. quinupristin/dalfopristin seems to be a promising antimicrobial agent against common gram-positive bacteria other than e. faecalis in taiwan.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of pneumonia pathogens in newborns and problems of antibacterial therapy of the pathologic process].
AB  == the results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk  of the fetus intranatal infection. during the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), staphylococcus epidermidis, s. haemolyticus and enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. on the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. the study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the p. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin b, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. the s.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. when the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently  available antibiotics. because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.

TI  == [a consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci].
AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-positive  cocci and gram-negative cocci in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, streptococcus pyogenes (group a) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b) showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to ofloxacin (oflx) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (st), while  streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis showed slightly  decreasing tendency to cefaclor (ccl). however, these annual changes were almost  negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-positive and -negative cocci. however, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, cefmetazole (cmz), vancomycin (vcm), latamoxef (lmox), st and minocycline (mino) showed good activities against some of the gram-positive and -negative cocci to which no indication are approved. in conclusion, beside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents)  could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of an antimicrobial agent is necessary.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

AB  == seventy tetracycline-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae were tested for the presence of tetracycline resistance genes, tetm and teto, using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay and dna-dna hybridization. seven isolates representing five serotypes (12, 22, 6a, 19f and 23) carried the teto gene. five of the isolates were genetically unrelated as judged using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis. two 19f isolates came from the same patient, carried both tetm and teto genes and had the same pfge pattern. the other 63 isolates carried only the tetm gene. dna sequences from three of the teto-carrying isolates were determined; they showed 91-95% nucleotide sequence identity over 300 nucleotides, and 93-95% amino acid sequence identity over 100 amino acids. the isolates carrying both teto and tetm genes could transfer the tetm gene into both enterococcus faecalis and s. pneumoniae recipients, but not the teto gene. there was no detectable transfer of the teto gene, by conjugation, from the other five isolates.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of opc-20011, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum 2-oxaisocephem antibiotic.
AB  == opc-20011, a new parenteral 2-oxaisocephem antibiotic, has an oxygen atom at the  2- position of the cephalosporin frame. opc-20011 had the best antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae: mics at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were 6.25, 6.25, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. its activity is due to a high affinity of the penicillin-binding protein 2' in mrsa, an affinity which was approximately 1,050 times as high as that for flomoxef. against gram-negative bacteria, opc-20011 also showed antibacterial activities similar to those of ceftazidime. the in vivo activities of opc-20011 were comparable to or greater than those of reference compounds in murine models of systemic infection caused by gram-positive and -negative pathogens. opc-20011 was up to 10 times as effective as vancomycin against mrsa infections in mice. this better in vivo efficacy is probably due to the bactericidal activity of opc-20011, while vancomycin showed bacteriostatic activity against mrsa. opc-20011 produced a significant decrease of viable counts in lung tissue at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg of body weight, an efficacy similar to that of ampicillin at a dose of 10 to 20 mg/kg on an experimental murine model of respiratory tract infection caused by non-ampicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae t-0005. the better therapeutic efficacy  of opc-20011 was considered to be due to its potent antibacterial activity and low affinity for serum proteins of experimental animals (29% in mice and 6.4% in  rats).

TI  == bacteriological activity of trovafloxacin, a new quinolone, against respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  == the use of established fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, as  empirical therapy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe respiratory tract infections is limited by their poor activity against gram-positive and atypical pathogens. data from in vitro susceptibility studies and in vivo animal protection models suggest that the new fluoroquinolone, trovafloxacin, compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin offers equivalent activity against gram-negative pathogens and improved activity against gram-positive pathogens. in particular, susceptibility data indicate that trovafloxacin is at least 16-fold more potent than either ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae. other susceptible pathogens include streptococcus pyogenes, vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis and the atypical respiratory pathogens legionella pneumophila, mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae. in vivo studies involving models  of protection against acute systemic infection and pneumococcal pneumonia in mice, and legionnaires' disease in guinea pigs, indicate that the antibacterial spectrum observed for trovafloxacin in vitro extends to the in vivo setting. together, these findings suggest that trovafloxacin may offer clinical efficacy against respiratory pathogens superior to that of ciprofloxacin and of ofloxacin, and may find a useful role as empiric therapy in both the community and hospital  setting.

TI  == piperazinyl oxazolidinone antibacterial agents containing a pyridine, diazene, or triazene heteroaromatic ring.

TI  == use of the lactococcal nisa promoter to regulate gene expression in gram-positive bacteria: comparison of induction level and promoter strength.
AB  == we characterized the regulated activity of the lactococcal nisa promoter in strains of the gram-positive species streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and bacillus subtilis. nisa promoter activity was dependent on the proteins nisr and nisk, which constitute a two-component signal transduction system that responds to the  extracellular inducer nisin. the nisin sensitivity and inducer concentration required for maximal induction varied among the strains. significant induction of the nisa promoter (10- to 60-fold induction) was obtained in all of the species studied at a nisin concentration just below the concentration at which growth is  inhibited. the efficiency of the nisa promoter was compared to the efficiencies of the spac, xyla, and laca promoters in b. subtilis and in s. pyogenes. because  nisa promoter-driven expression is regulated in many gram-positive bacteria, we expect it to be useful for genetic studies, especially studies with pathogenic streptococci in which no other regulated promoters have been described.

AB  == twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of mics. the volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. the mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, n-demethyl-fleroxacin, and n-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the  total dose, respectively. the total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. in the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (ubt) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. with most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in cfu of 99.9% (3 log units). overall, there was a good correlation between ubts and mics for the strains. against escherichia coli atcc  25922 the median ubts were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the e. coli strain for which the mic was 0.5 microgram/ml the ubt was  at least 1:4 for 48 h. the ubts of both drugs against klebsiella pneumoniae were  at least 1:16 for 72 h. the ubts for staphylococcus aureus (the mic for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. ubts for proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the median ubts were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. the same is true for enterococcus faecalis. against staphylococcus saprophyticus, ubts were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of  fleroxacin exhibits ubts comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. therefore,  it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.

TI  == a new ketolide, hmr 3004, active against streptococci inducibly resistant to erythromycin.
AB  == hmr 3004 is a new hydrazono ketolide characterized by a 3-keto function instead of the cladinose moiety. the effect of this antimicrobial agent on inducible and  constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b (mlsb) resistance was tested in a lacz reporter system under control of several ermam-like attenuator variants. for one constitutively resistant streptococcus agalactiae strain, three inducibly resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, and one inducibly resistant enterococcus faecalis strain, the attenuators fused with lacz were cloned into the shuttle plasmid pjim2246 and the plasmid was introduced into staphylococcus aureus rn4220. for the wild-type attenuators, hmr 3004 was a very weak inducer, unlike its cladinose counterpart ru 6652 and erythromycin. as expected, for the fusion originating from the constitutively resistant s. agalactiae strain, the level of uninduced beta-galactosidase synthesis was high. for one s. pneumoniae attenuator, mutations in the 3' end of the attenuator that weakened the stem-loop structure that sequesters the ribosome-binding site and start codon for ermam methylase could explain the high level of uninduced beta-galactosidase produced.  for streptococci, the activity of hmr 3004 correlated with the basal level of beta-galactosidase synthesized. the weak inducer activity of hmr 3004 explained its activity against inducibly mlsb-resistant s. pneumoniae but did not correlate with the moderate activity of the antibiotic against inducibly resistant e. faecalis.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of nisin against multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == the rapid spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens necessitates the search for alternative antibacterial agents. we examined the efficacy of the antibiotic nisin against 56 multidrug-resistant isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 staphylococcus aureus and 29 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolates. the test strains represented a large  variety of clonal types (as determined by a combination of dna fingerprints) isolated from a variety of geographic sources, and included some of the major internationally-spread multiresistant epidemic clones of s. pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), mrsa strains resistant to over 16 generically distinct antibacterial agents, and enterococcal strains resistant to  all currently available chemotherapeutic agents including glycopeptides. in the overwhelming majority of cases, treatment of growing cultures with nisin at 1 mg/l (s. pneumoniae) or 10-20 mg/l (in mrsa and enterococci) caused extensive (10(3)- to 10(4)-fold) loss of viable titre accompanied by various degrees of loss in the optical density of the cultures, which was most extensive in pneumococci (>90%) and least extensive (40-50%) in enterococci. nevertheless, extensive variation in rates of nisin-induced autolysis was observed in each bacterial species. serial exposure of a penicillin-susceptible strain of s. pneumoniae to nisin (1 mg/l) in liquid culture resulted in the rapid appearance of stable nisin-resistant mutants in which the mic increased from 0.4 to 6.4 mg/l and the resistance trait was transferable by genetic transformation.

AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in-vitro and in-vivo activities of cfc-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. against gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, cfc-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to  sparfloxacin. against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of cfc-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. however, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in mouse systemic infection caused by s. aureus smith or s. aureus tms 33, cfc-222 demonstrated an activity similar  to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. the compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by streptococcus pyogenes atcc 8668. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. the activity of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against p. aeruginosa mb4-16 in the same infection model. these results suggest that cfc-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.

AB  == five monoclonal antibodies (mabs) were produced against the streptococcus pneumoniae pneumococcal surface adhesin a (psaa) 37-kda common cell wall protein. these antibodies were used in a dot immunoblot and western blot study of clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae to detect the presence of the protein. by both assays,  the mabs reacted with clinical isolates representing the 23 type-specific serotypes present in the licensed pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. western blot analysis confirmed the presence of a protein migrating in the gel with a molecular mass of 37 kda. an extension of the study by using dot immunoblot analysis that included an analysis of the 90 serotypes of s. pneumoniae showed that all five mabs reacted with 89 of the 90 serotypes tested. mab 1b6, the exception, did not react with s. pneumoniae serotype 16f. dot immunoblot analysis of the mabs with enterococcus faecalis and viridans streptococci showed varied reactivity patterns, depending on the species. the mabs against the 37-kda antigen did not react with escherichia coli, respiratory pathogens, or nonpathogens representing 22 genera and 29 species of bacteria. all five mabs also reacted with five multidrug-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae. in summary,  these mabs may be useful for detection of pneumococcal antigen and may lead to the development of diagnostic assays for pneumococcal disease.

TI  == discovery of novel pyridinopolyamines with potent antimicrobial activity: deconvolution of mixtures synthesized by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry.
AB  == a 1638-member pyridinopolyamine library, consisting of 13 sublibraries of 126 members prepared by a solution-phase approach, was completely deconvoluted from orthogonally protected intermediates by a combination of iterative and positional scanning procedures. antibacterial assays against streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli imp- and a candida albicans yeast specificity assay were employed to follow the activity of sublibraries. screening of the 13 sublibraries, which were prepared by a synthetic method that places the differentiating functionality in a selected position a (secondary amine), at the  end of the synthesis (fix last), provided several first-round activities. subsequently, six single pyridinopolyamines (2-7) were prepared where the first-round winner, a hydrogen atom, is in the first deconvoluted position and the remaining three positions contained the same functionalities. the range of antibacterial and yeast activities of these single compounds suggested that a more active and selective compound may be discovered by completely deconvoluting  the first-round active sublibraries. pyridinopolyamine positions b (secondary benzylamine) and c (primary benzylamine) were then sequentially positionally scanned with a set of six meta-substituted benzyl functionalities to generate two sets of second/third-round sublibraries, containing 21 or 36 compounds in each sublibrary, respectively. high-throughput screening yielded sublibraries 15, 18,  and 21 with mics of 1-5 microm against s. pyogenes and e. coli imp-. using rounds 1 and 2/3 screening data, two sets of single compounds (22-27) and (28-32) with the combination of m-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl group at position c and m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl or m-methylbenzyl group at position b with position d (primary benzylamine) fixed were synthesized in the fourth round deconvolution. subsequently, broader screening of deconvoluted compounds against a tier ii panel of wild-type bacteria identified eight compounds (5, 7, 27, and 29-32) with approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, s. pyogenes, s. pyogenes (wild-type), streptomyces aureus, and enterococcus faecalis were inhibited at mics of 1-12 microm, whereas mics for e.  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were >  100 microm. these eight compounds were not active (> 100 microm) against fungus c. albicans.

AB  == repetitive sequence-based pcr was compared to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) for the ability to discriminate enterococcus faecalis isolates at the subspecies level. the boxa2r primer, derived from repetitive sequences in streptococcus pneumoniae, was applied to 41 isolates of e. faecalis collected from various sources. the rep1r-dt and rep2-dt primers, derived from the gram-negative repetitive extragenic palindromic element, were also applied to 18  selected isolates. of the 41 isolates examined, 7 were beta-lactamase producing and 8 were vancomycin resistant. by pfge, 17 isolates had distinct patterns; the  other 24 were classified into eight different clonal groups. by pcr using the boxa2r primer, 16 isolates generated distinct patterns; the other 25 were classified into nine different clonal groups. there were only minor differences in the pcr results obtained by using the boxa2r primer and the rep1r-dt and rep2-dt primers. two isolates among vancomycin-resistant enterococci from the greater houston, tex., area were related by pfge, distinct by pcr with the boxa2r primer, and related by pcr with the rep1r-dt and rep2-dt primers. clonal relationships among the remaining 39 isolates were similar by both pfge and pcr.  pcr reliably discriminated all epidemiologically unrelated isolates. although pcr is less time consuming than pfge, pcr results were more difficult to interpret than pfge results, perhaps because fewer bands were generated by pcr than by pfge and some pcr products were inconsistently seen.

TI  == [comparative antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  == rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which  are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  == very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. this study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (biomerieux vitek, hazelwood, mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents,  including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. mics of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarblue; accumed international, westlake, ohio). this study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococcus species, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in some instances, the mics were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. the proposed in-flight experiment will  include inoculation of the vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of mics by the mission's astronauts. ground-based studies have shown reproducible mics following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees c to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. for comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) mic values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation  of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. this procedure  can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.

AB  == rpr 106972 is a novel oral streptogramin combination with reported therapeutic potency against gram-positive and certain respiratory tract pathogens. mics for rpr 106972, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and seven comparison drugs were determined by the reference methods against 337 strains selected to define spectrum and potency. rpr 106972 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic ranges of 0.12 to 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml, respectively), and coagulase-negative staphylococci were also inhibited by rpr 106972 (mic90, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml)  and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic90, < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). against all streptococcal strains tested (including penicillin-resistant pneumococcus), rpr 106972 was highly active with mic results at < or = 1 microgram/ml. rpr 106972 inhibited corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml), and some haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 2 micrograms/ml). rpr 106972 and quinupristin/dalfopristin demonstrated little activity against enterococcus faecalis (mic90s, 4 to 32 micrograms/ml) as compared to enterococcus faecium (mic90s, 0.5 to 1 microgram/ml) and other enterococcus ssp. (mic90s, 1 microgram/ml). studies to establish mic quality-control guidelines indicated the following ranges: for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml; for s. aureus atcc 29213, 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml;  and for streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml. the results of this study indicate that the in vitro activity of rpr 106972 against gram-positive bacteria and selected gram-negative respiratory organisms is promising and warrants additional studies of pharmacokinetics, and in vivo infection model dynamics.

TI  == differential induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in whole blood by  bacteria: effects of antibiotic treatment.
AB  == the in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), il-6, and the il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, capnocytophaga canimorsus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines il-1beta, il-6, and il-1ra. gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. these  differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-1ra. in addition, blood was stimulated with e. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. e. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher  levels of il-1beta and il-6 production but levels of il-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed e. coli. in contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed e. coli; polymyxin b decreased the level of production of the cytokines.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of ru-59863, a c-7 catechol substituted cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ru-59863, a so-called "fifth generation" catechol cephalosporin, was evaluated against 606 bacterial isolates and compared with the activities of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, and cefpirome. ru-59863 demonstrated a broad spectrum of inhibition and superior overall activity than comparators when tested against enterobacteriaciae (mic90s, 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml), acinetobacter ssp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus ssp. (mic90s,  0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml). potent ru-59863 activity was also observed against beta-haemolytic and viridans gr. streptococci (mic90s, 0.12-0.5 microgram/ml), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90s, 0.03 to 0.5 microgram/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). ru-59863 demonstrated marginal potency against enterococcus faecalis (mics 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and was inactive against enterococcus faecium (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml). oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were not  inhibited by ru-59863 (mic90s, 32 to 128 micrograms/ml). among the cephalosporins tested, ru-59863 performed best versus ceftazidime-resistant bush group 1 isolates and strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. ru-59863 was also effective against many fluoroquinolone-, aminoglycoside-, and imipenem-resistant isolates. ru-59863 seems to be a significant advance in cephalosporin chemistry and activity, especially against gram-negative pathogens  resistant to current beta-lactam therapeutic agents. further studies of human pharmacokinetics and against clinical infections are encouraged.

TI  == detection of the phosphorylcholine epitope in streptococci, haemophilus and pathogenic neisseriae by immunoblotting.
AB  == the phosphorylcholine (pc) determinant in streptococcus pneumoniae is known to be linked to the cell wall polysaccharides (c-ps) and to the lipoteichoic acid (lta) (forssman antigen) of the plasma membrane. western blotting with two pc specific  murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) designated 145,f-2 (igm) and 147,a-1 (iga) showed a similar ladder-like pattern for all examined strains of s. pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis. purified antigens run in parallel indicated that this ladder pattern is due to the pc of lta. unlike other techniques, western blotting thus enables the identification of only one of the streptococcal structures carrying the pc epitope. gram-negative organisms were also examined, and six of 11 haemophilus influenzae strains reacted with the mabs. for this species, unlike the streptococci, only one fast moving band was detected. analyses by thin-layer  chromatography (tlc) detected the pc epitope in lipopolysaccharide (lps) fraction from h. influenzae. some strains of the neisseriaceae family were also positive by western blotting, but tlc and immunostaining did not detect the pc determinant in lps.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of du-6681a, a parent compound of dz-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and mic90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively. mic90s of du-6681a  were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic50 and mic90 of du-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a  activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) cfu), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to du-6681a was less  than or equal to those of the reference compounds. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of du-6681a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and h. influenzae.

TI  == development of provisional disc diffusion breakpoints for testing quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is an injectable streptogramin with broad activity against many gram-positive bacteria, including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. although a number of studies have reported the mics of this compound against a variety of bacteria, there are no published reports of disc diffusion testing. we tested total disc masses of 7.5 and 15 micrograms with varying ratios of the component compounds, quinupristin and dalfopristin, combined in the following quinupristin: dalfopristin ratios (in microgram): 7.5:0, 0:7.5, 10:5, 5:10, 5:2.5 and 2.5:5. zone diameters and mics were determined in parallel for 44 isolates of staphylococci, 47 isolates pneumococci and 64 isolates of enterococci. control strains were included for each species tested, including a strain of enterococcus faecalis with known resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin. using tentative definitions for quinupristin/dalfopristin of < or = 2 mg/l as susceptible and > or = 4 mg/l as resistant, each of the four discs containing ratios of both component compounds separated presumptive susceptible organisms from resistant ones better than either quinupristin or dalfopristin alone. the best correlation of zone sizes and mics for predicting susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin at an mic of < or = 2 mg/l was achieved with the 5 micrograms:10 micrograms disc and a zone diameter of > or = 18 mm. these criteria may be useful for identifying organisms  that are presumptively susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin.

TI  == limited diversity of streptococcus pneumoniae psaa among pneumococcal vaccine serotypes.
AB  == the pneumococcal surface adhesin a (psaa) is a surface-exposed protein of the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae. it belongs to a group of proteins designated the lipoprotein receptor i antigen family. the gene encoding  psaa from an encapsulated strain of pneumococcal serotype 6b was cloned and sequenced. the peptide sequence was compared to that of homologs found in s. pneumoniae serotype 2, viridans streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis. identity values among the deduced peptides ranged from 57 to 98%. the polymorphism of psaa was examined among the 23 encapsulated vaccine serotypes by using pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. ten different enzymes were used to analyze 80 strains representing the 23 serotypes in a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine. this analysis showed that restriction sites within the gene were highly conserved, with only a minor variation occurring in 10% of the strains, the result of an additional tsp509i site. the lack of variation for the other restriction sites within the gene examined here indicates that psaa is genetically conserved, an important characteristic necessary for a candidate common protein vaccine.

TI  == use of an excision reporter plasmid to study the intracellular mobility of the conjugative transposon tn916 in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == an excision reporter plasmid was constructed to characterize the intracellular mobility of tn916 in various gram-positive bacteria. the reporter component of this plasmid is a chloramphenicol-resistance gene which has been insertionally inactivated with the integrative vector pat112 containing the attachment site of  tn916. tn916-mediated excision of pat112, to produce clones resistant to chloramphenicol, was detected in enterococcus faecalis bm4110, listeria monocytogenes l028-str and streptococcus gordonii bm120, but not in lactococcus lactis mg1363-rf or in streptococcus pneumoniae bm124, and always depended upon the ability of the bacterial host to generate circular forms of the transposon. the results suggest that (i) the excision event, although required, is not sufficient for conjugal transfer to occur and (ii) there is no linear relationship between the donor potential of e. faecalis strains and either the excision frequency of pat112 or the copy number of tn916 circular intermediates per cell in these hosts. excision of pat112 occurred mainly during the late exponential phase of growth of e. faecalis and l. monocytogenes and this recombination event was not stimulated by heat shock, salt and alcohol stresses or by the presence of tetracycline in the medium.

TI  == plasmid integration in a wide range of bacteria mediated by the integrase of lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  == bacteriophage mv4 is a temperate phage infecting lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. during lysogenization, the phage integrates its genome into the host  chromosome at the 3' end of a trna(ser) gene through a site-specific recombination process (l. dupont et al., j. bacteriol., 177:586-595, 1995). a nonreplicative vector (pmc1) based on the mv4 integrative elements (attp site and integrase-coding int gene) is able to integrate into the chromosome of a wide range of bacterial hosts, including lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei  (two strains), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. integrative recombination of pmc1 into the chromosomes  of all of these species is dependent on the int gene product and occurs specifically at the pmc1 attp site. the isolation and sequencing of pmc1 integration sites from these bacteria showed that in lactobacilli, pmc1 integrated into the conserved trna(ser) gene. in the other bacterial species where this trna gene is less or not conserved; secondary integration sites either in potential protein-coding regions or in intergenic dna were used. a consensus sequence was deduced from the analysis of the different integration sites. the comparison of these sequences demonstrated the flexibility of the integrase for the bacterial integration site and suggested the importance of the trinucleotide  cct at the 5' end of the core in the strand exchange reaction.

TI  == cell-cell communication in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == in gram-positive bacteria, many important processes are controlled by cell-to-cell communication, which is mediated by extracellular signal molecules produced by the bacteria. most of these signaling molecules are peptides or modified peptides. signal processing, in most cases, involves either transduction across the cytoplasmic membrane or import of the signal and subsequent interaction with intracellular effectors. concentrations of signal in the nanomolar range or below are frequently sufficient for biological activity. the microbial processes controlled by extracellular signaling include the expression  of virulence factors, the expression of gene transfer functions, and the production of antibiotics.

AB  == isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from july  1994 to june 1995 were investigated by a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. one hundred and fifty-three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 143 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. from primary infections, both anaerobic gram-positive and-negative bacteria were predominant, and from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was highest, followed by that of staphylococcus aureus from both types of infections. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of streptococcus intermedius was highest from primary infections, but from postoperative infections anaerobic gram-positive bacteria was uncommon. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order. from  postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by serratia marcescens and e. coli. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. we have noticed that resistant strains against imipenem and ofloxacin were increasing among p. aeruginosa and resistant strains against cefazolin were  increasing among e. coli. mics of cefazolin against four out of 30 strains of e.  coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and mics of imipenem was higher than 50  micrograms/ml against 5 out of 22 strains of p. aeruginosa.

TI  == semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from ly264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin  and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of lb10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  == in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml  was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.

TI  == influence of lipoteichoic acid structure on recognition by the macrophage scavenger receptor.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) belong to the immunostimulatory class of molecules of gram-positive bacteria (gpb). previous investigations showed that the macrophage  scavenger receptor (sr), a glycosylated trimeric transmembrane protein, binds directly to many gpb, possibly via lta. sr binding to other ligands is dependent  upon the spatial characteristics of the repeating negative charge of the ligand.  we therefore investigated sr recognition of lta species with various charge densities and distributions by determining the capacity of these ltas to compete  with the binding of metabolically labeled sr to beads coated with the known sr ligand polyguanylic acid. staphylococcus aureus lta, a classical lta type (unbranched 1,3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain covalently bound to a membrane  diacylglyceroglycolipid), had a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) for inhibition of sr binding of 0.84 microg/ml. when the s. aureus lta was rendered more negatively charged by removal of ester-linked alanine from the polyglycerophosphate backbone, the ic50 dropped to 0.23 microg/ml. other polyglycerophosphate ltas from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, listeria monocytogenes, listeria welshimeri, and streptococcus sanguis showed ic50s of 0.5 to 2.1 microg/ml, supporting the role of negative charge in binding to sr. accordingly, the zwitterionic lta of streptococcus pneumoniae and clostridium innocuum lta substituted with positively charged sugar residues had no binding capacity. monoglycerophosphate branches, but not succinyl ester, affected binding of lipoglycans. the data presented above parallel the previous findings for whole organisms and support the role of surface-associated lta as a major ligand of gpb for binding to sr. whether binding of lta and whole gpb to macrophages initiates uptake and degradation or results in signal transduction remains to be determined.

TI  == rapid identification of streptococcus and enterococcus species using diffuse reflectance-absorbance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and artificial neural networks.
AB  == diffuse reflectance-absorbance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ft-ir) was used to analyse 19 hospital isolates which had been identified by conventional means to one enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, streptococcus bovis, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes. principal components analysis of the ft-ir spectra showed that this 'unsupervised' learning method failed to form six  separable clusters (one of each species) and thus could not be used to identify these bacteria base on their ft-ir spectra. by contrast, artificial neural networks (anns) could be trained by 'supervised' learning (using the back-propagation algorithm) with the principal components scores of derivatised spectra to recognise the strains from their ft-ir spectra. these results demonstrate that the combination of ft-ir and anns provides a rapid, novel and accurate bacterial identification technique.

TI  == in vivo activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  == the upjohn oxazolidinones, u-100592 and u-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. in several mouse models of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection, u-100592 and u-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ed50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ed50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. similarly, both compounds were active versus a staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. u-100592 and u-100766 effectively cured an enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ed50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with ed50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. in soft tissue infection models with s. aureus and e. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. u-100766 was also very active versus the bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ed50 = 46.3 mg/kg).  in combination-therapy studies, both u-100592 and u-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic s. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic s. aureus-escherichia coli infection. u-100592 and u-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.

TI  == direct application of etest to gram-positive cocci from blood cultures: quick and reliable minimum inhibitory concentration data.
AB  == the etest was applied directly to 100 gram-positive bacterial strains from blood  cultures to measure their minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). results showed  100% concordance of mic data between a direct etest method and the standard etest method for streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. in addition, direct etest for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus faecalis showed 83 to 100% correlation with standard etests. these data indicate that the  etest is useful to obtain mic data on gram-positive cocci (especially streptococci) directly from positive blood cultures. the advantages of a direct etest are two fold: mic results can be obtained 24 hours earlier than standard methods and a more representative population of the bacterial isolate is tested.

TI  == the tetracycline resistance gene tet(m) exhibits mosaic structure.
AB  == tetracycline resistance genes of the m class, tet(m), are typically found on mobile genetic elements as the conjugative transposons of gram-positive bacteria. by comparing the sequences of eight different tet(m) genes (from enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ureaplasma urealyticum, and neisseria), a mosaic structure was detected which could be traced to two distinct alleles. the two alleles displayed a divergence of 8% and  a different g/c content. the block structure of these genes provides evidence for the contribution of homologous recombination to the evolution and the heterogeneity of the tet(m) locus. unlike described cases of chromosomally located mosaic loci, tet(m) is a relatively recently acquired determinant in the  species examined and it would appear that mosaic structure within tet(m) has evolved after acquisition of the gene by the mobile genetic elements upon which it is located.

TI  == in vitro activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  == oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. u-100592 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and u-100766 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. mics were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective mics of u-100592 and u-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. aureus, 4  and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2  micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. most strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (vana, vanb, and vanc resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and m. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. the  presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. the spontaneous mutation frequencies of s. aureus atcc 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for u-100592 and u-100766, respectively. serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem, were evaluated in comparison with imipenem (ipm), meropenem (mepm), ceftazidime (caz)  and flomoxef (fmox). sulopenem had broad and potent antibacterial spectra against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterococcus faecalis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii. sulopenem showed concentration-dependent bactericidal activities against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. morphological observation using phase-contrast microscope revealed that sulopenem induced spherical cell formation with e. coli  and k. pneumoniae at lower concentrations and bacteriolysis at higher concentrations. therapeutic efficacies of sulopenem against systemic infections in mice were almost equal to those of imipenem against streptococcus pneumoniae.  while its therapeutic efficacies were superior to those of meropenem, ceftazidime and flomoxef against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae, they were inferior to those of  imipenem/cilastatin against s. aureus, k. pneumoniae and a. calcoaceticus.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble cd14.
AB  == in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. lps-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte lps receptor, scd14. we evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial e-selectin and tissue factor expression through scd14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huve). both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, and klebsiella pneumoniae) but not  viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent e-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. tissue factor activity  on huve, indicated by factor x activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in huve, indicated by the appearance of e-selectin-specific mrna and by the demonstration of activation of nf-kappa b, a trans-activating factor necessary for e-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. in contrast, neither e-selectin mrna nor activation of nf-kappa b was detected in huve treated with gram-positive bacteria. endothelial  cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against cd14. furthermore, cho-k1 cells, transfected with human recombinant cd14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by cho-k1 nf-kappa b activation. we conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common scd14-dependent pathway.

TI  == controlled evaluation of bact/alert standard anaerobic and fan anaerobic blood culture bottles for the detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  == fan medium was formulated to improve microbial recovery, particularly for fastidious microorganisms and for microorganisms causing sepsis in patients receiving antimicrobial therapy. in a controlled clinical evaluation performed at four university-affiliated hospitals, fan anaerobic bottles were compared with standard anaerobic bottles for yield, speed of detection of microbial growth, and detection of septic episodes. a total of 10,431 blood culture sets were received; both anaerobic bottles of 7,694 blood culture sets were adequately filled with blood. altogether, 925 isolates were recovered: 557 that were the cause of sepsis, 99 that were indeterminate as the cause of sepsis, and 269 contaminants.  more staphylococcus aureus (p < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (p < 0.001), escherichia coli (p < 0.02), and all microorganisms combined (p < 0.005)  were recovered from fan bottles; more nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (p <  0.05), torulopsis glabrata (p < 0.001), and other yeasts (p < 0.01) were recovered from standard bottles. growth of s. aureus (p < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (p < 0.001), enterococcus faecalis (p < 0.025),  streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae (p < 0.01), and all microorganisms combined (p < 0.001) was detected earlier in standard bottles; growth of more isolates of e. coli (p < 0.05) and anaerobic bacteria (p < 0.01) was detected earlier in fan bottles. the mean times to detection were 14.2 and 16.1 h for standard and fan bottles, respectively. more septic episodes caused by s. aureus (p < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (p < 0.005), members of the family enterobacteriaceae (p < 0.02), and all microorganisms combined (p < 0.02) were detected in fan bottles; more septic episodes caused by nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (p < 0.025) and yeasts (p < 0.005) were detected in standard bottles. in summary, more isolates (except for strict aerobes) were recovered from fan bottles than from standard anaerobic bottles. similarly, significant more septic episodes (except for those caused by strict aerobes) were detected with fan bottles than with standard anaerobic bottles. with the exception of e. coli and anaerobic bacteria, growth of more isolates was detected earlier in standard anaerobic bottles.

TI  == characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of some novel 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-pyridinyl-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids. potent antistaphylococcal agents.
AB  == the palladium-catalyzed coupling of 3- and 4-(trialkylstannyl)pyridines with 7-bromo or 7-chloro 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylates has provided access to the corresponding 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-pyridinyl-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids. the antibacterial activity of these derivatives was studied with the finding that the optimal 1- and 7-position substituents for gram positive activity are cyclopropyl and 4-(2,6-dimethylpyridinyl), respectively. we find that for the fluorine-substituted derivatives studied, the position of the fluorine on the quinolone nucleus or the number of fluorine atoms does not seem to be important for good gram positive activity. for 1-cyclopropyl 7-(2,6-dimethyl-4-pyridinyl) derivatives, the 6-fluoro 4a, 8-fluoro 10d, 6,8-difluoro 10b, and 5,6,8-trifluoro 8, all provided equal antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213. there is also a correlation between the substitution on the 7-(4-pyridinyl) group and the gram positive activity, particularly for s. aureus, clearly indicating that the 2,6-dimethylpyridinyl group is optimal. the mic50 value for the most potent agents in this study against s. aureus atcc 29213 is 0.008 microgram/ml. by comparison, ciprofloxacin and aminopyrrolidine 28 gave values of 0.25 and 0.015 microgram/ml, respectively, against this organism.

TI  == synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. to investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (ctx), desacetylcefotaxime (des), and ofloxacin (ofl), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between ctx, des and ofl was demonstrable for 89 (81%). included in the study were 70 members of the enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of xanthomonas maltophilia. additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. organisms tested included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (10), enterococcus faecalis (10), and streptococcus pneumoniae (20). synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the bacteroides fragilis group. of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). isolates representative of each major group  of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == efficacies of abt-719 and related 2-pyridones, members of a new class of antibacterial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  == the 2-pyridones are a new class of broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antibacterial agents. these compounds are potent bacterial dna gyrase inhibitors  which differ from fluoroquinolones by placement of the nitrogen atom in the ring  juncture. abt-719 is an s isomer and a representative 2-pyridone. abt-719 administered orally or subcutaneously was 4- to 10-fold more effective than ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes infections in normal mice. abt-719 was equivalent in efficacy to ciprofloxacin for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa or escherichia coli. the racemate and r forms of abt-719 produced similar results against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. the 50% effective doses of abt-719 were at least threefold  lower than those of ciprofloxacin for therapy of intracellular infections caused  by salmonella typhimurium or listeria monocytogenes. in immunosuppressed mice, abt-719 was more effective than ciprofloxacin against quinolone-sensitive s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. the pharmacokinetic properties of abt-719 were consistent with its relative efficacy. the 2-pyridones are potent, orally available antibacterial agents with efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections in mice.

(b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

TI  == cloning of an enterococcus faecalis endocarditis antigen: homology with adhesins  from some oral streptococci.
AB  == serum from a patient with enterococcus faecalis endocarditis was used to identify the gene efaa cloned in lambda zapii in escherichia coli. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 924-bp open reading frame encoding a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 34,768. the amino acid sequence of efaa shows 55 to 60% homology to a group of streptococcal proteins, fima from streptococcus parasanguis, ssab from streptococcus sanguis, scaa from streptococcus gordonii, and psaa from streptococcus pneumoniae. members of this group have been shown to  be adhesins, and we hypothesize that efaa may function as an adhesin in endocarditis.

TI  == the effects of x-ray contrast media on bacterial growth.
AB  == six widely used x-ray contrast media (xrc) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using xrc to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of  using xrc in divided doses to reduce cost. preparations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/ml (cfu/ml) were inoculated into the following xrc: conray 280, hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, omnipaque 350, ultravist 300 and optiray 320 each in two concentrations. sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees c and 4 degrees c. there were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the gram-negative organisms. conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. most effects were bacteriostatic. organisms were  most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with xrc. no effect was seen with dilute xrc. all weekly sterility checks were negative. non-ionic xrc have no significant effect on the growth of gram-positive organisms and little effect on gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of xrc occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of xrc utilization.

TI  == [the present and future problems of resistance in staphylococci, streptococci and m. tuberculosis].
AB  == mechanisms of resistance of strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, neisseria meningitidis and mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics are presented and discussed. the resistance to methicillin-oxacillin in s. aureus and s. epidermidis is chromosomally-mediated by sequence of dna, namely by gene meca. this gene codes altered pbp-2a protein. strains of s.pneumoniae contain pbp-1a, pbp-2b and pbp-2x proteins. they cause resistance to many beta-lactam antibiotics. resistance to vankomycin, respectively to teikoplanin in strains of  e. faecalis and e. faecium is coded by transferable vana and vanb genes. strains  of n. meningitidis produce mostly the altered pbp-2 protein. the increase of resistance in strains of m. tuberculosis is also significant.

TI  == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of streptococcus pneumoniae in southwest germany as determined by the e test.
AB  == we have studied the prevalence of anti-microbial resistance of streptococcus pneumoniae in southwest germany. one hundred seventy-four clinical isolates of pneumococci collected from hospitalized patients between october 1992 and april 1994 were used for mic determinations. mics for penicillin, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, and rifampicin were assessed by the e test. eleven of the 174 strains (6.3%) were intermediately resistant to penicillin (mic between 0.1 and 1.0 microgram/ml) and four of the 174 strains (2.3%) were intermediately resistant to ceftriaxone (mic between 0.1 and 1.0 microgram/ml). all four isolates with a reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone also demonstrated intermediate resistance to penicillin. six of the 174 strains (3.5%) were highly  resistant (mic > or = 8 micrograms/ml) to erythromycin. resistance to rifampicin  was not observed. our results demonstrate that pneumococcal resistance to penicillin and erythromycin has increased markedly in germany over the last decade. our findings underline the need for continuous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of streptococcus pneumoniae.

AB  == in vitro activities of broad-spectrum quinolones (sparfloxacin (spfx), ciprofloxacin (cpfx), lomefloxacin (lflx), fleroxacin (flrx), and levofloxacin (lvfx) were examined against clinical bacterial isolates: klebsiella pneumoniae,  haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae). antibacterial activities of spfx, cpfx, and lvfx against gram-negative bacteria such as k. pneumoniae, m. (b) catarrhalis and h. influenzae were better than those of flrx and lflx. spfx showed the highest activity against all gram-positive bacteria tested in this study. however, strains showed high mic (> or = 16 micrograms/ml) to spfx were found among mrsa,  e. faecalis, and e. faecium, whose isolation frequencies were 28.6%, 10.0%, and 6.7%, respectively. the results of this study suggest that resistant strains of gram-positive bacteria against new quinolone might increase among clinical isolates.

TI  == agar disk diffusion (bauer-kirby) tests with various fastidious and nonfastidious reference (atcc) strains: comparison of several agar media.
AB  == several agar media (mueller-hinton agar, mha; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, dsta; schaedler agar, scha; todd-hewitt agar with added yeast extract, thya; wilkins-chalgren agar, wca) were compared using the bauer-kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: staphylococcus  aureus atcc 25923 and atcc 29213, escherichia coli atcc 25922 and atcc 35218, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212. mha, dsta, and thya yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. however, wca and  scha antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, scha  antagonized polymyxin b, and both wca and scha antagonized imipenem against the p. aeruginosa strain, but not against the e. coli strains. sheep blood-mha (bl-mha), wca, thya, and dsta were examined with streptococcus pyogenes atcc 19615, streptococcus agalactiae atcc 13813, and streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 6306. in comparison with bl-mha, both wca and thya yielded comparable inhibition  zones against s. pyogenes; dsta afforded suboptimal growth. dsta yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against s. agalactiae,  whereas wca and thya enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin g against  this strain. s. pneumoniae strain atcc 6306 grew well on bl-mha, yielded suboptimal growth on wca and faint growth on thya, and failed to grow on dsta. chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-mha (choc-mha) was compared with haemophilus test medium (htm), wca with added nad, and thya with added hematin and nad against haemophilus influenzae strains atcc 35056 and atcc 49247. the activities  of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by htm, wca+nad, and thya+hematin+nad. only wca+nad antagonized cotrimoxazole against both h. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, htm antagonized cotrimoxazole against s. aureus atcc 25923 and e. coli atcc 25922. it was concluded that bl-mha performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. likewise, choc-mha was optimal for the two h. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.

TI  == streptococcal update. a microbiology perspective.
AB  == the streptococci remain important human pathogens despite it being nearly 60 years since sulphonamides were introduced. rheumatic fever and post glomerulonephritis are common diseases in the aboriginal community, and a new invasive disease, toxic shock-like syndrome, is also caused by group a streptococcus. group b, first described over 50 years ago in obstetric wards remains the primary neonatal pathogen despite attempts to eliminate this organism from the genital tract of the carrier mother. a major concern in paediatrics is the relatively poor response to the current pneumococcal vaccines. australian researchers are playing a major role in developing a new vaccine with high antigenicity against all of the 100 odd serotypes of s pneumoniae. the oral streptococci are now recognised as important opportunistic pathogens and the pathogenesis is well defined. disturbing reports from different geographical regions alert us to the antibiotic resistance in some of the streptococci once thought of as sensitive bacteria, for example, group a has shown resistance to erythromycin, the pneumococcus to penicillin and beta-lactam antibiotics and the  aminoglycosides have been ineffective against the enterococci due to plasmid-borne genes.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for sultamicillin (sbtpc), and for other major oral beta-lactam agents against clinically isolated  strains collected from outpatients during a period from august, 1992 to february, 1993, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of penicillinase  (pcase)-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus was 96.0% and that of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was 12.0%. mic90 of sbtpc against s. aureus including mrsa was 6.25 micrograms/ml. no increasing tendency was observed for s. aureus resistant to sbtpc. 2. no resistant strains were found among streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis against penicillins (pcs) including sbtpc. but pcs and cephems (ceps) insensitive or resistant streptococcus pneumoniae were observed in 22.0% among all the strains of s. pneumoniae. 3. 100% of the tested both strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were beta-lactamase producers. 12.0% of the tested strains of haemophilus influenzae and 16.0% of the strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae were also beta-lactamase producers. sbtpc showed strong antimicrobial activity against most of these beta-lactamase producing strains. however, in our study of beta-lactamase productivity using plural substrates and test methods, it appeared that a part of strains of e. coli might produce beta-lactamase of "extended broad-spectrum". mics of sbtpc and ceps against those strains were distributed rather in a high range. 4. the results of the study suggested that the resistant  strains of s. pneumoniae against pcs and ceps might be increasing year by year. some of strains of e. coli, resistance against the 2 agents were observed. it is  important to keep observing changes in resistance of such organisms in the future. 5. the antimicrobial activities of sbtpc against clinically isolated strains in this study indicated potential problems such as those mentioned above. it is, however, also confirmed that sbtpc shows still strong antimicrobial activities against most of beta-lactamase producing strains found in daily medical examinations. taking into consideration of the strong activities of sbtpc against so-called indirect pathogenicity caused by beta-lactamase producing indigenous bacteria reported lately, sbtpc may be a useful antibiotic for community acquired infections in the 1990's.

TI  == multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the british isles.
AB  == twenty-nine british and irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. the organisms were identified by an appropriate api system or, for staphylococci, by their gram and coagulase reactions. disc susceptibility tests were performed. isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of mic, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. over 95% of the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiellae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus, moraxella and bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella and serratia group. tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against e. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), p. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). occasional (18%) resistance in enterobacter, serratia and citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of class i beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam.  high resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for enterococcus faecium and xanthomonas maltophilia. tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/l piperacillin/tazobactam in mic  tests. similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. amongst  the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. however, acinetobacter and bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. cefuroxime, ampicillin and  co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.

AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from various bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability  to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. some of the highly purified ltas, in particular ltas from bacillus subtilis, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, and enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. as after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these ltas reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. other purified ltas, i.e., ltas from streptococcus sanguis, s. pneumoniae, and l. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native lta from s. aureus was inactive. there was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain  length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of ltas. deacylation of ltas resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated ltas did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of lta to the cell surface. the results demonstrate that some lta species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.

AB  == the in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new difluorinated quinolone, was evaluated against 857 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, fleroxacin, and lomefloxacin. the mic of sparfloxacin for 90% of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested was 0.5 microgram/ml (range, 0.06 to 4.0 micrograms/ml); only for members of the genera serratia, citrobacter, and providencia were mics above 1 microgram/ml. some 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 8 micrograms of the drug per ml. the mics for 90% of staphylococcus spp. and enterococcus faecalis were 0.12 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. all (100%) streptococcus pneumoniae strains were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. the inoculum size had little effect on either the mic or the mbc of sparfloxacin. an increase in the magnesium concentration from 1.1 to 8.4 mm increased the mic between 2 and 10 times, depending on the genus tested. sparfloxacin was less active at ph 5. the antibacterial activity of sparfloxacin  against gram-positive bacteria was generally higher than those of the quinolones  with which it was compared; against streptococcus pneumoniae, sparfloxacin was four- and eightfold more active than ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. the activity of sparfloxacin against gram-negative rods was generally comparable  to that of ciprofloxacin except against enterobacter and acinetobacter spp., pseudomonas cepacia, xanthomonas maltophilia, and alcaligenes and flavobacterium  spp., against which sparfloxacin was the most active quinolone.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  == cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its mic90 is 0.125 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for haemophilus spp., neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of m. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. less than 1 mg/l is needed for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp. and shigella spp. the mic90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, morganella morganii, providencia spp. and most strains of serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and most strains of pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. cefodizime has high affinity for pbp 3 and pbp ia and ib (escherichia coli); in s. aureus it shows the highest affinity for pbp 1.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of bay y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  == bay y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as bacteriodes fragilis and clostridium perfringens. mic90s for s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. faecalis, and s. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant s. aureus, mic50 levels of bay y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. the potency of bay y3118 against all members of the enterobacteriaceae generally  was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. bay y3118 was also highly active against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on mic determinations. the drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference mbcs and time-kill curves. from the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.

TI  == stimulation of monokine production by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) isolated from bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes a, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and listeria monocytogenes, were tested for their ability to stimulate the production of interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), il-6, and  tumor necrosis factor alpha in cultured human monocytes. ltas from s. aureus and  s. pneumoniae failed to induce monokine production when applied in the concentration range of 0.05 to 5.0 micrograms/ml. however, ltas from several enterococcal species (0.5 to 5 micrograms/ml) induced the release of all three monokines at levels similar to those observed after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. the kinetics of il-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha release elicited by ltas closely resembled those observed following lipopolysaccharide application. cytokine production occurred in the presence of both fetal calf serum and autologous human serum. hence, it was not dependent on complement activation and could not be suppressed by naturally occurring human antibodies. deacylation caused the total loss of monocyte stimulatory capacity. deacylated ltas were unable to prevent monocyte activation by intact ltas, so primary binding of these molecules probably does not involve a simple interaction of a membrane receptor with the hydrophilic portion of the molecule. the results identify some species of ltas as inducers of monokine production in human monocytes.

TI  == comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  == thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (uti) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower uti) or a 14 day (upper uti) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper uti. overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. the infecting organisms were: escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), citrobacter freundii (three), klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter agglomerans, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis (one of each). all of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. the effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. the cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively.  there were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. in the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. one of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. in this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic uti.

TI  == abnormal maxillary sinus radiographs in children: do they represent bacterial infection?
AB  == thirty-three children with chronic tonsillitis and/or adenoid enlargement and without previous diagnosis of sinusitis were studied regarding the bacterial flora of their maxillary sinuses. puncture of maxillary sinus was performed at surgery (adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy) and aspirates were cultured. streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from 8 of 12 (66.7%) patients whose x-rays  showed completely opacified maxillary sinus. streptococcus viridans, streptococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis were recovered from 6 (28.6%) of the 21 patients with normal maxillary sinus radiographs. bacterial titers were greater than 10(4) colonies/ml in all but one of the positive cultures. no anaerobic bacteria were isolated. history of bronchial asthma, presence of nasal purulent secretion, elevated blood eosinophils, and elevated serum ige were found more frequently in children with complete opacification of maxillary sinus. serum levels of igg2 were low in 29% of the children, but no correlation was found between low igg2 levels and positive cultures from maxillary sinus aspirates. we concluded that children with complete radiologic opacification of maxillary sinus had bacterial infection in almost 70% of the cases with symptoms that did not prompt their physicians to consider the diagnosis of sinusitis.

TI  == radio-immunoassay for formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine. i. development and application to assessment of chemotactic peptide production by enteric bacteria.
AB  == bacterial chemotactic peptides are low molecular weight peptides which stimulate  a wide range of neutrophil functions following binding to specific leucocyte receptors. formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (fmlp) is the major chemotactic  peptide in escherichia coli culture supernatants. this paper reports the development and validation of a radio-immunoassay (ria) for fmlp and its application to the analysis of formyl peptide production by enteric bacteria in vitro. the assay was moderately sensitive (10 nmol/l fmlp) and highly specific showing cross reactivity with f-met-leu-tyr, f-nle-leu-phe and f-met-met-met sequences (id50 = 200, 100 and 250 nmol/l, respectively) but no significant cross reactivity with non-formylated or other formylated di- and tri-peptides (id50 = 10(5) nmol/l. culture supernatants from five species of enteric bacteria were filtered, concentrated and fractionated by reverse phase high performance liquid  chromatography before ria. all five organisms produced immunoreactive f-met peptides. a major peak of immunoreactivity co-chromatographing with authentic fmlp was found in all supernatants, but additional peaks representing more hydrophobic peptides were found in streptococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis cultures. in e. coli culture supernatants, concentration of immunoreactive fmlp increased in a linear fashion during 3 h of log phase growth  reaching 31.2 nmol/l(s.e.m. = 10) with final bacterial concentrations of 3 +/- 0.73 x 10(8)/ml (n = 6). these findings extend earlier work showing production of bioactive formyl oligopeptides by different species of enteric bacteria and suggest that a ria for fmlp will be a useful tool for investigating the production and metabolic fate of such peptides in man.

TI  == mutation rates to 4-quinolone resistance.
AB  == the sensitivity of staph. aureus, staph. warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, strep.  pneumoneae and strep. faecalis to eleven 4-quinolone antibacterials was compared  by determining their minimum inhibitory concentrations on nutrient agar. in all cases where the minimum inhibitory concentration was less than 10 micrograms/ml then the frequency at which 4-quinolone-resistant mutants arose was estimated using each drug at 5, 10 and 20 times its minimum inhibitory concentration. it was found with all five bacterial species tested that ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were the most potent antibacterial and that no mutants could be detected in 10(12) bacteria for either drug with staph. warneri, strep. pneumoneae and strep. faecalis. on the other hand, mutants of pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to both  5 and 10 times (but not 20 times) the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were detected at similar frequencies in the 10(12) bacteria tested. with staph. aureus, mutants resisting 5 times (but not 10 or 20  times) the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were  detected in the 10(12) bacteria tested at similar frequencies. however, all mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin retained the ability to produce coagulase while the majority of ofloxacin-resistant mutants had lost their ability to produce coagulase. hence clear evidence for pathogenicity loss was observed with  ofloxacin but not with ciprofloxacin.

AB  == in vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mics and the results of disk susceptibility tests. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at  an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the mic80s of imipenem (ipm) against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal mic distribution. however, the distribution of mics against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. group a streptococcus, enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by ipm at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. ipm inhibited escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a mic of 25 micrograms/ml, serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with mic greater than 100 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. indole (-) proteus and indole (+) proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the ipm disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and  also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. for the interpretation of the showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa ipm disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). with showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml  cannot be achieved. in this study, however, the differentiation of strains with mics less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set mic break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. according to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == efficacy of clavulanate-potentiated antibiotics against bacteroides species and artificially associated cultures of aerobes and anaerobes.
AB  == clavulanic acid is known to potentiate the activity of amoxycillin and ticarcillin against beta-lactamase-producing bacteroides species. in order to assess the usefulness of the clavulanate antibiotics in mixed infections with aerobes and anaerobes, artificially associated cultures of clinically significant bacteroides species and facultative anaerobes (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp.) were tested. the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of amoxycillin and ticarcillin, singly and in combination with clavulanate, were determined for the individual species in the associated culture and for the  associated culture as a whole. in the absence of clavulanate, association experiments showed that the mbcs of susceptible strains increased in the presence of beta-lactamase-producing species, whereas the addition of clavulanate to the test systems led to mbcs which were mostly comparable to values as determined in  single strain testing.

AB  == tn1545, a conjugative transposon originally discovered in streptococcus pneumoniae, has been transferred from enterococcus faecalis and bacillus subtilis to clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052. transfer between different strains of c. acetobutylicum has also been observed. insertion of tn1545 into the c. acetobutylicum chromosome occurred at multiple sites, as shown by southern hybridization. although ermam (erythromycin-resistance) was the most satisfactory marker for primary selection of transconjugants, all three tn1545-encoded antibiotic resistance genes (apha-3, ermam, and tetm) were apparently expressed in c. acetobutylicum. our results indicate that tn1545 is potentially useful for  undertaking mutagenesis and mutational cloning in this industrially important organism. transfer of another conjugative transposon, tn916, from e. faecalis to  c. acetobutylicum ncib 8052 was also apparently detected. circumstantial evidence suggests that there may be a hot spot for tn916 insertion in the c. acetobutylicum ncib 8052 chromosome.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == dna probe for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the therapeutic activities of orally administered fk482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of  bacteria in mice and rabbits. in systemic infections in mice, oral fk482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (ccl) and more effective than oral cephalexin (cex) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis infections. however, fk482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against e. coli infection in mice,  and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given ccl. in comparison with ccl, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given fk482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. in local infections in rabbits, a species in which fk482 was better absorbed than in mice, fk482 was more effective than ccl, cex or amoxicillin (ampc). against pneumonia induced by s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, fk482 was as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. in the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, fk482 was superior to ccl and ampc against methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection, as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl against enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (cfix) and more effective than ccl and ampc against e. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefoperazone. evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  == to interpret of the cefoperazone (cpz) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in japan, but a 3 category system is used in the u.s.a. and europe. in the 4 category interpretation system of showa cpz disc the following classification is used: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible mic less than  or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible mic less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. reliability of the cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate mics by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and  75 micrograms. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. a good negative correlation was observed between  inhibitory zone diameters and mics, showing reliability of the test using these discs. the results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of cpz were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. some strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. when different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. with 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which mics of cpz were below 3 micrograms/ml. however, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which mics were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. the fact that most frequent values of mics of cpz against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. according to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == evidence for natural gene transfer from gram-positive cocci to escherichia coli.
AB  == high-level resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin type b (mls) antibiotics in escherichia coli bm2570 is due to the presence on the conjugative  plasmid pip1527 of the mls resistance determinant ermbc, which is almost identical to the erm genes previously described in plasmid pam77 from streptococcus sanguis (ermam) and in transposon tn917 from enterococcus faecalis  (ermb). this gene and its regulatory region are located downstream from the insertion sequence is1. the 23s rrna methylase encoded by pip1527 differs by three and six amino acids from those encoded by tn917 and pam77, respectively. unlike the streptococcal elements which confer the inducible mls phenotype, the ermbc gene is expressed constitutively in e. coli and bacillus subtilis, due to several mutations in the regulatory region. transcription of the ermbc gene starts from three different sites following three overlapping promoters which function in both e. coli and b. subtilis. promoters p2 and p3 are located within  the region homologous to pam77 and tn917, and p1 is a hybrid promoter constituted by -35 and -10 sequences located at the end of is15 and in the streptococcal region, respectively. these results constitute evidence for the recent in vivo transfer from streptococcus spp. to e. coli. this transfer could have been mediated by transposons such as tn917 or tn1545 from streptococcus pneumoniae, which also bears an mls determinant that is homologous to ermb. we speculate that the insertion sequences is15 and is1 could have played a role in the expression and dissemination of ermbc, which has been found in numerous strains of enterobacteria.

AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

AB  == isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci were investigated for their abilities, in vitro, to develop resistance to ly146032. exposure of the organisms to incremental concentrations of ly146032 resulted in mics 8- to 32-fold higher than those for the original isolates. after three passages on antibiotic-free medium, the high mics were maintained for the coagulase-negative  staphylococci and pneumococci, with a twofold decrease observed for the enterococci and a fourfold decrease observed for staphylococcus aureus. the frequency of spontaneous emergence of resistance was highest with s. pneumoniae (1.2 x 10(-6) at 16 times the original mic) and lowest with s. aureus (7.0 x 10(-10) at 8 times the original mic). for bacteria for bacteria surviving time-kill studies mics were also higher than were those for the original isolates. exposure to ly146032 in vitro selected for strains with decreased susceptibilities to the antimicrobial agent. however, the emergence of resistance in vivo is unpredictable and can be evaluated only after prolonged clinical use of the drug.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant of the pneumococcal transposon tn1545: evolutionary relationships and transcriptional analysis of apha-3 genes.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant apha-3 encoded by transposon tn1545 from streptococcus pneumoniae was determined and compared to those of plasmids pjh1 and pip1433 from streptococcus faecalis and campylobacter  coli, respectively. the three sequences were found to be identical and differed by two substitutions and the deletion of a codon from that of plasmid psh2 from staphylococcus aureus. comparison of the 5' noncoding sequences indicated that the regions containing the apha-3 gene in pjh1 and in tn1545 evolved independently by deletion from a sequence similar to that found in pip1433. in the latter plasmid, apha-3 is transcribed from a promoter, p1, which is flanked by two 12-base pair direct repeats. the rearrangement observed in pjh1 removed one of these recombinogenic sites and altered the -10 and 3' flanking sequences of p1. the promoter thus generated. p1', allows expression of similar level of kanamycin resistance as p1. however, fusion experiments carried out with a promotorless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene indicated that the canonical  promoter p1 is significantly less efficient than p1'. from analysis of the thermodynamic properties of these promoters, we conclude that this difference in  strength reflects the melting properties of the -10 sequences. the transition from pip1433 to pjh1 may correspond to the progression of a molecule structurally unstable to a more stable one combined with the need to maintain an efficient promoter upstream of the apha-3 gene. the deletion event in tn1545, which occurred between the two 12-base pair directly repeated sequences, removed p1 in  its entirety.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. the number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (ags) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-ags antibiotics including beta-lactam (non ags) was observed. a trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (cfr) was  observed except that cfr for gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + ags remained at a same level. cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. cases with staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, cfr was 28.6%  (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + ags and 37.5% (3/8) with  beta-lactam + non ags (p less than 0.1). among 100 cases of group b streptococcus (gbs), cfr was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + ags (p less than 0.1). among 198 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae, cfr was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. cfr for the cases treated with beta-lactam + ags was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + non ags was 3.6% (1/28) (p less than 0.1). cfr for 292 cases of haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + ags and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam  + non ags, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. among 111 cases of escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + non ags gave 6.5% (2/31) cfr, and 5.6% (1/18) cfr, respectively, whereas beta-lactam  + ags showed cfr of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (p less than 0.1). similar tendencies were observed in the cases of listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. contrary to the high cfr observed with the beta-lactam + ags treatment, significantly low cfr was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. infections with gbs, e. coli, and p. mirabilis  occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and cfr was especially high in  the very young.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [evaluation of cefuzonam in the pediatric field].
AB  == cefuzonam (l-105, czon) was studied in pediatric infections. a summary of the results it as follows: for recently isolated staphylococcus aureus strains, peak  mics of czon were distributed between 0.39 and 0.78 micrograms/ml showing a greater susceptibility of s. aureus to czon than to cefoperazone (cpz), latamoxef (lmox), and cefmenoxime (cmx). peak mics of czon for escherichia coli were 0.10-0.20 micrograms/ml, similar to those of cpz, lmox, and cmx. ampicillin (abpc)-resistant strains were also susceptible to czon. mics for salmonella were  similar to those for e. coli. peak mics of czon for vibrio parahaemolyticus were  0.20-0.39 micrograms/ml. the susceptibility of the bacteria to czon was far greater than to abpc, and was similar to cpz, lmox, and cmx. with 20 mg/kg drip infusion, serum concentrations reached their peaks at the end of administration with values of 20.6-68.7 micrograms/ml, which decreased to 0.43-1.70 micrograms/ml after 2 hours. half-lives of czon in serum were 0.68-1.2 hours. with 50 mg/kg drip infusion, serum concentrations reached their peaks at the end  of administration with levels of 69.0-82.0 micrograms/ml, and at after 2 hours 1.85-3.45 micrograms/ml. thus, an apparent dose response was observed. half-lives of czon in serum were 0.63-0.99 hours. urinary recovery rates in 6 hours were 39.9-80.5%. a total of 44 cases of 10 different types of acute pediatric infections was treated by czon intravenous drip infusion as the main therapeutic  procedure. the efficacy rate was 93.2%, and the compound was effective on purulent infections, acute urinary tract infection, etc. with pathogens such as abpc-resistant s. aureus, e. coli, and enterococcus faecalis. dosage levels per day were 50 to 80 mg/kg in most cases. in infections with s. aureus (8 strains),  streptococcus pneumoniae (3 strains), e. faecalis (1 strain), haemophilus parahaemolyticus (1 strain), haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains), haemophilus  influenzae (11 strains), bordetella pertussis (1 strain), e. coli (3 strains), a  total of 30 strains, bacterial elimination was noted with an exception of 1 strain of s. aureus. the compound was used for 4 to 15 days, but side effects observed clinically were only 1 case of diarrhea and 1 case of thrombocytosis.

AB  == 6 typical bacteria species of the human intestinal flora (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, bifidobacterium sp.) were incubated in a liquid medium for 48 h with [15n2]-urea  and [15n]-ammonium chloride. the rates of [15n]-incorporation were calculated. they depend reproducible on the species examined, on the kind of the offered npn-substance and on the amount of npn-substance in the medium. with [15n2]-urea  the minimal rate of incorporation was 3.8% (e coli) and the maximal one 95.6% (bifidobacterium sp.). with [15n]-ammonium chloride the corresponding figures were 31.0 (proteus vulg.) and 98.0% (bifidobacterium sp.). the findings are discussed with regard to a possible enteral detoxification in uremic patients by  bacterial utilization and elimination of urea and ammonia.

TI  == susceptibility testing with disc diffusion for new cephalosporins: pre-diffusion  revisited.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of 20-hour pre-diffusion, i.e. placing the antibiotic-containing discs on the agar for 20 hours prior to inoculation, as compared to direct diffusion, i.e. placing the discs on the agar immediately after inoculation, for the newer 3. generation cephalosporins as represented by ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. regression lines (zone sizes vs. inhibitory concentrations, as measured by plate-dilution) were constructed for three groups of bacteria chosen because of their differences in growth characteristics on agar: e. coli (n = 50), enterobacter sp. (n = 35), and  streptococci (n = 51). the results for both cephalosporins were: 20-hour pre-diffusion produced larger zones than direct diffusion, regression studies for 20-hour pre-diffusion as compared to direct diffusion resulted in greater variation in zone sizes, numerically lower slopes, lower residual variances and higher correlation coefficients, and regression lines were significantly different for the 3 groups of bacteria with direct diffusion but not so with 20-hour pre-diffusion. considering the interpretation of zone sizes with disc diffusion for the cephalosporins tested, 20-hour pre-diffusion was superior to direct diffusion.

TI  == structure of a conjugative element in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == we have cloned and mapped a 69-kilobase (kb) region of the chromosome of streptococcus pneumoniae dp1322, which carries the conjugative omega (cat-tet) insertion from s. pneumoniae bm6001. this element proved to be 65.5 kb in size. location of the junctions was facilitated by cloning a preferred target region from the wild-type strain rx1 recipient genome. this target site was preferred by both the bm6001 element and the cat-erm-tet element from streptococcus agalactiae b109. within the bm6001 element cat and tet were separated by 30 kb, and cat was  flanked by two copies of a sequence that was also present in the recipient strain rx1 dna. another sequence at least 2.4 kb in size was found inside the bm6001 element and at two places in the rx1 genome. its role is unknown. the ends of the bm6001 element appear to be the same as those of the b109 element, both as seen after transfer to s. pneumoniae and as mapped by others in pdp5 after transposition in streptococcus faecalis. we see no homology between the ends of the bm6001 element and find no evidence suggesting that it ever circularizes.

TI  == immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == studies of various models of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. a limited number of studies carried out in models of klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. the efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections  has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. most studies of combined therapy in  gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. experiments in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, and streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. the enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. with p. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. for both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. these in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.

TI  == in-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  == pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. a comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (escherichia coli, indole + proteus spp., enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (klebsiella pneumoniae). pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 100 staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). it was markedly less active against streptococcus faecalis and str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the mic90 being 4 mg/l against both species. overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against p. aeruginosa, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. against e. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. a paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. an optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in  blood of patients treated with this drug.

TI  == bacterial colonization of hemasite access devices.
AB  == vascular access ports (hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. all were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. one hemasite from which staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. another hemasite from which  proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting  of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular  products. this direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the  resolution of the associated infection.

AB  == bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in atp content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. the results obtained were as follows: the bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the atp-bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by cfu assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming  and more simple than other methods. using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. the serum suppressed the growth rate of e. coli, str.  fecalis, cbs, kleb. pneumoniae and staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. the anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional disc method. thus the sensitivity test  under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. these results suggest the usefulness of atp-bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.

TI  == emerging patterns of microbial resistance.
AB  == microbial resistance arises by mutation or by inheritance. the latter is plasmid-mediated and transferable and may erode multidrug resistance to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides, lincosamides, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim. resistance genes may transfer from one plasmid to another or from a plasmid to the chromosome or to a bacteriophage, thereby allowing rapid dissemination of resistance among bacteria. mutational or chromosomal resistance is not readily transferable between different bacterial species or genera but is nonetheless medically important for resistance to isoniazid, methicillin, nalidixic acid, rifampin, and expanded spectrum cephalosporins.

AB  == penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 5 of streptococcus faecium atcc 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). pbps with similar properties are carried by strains of streptococcus durans, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups a, b, c, and g streptococci or streptococcus pneumoniae. the strains carrying the slow-reacting pbp demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was  several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from s. faecium atcc 9790. they all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting pbp produced. mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of s. durans, s.  faecalis, and s. faecium. all of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting pbp than that carried by the parent. finally, it was found that resistant s. faecium atcc 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all pbps except pbp 5. cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting pbp by 90%. this penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.

AB  == we compared blood cultures that were diluted 1:5 (20%, vol/vol) and 1:10 (10%, vol/vol) and contained specimens from patients with suspected septicemia. streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered significantly more frequently from blood cultures diluted 20%, whereas gram-negative bacilli, group d streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, and candida spp. were recovered significantly sooner and more frequently from blood cultures diluted 10%. statistically significant differences in isolation rates, however, represented only a small number of patients for whom the positive cultures affected therapy. we conclude that as long as at least two separate sets of blood cultures are obtained per septic episode from each patient, a 1:5 to 1:10 blood/vented (aerobic) medium ratio provides acceptable results. nevertheless, the results also demonstrate that blood cultures diluted 10% provided greater and faster yields than those provided by blood cultures diluted 20%.

TI  == membrane stimulation and intracellular killing by monocytes.
AB  == the present paper reviews our recent studies concerning the intracellular killing of bacteria by human monocytes and compares the results with those found for circulating granulocytes. the findings show that optimal intracellular killing of catalase-positive and catalase-negative bacteria is only reached during interaction of the fc part of igg and complement component c3b with their specific receptors in the membrane of the phagocytes. similar stimulation was found during interaction of plant lectins and their specific sugar moieties in the cell membrane. the studies permit the general conclusion that optimal intracellular killing of micro-organisms requires membrane stimulation, which occurs after triggering of certain receptors.

TI  == heterogeneity of tetracycline resistance determinants in streptococcus.
AB  == we found that naturally occurring tetracycline resistance in streptococci is encoded by more than one genetic determinant. two of these distinct determinants  were cloned, and the regions that are necessary and sufficient for expression of  tetracycline resistance were defined by deletion analysis. these cloned determinants were further characterized by dna-dna hybridization experiments which also identified a third genetically unrelated tetracycline resistance determinant. some of these genetic differences appear to represent mechanistic differences. the tetl determinant was associated with small nonconjugative plasmids and mediated resistance to tetracycline. the tetm determinant was most often "nonplasmid" associated and mediated resistance to minocycline as well as tetracycline. the tetn determinant was represented on a large conjugative plasmid and was genetically distinct from tetl and tetm, although phenotypically it resembled tetm.

TI  == homology among tet determinants in conjugative elements of streptococci.
AB  == a mutation to tetracycline sensitivity in a resistant strain of streptococcus pneumoniae was shown by several criteria to be due to a point mutation in the conjugative omega (cat-tet) element found in the chromosomes of strains derived from bm6001, a clinical strain resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol. strains carrying the mutation were transformed back to tetracycline resistance with the high efficiency of a point marker by donor deoxyribonucleic acids from its ancestral strain and from nine other clinical isolates of pneumococcus and by deoxyribonucleic acids from group d streptococcus faecalis and group b streptococcus agalactiae strains that also carry conjugative tet elements in their chromosomes. it was not transformed to resistance by tet plasmid deoxyribonucleic acids from either gram-negative or gram-positive species, except for one that carried transposon tn916, the conjugative tet element present in the chromosomes of some s. faecalis strains. the results showed that the tet determinants in conjugative elements of several streptococcal species share a high degree of deoxyribonucleic acid sequence homology and suggested that they differ from other tet genes.

TI  == effects of physiologic variations in temperature on the rate of antibiotic-induced bacterial killing.
AB  == the effects of physiologic temperature variations on antibiotic-induced killing of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae were studied. at concentrations less than or equal to four times the minimal bactericidal concentration, the activity of each of the antibiotics (gentamicin sulfate, sodium ampicillin, and chloramphenicol) against  the test bacteria was influenced by changes in temperature. only with s. pneumoniae did such influence appear to result directly from temperature-induced  changes in the multiplication rate of the bacteria. repeated subculturing of bacteria at 41 degrees c to induce temperature adaptation had a variable effect on the rate of bacterial killing by appropriate antibiotics. the magnitude of the effect of temperature on antibiotic-induced rates of bacterial killing varies with the antibiotic class, the species of bacteria, and the temperature to which  bacteria have been adapted.

TI  == does penicillin kill bacteria?.
AB  == the thesis is presented that the bactericidal action of penicillin and of other inhibitors of cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis, such as vancomycin and cycloserine, is secondary or tertiary to their ability inhibit specific reactions in the assembly of an osmotically protective cell wall. examples are given of the inhibition of these reactions, which results in inhibition of cell growth (bacteriostatic action) in the absence of either cellular lysis or rapid loss of  viability. thus, in some instances, inhibitory concentrations of these drugs are, in effect, sublethal; this is true, for example, for streptococcus mutans, a species of bacteria that is part of the normal flora of the oropharynx and that can cause subacute bacterial endocarditis. on the other hand, the damaging effects of the subminimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin g on streptococcus faecalis, a species with an active autolytic enzyme system, can be  uncovered and converted to a lytic (and lethal) response by partial inhibition of fatty acid synthesis with low concentrations of cerulenin. some theoretical and practical implications of the occurrence and inhibition of these secondary lethal consequences are discussed.

TI  == superoxide dismutase and oxygen metabolism in streptococcus faecalis and comparisons with other organisms.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis contains a single superoxide dismutase that has been purified to homogeneity with a 55% yield. this enzyme has a molecular weight of 45,000 and is composed of two subunits of equal size. it contains 1.3 atoms of manganese per molecule. its amino acid composition was determined and is compared with that for the superoxide dismutases from escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and mycobacterium lepraemurium. when used as an antigen in rabbits, the s. faecalis enzyme elicited the formation of a precipitating and inhibiting antibody. this antibody cross-reacted with the superoxide dismutase present in another strain of s. faecalis, but neither inhibited nor precipitated the superoxide dismutases in a wide range of other bacteria, including several other  streptococci, such as s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, and s. lactis. the inhibiting antibody was used to suppress the superoxide dismutase activity present in cell extracts of s. faecalis and thus allow the demonstration that 17% of the total oxygen consumption by such extracts, in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, was associated with the production of o(2) (-). a variety of bacterial species were surveyed for their content of superoxide dismutases. the iron-containing enzyme was distinguished from the manganese-containing enzyme through the use of h(2)o(2), which inactivates the former more readily than the latter. some of the bacteria appeared to contain only the iron enzyme, others only the manganese enzyme, and still others both. indeed, some had multiple, electrophoretically distinct superoxide dismutases in both categories. there was  no discernible absolute relationship between the types of superoxide dismutases in a particular organism and their gram-stain reaction.

AB  == the microbiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of all (71) cases of bacterial endocarditis admitted to the hopital cantonal, geneva, between august 1970 and october 1974 were reviewed: there was a definite trend towards higher prevalence of acute cases compared to subacute cases. the pathogenic role of s. epidermidis, mostly in cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis, could be demonstrated in several cases. when defined initially by microbiological criteria only, acute endocarditis were characterized by rapid evolution, destruction of the valvular structures (especially aortic valve), and by further evolution under adequate antibiotic therapy: thus, 10/25 patients with acute endocarditis died, whereas the mortality rate in the subacute cases was only 10/46. many cases in our series showed one or more often frequent embolic phenomena: 70% of the cured  cases and 80% of the patients with a fatal outcome. an unfavorable evolution could be correlated with neurologic involvement, cardiac rhythm or conduction disturbances, and/or heart failure; indeed, heart failure due to various mechanisms was the single most frequent cause of death and is presently the main  therapeutic problem. thus, acute infection leading to destruction of the aortic valve and to heart failure still carries a bad prognosis, even if emergency valve replacement is attempted. finally, 22/30 patients who developed a bacterial endocarditis after oral or urological procedures knew about a heart murmur, but did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis. this clearly shows that emphasis should be put on the elaboration and diffusion of adequate prophylactic regimens.

TI  == resistance mechanism of chloramphenicol in streptococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == the chloramphenicol resistance of streptococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis isolated from clinical materials was proved to be due to an inactivating enzyme produced by these bacteria. the inactivated products of chloramphenicol were identified as 1-acetoxy, 3-acetoxy and 1,3-diacetoxy derivatives by thin-layer chromatography and infrared spectroscopy. the responsible enzyme was thus confirmed to be chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. the enzyme was inducible. it was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, deae-cellulose chromatography and gel filtration  on sephadex g-150. the enzymes obtained from s. haemolyticus, s. pneumoniae and s. faecalis have been compared with the conclusion that they are identical with respect to molecular weight (approximately 75,000-80,000), optimum ph and heat stability.

AB  == the role of peroxidase-mediated bacterial killing by rabbit alveolar macrophages  was examined. during 3 h of incubation in vitro, alveolar macrophages ingested and killed greater than 88% of the streptococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, or  streptococcus pneumoniae present in the incubation mixture. preincubation of alveolar macrophages with inhibitors of catalase, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole or sodium nitrite, did not alter their bactericidal potential. iodination of ingested zymosan particles, a peroxidase-dependent and hydrogen peroxide-dependent reaction, was not observed, in spite of vigorous phagocytosis  by alveolar macrophages. furthermore, iodination by alveolar macrophages was not  significantly increased when peroxidase-coated zymosan particles were ingested. the results suggest that hydrogen peroxide may not be available to the phagocytic vacuole for microbial killing. since tetrazolium dye reduction reflects the activity of an oxidase responsible for stimulated oxygen consumption by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, this reaction was also measured. rabbit alveolar macrophages incubated with latex particles did not exhibit an increased dye reduction compared with resting cells. the absence of significant stimulation of  tetrazolium dye reduction indicates that the oxidase reaction does not occur in the proximity of the phagocytic vacuole of alveolar macrophages.

TI  == influence of the alternate complement pathway in opsonization of several bacterial species.
AB  == in normal human serum chelated with magnesium (10 mm) and ethylene glycotetraacetic acid (10 mm) (mgegta), the classical pathway of complement activation is blocked; however, the alternate pathway of complement activation is intact. diplococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus albus, streptococcus viridans, streptococcus faecalis, and serratia marcescens were opsonized in normal human serum containing 10 mm mgegta. in contrast, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were poorly opsonized in human serum chelated with 10 mm mgedta. therefore certain bacterial species appear to require the classical pathway of complement activation to be opsonized and other bacterial species utilize the alternate pathway of complement activation.

TI  == amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  == amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. strains of haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella sonnei, salmonella species, and streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. penicillinase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus and strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive proteus, klebsiella, and enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. the new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. after oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. the absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration  of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

AB  == overnight cultures of v. cholerae, v. el tor, non-cholera vibrio, and streptococcus pneumoniae in tryptone-soya broth (with 5% blood added for the last-named) failed to grow on subculture despite visible growth in all tubes. viable counts and ph determinations of overnight cultures of various species in tryptone-soya broth, brain-heart infusion broth, and lab-lemco peptone broth show that death in tryptone-soya broth is associated with the drop in ph resulting from fermentation of glucose in the medium and that this drop is greater than that produced by the same amount of glucose in brain-heart infusion broth. some strains of pneumococci failed to grow in brain-heart infusion broth and it is suggested that both these media are unsuitable for blood cultures.

TI  == platelet interaction with bacteria. i. reaction phases and effects of inhibitors.
AB  == interactions between human platelets and several common species of bacteria have  been studied in vitro by the technic of recording nephelometry. results of this investigation have established the following parameters of platelet-bacterial interaction: (1) bacteria are potent stimuli of the platelet-aggregating reaction. (2) the platelet-bacterial interaction proceeds through four distinct phases which are separable by varying the platelet-bacterial ratios or adding appropriate chemical inhibitors. (3) the degree and rate of the platelet response is proportional to the ratio of bacteria to platelets. (4) direct contact between platelets and bacteria, physiologic levels of divalent cations and nucleotide release from platelets are essential for aggregation of platelets by bacteria. (5) by adding equivalent numbers of six species of microorganisms to platelet-rich plasma, their potency as initiators of the platelet reaction was determined, with staphylococcus being the most powerful.

TI  == characteristics of a bacteriocin derived from streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes antagonistic to diplococcus peumoniae.
AB  == a bacteriocin-producing strain of streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes (e-1) was isolated from clinical material (conjunctiva). the active substance differed from bacteriocins described by other investigators primarily in its spectrum of antibacterial activity, especially by its marked inhibition of diplococcus pneumoniae. the e-1 bacteriocin also inhibited nonhemolytic strains of enterococci as well as one-third of the viridans group of streptococcal strains investigated. the degree of inhibition, however, as indicated by the size of the  zones against the latter organisms, was significantly reduced. no activity was detected against any of the strains belonging to the following groups of bacteria: hemolytic enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, nonhemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, and various gram-negative species. similarly, three  strains each of bacillus cereus and listeria monocytogenes and one strain of erysipelothrix insidiosa were not inhibited. the bacteriocin was able to diffuse  through bacterial membranes as well as cellulose dialyzer tubing. it was inactivated by heating to 80 c for 20 min but resisted inactivation by either trypsin or chloroform.

TI  == vitamin b12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  == the mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject  of this study. bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. a primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), ph dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl  inhibitor n-ethyl-maleimide. protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all b(12) uptake. this primary uptake phase is thought to  represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. second stage uptake was slower, ph and temperature dependent, required living bacteria,  and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or n-ethyl-maleimide. this phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of b(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for b(12), all organisms except streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. two gram-positive organisms. bacillus subtilis and group a streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin b(12) uptake values; gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. binding constants (k(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)m for b. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)m for klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)m). competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin b(12) may be inferred from the  similarity of these constants. these observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous b(12), may play a role  in the pathogenesis of the vitamin b(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

TI  == antipseudomonal activity of alpha-sulfoaminopenicillins.
AB  == a series of penicillins characterized by the presence of a sulfoamino or a modified sulfoamino group in the side chain was subjected to in vitro antimicrobial screening tests. although the most potent members of the series were less active than benzylpenicillin against gram-positive bacteria and comparably active against most gram-negative bacteria, they were, on the average, 8 to 16 times more effective against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. in other  comparative laboratory tests against p. aeruginosa, these compounds were about as active as carbenicillin and four to eight times more active than ampicillin. an examination of structure-activity relationships indicated that maximal potency was obtained with penicillins having an alpha-(aromatic or heteroaromatic)-alpha-sulfoaminoacetamido side chain. the compound with an alpha-phenyl group was comparable in activity to those having an alpha-(2- or 3-thienyl) group, whereas any modification in position or structure of the alpha-sulfoamino group reduced activity. results of studies with a cell-free p. aeruginosa beta-lactamase suggest that the marked inhibitory effects of alpha-sulfoamino penicillins for p. aeruginosa can be attributed, at least in part, to their high degree of resistance to this enzyme. some derivatives, however, had weak antipseudomonal activity, despite possessing a high degree of beta-lactamase resistance.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (ph 6.0 to 8.2). this effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. the urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting e. coli and k. pneumoniae even when diluted  up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same ph as the urine. undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable  of inhibiting these organisms. the range of ph (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.

TI  == in vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  == norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. the organisms tested included staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus conglomeratus, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhosa, shigella flexnerii, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus vulgaris. bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on s. aureus. however, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. in vivo studies indicated that  female, adult new zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with s.  aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. the protective  effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. when the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. during the 1st day after infection with s. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.
