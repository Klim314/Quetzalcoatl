TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == microcalorimetry: a novel method for detection of microbial contamination in platelet products.
AB  == background: measuring heat from replicating microorganisms in culture may be a rapid, accurate, and simple screening method for platelets (plts). microcalorimetry for detection of microorganisms in in vitro contaminated plt products was evaluated. study design and methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguinis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and candida albicans were inoculated in single-donor apheresis plts to achieve target concentrations of 10(5), 10(3), 10, or 1 colony-forming units (cfu) per ml of plts. contaminated plts in growth medium were incubated at 37 degrees c for 5 days in a calorimeter. positivity was defined as heat flow of at least 10 microw above the lowest value of the power-time curve. results: with microcalorimetry, inocula of 10 cfus per ml plts  could be detected with the following detection times: s. epidermidis (31.65 hr),  s. aureus (24.24 hr), s. sanguinis (7.82 hr), e. coli (7.53 hr), p. acnes (73.57  hr), and c. albicans (43.77 hr). the detection time was less than 4 hr at 10(5) cfus per ml plts for s. aureus, s. sanguinis, and e. coli. noncontaminated plts remained negative. the total heat ranged from 2.8 (s. sanguinis) to 8.3 j (e. coli). the shape of the power-time curve was species-specific and independent from the initial concentration of microorganisms. conclusion: the detection limit of microcalorimetry was 1 to 10 cfus per ml plts. microcalorimetry is a promising novel method for detection of contaminated plts. applying this method to all plt  products could reduce the frequency of transfusion-related sepsis and prolong the shelf life of plts.

TI  == bacterial diversity in aortic aneurysms determined by 16s ribosomal rna gene analysis.
AB  == background: aortic aneurysms are common vascular conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the condition remains limited. recently, infection has been suggested as possible contributor in the development of the disease. the aim of the present study was to examine aortic aneurysms for the presence of bacterial dna using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)  gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. methods: universal eubacterial primers  were used to amplify 16s rrna bacterial genes in 10 specimens from arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. subsequently, pcr amplicons were cloned into escherichia coli and sequencing of the cloned inserts was used to determine species identity  or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences in genbank. results: sequences of stenotrophomonas spp., including s. maltophilia (formerly pseudomonas homology group v) were detected in six aneurysm samples. propionibacterium acnes was identified in five samples, and brevundimonas diminuta (formerly p. diminuta) in four samples. other species previously assigned to the pseudomonas genus such as comamonas testosteroni, delftia acidovorans, burkholderia cepacia, herbaspirillum sp., and acidovorax sp. were also detected. some clones fell into other environmental species, including methylobacterium sp. and bradyrhizobium elkanii, and others represented bacteria  that have not yet been cultivated. dna sequences from oral bacteria, including streptococcus sanguinis, tannerella forsythia, and leptotrichia buccalis were detected. sequences from prevotella melaninogenica and lactobacillus delbrueckii, which are commonly found in both mouth and gastrointestinal tract, were also detected. additional species included dermacoccus spp. and corynebacterium vitaeruminis. conclusions: a wide variety of bacteria, including oral bacteria, was found to colonize aortic aneurysms and may play a role in their development.  several of these microorganisms have not yet been cultivated. clinical relevance: although chlamydophila pneumoniae has been detected in aneurysmal walls, its exact role in the condition remains inconclusive. overall, there is scarce information about the role of microorganisms in aneurysmal disease. in the present study, we used molecular genetics to detect a diversity of bacteria in arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. the presence of multiple microorganisms in aneurysmal disease may have implications for chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment if directed only at c.pneumoniae.

TI  == repeat infective endocarditis: differentiating relapse from reinfection.
AB  == repeat infective endocarditis due to the same species can represent relapse of the initial infection or a new infection. we used time-based clinical criteria and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-based molecular criteria to classify 13 cases of repeat infective endocarditis as either relapse or reinfection. the agreement between clinical and molecular criteria was imperfect (agreement in 10  [77%] of 13 cases).

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms in apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis.
AB  == thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% co2 in air. a total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three  of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. all were identified as belonging to the streptococcus sanguis group. no beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in  apical periodontitis samples. twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, actionomyces odontolyticus and peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces meyeri. of 19 staphylococci and  micrococci, staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. however, less commonly known organisms such as staphylococcus cohnii and micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. the isolation of bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.

TI  == bacterial eradication from root dentine by ultrasonic irrigation with sodium hypochlorite.
AB  == the study aimed to evaluate intracanal irrigation procedures in eradicating bacteria from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine using extracted human teeth. artificial bacterial smear layer was successfully produced by rubbing a mixture of dental plaque and artificially decalcified dentine or carious dentine on root canal walls. the reservoir holes were 3.5 mm in depth, 1  mm in diameter prepared 1.5 mm apart and parallel to the root canals on the decrowned planes, in which five separate bacterial species were placed (actinomyces israelii, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis). bacterial eradication after irrigation of the prepared canals was determined by bacterial recovery (i) from the root canal surfaces and shallow layers where bacteria were smeared artificially and (ii) from deeper layers of root canal dentine reservoir holes. ultrasonic irrigation with 5.5% and 12% naocl eradicated bacteria from artificial smear layer (p < 0.0001), whilst 12% naocl irrigation with a syringe was insufficient. ultrasonic irrigation with water or 15% edta-failed to eradicate bacteria from smeared surfaces. ultrasonic irrigation with 12% naocl killed a. israelii, f. nucleatum, p. acnes, s. mutans, and s. sanguis placed in reservoir channels, although for f. nucleatum, a very small number of bacteria remained in  five samples out of 12. ultrasonic irrigation with less concentrated naocl failed to eliminate bacteria completely from reservoir channels in most samples. ultrasonic irrigation with 12% naocl appeared to eliminate bacteria efficiently from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine.

TI  == colonic perforation by ventriculoperitoneal shunt tubing: a case of suspected silicone allergy.
AB  == background: a case of colonic perforation by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is presented in a patient with several previous complications associated with shunt  tubing. case description: initially managed by intravenous antibiotics, shunt externalization, and colonoscopy, the entire ventriculoperitoneal shunt system was subsequently replaced after cerebrospinal fluid cultures had grown propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus sanguis organisms. the patient has had  three episodes of skin breakdown over his shunt tubing (two prior and one subsequent to colonic perforation) without evidence of shunt infection or malfunction. conclusions: the etiology of these complications is consistent with  silicone tubing allergy. replacement with a polyurethane system produced no similar complications thus far, which further supports a possible silicone allergy to the ventriculoperitoneal shunt and possible etiology of this patient's colonic perforation.

TI  == ribotyping of bacteria from root canal and blood of patients receiving endodontic therapy.
AB  == dna restriction patterns and corresponding ribotypes of 26 bacterial isolates (propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis) recovered from patients with infected root canals and their peripheral blood, collected during and after endodontic therapy, were examined. eleven additional reference strains including type strains were also examined. purified dna was digested with bgli,ecori, and hindiii. hybridization was carried out with a digoxigenin-labeled cdna probe obtained by reverse transcription of escherichia coli 16s + 23s rrna. ribotypes of the bacteria recovered from root canal and blood showed identical characteristics within the patients, and differed between the patients. the results were confirmed when the similarity coefficient (s(ab)) of the ribotypes from the isolates were assessed by the dendron computer-assisted system. these results suggested that the bacteria isolated from the blood originated from the root canal.

TI  == electrophoresis of whole-cell soluble proteins of microorganisms isolated from bacteremias in endodontic therapy.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that anaerobic bacteria are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from blood following endodontic therapy of teeth with apical periodontitis. phenotypic characterisation of the isolates suggested that  the bacteria in the blood originated from the root canal. the present experiment  using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was carried out in an effort to verify these findings, and to further study the microorganisms involved in endodontic bacteremias. soluble cellular proteins were extracted from 11 reference strains and 26 bacterial isolates recovered from the  root canal and blood. these included propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus  prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia. actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis. the electrophoretic patterns mostly confirmed the identity of the isolates as determined by the biochemical and antimicrobial resistance tests. furthermore, with this typing method the species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens could be differentiated.  these species had been recovered from both root canal and blood. also, differences between subspecies of fusobacterium nucleatum became evident with sds-page, and the results indicated that the organism recovered from the root canal and blood was fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii. the electrophoretic patterns of the different organisms isolated from the root canal and the blood were similar, providing further evidence that the bacteria found in the blood originated from the root canal.

TI  == bacteremia in conjunction with endodontic therapy.
AB  == this study characterizes oral microorganisms believed to have spread from the root canal into the blood stream during and after endodontic therapy of teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis. microbiological samples were taken under  aseptic conditions from the root canal of 26 single-rooted teeth in 26 patients.  in the endodontic treatment of 13 of the patients (group 1), the first 3 reamers, sizes 15, 20 and 25, were used to a level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. in the  other 13 patients (group 2), the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. blood samples were taken from the patients during the instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from all root canals. in 7 patients of group 1, propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and saccharomyces cerevisiae were recovered from the blood. in 4 patients of group 2, p. intermedia, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus sanguis were isolated from the blood. biochemical tests and antibiograms revealed that the isolates from the root canal and blood had identical profiles within the patients, strongly suggesting that the microorganisms isolated from the blood had the root canal as their source.

TI  == a quantitative comparison of selected bacteria in human carious dentine by microscopic counts.
AB  == the levels of selected cariogenic and obligately anaerobic bacteria have been compared in carious dentine taken from fissures, smooth surfaces, and root surfaces. the numbers of infected dentinal tubules were determined by immunohistological staining using species-specific antisera against selected bacteria. selective localization was observed; mutans streptococci were the predominant bacteria in dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal caries,  but not from root surface caries. the proportion of mutans streptococci was higher in the shallow and middle layers of dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal carious lesions than from the deep layers. in root surface caries, actinomyces spp. were the predominant bacteria, and were present at higher levels in the deep layer of root lesions than in the shallow and middle layers. the proportion of lactobacillus spp. was relatively low despite its high  detection frequency in all layers of the three types of carious lesion. immunohistological staining with species-specific antisera was able to reveal the distribution and the localization of various bacteria in carious dentine.

TI  == profiling of propionibacterium acnes recovered from root canal and blood during and after endodontic treatment.
AB  == this report describes the first results of an ongoing study of bacteremia after endodontic treatment of teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis. after access cavity preparation, microbiological samples were taken from the root canal under aseptic conditions in 4 single-rooted teeth in 4 patients. in treatment of  2 of the patients, the first 3 reamers (sizes 15-25) were deliberately used to a  level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. in 2 patients the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. blood samples were taken  from the patients during the endodontic instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. using lysis-filtration under anaerobic conditions, the blood was passed through a cellulose membrane filter. the filters as well as the  root canal samples were incubated using an anaerobic technique. anaerobic bacteria were isolated from all root canals. in the 2 patients where overinstrumentation had occurred, propionibacterium acnes was recovered both from the root canals and from the blood samples taken during and after the treatment had been completed. biochemical profiles, antibiotic susceptibility tests and electrophoresis of soluble proteins revealed that propionibacterium acnes isolated from the root canal and blood samples were identical within patients, but varied between patients. facultative anaerobic bacteria including streptococcus sanguis were recovered from only one root canal sample and not from the blood samples.

TI  == enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  == this study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and dna probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented  with 5% sheep blood. colonies of reference strains were lifted onto nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial dna to the filters. positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of streptococcus mitis reacted with  the probe to streptococcus sanguis ii. subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of  26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees c. colonies were lifted as described above. filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled dna probes. the probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. the colony lift method and dna probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. in addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.

TI  == susceptibility of oral bacteria to phenoxyethanol and phenoxyethanol/chlorhexidine combinations.
AB  == a total of 57 bacterial strains (26 different species) which may be isolated from subgingival plaque were tested for their in vitro susceptibility to phenoxycthanol, a commonly-used antiseptic and preservative. ninety-five percent  of the strains, including those associated with chronic inflammatory periodontal  disease, were susceptible to concentrations of phenoxyethanol used topically (2%  w/v). phenoxyethanol at a concentration of 1% (w/v) was also found that to have a rapid bactericidal effect achieving a 99.9% kill in 5 minutes or less for species such as bacterodides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and wolinella recta. addition of chlorhexidine to phenoxyethanol resulted in a mixture with increased antibacterial activity. for most bacterial strains, the presence of chlorhexidine resulted in at least a four-fold decrease in the concentration of pheoxyethanol required for inhibition of growth. these results imply that phenoxyethanol may be useful in the treatment of chronic inflammatory  periodontal disease either by itself or in combination with chlorhexidine.

TI  == the microbiology of periapical granulomas.
AB  == of the 16 periapical granulomas studied, 14 (88%) yielded a positive growth when  homogenized and cultured. the concentration of colony-forming units per milliliter of the suspension ranged from 10(1.3) to 10(4.0) (mean 10(2.2)). a total of 47 isolates comprising 26 (55%) facultative anaerobes and 21 (45%) strict anaerobes were obtained. the organisms most commonly cultured were veillonella species (15%), streptococcus milleri (11%), streptococcus sanguis (11%), actinomyces naeslundii (11%), propionibacterium acnes (11%), and bacteroides species (10%). most of the organisms (96%) were sensitive to either amoxicillin, clindamycin, or tetracycline, whereas only 45% were sensitive to metronidazole.

TI  == cell-to-cell interaction of streptococcus sanguis and propionibacterium acnes on  saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.
AB  == cell-to-cell interaction (coaggregation) between propionibacterium acnes pk93 and streptococcus sanguis dl1 was measured on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads (sha) at bacterial concentrations between 1.3 x 10(6) and 6.7 x 10(8) cells per ml. four hundredfold more dl1 than pk93 cells adhered to the saliva-coated beads, and the adherence of s. sanguis was proportional to cell input. sha precoated with 3 x 10(8) dl1 cells bound 75 to 80% of available pk93 cells at all input amounts tested, up to an input of 8 x 10(7) cells. adherence of pk93 to dl1-coated sha approached saturation at an input of approximately 10(9) pk93 cells, when 1.5 x 10(8) bound. the coaggregation on sha occurred either in buffer or saliva and was inhibited by n-acetylgalactosamine and by lactose; the attachment of dl1 to sha was not inhibited by these sugars. s. sanguis 34 and heat-treated dl1 cells, neither of which form coaggregates with pk93, attached to sha, but such cells did not bind pk93 cells. the findings of this study indicate  that bacteria unable to attach to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite can indeed adhere  to such a surface by strong lectin-mediated cell-to-cell interactions with bacteria already attached to the surface.

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == effect of bacterial products on inflammatory reactions in the dental pulp.
AB  == culture filtrates (extracellular components) and material obtained from disintegrated cells (intracellular components) of cultured plaque bacteria were studied for their capacity to induce inflammatory reactions in the dental pulp. class v cavities were prepared on the buccal surface of 94 teeth: 42 test and 52  control teeth in six adult monkeys. lyophilized bacterial components were sealed  into the test cavities either alone or following an 8-h topical application of a  solution of the same components in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs). culture medium and pbs were applied in two sets of control cavities. a third set was restored with zinc oxide-eugenol cement. the animals were killed 32 h after the initiation of the experiment and the pulps were examined histologically. teeth treated trophil leukocytes in the area of the pulp subjacent to the cut dentin tubules. abscess formation was frequently found. the severe reactions which developed were independent of differences between individual animals and differences in thickness of the remaining dentin. the controls showed damage to the odontoblasts but little or no neutrophil infiltration. the findings confirm that products of bacteria applied to exposed dentin initiate inflammatory reactions in the dental pulp.
