TI  == multibacterial sepsis in an alcohol abuser with hepatic cirrhosis.
AB  == an alcohol abuser with hepatitis c developed multibacterial sepsis. his mean 100% alcohol intake reached 400 ml/day. in january 2001, he suddenly experienced fever (39 degrees c) with no other symptoms. one week later, he was admitted to our hospital and was subsequently diagnosed with sepsis associated with four species  of bacteria (streptococcus constellatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and non-spore-forming anaerobic gram-positive bacillus). a drip infusion of imipenem/cilastatin was administrated, resulting in a successful therapeutic outcome. no underlying disorder was found except for gastric ulcers and hepatic cirrhosis. damaged gastric mucosa was assumed to be the possible cause and route for the bacterial invasion.

TI  == [retrospective analysis of fusobacterium associated infections; experience at aomori prefectural hospital with 108 cases from 1995 to 1999].
AB  == we experienced 108 cases of fusobacterium associated infections, including otolaryngeal, oral, pleuropulmonary, intraabdominal, skin and soft tissue infections, at aomori prefectural hospital during the 5 year-period from 1995 to  1999. a total of 433 organisms, included 113 fusobacterium spp. (80 fusobacterium nucleatum, 18 fusobaterium necrophorum, 5 fusobacterium varium, 4 fusobacterium mortiferum, 6 fusobacterium spp.), were recovered with an average of 4.0 organisms per case of the 108 cases, 68% were mixed aerobic and anaerobic and yielded 185 anaerobic bacteria (2.5 per case) and 137 aerobic bacteria (1.9 per case) with an average of 4.4 per case. the remaining 32% were purely anaerobic and yielded 111 organisms with an average of 3.2 per case, prevotella spp., bacteroides fragilis group, streptococcus milleri group, enterobacteriaceae, peptostreptococcus spp. staphylococcus spp. were most frequently coisolated with  fusobacterium spp.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of shallow periodontal pockets in individuals after head and neck irradiation.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the subgingival plaque microorganisms of shallow pockets (< or = 5 mm) in subjects who previously received irradiation in  the head and neck region for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. direct microscopy and anaerobic culture were used. subgingival paper point samples were  taken from 6 tooth-sites (one/sextant) per subject for direct microscopy (n = 108). another set of paper points was taken from the deepest of the previously selected sites (one per subject) with: group a) no bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 9) and group b) bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 6) for microscopic and anaerobic culture study. under the microscope, the microflora was found to be a complex mixture comprising gram-positive and gram-negative cocci, rods and filaments, fusiforms, curved rods and spirochetes. low level of fungi were observed and mycelia were occasionally detected. there was no significant variation in the plaque bacterial morphotypes observable according to sites of isolation and no significant difference between group a and group b in morphotypes of the different microflora. the predominant cultivable microflora comprised several species of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria: gemella, peptostreptococcus, staphylococcus, stomatococcus, streptococcus, actinomyces, eubacterium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, neisseria, veillonella, bacteroides, campylobacter, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, kingella, porphyromonas and prevotella species. there was no difference between the two groups except the significantly higher proportion of kingella dentrificans isolated from group b sites. however, colonization of the gingival sulcus in these individuals by microbes that are normal flora of: skin (peptostreptococcus  prevotii and propionibacterium granulosum) and gut (eubacterium aerofaciens, fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium) was detected. these findings appear to suggest that the major components of the subgingival microflora of shallow sites in previously head- and neck-irradiated individuals are similar to  that of gingivitis sites in the normal population although they may contain bacterial or fungal species uncommon in normal subjects.

TI  == survival of anaerobic bacteria in common laboratory diluents.
AB  == the survival of six species of anaerobic bacteria was studied in simple or commercially available diluents. bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium nucleatum showed excellent survival in all diluents including distilled water. fusobacterium mortiferum survived well in all diluents except water and water supplemented with 0.1% gelatain. clostridium perfringens survived best in phosphate-buffered saline with gelatin. peptococcus asaccharolyticus required gelatin added to the basic diluent, and streptococcus intermedius showed excellent survival only in minimal essential medium with gelatin. these diluents  could provide effective and economical alternatives to more complex and costly diluents often used in work with anaerobic bacteria.
