TI  == prevotella aurantiaca sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == two anaerobic, pigmented, non-spore-forming, gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped strains isolated from the human oral cavity, oma31(t) and oma130, were characterized by determining their phenotypic and biochemical features, cellular  fatty acid profiles and phylogenetic positions based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that the new isolates belonged to a single species of the genus prevotella. the two isolates showed 100 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with each other and were most closely related to prevotella intermedia atcc 25611(t) with 96.4 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity; the next most closely related strains to the isolates were prevotella pallens ahn 10371(t) (96.1 %) and prevotella falsenii jcm 15124(t) (95.3 %). phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of the isolates were the same as those of p. intermedia jcm 12248(t), p. falsenii jcm 15124(t) and prevotella nigrescens jcm 12250(t). the isolates could be differentiated from p. pallens jcm 11140( t)  by mannose fermentation and alpha-fucosidase activity. conventional biochemical tests were unable to differentiate the new isolates from p. intermedia, p. falsenii and p. nigrescens. however, hsp60 gene sequence analysis suggested that  strain oma31(t) was not a representative of p. intermedia, p. pallens, p. falsenii or p. nigrescens. based on these data, a novel species of the genus prevotella, prevotella aurantiaca sp. nov., is proposed, with oma31(t) (=jcm 15754(t)=ccug 57723(t)) as the type strain.

TI  == prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 targets host cell lamellipodia in epithelial cell adhesion and invasion.
AB  == introduction: the prevotella intermedia group bacteria, namely p. intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella pallens, are phylogenetically closely related and potentially connected with oral and gastrointestinal tract disease pathogenesis. the aim of the present study was to examine whether these species differ in their capabilities of adhesion to and invasion of epithelial cells. methods: adhesion and invasion were assayed by standard antibiotic/culture assays and fluorescent microscopy techniques. the effect of prevotella strains on epithelial cell viability was measured using a commercial cell proliferation assay. results: the strains p. intermedia atcc 25611 and p. nigrescens atcc 33263 adhered to epithelial cells, the adhesion numbers of p. intermedia being twice as high as those of p. nigrescens. these strains invaded epithelial cells but invasion was weak. the adhesion of p. intermedia was specifically targeted to epithelial cell lamellipodia. the number of adhered p. intermedia cells increased or decreased when the formation of lamellipodia was stimulated or inhibited, respectively. none of the tested strains showed toxic effects on epithelial cells; a clinical p. intermedia strain even increased the number of viable cells  by about 20%. conclusion: the results suggest that among the p. intermedia group  bacteria, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens type strains can adhere to and invade epithelial cells, the capability of p. intermedia atcc 25611(t) being highest in  this context. this strain proved to have a special affinity in binding to epithelial cell lamellipodia.

TI  == prevotella falsenii sp. nov., a prevotella intermedia-like organism isolated from monkey dental plaque.
AB  == eight anaerobic, pigmented, non-spore-forming, gram-negative, rod-shaped strains  isolated from monkey oral cavities were characterized phenotypically and chemotaxonomically and their phylogenetic positions were determined using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that these isolates represent a single species of the genus prevotella. these strains  were most closely related to prevotella intermedia atcc 25611(t), with 95.0 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the next most closely related species were prevotella pallens and prevotella nigrescens (92.7 and 92.1 % similarity to the respective type strains). the phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of the isolates were the same as those of p. intermedia jcm 12248(t) and p. nigrescens jcm 12250(t). the isolates could be differentiated from p. pallens jcm 11140(t) on the basis of mannose fermentation and alpha-fucosidase activity. the isolates  could not be distinguished from p. intermedia or p. nigrescens using conventional biochemical tests. dna-dna hybridization experiments revealed the genomic distinctiveness of these eight strains with respect to p. pallens jcm 11140(t), p. intermedia jcm 12248(t) and p. nigrescens jcm 12250(t). on the basis of these  data, strains 04013, 04021, 04043, 04052(t), 0406, 04113, 04111 and 04161 represent a novel prevotella species, for which the name prevotella falsenii sp.  nov. is proposed. the type strain is 04052(t) (=jcm 15124(t) =ccug 56137(t)).

TI  == molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  == aim: compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a uk population using culture-independent techniques. materials and methods: halitosis patients were screened according to  our recently developed recruitment protocol. scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. bacteria were identified by pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes. results: the predominant species found in the control samples were lysobacter-type species, streptococcus salivarius, veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, actinomyces odontolyticus, atopobium parvulum and veillonella atypica. in the halitosis samples, lysobacter-type species, s. salivarius, prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, prevotella veroralis and prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. for the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). in the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. conclusions: the microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.

TI  == inhibitory effects of green tea catechins on protein tyrosine phosphatase in prevotella intermedia.
AB  == members of the prevotella intermedia group possess protein tyrosine phosphatase (ptpase). the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of catechin derivatives from japanese green tea on the activity of ptpase in p. intermedia and related organisms. multilocus enzyme electrophoresis of alkaline phosphatase  derived from p. intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella pallens and porphyromonas gingivalis revealed a species-specific migration pattern. among the tea catechin derivatives tested, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (egcg), similar to  orthovanadate, a specific inhibitor for ptpase, was effective in inhibiting the ptpase activity in p. intermedia at 0.5 microm, and related species at 5 microm.  the results suggested that the inhibitory effect observed is due to the presence  of galloyl moiety in the structure. in contrast, neither the green tea catechins  nor orthovanadate inhibited the phosphatase activity in p. gingivalis, suggesting that this organism possessed a different family of alkaline phosphatase.

TI  == direct quantitative differentiation between prevotella intermedia and prevotella  nigrescens in clinical specimens.
AB  == this paper describes a quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) assay for the differential identification of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in clinical samples, and compares its performance with less discriminatory culture and quantitative immunofluorescence (if) assays. fluorescence-labelled oligonucleotide probes directed to specific 16s rrna sequences of p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, prevotella pallens and prevotella denticola were hybridized under stringent conditions with cultured reference strains or plaque samples from deep periodontal pockets. probe specificity was defined with strains from multiple oral prevotella species. the lower detection level of the assays was approximately 3x10(3) target cells per ml of plaque-sample suspension. p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, p. pallens and p. denticola were detected in plaques with prevalences of 69, 67, 0 and 28%, respectively. on average, 3.9 x 10(6) p. intermedia, 3.1 x 10(6) p. nigrescens and 5.6 x 10(5) p. denticola cells were counted per positive sample. all three species were found almost exclusively in dense mixed aggregates. quantitative fish data agreed satisfactorily with corresponding if data (r=0.711). both fish and if enumerations of the sum of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens markedly exceeded the c.f.u. counts of black-pigmented colonies in porphyromonas gingivalis-free cultured subgingival plaques. the results demonstrate the validity of this new assay. unlike established if, culture, pcr or checkerboard dna hybridization assays, this fish assay differentiates quantitatively between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens, provides visual accuracy control, and offers insights into the spatial distribution of the target cells within a clinical sample.

TI  == beta-lactamase production in prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella pallens genotypes and in vitro susceptibilities to selected antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the present study investigated the beta-lactamase production of 73 prevotella intermedia, 84 prevotella nigrescens, and 14 prevotella pallens isolates and their in vitro susceptibilities to six antimicrobial agents. the p. intermedia and p. nigrescens isolates were recovered from oral and extraoral samples obtained from subjects in two geographic locations from 1985 to 1995. the clonality of the beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative isolates and the clustering of the genotypes were studied by arbitrarily primed-pcr fingerprinting. beta-lactamase production was detected in 29% of p. intermedia isolates, 29% of p. nigrescens isolates, and 57% of p. pallens isolates. no difference in the frequencies of beta-lactamase production by p. intermedia and p. nigrescens between isolates from oral and extraoral sites, between isolates obtained at different time periods, or between p. intermedia isolates from different geographic locations was observed. however, the p. nigrescens isolates  from the united states were significantly more frequently (p = 0.015) beta-lactamase positive than those from finland. no association between the genotypes and beta-lactamase production or between the genotypes and the sources  of the isolates was found. the penicillin g mics at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were 8 microg/ml for p. intermedia, 8 microg/ml for p. nigrescens, and 16 microg/ml for p. pallens. for the beta-lactamase-negative isolates, the corresponding values were 0.031, 0.031, and 0.125 microg/ml, and for the beta-lactamase-positive isolates, the corresponding values were 16, 8, and 32 microg/ml. all isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, metronidazole, azithromycin, and trovafloxacin. the mics of amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefoxitin were relatively higher for the beta-lactamase-positive population than for the beta-lactamase-negative population.

TI  == phylogenetic characterization and proposal of a new pigmented species to the genus prevotella: prevotella pallens sp. nov.
AB  == complete 16s rrna gene sequences of three representative strains of anaerobic, gram-negative, pigmented, moderately saccharolytic, indole-positive bacteria isolated from the oral cavity of humans were determined. according to comparative analyses of the rrna sequence data, this organism represents a previously unknown species within the genus prevotella. in addition, 22 representative strains and 21 reference strains (including 11 prevotella intermedia and 10 prevotella nigrescens strains) were subjected to multilocus enzyme electrophoretic analysis. the strains were consistently separated into three clearly distinct groups, corresponding to their previous entities. on the basis of the present phylogenetic results that confirmed our biochemical and genetic data, we propose  a new species, prevotella pallens. the type strain is nctc 13042 (= ahn 10371).
