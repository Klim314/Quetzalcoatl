TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == nature of the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus caseibifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis against foodborne pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities as well as the nature of the inhibitory compounds obtained from lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis strains were assayed on foodborne pathogenic - staphyloccoccus aureus subsp. aureus (ccug atcc(r) 25926) and escherichia coli (atcc(r) 25922) - and spoilage microorganisms - pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc(r) 27853). test producer strains showed inhibitory effect on all indicator microorganisms in diffusion of  cell-free concentrated supernatant by agar in well methods (10.0-22.5 mm) in periods of 24, 48 and 72 h. inhibitory compounds showed no sensitivity to the action of proteolytic enzyme trypsin and were completely inactivated by adjusting the ph of the cell-free 20 x concentrated supernatant to 7.0. the results demonstrated that antimicrobial substances do not have proteinaceous nature and are caused by the action of organic acids with decreasing medium ph.

TI  == role of bifidobacteria in the hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid.
AB  == this study aimed to explore the capability of potentially probiotic bifidobacteria to hydrolyze chlorogenic acid into caffeic acid (ca), and to recognize the enzymes involved in this reaction. bifidobacterium strains belonging to eight species occurring in the human gut were screened. the hydrolysis seemed peculiar of bifidobacterium animalis, whereas the other species failed to release ca. intracellular feruloyl esterase activity capable of hydrolyzing chlorogenic acid was detected only in b. animalis. in silico research among bifidobacteria esterases identified balat_0669 as the cytosolic enzyme likely responsible of ca release in b. animalis. comparative modeling of balat_0669 and molecular docking studies support its role in chlorogenic acid hydrolysis. expression, purification, and functional characterization of balat_0669 in escherichia coli were obtained as further validation. a possible role of b. animalis in the activation of hydroxycinnamic acids was demonstrated and new perspectives were opened in the development of new probiotics, specifically selected for the enhanced bioconversion of phytochemicals into bioactive compounds.

TI  == short communication: viability of culture organisms in honey-enriched acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (abt)-type fermented camel milk.
AB  == the aim of this research was to monitor the survival during refrigerated storage  of lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 (a), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 (b), and streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 (t) in cultured dairy foods made from camel and, for comparison, cow milks supplemented with black locust (robinia pseudoacacia l.) honey and fermented by an acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (abt)-type culture. two liters of dromedary camel milk and 2 l of cow milk were heated to 90 degrees c and held for 10 min, then cooled to 40 degrees c. one half of both types of milk was fortified with black locust honey at the rate of 5.0% (wt/vol), whereas the other half was devoid of honey and served as a control. the camel and cow milks with and without honey were subsequently inoculated with abt-5 culture and were fermented at 37 degrees c until a ph value of 4.6 was reached. thereafter, the probiotic fermented milks were cooled to 15 degrees c in ice water and were each separated  into 18 fractions that were transferred in sterile, tightly capped centrifuge tubes. after 24 h of cooling at 8 degrees c (d 0), the samples were stored at refrigeration temperature (4 degrees c). three tubes of all 4 products (i.e., fermented camel and cow milks with and without honey) were taken at each sampling time (i.e., following 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d of storage), and the counts of characteristic microorganisms and those of certain spoilage microbes (yeasts, molds, coliforms, escherichia coli) were enumerated. the entire experimental program was repeated twice. the results showed that addition of black locust honey at 5% to heat-treated camel and cow milks did not influence the growth and  survival of starter streptococci during production and subsequent refrigerated storage of fermented abt milks. in contrast, honey improved retention of viability of b. animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 in the camel milk-based product during storage at 4 degrees c up to 5 wk. no spoilage organisms were detected in any of  the samples tested in this study. in conclusion, supplementation of cultured dairy foods, especially those made from camel milk, with honey is recommended because honey is a healthy natural sweetener with a variety of beneficial microbiological, nutritional, and sensory properties.

TI  == assessing the effects of exposure to environmental stress on some functional properties of bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis.
AB  == this study assessed the effects of exposing a strain of bifidobacterium animalis  ssp. lactis to acid, bile and osmotic stresses on antagonistic properties, biofilm formation and antibiotic susceptibility/resistance profile. exposure to each stress factor appeared to have no significant effect on the antagonism against escherichia coli nctc 12900 and salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis pt4. no suppression in biofilm formation due to exposure to stress was observed.  bile and osmotic stresses resulted in significantly higher biofilm formation. expression of an exopolysaccharide synthesis gene, gtf 01207, was significantly higher when the b. animalis ssp. lactis strain was exposed to osmotic stress. susceptibility of the b. animalis ssp. lactis strain to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, ampicillin and vancomycin, and resistance to tetracycline remained  unchanged when exposed to each stress. the expression of a tetracycline resistance gene, tet(w), was significantly higher when exposed to each stress. these results may suggest that the potential for the b. animalis ssp. lactis strain to provide probiotic benefit, after exposure to the stressful conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, remains intact.

TI  == potential probiotic bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis 420 prevents weight gain and glucose intolerance in diet-induced obese mice.
AB  == alterations of the gut microbiota and mucosal barrier are linked with metabolic diseases. our aim was to investigate the potential benefit of the potential probiotic bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis 420 in reducing high-fat diet-induced body weight gain and diabetes in mice. in the obesity model, c57bl/6j mice were fed a high-fat diet (60 energy %) for 12 weeks, and gavaged daily with b. lactis 420 (109 cfu) or vehicle. in the diabetes model, mice were fed a high-fat, ketogenic diet (72 energy % fat) for 4 weeks, with a 6-week subsequent treatment with b. lactis 420 (108-1010 cfu/day) or vehicle, after which they were analysed for body composition. we also analysed glucose tolerance, plasma lipopolysaccharide and target tissue inflammation using only one of the b. lactis 420 groups (109 cfu/day). intestinal bacterial translocation and adhesion were analysed in a separate experiment using an escherichia coli gavage. body fat mass was increased in both obese (10.7 +/- 0.8 g (mean +/- standard error of mean) vs. 1.86 +/- 0.21 g, p<0.001) and diabetic mice (3.01 +/- 0.4 g vs. 1.14 +/- 0.15 g, p<0.001) compared to healthy controls. treatment with  b. lactis 420 significantly decreased fat mass in obese (7.83 +/- 0.67 g, p=0.007 compared to obese with vehicle) and diabetic mice (1.89 +/- 0.16 g, p=0.02 for highest dose). this was reflected as reduced weight gain and improved glucose tolerance. furthermore, b. lactis 420 decreased plasma lipopolysaccharide levels  (p<0.001), liver inflammation (p=0.04), and e. coli adhesion in the distal gut (p<0.05). in conclusion, b. lactis 420 reduces fat mass and glucose intolerance in both obese and diabetic mice. reduced intestinal mucosal adherence and plasma  lipopolysaccharide suggest a mechanism related to reduced translocation of gut microbes.

TI  == probiotic bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07 alleviates bacterial translocation and ameliorates microinflammation in experimental uraemia.
AB  == aim: uraemia is characterized by intestinal bacterial translocation, which contributes to the development of microinflammation. probiotics enhance the intestinal barrier and overall health of the host. the present study investigated whether the probiotic bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07 alleviates bacterial translocation and ameliorates microinflammation in experimental uraemia. methods: sixty sprague-dawley rats were divided into three groups of 20  rats each: the sham group, which underwent only laparotomy; the uraemia group, which underwent 5/6 nephrectomy; and the uraemia + probiotic group, which underwent 5/6 nephrectomy and daily intragastric administration of b. animalis subsp. lactis bi-07 for 4 weeks. bacterial translocation was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the green fluorescent protein (gfp) gene from oral gfp-labelled escherichia coli in the peripheral blood, mesenteric  lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. intestinal permeability, plasma inflammatory biomarker levels, and endotoxin levels were measured. jejunum, ileum, and colon specimens were removed for histological examination. results: uraemic rats exhibited a significantly higher incidence of bacterial translocation (70%) than  did sham rats (10%). probiotic treatment resulted in a decrease in bacterial translocation (20%). intestinal permeability, inflammatory biomarker levels, and  endotoxin levels in uraemic rats were significantly higher than those in the sham group. after treatment with the probiotic, inflammatory biomarker levels significantly decreased. uraemic rats demonstrated superficial mucosal erosion and inflammatory cell infiltration in the small intestine, and administration of  the probiotic alleviated these lesions. conclusion: the probiotic b. animalis subsp. lactis bi-07 alleviate bacterial translocation and ameliorate microinflammation through the recovery of intestinal mucosal integrity.

TI  == identification of restriction-modification systems of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis cncm i-2494 by smrt sequencing and associated methylome analysis.
AB  == bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis cncm i-2494 is a component of a commercialized fermented dairy product for which beneficial effects on health has been studied by clinical and preclinical trials. to date little is known about the molecular mechanisms that could explain the beneficial effects that bifidobacteria impart to the host. restriction-modification (r-m) systems have been identified as key obstacles in the genetic accessibility of bifidobacteria,  and circumventing these is a prerequisite to attaining a fundamental understanding of bifidobacterial attributes, including the genes that are responsible for health-promoting properties of this clinically and industrially important group of bacteria. the complete genome sequence of b. animalis subsp. lactis cncm i-2494 is predicted to harbour the genetic determinants for two type  ii r-m systems, designated banli and banlii. in order to investigate the functionality and specificity of these two putative r-m systems in b. animalis subsp. lactis cncm i-2494, we employed pacbio smrt sequencing with associated methylome analysis. in addition, the contribution of the identified r-m systems to the genetic accessibility of this strain was assessed.

TI  == biochemical and kinetic characterisation of a novel xylooligosaccharide-upregulated gh43 beta-d-xylosidase/alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase (bxa43) from the probiotic bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12.
AB  == the bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 gene bif_00092, assigned to encode a beta-d-xylosidase (bxa43) of glycoside hydrolase family 43 (gh43), was cloned with a c-terminal his-tag and expressed in escherichia coli. bxa43 was purified to homogeneity from the cell lysate and found to be a dual-specificity exo-hydrolase active on para-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside (pnpx), para-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-arabinofuranoside (pnpa), beta-(1 --> 4)-xylopyranosyl oligomers (xos) of degree of polymerisation (dp) 2-4, and birchwood xylan. a phylogenetic tree of the 92 characterised gh43 enzymes displayed five distinct groups (i - v) showing specificity differences. bxa43 belonged to group iv and had an activity ratio for pnpa:pnpx of 1:25. bxa43 was stable below 40 degrees c  and at ph 4.0-8.0 and showed maximum activity at ph 5.5 and 50 degrees c. km and  kcat for pnpx were 15.6 +/- 4.2 mm and 60.6 +/- 10.8 s-1, respectively, and substrate inhibition became apparent above 18 mm pnpx. similar kinetic parameters and catalytic efficiency values were reported for beta-d-xylosidase (xynb3) from  geobacillus stearothermophilus t6 also belonging to group iv. the activity of bxa43 for xylooligosaccharides increased with the size and was 2.3 and 5.6 fold higher, respectively for xylobiose and xylotetraose compared to pnpx. bxa43 showed clearly metal inhibition for zn2+ and ag+, which is different to its close homologues. multiple sequence alignment and homology modelling indicated that arg505tyr506 present in bxa43 are probably important for binding to xylotetraose  at subsite +3 and occur only in gh43 from the bifidobacterium genus.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri and escherichia coli in the human gut microbiota may predict weight gain associated with vancomycin treatment.
AB  == background: antibiotics, used for 60 years to promote weight gain in animals, have been linked to obesity in adults and in children when administered during early infancy. lactobacillus reuteri has been linked to obesity and weight gain in children affected with kwashiorkor using ready-to-use therapeutic food. in contrast, escherichia coli has been linked with the absence of obesity. both of these bacteria are resistant to vancomycin. objectives and methods: we assessed vancomycin-associated weight and gut microbiota changes, and tested whether bacterial species previously linked with body mass index (bmi) predict weight gain at 1 year. all endocarditis patients treated with vancomycin or amoxicillin  in our center were included from january 2008 to december 2010. bacteroidetes, firmicutes, lactobacillus and methanobrevibacter smithii were quantified using real-time pcr on samples obtained during the 4-6 weeks antibiotic regimen. l. reuteri, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, bifidobacterium animalis and e. coli were quantified on stool samples obtained during the first week of antibiotics. results: of the193 patients included in the study, 102 were treated with vancomycin and 91 with amoxicillin. vancomycin was associated with a 10% bmi increase (odds ratio (or) 14.1; 95% confidence interval (ci; 1.03-194); p=0.047)  and acquired obesity (4/41 versus 0/56, p=0.01). in patients treated with vancomycin, firmicutes, bacteroidetes and lactobacillus increased, whereas m. smithii decreased (p<0.05). the absence of e. coli was an independent predictor of weight gain (or=10.7; 95% ci (1.4-82.0); p=0.02). strikingly, a patient with an 18% bmi increase showed a dramatic increase of l. reuteri but no increase of e. coli. conclusion: the acquired obesity observed in patients treated with vancomycin may be related to a modulation of the gut microbiota rather than a direct antibiotic effect. l. reuteri, which is resistant to vancomycin and produces broad bacteriocins, may have an instrumental role in this effect.

TI  == impact of 6 different intestinal bacteria on broiler breeder sperm motility in vitro.
AB  == male fertility is often evaluated by measuring sperm parameters, including concentration, viability, and motility. this is important because after copulation occurs, sperm must overcome many barriers in the female reproductive tract to fertilize the ovum. in mammalian species, sperm have been shown to have  reduced motility when bacteria are present. in male broiler breeders, bacteria have been associated with spermatozoa, but their effect on motility has not been  investigated. the sperm quality index is a modern rapid method of evaluating avian sperm motility. therefore, the objective of this study was to use the sperm quality index to determine if broiler breeder sperm motility is reduced when semen is exposed to various bacteria. in this experiment, semen was collected from 20 broiler breeders to obtain a pooled neat semen sample. six different intestinal bacteria, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium bifermentans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis were cultured overnight. for each bacterium, 50 microl of semen was diluted in 450 microl of saline, sterile broth, or the overnight culture, creating 3 treatments. the experiment was repeated twice. in each treatment, 3 replicates were evaluated at 0 and 10 min postinoculation, creating a completely randomized  design with a split plot over time. also, the ph was measured for each treatment  at 0 and 10 min. the results indicated that all broths containing bacteria immediately reduced broiler breeder sperm motility when compared with the controls (p < 0.0001), but broths containing bifidobacterium or lactobacillus virtually made sperm immotile. although broth containing salmonella, campylobacter, and bifidobacterium immediately reduced sperm motility, the reduction did not change over time. broths containing e. coli, clostridium, and lactobacillus reduced sperm motility immediately, but over time motility continued to decrease. however, ph was increased when semen was exposed to the e. coli and campylobacter treatment, but when semen was exposed to bifidobacterium and lactobacillus treatments, ph was reduced. in conclusion, the results indicate that bacteria can reduce broiler breeder sperm motility upon exposure.

TI  == correlation between body mass index and gut concentrations of lactobacillus reuteri, bifidobacterium animalis, methanobrevibacter smithii and escherichia coli.
AB  == background: genus and species level analysis is the best way to characterize alterations in the human gut microbiota that are associated with obesity, because the clustering of obese and lean microbiotas increases with the taxonomic depth of the analysis. bifidobacterium genus members have been associated with a lean status, whereas different lactobacillus species are associated both with a lean and an obese status. objectives and methods: we analyzed the fecal concentrations of bacteroidetes, firmicutes, methanobrevibacter smithii, the genus lactobacillus, five other lactobacillus species previously linked with lean or obese populations, escherichia coli and bifidobacterium animalis in 263 individuals, including 134 obese, 38 overweight, 76 lean and 15 anorexic subjects to test for the correlation between bacterial concentration and body mass index (bmi). of these subjects, 137 were used in our previous study. findings: firmicutes were found in >98.5%, bacteroidetes in 67%, m. smithii in 64%, e. coli in 51%, lactobacillus species between 17 and 25% and b. animalis in 11% of individuals. the fecal concentration of lactobacillus reuteri was positively correlated with bmi (coefficient=0.85; 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.12-0.58; p=0.02) in agreement with what was reported for lactobacillus sakei. as reported, b. animalis (coefficient=-0.84; 95% ci -1.61 to -0.07; p=0.03) and m. smithii (coefficient=-0.43, 95% ci -0.90 to 0.05; p=0.08) were negatively associated with the bmi. unexpectedly, e. coli was found here for the first time to negatively correlate with the bmi (coefficient=-1.05; 95% ci -1.60 to -0.50; p<0.001). conclusion: our findings confirm the specificity of the obese microbiota and emphasize the correlation between the concentration of certain lactobacillus species and obesity.

TI  == myosin-cross-reactive antigens from four different lactic acid bacteria are fatty acid hydratases.
AB  == the 67 kda myosin-cross-reactive antigen (mcra) is a member of the mcra family of proteins present in a wide range of bacteria and was predicted to have fatty acid isomerase function. we have now characterised the catalytic activity of mcras from four lab stains, including lactobacillus rhamnosus lgg, l. plantarum st-iii, l. acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12. mcra genes  from these strains were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein function was analysed with lipid profiles by gc-ms. the four  mcras catalysed the conversion of linoleic acid and oleic acid to their respective 10-hydroxy derivatives, which suggests that mcra proteins catalyse the first step in conjugated linoleic acid production. this is the first report of mcra from l. rhamnosus with such catalytic function.

TI  == analysis of the human intestinal epithelial cell transcriptional response to lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, bifidobacterium lactis and escherichia coli.
AB  == the complex microbial population residing in the human gastrointestinal tract consists of commensal, potential pathogenic and beneficial species, which are probably perceived differently by the host and consequently could be expected to  trigger specific transcriptional responses. here, we provide a comparative analysis of the global in vitro transcriptional response of human intestinal epithelial cells to lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus salivarius ls-33, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420, and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 (ehec). interestingly, l. salivarius ls-33 dce-induced changes were overall more similar to those of b. lactis 420 than to l. acidophilus ncfm, which is consistent with previously observed in vivo immunomodulation properties. in the gene ontology and pathway analyses both specific and unspecific changes were observed. common to all was the regulation of apoptosis and adipogenesis, and lipid-metabolism related regulation by the probiotics. specific changes such as regulation of cell-cell adhesion by b. lactis 420, superoxide metabolism by l. salivarius ls-33, and regulation of mapk  pathway by l. acidophilus ncfm were noted. furthermore, fundamental differences were observed between the pathogenic and probiotic treatments in the toll-like receptor pathway, especially for adapter molecules with a lowered level of transcriptional activation of myd88, trif, irak1 and traf6 by probiotics compared to ehec. the results in this study provide insights into the relationship between probiotics and human intestinal epithelial cells, notably with regard to strain-specific responses, and highlight the differences between transcriptional  responses to pathogenic and probiotic bacteria.

TI  == incorporation of probiotic bacteria in whey cheese: decreasing the risk of microbial contamination.
AB  == for dairy products that are consumed fresh, contamination by spoilage microorganisms and pathogens from the environment is a major concern. contamination has been associated with a number of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses; however, consistent data pertaining to the microbial safety of whey cheeses specifically have not been reported. hence, the goals of this research effort were (i) to manufacture a probiotic whey cheese with bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus casei and (ii) to assess the antimicrobial activity of these probiotics against a set of foodborne pathogens (listeria innocua, salmonella enteritidis, and staphylococcus aureus) and food spoilage microorganisms (pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli). three ranges of these microbial contaminants were used for inoculation of cheeses: 10(3) to 10(4), 10(4) to 10(6), and 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/g. inoculation in plain culture medium served as a control. the inhibition produced by the probiotics was calculated, and the major effect was found to be bacteriostatic. in specific cases, full inhibition was observed, i.e., by b. animalis against p. aeruginosa and by l. casei against salmonella enteritidis and l. innocua. conversely, the least inhibition was detected for l. casei against p. aeruginosa. our results suggest that use of these probiotic strains can extend the shelf life of whey cheeses and make them safer by delaying or preventing growth of common contaminant bacteria.

TI  == intestinal mucosal adherence and translocation of commensal bacteria at the early onset of type 2 diabetes: molecular mechanisms and probiotic treatment.
AB  == a fat-enriched diet modifies intestinal microbiota and initiates a low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes. here, we demonstrate that before the onset of diabetes, after only one week of a high-fat diet (hfd), live  commensal intestinal bacteria are present in large numbers in the adipose tissue  and the blood where they can induce inflammation. this translocation is prevented in mice lacking the microbial pattern recognition receptors nod1 or cd14, but overtly increased in myd88 knockout and ob/ob mouse. this 'metabolic bacteremia'  is characterized by an increased co-localization with dendritic cells from the intestinal lamina propria and by an augmented intestinal mucosal adherence of non-pathogenic escherichia coli. the bacterial translocation process from intestine towards tissue can be reversed by six weeks of treatment with the probiotic strain bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420, which improves the animals' overall inflammatory and metabolic status. altogether, these data demonstrate that the early onset of hfd-induced hyperglycemia is characterized by an increased bacterial translocation from intestine towards tissues, fuelling a continuous metabolic bacteremia, which could represent new therapeutic targets.

TI  == late rather than early responses of human dendritic cells highlight selective induction of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == the probiotic properties of commensal bacteria including lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are likely to be determined at least in part by their effects on dendritic cells. like traditional immune stimulants such as lipopolysaccharides (lps), probiotic bacteria promote maturation of cultured human dendritic cells (dc) by inducing elevated expression of mhc-ii and co-stimulatory molecules. different effects have been reported on cytokine induction, especially of major regulatory cytokines such as tnf-alpha, il-12 and il-10. yet, these previous analyses have failed to reveal consistent differences between such effects of probiotics on the one hand, and of lps on the other. selective response markers for probiotics, however, would be important for our understanding of their biological properties and for a rational selection of strains for in vivo studies. in this study, we compared in detail both early and late effects on cultured human dc of 4 different probiotics with those of lps. at the early stages of stimulation, all stimuli induced qualitatively very similar responses in dc at the level of surface markers and secretion of cytokines and chemokines.  a lower immune stimulatory effect was observed by bifidobacterium animalis bb-12  as compared to lactobacilli. late responses, on the other hand, tended to diverge. microarray transcript profiling for 268 cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and their receptors after 2 days of culture revealed various transcripts  to be selectively induced by certain probiotics but not lps. our data indicate that late rather than early dc responses may be helpful to clarify the divergent  biological effects of probiotics on human innate immune responses.

TI  == comparison of in vitro models to study bacterial adhesion to the intestinal epithelium.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the adhesion ability of intestinal bacteria to different in vitro models of intestinal epithelia, and to estimate the suitability of these models and the type of interactions involved. methods and results: the adhesion of probiotic (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb12), commensal (b. animalis iata-a2 and b. bifidum iata-es2) and potentially pathogenic bacteria (e. coli and l. monocytogenes) was determined. the adhesion models used were polycarbonate-well plates, with or without mucin, and different configurations of caco-2 and/or ht29-mtx cell cultures. all bacteria adhered to wells without mucin (2.6-27.3%), the values being highly variable depending on the bacterial strain. adhesion percentages of potentially probiotic bacteria to caco-2 cultures were remarkably lower (p < 0.05) than those to mucin, and more similar to those of pathogenic strains. the lowest adhesion of different bacterial strains was detected on ht29-mtx (0.5-2.3%) cultures and caco-2/ht29-mtx (0.6-3.2%) cocultures, while these values were increased in caco-2 cultures plus mucin. conclusions: the results suggested that bacterial strains exhibit different capacities to adhere to cellular components and several types of mucin present in different models, showing preferences for intestinal muc2. significance and impact of the study: the use of caco-2 cells monolayer plus mucin (type ii) better approaches the physiological characteristics of in vivo situation, providing a reliable and suitable in vitro model to evaluate bacterial adhesion.

TI  == comparative study of bifidobacterium animalis, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei and saccharomyces boulardii probiotic properties.
AB  == the present work investigates some probiotic properties of four different microorganisms (bifidobacterium animalis var. lactis bb-12, escherichia coli emo, lactobacillus casei and saccharomyces boulardii). in vitro and in vivo tests were carried out to compare cell wall hydrophobicity, production of antagonistic substances, survival capacity in the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free mice without pathological consequence, and immune modulation by stimulation of kupffer cells, intestinal siga and il-10 levels. in vitro antagonism against pathogenic bacteria and yeast was only observed for the probiotic bacteria b. animalis and l. casei. the hydrophobic property of the cell wall was higher for b. animalis and e. coli emo, and this property could be responsible for a better ability to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free mice. higher levels of siga were observed mainly for s. boulardii, followed by e. coli emo and b. animalis, and only s. boulardii induced a significant higher level of il-10. in conclusion, for a probiotic use, s. boulardii presented better characteristics in terms of immunomodulation, and b. animalis and l. casei for antagonistic substance production. the knowledge of the different probiotic properties could be used to  choice the better microorganism depending on the therapeutic or prophylactic application.

AB  == bifidobacteria are normal inhabitants of the human gut. some strains of this genus are considered health promoting or probiotic, being included in numerous food products. in order to exert their health benefits, these bacteria must overcome biological barriers, including bile salts, to colonize and survive in specific parts of the intestinal tract. the role of multidrug resistance (mdr) transporters in bile resistance of probiotic bacteria and the effect of bile on probiotic gene expression are not fully understood. in the present study, the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of bile on the expression levels of predicted mdr genes from three different bifidobacterial strains, belonging to bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis, was tested. in this way, two putative mdr genes whose expression was induced by bile, bl0920 from b. longum and its homolog, bbr0838, from b. breve, were identified. the expression of the bl0920 gene in escherichia  coli was shown to confer resistance to bile, likely to be mediated by active efflux from the cells. to the best of our knowledge, this represents the first identified bifidobacterial bile efflux pump whose expression is induced by bile.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

TI  == postnatal development of bacterial population in the gastrointestinal tract of calves.
AB  == bacterial 16s rdna from fecal samples of two calves were amplified by pcr and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; selected bands were sequenced. escherichia coli and bifidobacterium animalis were the initial colonizers, followed by species closely related to the genera bacteroides, clostridium and faecalibacterium. change of diet was connected with shifts of bacterial population and with the occurrence of many bacterial species that have  not been cultured up to now. the diet change corresponded with an alteration in a volatile-fatty-acid concentration in fecal samples.

TI  == genetically engineered bifidobacterium animalis expressing the salmonella flagellin gene for the mucosal immunization in a mouse model.
AB  == background: a critical component of the host defense against enteric infections is the immunological response of the mucosal membrane, a major starting point of  infectious disease, such as typhoid fever. the mucosal immune system consists of  an integrated network of lymphoid tissues, mucous membrane-associated cells, and  effector molecules. in the present study, we developed a recombinant bifidobacterium animalis (b. animalis) genetically modified with the salmonella flagellin gene for mucosal immunization as an oral typhoid vaccine. methods: we constructed an oral vaccine against salmonella typhimurium, consisting of recombinant b. animalis containing the flagellin gene of salmonella. the recombinant b. animalis was administered orally to mice every other day for 6 weeks. anti-flagellin antibodies in the serum and stools were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). results: we detected significantly higher levels of flagellin-specific iga in the serum and stools of the mice treated with the recombinant b. animalis containing the flagellin gene than was seen in those treated with parental b. animalis. conclusions: our findings suggest that an oral vaccination using recombinant b. animalis genetically modified with the flagellin gene of salmonella may be effective against salmonella infections.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. the genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of eps-encoding genes. however, the physiological role that epss play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. in this study, we have assessed the effect of epss produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum nb667, and bifidobacterium animalis ipla-r1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. the eps fraction gg had no significant effect on the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg and b. animalis ipla-r1. however, the eps fractions nb667 and  ipla-r1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. in contrast, the three eps fractions increased the adhesion of enterobacter sakazakii atcc 29544 and escherichia coli nctc 8603. higher adherence of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 29631 and clostridium difficile atcc 9689 was detected in the presence of the eps fractions gg and nb667. in general,  these effects were obtained at eps concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were eps dose dependent. the competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of eps could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus.  the increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific epss and the bound epss are  able to adhere to mucus. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of epss from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.

TI  == probiotic bacteria bifidobacterium animalis mb5 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg protect intestinal caco-2 cells from the inflammation-associated response induced by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli k88.
AB  == probiotic bacteria may provide protection against intestinal damage induced by pathogens, but the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. we investigated whether bifidobacterium animalis mb5 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg  (lgg) protected intestinal caco-2 cells from the inflammation-associated response induced by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) k88, by inhibiting pathogen attachment to the cells, which is the first step of etec pathogenicity, and regulating neutrophil recruitment, a crucial component of inflammation. a partial reduction of etec adhesion was exerted by probiotics and their culture supernatant fractions either undigested or digested with proteases. etec viability was unaffected by the presence of b. animalis, lgg or their supernatant fractions in the culture medium, indicating an absence of probiotic bactericidal  activity. probiotics and their supernatant fractions, either undigested or digested with proteases, strongly inhibited the neutrophil transmigration caused  by etec. both b. animalis and lgg counteracted the pathogen-induced up regulation of il-8, growth-related oncogene-alpha and epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide-78 gene expression, which are chemokines essential for neutrophil migration. moreover, the probiotics prevented the etec-induced increased expression of il-1beta and tnf-alpha and decrease of transforming growth factor-alpha, which are regulators of chemokine expression. these results indicate that b. animalis mb5 and lgg protect intestinal cells from the inflammation-associated response caused by etec k88 by partly reducing pathogen adhesion and by counteracting neutrophil migration, probably through the regulation of chemokine and cytokine expression.

TI  == characterization of the genus bifidobacterium by automated ribotyping and 16s rrna gene sequences.
AB  == in order to characterize the genus bifidobacterium, ribopatterns and approximately 500 bp (escherichia coli positions 27 to 520) of 16s rrna gene sequences of 28 type strains and 64 reference strains of the genus bifidobacterium were determined. ribopatterns obtained from bifidobacterium strains were divided into nine clusters (clusters i-ix) with a similarity of 60%. cluster v, containing 17 species, was further subdivided into 22 subclusters with a similarity of 90%. in the genus bifidobacterium, four groups were shown according to miyake et al.: (i) the bifidobacterium longum infantis-longum-suis type group, (ii) the b. catenulatum-pseudocatenulatum group, (iii) the b. gallinarum-saeculare-pullorum group, and (iv) the b. coryneforme-indicum group, which showed higher than 97% similarity of the 16s rrna gene sequences in each group. using ribotyping analysis, unique ribopatterns were obtained from these species, and they could be separated by cluster analysis. ribopatterns of six b.  adolescentis strains were separated into different clusters, and also showed diversity in 16s rrna gene sequences. b. adolescentis consisted of heterogeneous  strains. the nine strains of b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum were divided into five subclusters. each type strain of b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum and b. pseudolongum subsp. globosum and two intermediate groups, which were suggested by yaeshima et al., consisted of individual clusters. b. animalis subsp. animalis and b. animalis subsp. lactis could not be separated by ribotyping using eco ri. we conclude that ribotyping is able to provide another characteristic of bifidobacterium strains in addition to 16s rrna gene sequence phylogenetic analysis, and this information suggests that ribotyping analysis is  a useful tool for the characterization of bifidobacterium species in combination  with other techniques for taxonomic characterization.

TI  == enzymatic ability of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis to hydrolyze milk proteins: identification and characterization of endopeptidase o.
AB  == the proteolytic system of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis was analyzed, and an intracellular endopeptidase (pepo) was identified and characterized. this  work reports the first complete cloning, purification, and characterization of a  proteolytic enzyme in bifidobacterium spp. aminopeptidase activities (general aminopeptidases, proline iminopeptidase, x-prolyl dipeptidylaminopeptidase) found in cell extracts of b. animalis subsp. lactis were higher for cells that had been grown in a milk-based medium than for those grown in mrs. a high specific proline iminopeptidase activity was observed in b. animalis subsp. lactis. whole cells and cell wall-bound protein fractions showed no caseinolytic activity; however, the combined action of intracellular proteolytic enzymes could hydrolyze casein fractions rapidly. the endopeptidase activity of b. animalis subsp. lactis was examined in more detail, and the gene encoding an endopeptidase o in b. animalis  subsp. lactis was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli. the deduced amino acid sequence for b. animalis subsp. lactis pepo indicated that it is a member of the m13 peptidase family of zinc metallopeptidases and displays 67.4% sequence homology with the predicted pepo protein from bifidobacterium longum. the recombinant enzyme was shown to be a 74-kda monomer. activity of b. animalis subsp. lactis pepo was found with oligopeptide substrates of at least 5 amino acid residues, such as met-enkephalin, and with larger substrates, such as the 23-amino-acid peptide alpha s1-casein(f1-23). the predominant peptide bond cleaved by b. animalis subsp. lactis pepo was on the n-terminal side of phenylalanine residues. the enzyme also showed a post-proline secondary cleavage  site.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in pcr amplification of lactic acid bacteria (lab). an appropriately-sized pcr product was obtained from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll43-1 and mg1363; lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lc10-1, lc11-1, and  lc12-1; streptococcus thermophilus st1-1; enterococcus faecalis ef1-1; lactobacillus acidophilus la1-1; lactobacillus helveticus lh1-1; pediococcus pentosaceus pp1-1; and bifidobacterium animalis ba1-1. the pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the human y-box factor. the amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also  highly conserved in the lab strains. it is possible, therefore, that this protein in lab may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an rna chaperone unwinding tightly folded rna molecules.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == characterization of the plasmid pmb1 from bifidobacterium longum and its use for  shuttle vector construction.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the 1847-bp bifidobacterium longum b2577 cryptic plasmid pmb1 was determined. the plasmid had a g+c content of 62.0%, and contained two open reading frames, orf1 and orf2, likely arranged in an operon. the proteins encoded by orf1 and orf2 show the highest degree of similarity with  similarly arranged peptide sequences translated from corynebacterium glutamicum pxz10142 and mycobacterium fortuitum pal5000 plasmids. recombinant plasmids containing the pmb1 replicon were able to replicate in bifidobacterium animalis mb209. the successful transformation of this strain with pmb1-based plasmids facilitated characterization of this replicon, results of which showed that both  orf1 and orf2 are necessary for plasmid replication. a family of new escherichia  coli-b. animalis shuttle plasmids, based on the pmb1 replicon and expressing a cat and an ery gene, was constructed.
