TI  == acid production and growth by oral lactobacillus species in vitro.
AB  == aim: to analyze the acid-producing and growth abilities of different oral lactobacillus species. methods: thirty-nine oral clinical strains and type strains of lactobacillus, representing nine species, including lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus vaginalis were studied. anaerobically-grown bacterial cells were inoculated overnight in de man, rogosa,  and sharpe broth containing 2% glucose (ph 7.0). acid production and growth were  measured at 0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. results: lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei/paracasei, and lactobacillus plantarum grew rapidly and reached an optical density higher than other species.  they also produced more acid than the others. lactobacillus vaginalis showed the  lowest rate of growth and acid production. these findings demonstrated that the different species of lactobacillus showed different abilities to generate acid, allowing the species to be categorized into three groups: strongly, moderately, and weakly acidogenic. conclusion: there was variation in acid production and growth between the lactobacillus species. the strongest acid producers were lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei/paracasei, respectively. it seems possible that these species might play a more important role in caries development than the others.

TI  == inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. methods and results: total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral lactobacillus, lactobacillus fermentum (195), lactobacillus salivarius (53), lactobacillus casei (20), lactobacillus gasseri (18), lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), lactobacillus paracasei (12), lactobacillus mucosae (12), lactobacillus oris (12), lactobacillus plantarum (11) and lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. most oral lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. the strongest inhibitory activity was associated with lact. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus, lact. casei and lact. salivarius. lactobacillus sd1-sd6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 in the biofilm model. also, it was demonstrated that growth of strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with lact. paracasei sd1. the inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. conclusions: the results have shown that oral lactobacillus sd1-sd6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against strep. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, gram-negative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. significance  and impact of the study: the results indicated that lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

TI  == the identification of vaginal lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal dna probes to 20 american type culture collection lactobacillus strains. most women were colonized by l. crispatus (32%), followed by l. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated l. 1086v (15%), l. gasseri (5%), l. fermentum (0.3%), l. oris (0.3%), l. reuteri  (0.3%), l. ruminis (0.3%), and l. vaginalis (0.3%). h2o2 was produced by 95% of l. crispatus and 94% of l. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of l. 1086v.  colonization by l. crispatus or l. jensenii was positively associated with being  white (p<.001), age >/=20 years (p=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (p=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (p<.001) and gonorrhea (p=.03). l. crispatus and l. jensenii, not l. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.

TI  == enzyme production by lactobacilli and the potential link with infective endocarditis.
AB  == fifty-six strains of lactobacilli were examined for the production of glycosidases and proteases (arylamidases) that could be associated with the ability to grow in vivo and/or be a factor in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. the strains were from seven species, with an emphasis on lactobacillus rhamnosus  and lact. paracasei subsp. paracasei, both of which have been associated with endocarditis and provided 12 of the 13 strains isolated from cases of the disease. other species were lact. acidophilus, lact. plantarum, lact. salivarius, lact. fermentum and lact. oris. commonly expressed glycosidase activities were alpha-d-galactosidase and beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase followed by beta-d-glucosidase and alpha-l-fucosidase. the combined production of beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase and alpha-d-galactosidase was a feature of the endocarditis isolates. in contrast, beta-d-galactosidase was produced by very few of the strains within species implicated in endocarditis but most of the strains  of lact. salivarius, lact. fermentum and lact. oris. the most commonly produced arylamidases active against substrates employed for testing human blood clotting  cascade were activated protein c(ca)-like, activated factor x(xa)-like and hageman factor-like followed by kallikrein-like and chymotrypsin-like enzymes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == pathogenic potential of lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacilli are often considered to be commensal or beneficial participants in human microbial ecology and considerable research is being carried out into the effects of the use of lactobacilli as additives in both human and animal diets. however, lactobacilli also cause some human diseases (e.g. dental caries, rheumatic vascular disease, septicaemia and infective endocarditis (ie)), and have recently been identified as potential emerging pathogens in elderly and immunocompromised patients, particularly those receiving broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. the identification of potential pathogenic traits amongst lactobacilli will therefore facilitate the use of the organisms for probiotic purposes. the ability to aggregate human platelets is considered to be a possible pathogenic trait in the progression of ie. a comparison of bacterial cell surface properties amongst l. rhamnosus strains showed that platelets were aggregated by  5/5 ie strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. for the l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. however two strains, morphological mutants of a non-aggregating strain, which had been re-isolated after passaging through rats were found to aggregate platelets. no loss of aggregating function occurred on extensive subculturing of ie strains. aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains for five other species, namely, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus salvivarius, with each species being represented indicating that the property is not uncommon in the genus. a comparison of ie and oral isolates of l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei and seven other lactobacillus species, has shown that the binding of both fibronectin and fibrinogen by lactobacilli is greatly increased, up to 50 fold, when the ph is reduced from 7.0 to 5.0. re-exposing the lactobacilli to a neutral ph environment releases most of the bound proteins, but the amount still  remaining bound to the cell is several times more than is bound at neutral ph. lactobacilli will also bind to the proteins that make up the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells. lactobacilli bound significantly better to collagen types i and v than to types iii and iv (p < 0.01). further, strains isolated from ie cases, particularly l. rhamnosus strains, bound significantly better to types i and v than did 'normal' strains (p < 0.02). type v collagen has been demonstrated at the sites of endothelial damage. thus the binding of lactobacilli, particularly l. rhamnosus to these collagen types may be of importance in the early stages of colonization of the damaged heart valve.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the aggregation of human platelets by lactobacillus species.
AB  == the ability to aggregate human platelets was examined for five lactobacillus rhamnosus strains and five lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei strains isolated from patients with infective endocarditis (ie), 25 laboratory isolates from the same two species, and 14 strains from five other oral species, namely lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus salivarius. amongst the l. rhamnosus strains, platelets were aggregated by all five ie strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. for the l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains, the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains of the other five  species; each species was represented. the optimal ratio of bacteria to platelets for aggregation was approximately 1:1, and there was considerable variation in the lag phase that preceded aggregation, depending on the source of the platelets. overall, the lag phase varied between 0.25 +/- 0.1 and 20.4 +/- 3.2 min and the percentage aggregation ranged between 70 +/- 2.6 and 104 +/- 13.5%. confirmation that aggregation was being observed came from studies with five strains on the inhibitory effects of edta, dipyridamole, apyrase, imipramine, acetylsalicylic acid and quinacrine. inhibition of aggregation by l. rhamnosus strains by the peptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine (rgds) further indicated a role for fibronectin and/or fibrinogen. pronase treatment of cells for 1 h and extraction of bacterial surface components with 0.1 m-tris/hcl (ph 8.5) at 37 degrees c for 1 h stopped aggregation in 8/9 ie strains. extracted surface proteins (200 micrograms) completely inhibited platelet aggregation by 8/9 of the homologous strains.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
