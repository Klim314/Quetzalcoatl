TI  == biochemistry of pufa double bond isomerases producing conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  == the biotransformation of linoleic acid (la) into conjugated linoleic acid (cla) by microorganisms is a potentially useful industrial process. in most cases, however, the identities of proteins involved and the details of enzymatic activity regulation are far from clear. here we summarize available data on the reaction mechanisms of cla-producing enzymes characterized until now, from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, lactobacillus acidophilus, ptilota filicina, and propionibacterium acnes. a general feature of enzymatic la isomerization is the protein-assisted abstraction of an aliphatic hydrogen atom from position c-11, while the role of flavin as cofactor for the double bond activation in cla-producing enzymes is also discussed with regard to the recently published three-dimensional structure of an isomerase from p. acnes. combined data from structural studies, isotopic labeling experiments, and sequence comparison suggest that at least two different prototypical active site geometries occur among polyunsaturated fatty acid (pufa) double bond isomerases.

TI  == characterization of the cecal bacteria of normal pigs.
AB  == one hundred ninety-two isolates from cecal contents of three normal weaned pigs were obtained by means of anaerobic roll tube methods and were characterized. seventy-eight percent of the isolates were gram-negative. the most numerous species isolated from each of the pigs was bacteroides ruminicola. this species accounted for 35% of the isolates that were characterized, and selenomonas ruminantium accounted for 21% of the isolates. other gram-negative bacteria isolated from all three pigs were butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (6.0%) and bacteroides uniformis (3.0%); predominant gram-positive isolates were lactobacillus acidophilus (7.6%), peptostreptococcus productus (3.0%), and eubacterium aerofaciens (2.5%). the other 42 isolates were placed in 14 other species, and 5 additional isolates that did not fit well into existing species were not placed taxonomically. fifteen of the isolates (representing nine species) produced urease.
