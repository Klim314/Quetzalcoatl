identification of the intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoate depolymerase gene of paracoccus denitrificans and some properties of the gene product.
paracoccus denitrificans degraded poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (phb) in the cells under carbon source starvation. intracellular poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) (pha) depolymerase gene (phaz) was identified near the pha synthase gene (phac) of p. denitrificans. cell extract of escherichia coli carrying lacz--phaz fusion gene degraded protease-treated phb granules. reaction products were thought to be mainly d(--)-3-hydroxybutyrate (3hb) dimer and 3hb oligomer. diisopropylfluorophosphonate and triton x-100 exhibited an inhibitory effect on the degradation of phb granules. when cell extract of the recombinant e. coli was used, mg(2+) ion inhibited phb degradation. however, the inhibitory effect by mg(2+) ion was not observed using the cell extract of p. denitrificans.
analyses of a polyhydroxyalkanoic acid granule-associated 16-kilodalton protein and its putative regulator in the pha locus of paracoccus denitrificans.
the polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (pha) granule-associated 16-kda protein (ga16 protein) of paracoccus denitrificans was identified, and its corresponding gene was cloned and analyzed at the molecular level. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of ga16 protein revealed that its structural gene is located downstream from the pha synthase gene (phacpd) cloned recently (s. ueda, t. yabutani, a. maehara, and t. yamane, j. bacteriol. 178:774-779, 1996). gene walking around phacpd revealed two new open reading frames (orfs) possibly related to pha synthesis, one of which was the phappd gene, encoding ga16 protein, and the other was the pharpd gene, encoding a protein that is putatively involved in the regulation of the expression of phappd. overproduction of phappd was observed in escherichia coli carrying phappd, but the overproduction was not observed in the presence of pharpd. coexpression of phappd and pha biosynthesis genes in e. coli caused increases in both the number of poly-(3-hydroxybutyric acid) (phb) granules and phb content and caused decreases in both the size of the granules and the molecular weight of phb. ga16 protein was considered a phasin protein. the pharpd gene had significant similarities to stdc, a possible transcriptional factor of comamonas testosteroni, as well as to other orfs of unknown function previously found in other pha-synthetic bacteria.
inhibition by capsaicin of nadh-quinone oxidoreductases is correlated with the presence of energy-coupling site 1 in various organisms.
the nadh-ubiquinone reductase activity of the respiratory chains of several organisms was inhibited by capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, which are the pungent principles of red pepper. this inhibition was correlated with the presence of an energy transducing site in this segment of the respiratory chain. where the nadh-quinone oxidoreductase segment involved an energy coupling site (e.g., in paracoccus denitrificans, escherichia coli, and thermus thermophilus hb-8 membranes and bovine heart mitochondria), capsaicin acted as an inhibitor of ubiquinone reduction by nadh. in contrast, where this energy coupling site was absent (e.g., in saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria and bacillus subtilis membranes), there was no inhibition of nadh-ubiquinone reductase activity by capsaicin. the capsaicin inhibition of paracoccus membranes was reversed by washing the membranes with medium containing bovine serum albumin. in the e. coli and paracoccus membranes and bovine submitochondrial particles, capsaicin acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor for ubiquinone-1 at lower concentrations of ubiquinone-1 (less than 20 microm) and as a competitive inhibitor at higher concentrations of ubiquinone-1 (greater than 50 microm). in addition, the concentrations of capsaicin required for 50% inhibition of nadh oxidase activity of bovine submitochondrial particles were increased when ubiquinone-10 was added to the particles. the mechanism by which capsaicin inhibits the energy-transducing nadh-quinone oxidoreductase is discussed.
inhibition of nadh-ubiquinone reductase activity by n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and correlation of this inhibition with the occurrence of energy-coupling site 1 in various organisms.
the nadh-ubiquinone reductase activity of the respiratory chains of several organisms was inhibited by the carboxyl-modifying reagent n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (dccd). this inhibition correlated with the presence of an energy-transducing site in this segment of the respiratory chain. where the nadh-quinone reductase segment involved an energy-coupling site (e.g., in bovine heart and rat liver mitochondria, and in paracoccus denitrificans, escherichia coli, and thermus thermophilus hb-8 membranes), dccd acted as an inhibitor of ubiquinone reduction by nadh. by contrast, where energy-coupling site 1 was absent (e.g., in saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria and bacillus subtilis membranes), there was no inhibition of nadh-ubiquinone reductase activity by dccd. in the bovine and p. denitrificans systems, dccd inhibition was pseudo first order with respect to incubation time, and reaction order with respect to inhibitor concentration was close to unity, indicating that inhibition resulted from the binding of one inhibitor molecule per active unit of nadh-ubiquinone reductase. in the bovine nadh-ubiquinone reductase complex (complex i), [14c]dccd was preferentially incorporated into two subunits of molecular weight 49,000 and 29,000. the time course of labeling of the 29,000 molecular weight subunit with [14c]dccd paralleled the time course of inhibition of nadh-ubiquinone reductase activity.
the antibacterial action of tinopal an.
the bactericidal activity of tinopal an [1,1-bis(3,n-5-dimethyl-benzoxazol-2-yl)-methine p-toluene sulphonate] was shown to be due to a mechanism entirely independent of its inhibitory effects upon nadh dehydrogenase which were reported previously. whereas the compound had no significant effect upon dna synthesis in escherichia coli d22, rna and protein synthesis were immediately and markedly inhibited. in confirmation, tinopal an caused an immediate cessation in inducible beta-galactosidase synthesis in the same organism. an in vitro assay of the transcription of calf-thymus dna by purified e. coli rna polymerase showed that this process was inhibited by tinopal an.
