TI  == bidirectional cell-surface anchoring function of c-terminal repeat region of peptidoglycan hydrolase of lactococcus lactis il1403.
AB  == with the aim of constructing an efficient protein display system for lactic acid  bacteria (labs), the effect of fusion direction on the cell-surface binding activity of the c-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (cph) of lactococcus lactis il1403 was studied. cph fused to the alpha-amylase (amy) of streptococcus bovis 148 either at its c-terminus (cph-amy) or at its n-terminus (amy-cph) was expressed intracellularly in escherichia coli. this domain was able to direct binding of amy to the surface of l. lactis atcc 19435 in both constructs. however, the number of bound molecules per cell and the specific activity for starch digestion in the case of cph-amy were 3 and 14 times greater  than those in the case of amy-cph, respectively. of the labs tested, l. lactis atcc 19435 showed the highest binding capability for cph-amy, up to 6 x 10(4) molecules per cell, with a dissociation rate constant of 5.00 x 10(-5) s(-1). the binding of cph-amy to the surface of lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc 9649 cells was very stable with a dissociation rate constant of 6.96 x 10(-6) s(-1). the production of cph-amy in the soluble form increased 3-fold as a result of coexpression with a molecular chaperone, trigger factor. the results of this study suggest the usefulness of cph as a bidirectional anchor protein for the production of cell-surface adhesive enzymes in e. coli. furthermore, the importance of the fusion direction of cph in determining cell-surface binding and enzymatic activities was shown.

TI  == application of the extracellular alpha-amylase gene from streptococcus bovis 148  to construction of a secretion vector for yogurt starter strains.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus atcc 19258, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus t-11, and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 were transformed with the alpha-amylase gene (amya) from streptococcus bovis 148 by using a wide host-range vector, and all the transformants secreted the alpha-amylase successfully. since the promoter and the secretion signal of the amya gene were functional in these strains, we constructed a secretion vector using the expression elements of amya. trials to secrete foreign enzymes in yogurt starter  strains were performed using this novel secretion vector.

TI  == detection and localization of peptidases in lactococcus lactis with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == monoclonal antibodies against peptidases of lactococcus lactis were isolated and  characterized: pepn1-4 against a lysyl aminopeptidase pepn, pept1-5 against a tripeptidase pept and pepd1-3 against a dipeptidase pepd. these monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with their respective antigens in crude cell extracts of lc. lactis subspp. cremoris and lactis. a number of monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with proteins of other (lactic acid) bacteria. pept1, 2, 4 and 5 cross reacted weakly with a 35 kda protein in lactobacillus delbrueckii,  while pept1 and pept2 reacted with proteins in the cell-free extract of streptococcus thermophilus and clostridium fervidus. of the four isolated monoclonal antibodies against pepn, only pepn3 cross reacted weakly with a 90 kda protein in escherichia coli cell-free extract, and the other three antibody species against pepn3 cross reacted with 80 kda proteins of lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii, and str. bovis, but not of esch. coli. of the three monoclonal antibodies against pepd, only pepd1 and pepd2 cross reacted with 40 kda proteins  of lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii and str. bovis. all pepn, pepd and pept antibodies  reacted with components in cell-free extracts of eleven different lc. lactis strains, indicating that the peptidases of these strains were very similar to those of lc. lactis subsp. cremoris wg2. however, lc. lactis subsp. hordniae appeared to differ from the other lc. lactis subspecies since only pept1, 2 and 5 reacted with a protein in the cell-free extract. immunogold labelling of lc. lactis wg2 with the isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that pepn, pepd and pept were located intracellularly. the intracellular location of these peptidases is discussed in relation to the supply of essential amino acids and peptides.
