TI  - Salivary Microbiota Associated with Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy.
AB  - This study aimed at investigating the salivary microbiota of 28 patients affected by immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). Fourteen healthy volunteers (HC) were used as control. Compared to HC, the number of some cultivable bacteria groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in the salivary samples of IgAN patients. Total bacteria from salivary samples of IgAN patients and HC subjects were analyzed by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene. Paired t test showed no significant (P > 0.05) differences of alpha-diversity parameters (OTU, ACE, Chao1, and Shannon index) between the salivary samples of HC and IgAN patients. The difference for the community structure was further analyzed using three phylogeny-based beta-diversity measures. Compared to HC, the ratio between Firmicutes/Proteobacteria markedly decreased in IgAN patients. Gemella haemolysins, Granulicatella adiacens, and Veillonella parvula were positively associated (P < 0.05) with HC. Within the phylum Bacteroidetes, Prevotella species (Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella pallens, and Prevotella salivae) were the highest in HC. The only exception was for Prevotella aurantiaca. Compared to HC, the percentage of abundance of some species, belonging to Pasteurellaceae family (e.g., Haemophylus parainfluenzae), increased in IgAN patients. Fusobacteriaceae (Fusobacterium) and Corynebacterium sp. also differed between the salivary samples of HC and IgAN patients.
TI  - Effect of estradiol on planktonic growth, coaggregation, and biofilm formation of the Prevotella intermedia group bacteria.
AB  - Alterations in the quantity and quality of biofilms at gingival margin are considered to play a role in the initiation and development of pregnancy-related gingivitis. Prevotella intermedia sensu lato is able to consume estradiol, the major sex hormone secreted during pregnancy, in the absence of vitamin K. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of estradiol on the planktonic growth, coaggregation, polysaccharide production, and biofilm formation of the P. intermedia group bacteria, namely P. intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and Prevotella pallens. In all experiments, the type strain (ATCC) and a clinical strain (AHN) of P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and P. pallens were incubated with the concentrations of 0, 30, 90, and 120 nmol/L of estradiol. Planktonic growth was assessed by means of the colony forming unit method, while coaggregation and biofilm formation were assessed by spectrophotometric methods. In the determination of protein and polysaccharide levels, the Bradford and phenol-sulfuric acid methods were used, respectively. P. pallens AHN 9283 and P. nigrescens ATCC 33563 increased their numbers at planktonic stage with increasing estradiol concentrations. In 48-h biofilm tests, elevated protein levels were found for both strains of P. intermedia, and the strains P. nigrescens ATCC 33563 and P. pallens AHN 9283 in the presence of estradiol. The P. intermedia strains also increased the levels of polysaccharide formation in the biofilm. Coaggregation of the P. intermedia group organisms with Fusobacterium nucleatum was enhanced only in P. intermedia AHN 8290. In conclusion, our in vitro experiments indicate that estradiol regulates planktonic growth, coaggregation, polysaccharide production, and biofilm formation characteristics of P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and P. pallens differently. These results may, at least partly, explain the differences seen in their contribution to the pathogenesis of pregnancy-related gingivitis.
TI  - Efficacy of amoxicillin and metronidazole combination for the management of generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of metronidazole-amoxicillin combination on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients were randomly included. The test group (n = 12) received amoxicillin-metronidazole combination and scaling and root planing; the control group (n = 16) received scaling and root planing alone. In addition to the clinical examinations, subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for total cultivable bacteria and the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella pallens, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) using polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: All clinical parameters improved significantly compared to baseline (P <0.05) in both groups. There was a statistically significant reduction of pockets and clinical attachment gain in the combined group compared to the control group (P <0.05). Total counts of bacteria also decreased significantly at 3 and 6 months in both groups (P <0.05). T. denticola and T. forsythia were the most prevalent bacteria throughout the study. T. denticola showed a continuous decrease over 6 months in the test group, whereas no change was seen in the control group beyond 3 months. P. gingivalis decreased significantly at 3 months (P <0.05), whereas T. forsythia was the only pathogen decreased below detection limits by the combination therapy with a significant difference compared to the control group (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study suggest that combined amoxicillin and metronidazole use as an adjunct to scaling and root planing leads to better clinical healing compared to mechanical treatment alone. The polypharmaceutical approach used results in a significant and substantial decrease in T. forsythia and prevents its recolonization for 6 months, suggesting that T. forsythia may determine the long-term stability of periodontal treatment outcomes.
TI  - Prevotella aurantiaca sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  - Two anaerobic, pigmented, non-spore-forming, Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped strains isolated from the human oral cavity, OMA31(T) and OMA130, were characterized by determining their phenotypic and biochemical features, cellular fatty acid profiles and phylogenetic positions based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the new isolates belonged to a single species of the genus Prevotella. The two isolates showed 100 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with each other and were most closely related to Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611(T) with 96.4 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity; the next most closely related strains to the isolates were Prevotella pallens AHN 10371(T) (96.1 %) and Prevotella falsenii JCM 15124(T) (95.3 %). Phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of the isolates were the same as those of P. intermedia JCM 12248(T), P. falsenii JCM 15124(T) and Prevotella nigrescens JCM 12250(T). The isolates could be differentiated from P. pallens JCM 11140( T) by mannose fermentation and alpha-fucosidase activity. Conventional biochemical tests were unable to differentiate the new isolates from P. intermedia, P. falsenii and P. nigrescens. However, hsp60 gene sequence analysis suggested that strain OMA31(T) was not a representative of P. intermedia, P. pallens, P. falsenii or P. nigrescens. Based on these data, a novel species of the genus Prevotella, Prevotella aurantiaca sp. nov., is proposed, with OMA31(T) (=JCM 15754(T)=CCUG 57723(T)) as the type strain.
TI  - Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611 targets host cell lamellipodia in epithelial cell adhesion and invasion.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Prevotella intermedia group bacteria, namely P. intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and Prevotella pallens, are phylogenetically closely related and potentially connected with oral and gastrointestinal tract disease pathogenesis. The aim of the present study was to examine whether these species differ in their capabilities of adhesion to and invasion of epithelial cells. METHODS: Adhesion and invasion were assayed by standard antibiotic/culture assays and fluorescent microscopy techniques. The effect of Prevotella strains on epithelial cell viability was measured using a commercial cell proliferation assay. RESULTS: The strains P. intermedia ATCC 25611 and P. nigrescens ATCC 33263 adhered to epithelial cells, the adhesion numbers of P. intermedia being twice as high as those of P. nigrescens. These strains invaded epithelial cells but invasion was weak. The adhesion of P. intermedia was specifically targeted to epithelial cell lamellipodia. The number of adhered P. intermedia cells increased or decreased when the formation of lamellipodia was stimulated or inhibited, respectively. None of the tested strains showed toxic effects on epithelial cells; a clinical P. intermedia strain even increased the number of viable cells by about 20%. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that among the P. intermedia group bacteria, P. intermedia and P. nigrescens type strains can adhere to and invade epithelial cells, the capability of P. intermedia ATCC 25611(T) being highest in this context. This strain proved to have a special affinity in binding to epithelial cell lamellipodia.
TI  - Prevotella falsenii sp. nov., a Prevotella intermedia-like organism isolated from monkey dental plaque.
AB  - Eight anaerobic, pigmented, non-spore-forming, Gram-negative, rod-shaped strains  isolated from monkey oral cavities were characterized phenotypically and chemotaxonomically and their phylogenetic positions were determined using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that these isolates represent a single species of the genus Prevotella. These strains were most closely related to Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611(T), with 95.0 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. The next most closely related species were Prevotella pallens and Prevotella nigrescens (92.7 and 92.1 % similarity to the respective type strains). The phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of the isolates were the same as those of P. intermedia JCM 12248(T) and P. nigrescens JCM 12250(T). The isolates could be differentiated from P. pallens JCM 11140(T) on the basis of mannose fermentation and alpha-fucosidase activity. The isolates could not be distinguished from P. intermedia or P. nigrescens using conventional biochemical tests. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed the genomic distinctiveness of these eight strains with respect to P. pallens JCM 11140(T), P. intermedia JCM 12248(T) and P. nigrescens JCM 12250(T). On the basis of these data, strains 04013, 04021, 04043, 04052(T), 0406, 04113, 04111 and 04161 represent a novel Prevotella species, for which the name Prevotella falsenii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 04052(T) (=JCM 15124(T) =CCUG 56137(T)).
TI  - An examination of 'unidentified' Prevotella (formerly PINLO) using RAPD-PCR and partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
AB  - Prevotella intermedia- and Prevotella nigrescens-like organisms (PINLO) have been described as organisms which are phenotypically and biochemically similar to P. intermedia and P. nigrescens and the species P. pallens was created to include some of them. Other PINLO groups which do not fit the definition of P. pallens exist, and in this study these 'unidentified' Prevotella sp. were compared with P. corporis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens and P. pallens using commercial identification kits, GLC, RAPD-PCR and partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The Rapid ID 32 A and the RapID ANA II system both identified all 'unidentified' Prevotella as P. intermedia. Similarly they gave this identification to all the species tested (with the exception of P. corporis using the RapID ANA II system) clearly demonstrating biochemical similarities. Gas liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis of the volatile end-products of fermentation could not distinguish between strains. RAPD-PCR using arbitrary primer L10 demonstrated intra-species homogeneity within PINLO strains with amplification profiles which differed from other Prevotella species tested. Cluster analysis of the amplification profiles confirmed species divisions and yielded a distinct 'unidentified' Prevotella cluster. Comparison of partial 16S rDNA sequences displayed 98% sequence similarity between the 'unidentified' Prevotella strains, although 2 strains, HST 1156 and HST 2160 displayed 100% identity. The highest similarity between groups was seen between 'unidentified' Prevotella strains and P. corporis (approximately 94% similarity). The DNA techniques used here confirm that 'unidentified' Prevotella strains are distinct from the other species of Prevotella tested, including P. pallens. Partial 16S rDNA sequence comparisons suggested a close relationship with P. corporis.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of green tea catechins on protein tyrosine phosphatase in Prevotella intermedia.
AB  - Members of the Prevotella intermedia group possess protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of catechin derivatives from Japanese green tea on the activity of PTPase in P. intermedia and related organisms. Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis of alkaline phosphatase derived from P. intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella pallens and Porphyromonas gingivalis revealed a species-specific migration pattern. Among the tea catechin derivatives tested, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), similar to orthovanadate, a specific inhibitor for PTPase, was effective in inhibiting the PTPase activity in P. intermedia at 0.5 microm, and related species at 5 microm. The results suggested that the inhibitory effect observed is due to the presence of galloyl moiety in the structure. In contrast, neither the green tea catechins nor orthovanadate inhibited the phosphatase activity in P. gingivalis, suggesting that this organism possessed a different family of alkaline phosphatase.
TI  - Direct quantitative differentiation between Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella  nigrescens in clinical specimens.
AB  - This paper describes a quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for the differential identification of Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens in clinical samples, and compares its performance with less discriminatory culture and quantitative immunofluorescence (IF) assays. Fluorescence-labelled oligonucleotide probes directed to specific 16S rRNA sequences of P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, Prevotella pallens and Prevotella denticola were hybridized under stringent conditions with cultured reference strains or plaque samples from deep periodontal pockets. Probe specificity was defined with strains from multiple oral Prevotella species. The lower detection level of the assays was approximately 3x10(3) target cells per ml of plaque-sample suspension. P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, P. pallens and P. denticola were detected in plaques with prevalences of 69, 67, 0 and 28%, respectively. On average, 3.9 x 10(6) P. intermedia, 3.1 x 10(6) P. nigrescens and 5.6 x 10(5) P. denticola cells were counted per positive sample. All three species were found almost exclusively in dense mixed aggregates. Quantitative FISH data agreed satisfactorily with corresponding IF data (r=0.711). Both FISH and IF enumerations of the sum of P. intermedia and P. nigrescens markedly exceeded the c.f.u. counts of black-pigmented colonies in Porphyromonas gingivalis-free cultured subgingival plaques. The results demonstrate the validity of this new assay. Unlike established IF, culture, PCR or checkerboard DNA hybridization assays, this FISH assay differentiates quantitatively between P. intermedia and P. nigrescens, provides visual accuracy control, and offers insights into the spatial distribution of the target cells within a clinical sample.
TI  - The Prevotella intermedia group organisms in young children and their mothers as  related to maternal periodontal status.
AB  - Currently, the Prevotella intermedia group includes three biochemically and phylogenetically related species: Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and the newly described Prevotella pallens. The two first-named species are mentioned with varying emphasis in connection with periodontal diseases, while such a connection of P. pallens is not known. Mothers serve as a plausible source of bacteria to their children, and conceivably, a mother with periodontitis as a recurrent reservoir of periodontally infecting organisms. In the present study, 23 mothers and their young children were examined for the presence of the P. intermedia group organisms in relation to maternal periodontal status (I: periodontal health, II: initial periodontitis, and III: advanced periodontitis). Species differentiation was based on established biochemical methods, electrophoretic mobility patterns, SDS-PAGE, and DNA hybridization. P. intermedia was not recovered from children but nearly exclusively from mothers in group III, thus confirming its association with periodontitis. P. nigrescens and P. pallens were frequently found in mothers and children. To determine bacterial transmission between a mother and her child, 72 isolates from 13 mother-child pairs were analyzed by arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR). Similar AP-PCR types of P. nigrescens and/or P. pallens were recovered from 3/4 pairs in group I, 2/5 pairs in group II, and none in group III. Our results indicate that different species within the P. intermedia group have a different colonization pattern in childhood and that the periodontal status reflects qualitatively their presence in maternal saliva. Intra-familial transmission of P. nigrescens and P. pallens can occur in early childhood, however similar AP-PCR types were most obvious within periodontally healthy mother-child pairs.
TI  - Beta-lactamase production in Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and Prevotella pallens genotypes and in vitro susceptibilities to selected antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The present study investigated the beta-lactamase production of 73 Prevotella intermedia, 84 Prevotella nigrescens, and 14 Prevotella pallens isolates and their in vitro susceptibilities to six antimicrobial agents. The P. intermedia and P. nigrescens isolates were recovered from oral and extraoral samples obtained from subjects in two geographic locations from 1985 to 1995. The clonality of the beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative isolates and the clustering of the genotypes were studied by arbitrarily primed-PCR fingerprinting. beta-Lactamase production was detected in 29% of P. intermedia isolates, 29% of P. nigrescens isolates, and 57% of P. pallens isolates. No difference in the frequencies of beta-lactamase production by P. intermedia and P. nigrescens between isolates from oral and extraoral sites, between isolates obtained at different time periods, or between P. intermedia isolates from different geographic locations was observed. However, the P. nigrescens isolates from the United States were significantly more frequently (P = 0.015) beta-lactamase positive than those from Finland. No association between the genotypes and beta-lactamase production or between the genotypes and the sources of the isolates was found. The penicillin G MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were 8 microg/ml for P. intermedia, 8 microg/ml for P. nigrescens, and 16 microg/ml for P. pallens. For the beta-lactamase-negative isolates, the corresponding values were 0.031, 0.031, and 0.125 microg/ml, and for the beta-lactamase-positive isolates, the corresponding values were 16, 8, and 32 microg/ml. All isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, metronidazole, azithromycin, and trovafloxacin. The MICs of amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefoxitin were relatively higher for the beta-lactamase-positive population than for the beta-lactamase-negative population.
TI  - Phylogenetic characterization and proposal of a new pigmented species to the genus Prevotella: Prevotella pallens sp. nov.
AB  - Complete 16S rRNA gene sequences of three representative strains of anaerobic, Gram-negative, pigmented, moderately saccharolytic, indole-positive bacteria isolated from the oral cavity of humans were determined. According to comparative analyses of the rRNA sequence data, this organism represents a previously unknown species within the genus Prevotella. In addition, 22 representative strains and 21 reference strains (including 11 Prevotella intermedia and 10 Prevotella nigrescens strains) were subjected to multilocus enzyme electrophoretic analysis. The strains were consistently separated into three clearly distinct groups, corresponding to their previous entities. On the basis of the present phylogenetic results that confirmed our biochemical and genetic data, we propose a new species, Prevotella pallens. The type strain is NCTC 13042 (= AHN 10371).
