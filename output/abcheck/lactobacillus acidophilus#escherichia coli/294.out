adhering heat-killed human lactobacillus acidophilus, strain lb, inhibits the process of pathogenicity of diarrhoeagenic bacteria in cultured human intestinal cells.
heat-killed l. acidophilus, strain lb, was tested for its ability to adhere in vitro onto human enterocyte-like caco-2 and muco-secreting ht29-mtx cells in culture.
the heat-killed lb bacteria exhibited a high adhesive property.
a diffuse pattern of adhesion was observed to the undifferentiated cells, the apical brush border of the enterocytic cells, and to the mucus layer that covered the surface of the mucus-secreting cells.
the inhibitory effect of heat-killed lb organisms against the human intestinal caco-2 cell-adhesion and cell-invasion by a large variety of diarrhoeagenic bacteria was investigated.
the following dose-dependent inhibitions were obtained: (i) against the cell-association of enterotoxigenic, diffusely-adhering and enteropathogenic escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and salmonella typhimurium; (ii) against the cell-invasion by enteropathogenic escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium.
