TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [clinical experience of chemotherapy with cefmetazole for severe infections accompanying malignant hematological disorders].
AB  == we made an attempt to treat with cefmetazole (cmz) 25 patients who developed severe infectious diseases while suffering with granulocytopenia associated with  the treatment of malignant hematological disorders. 1. determination of bacteriological efficacy while 20 strains were isolated and identified from 15 patients, no significant bacteria were detected in 9 patients. isolates obtained  were: 5 strains of enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 2  strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 strains of klebsiella oxytoca, 2 strains of staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of neisseria sp., pseudomonas maltophilia, enterobacter sp., alpha-streptococcus, beta-streptococcus and gram-positive cocci. causative organisms were eradicated or markedly in 7 of the  15 patients from whom bacteria were isolated. clinical findings, including fever, revealed that none of the patients, in whom bacteriological efficacy was determined to be poor, exhibited sufficient clinical response. e. faecalis was isolated from 4 of 6 patients bacteriologically determined to have no response. 2. as for 23 patients, who were found to be evaluable among the 25 patients, 8 (34.8%), 4 (17.4%), 4 (17.4%), and 7 (30.4%) demonstrated excellent, good, fair and poor responses, respectively, showing a 69.6% efficacy rate which indicates a sum of percentages of patients with excellent, good and fair responses. 3. while  an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained for 3 patients with number of peripheral neutrophils less than 500/mm3 before the beginning of cmz administration, only an efficacy rate of 66.7% was obtained for 15 patients with neutrophils more than 500/mm3.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [multicenter study of the antibacterial activity of a new cephalosporin: cm 40874].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of cm were evaluated on 2 548 bacterial strains isolated in 8 hospitals. cm demonstrated high activity on enterobacteriaceae, the mic being less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for 71% of the 1 362 strains tested, less than or equal to 1 for 99.6%, and less than or equal to 4 for 99.9%. mode mic varies little among the different groups of enterobacteriaceae (from 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms/ml), with the exception of serratia sp. (mode mic : 0.25) and klebsiella oxytoca (mode mic : 0.03). most of  enterobacter, serratia, and citrobacter sp. strains not inhibited by cefotaxime are readily inhibited by cm at the same concentrations than susceptible strains.  cm has less activity on p. aeruginosa (mic 2-32 micrograms/ml) and acinetobacter  sp. (mic 8-128). staphylococci (mic 32) and enterococci are not susceptible. variable activity is found against other streptococci. cm inhibits haemophilus sp. at mics of 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml and gonococci at mics of 0.03 to 0.5 (whether the strains produce beta-lactamase or not). meningococci have a mode mic of 0.03 micrograms/ml (range 0.008 to 0.25). thus, cm 40874 is a new third generation cephalosporin with high activity on enterobacteriaceae, including those strains not susceptible to cefotaxime and good activity on haemophilus sp.  and neisseria sp. this additional activity is probably supported by enhanced resistance to enzymatic inactivation by beta-lactamases.
