TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of SMT19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against Clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of SMT19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined Clostridium difficile strains, 174 Gram-positive and 136 Gram-negative intestinal anaerobes, and 40 Gram-positive aerobes. SMT19969 was one dilution more active against C. difficile isolates (MIC range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. SMT19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes, especially the Bacteroides fragilis group species, than vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that SMT19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. SMT19969 showed limited activity against other Gram-positive anaerobes, including Bifidobacteria species, Eggerthella lenta, Finegoldia magna, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with MIC90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. Clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with C. innocuum being susceptible (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) and C. ramosum and C. perfringens being nonsusceptible (MIC90, >512 mug/ml). Activity against Lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; MIC90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and streptococci) showed high SMT19969 MIC90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).
TI  - Isolation and characterisation of an equol-producing mixed microbial culture from a human faecal sample and its activity under gastrointestinal conditions.
AB  - Only about one third of humans possess a microbiota capable of transforming the dietary isoflavone daidzein into equol. Little is known about the dietary and physiological factors determining this ecological feature. In this study, the in vitro metabolism of daidzein by faecal samples from four human individuals was investigated. One culture produced the metabolites dihydrodaidzein and O-desmethylangolensin, another produced dihydrodaidzein and equol. From the latter, a stable and transferable mixed culture transforming daidzein into equol was obtained. Molecular fingerprinting analysis (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) showed the presence of four bacterial species of which only the first three strains could be brought into pure culture. These strains were identified as Lactobacillus mucosae EPI2, Enterococcus faecium EPI1 and Finegoldia magna EPI3, and did not produce equol in pure culture. The fourth species was tentatively identified as Veillonella sp strain EP. It was found that hydrogen gas in particular, but also butyrate and propionate, which are all colonic fermentation products from poorly digestible carbohydrates, stimulated equol production by the mixed culture. However, when fructo-oligosaccharides were added, equol production was inhibited. Furthermore, the equol-producing capacity of the isolated culture was maintained upon its addition to a faecal culture originating from a non-equol-producing individual.
