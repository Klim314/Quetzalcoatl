TI  == establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB  == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI  == [anaerobic bacteria isolated from patients with suspected anaerobic infections].
AB  == the study involved 394 clinical samples sent to the clinical microbiology laboratory of hacettepe university adult hospital between january 1997 and may 2004 for anaerobic cultivation. since multiple cultures from the same clinical samples of the same patient were excluded, the study was carried on 367 samples.  the anaerobic cultures were performed in anaerobic jar using anaerogen kits (oxoid, basingstoke, u.k.) or genbox (biomerieux, lyon, france). the isolates were identified by both classical methods and "bbl crystal system" (becton dickinson, u.s.a.). while no growth was detected in 120 (32.7%) of the clinical samples studied, in 144 samples (39.2%) only aerobes, in 28 (7.6%) only anaerobes and in 75 (20.5%) of the samples both aerobes and anaerobes were isolated. the number of the anaerobic isolates was 217 from 103 samples with anaerobic growth.  of these 103 samples 15 showed single bacterial growth whereas in 88 samples multiple bacterial isolates were detected. anaerobic isolates consisted of 92 gram negative bacilli (bacteroides spp. 50, prevotella spp. 14, porphyromonas spp. 10, fusobacterium spp. 7, tisierella spp. 2, unidentified 9), 57 gram positive bacilli (clostridium spp.17, propionibacterium spp. 16, lactobacillus spp. 8, actinomyces spp. 5, eubacterium spp. 2, bifidobacterium adolescentis 1, mobiluncus mulieris 1, unidentified nonspore forming rods 7), 61 gram positive cocci (anaerobic cocci 44, microaerophilic cocci 17), and 7 gram negative cocci (veillonella spp.). in conclusion, in the samples studied with prediagnosis of anaerobic infection, bacteroides spp. (23%) were the most common bacteria followed by anaerobic gram positive cocci (20.3%) and clostridium spp (7.8%).
