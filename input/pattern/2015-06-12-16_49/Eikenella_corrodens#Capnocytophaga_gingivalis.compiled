TI  - Efficacy of a new mouth rinse formulation based on 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride in the control of plaque and gingivitis: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  - AIM: To assess the efficacy of a 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) mouth rinse in the control of plaque and gingival inflammation during a 6-month period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Adult subjects with moderate gingivitis were selected [>/=40% bleeding on marginal probing (BOMP)]. After retrieving microbiological samples and evaluating the clinical parameters (plaque, BOMP and stain indexes), a professional prophylaxis was performed and subjects were randomly assigned to the test (CPC mouth rinse) or to the placebo group. Subjects were re-assessed after 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients (35 test, 32 placebo) were included in the analysis. At 6 months, intra-group significant plaque reductions were observed in the test group (0.691, p < 0.001), but not in the placebo (0.181, p = 0.653). At 6 months, the mean BOMP values were lower in the test group (p = 0.052). Changes between baseline and 6 months were significantly higher in the test group both for plaque (p = 0.002) and BOMP (p = 0.037) when compared with the placebo. A microbiological impact was observed in the test group, especially for Prevotella intermedia. CONCLUSION: The evaluated 0.07% CPC-based mouth rinse, used three times per day adjunctively to mechanical tooth cleaning, prevents plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation, as compared to the placebo, for at least 6 months.
TI  - The association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in Brazilian adults with HIV: a multilevel analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load (HVL) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with HIV. METHODS: Thirty-seven individuals with HIV were divided into two groups: 1) detectable HVL (n = 15); and 2) undetectable HVL (n = 22). Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, Fisher exact test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare groups. Multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between HVL and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: Of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable HVL group than undetectable HVL group (P <0.001). These species included Actinomyces naeslundii II, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Veillonella parvula, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter concisus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Candida albicans. Significant associations between detectable HVL and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for A. naeslundii I, Actinomyces gerencseriae, C. gingivalis, E. corrodens, C. concisus, Prevotella nigrescens, T. forsythia, and Dialister pneumosintes. CONCLUSION: Detectable plasmatic HVL in individuals with HIV was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as P. nigrescens, T. forsythia, and E. corrodens, as well as C. concisus, C. gingivalis, and D. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.
TI  - Association between periodontal status and pre-term and/or low-birth weight in Spain: clinical and microbiological parameters.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Studies performed over the last 15 years have suggested that periodontal diseases may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, this association has not been found in all populations. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether periodontal status and the presence of specific periodontal pathogens may influence the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pregnant women were clinically examined before 26th week of gestation, and divided in two groups: non-periodontitis and periodontitis. Microbial samples were obtained in the periodontitis group and processed by anaerobic culturing. After delivery, data on the pregnancy outcome were taken; mother's socio-demographic and risk factors were obtained at inclusion. Simple and multiple regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy women were included in the study (116 non-periodontitis and 54 with periodontitis). The incidence of preterm (PTB) and low-birth weight (LBW) was 2.94% and 3.53%, respectively. Periodontal status did not show any association with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The presence of Eikenella corrodens was significantly related to PTB (p = 0.022) and the presence Capnocytophaga spp. was related to LBW (p = 0.008). The multivariate analyses showed a significant association between PTB and newborn weight and counts of E. corrodens. Maternal health and counts of E. corrodens were significantly associated with PTB or LBW. CONCLUSION: The clinical periodontal condition was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in a Spanish Caucasian population with medium-high educational level. The presence and counts of E. corrodens and the presence of Capnocytophaga spp. showed a significant association with PTB and LBW, respectively, in the bivariate and/or multivariate model.
TI  - A microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. METHODS: Samples were collected by means of a #15 H-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: The species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Tannerella forsythia, Enterococcus faecalis, Neisseria mucosa, Campylobacter gracilis, and Prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp space cases they were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, N. mucosa, E. faecalis, E. saburreum, C. gracilis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Counts of F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Campylobacter sputigena, Capnocytophaga showae, Treponema socrenskii, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp space cases.
TI  - Distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. DESIGN: Dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in Okayama, Japan, in 2011. Bacterial DNA was extracted from each specimen and PCR analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas gulae, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens were performed. RESULTS: P. gulae (71.2%), T. forsythia (77.3%), and C. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. P. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. Furthermore, E. corrodens and T. denticola in specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.
TI  - Molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in Japan.
AB  - Periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. The distribution of an animal gingival organism Porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. Porphyromonas gulae, Tannerella forsythia and Campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. Then, isolation and identification of the Porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. There were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were Porphyromonas gulae. In contrast, the frequency of Porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. These findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially Porphyromonas gulae.
TI  - Early microbial succession in redeveloping dental biofilms in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The development of dental biofilms after professional plaque removal is very rapid. However, it is not clear whether most bacterial species return at similar rates in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects or if there are differences in bacterial recolonization between supragingival and subgingival biofilms in periodontal health and disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects immediately after professional cleaning. Samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d of no oral hygiene and analyzed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The percentage of DNA probe counts were averaged within subjects at each time-point. Ecological succession was determined using a modified moving-window analysis. RESULTS: Succession in supragingival biofilms from subjects with periodontitis and from healthy individuals was similar. At 1 d, Streptococcus mitis and Neisseria mucosa showed increased proportions, followed by Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella parvula and Streptococcus oralis at 1-4 d. At 4-7 d, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella nigrescens became elevated. Subgingival plaque redevelopment was slower and very different from supragingival plaque redevelopment. Increased proportions were first observed for S. mitis, followed by V. parvula and C. gingivalis and, at 7 d, by Capnocytophaga sputigena and P. nigrescens. No significant increase in the proportions of periodontal pathogens was observed in any of the clinical groups or locations. CONCLUSION: There is a defined order in bacterial species succession in early supragingival and subgingival biofilm redevelopment after professional cleaning.
TI  - Short-term periodontal and microbiological changes following orthognathic surgery.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of orthognathic surgery on the development of periodontal and microbiological changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen consecutively treated patients with a mean age of 24.9+/-7.7 years receiving orthognathic surgery were included in the present study. Plaque index (PI) and concentrations of 11 periodonto-pathogenic bacteria were recorded one day prior to surgery (t(0)) and one week (t(1)) and six weeks (t(2)) post-surgery. In addition, a complete periodontal examination including pocket probing depth (PPD), gingival recession (GR), clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP) and width of keratinized gingiva (WKG) was conducted at t(0) and t(2). For statistical analysis, general linear model and paired t-test were applied. RESULTS: A significant increase of PI (t(0)-t(1), p=0.037) was followed by a significant decrease (t(1)-t(2), p=0.017). Apart from Eikenella corrodens (p=0.036), no significant microbiological changes were recorded. PPD significantly increased on oral sites (p=0.045) and GR especially on buccal sites (p=0.001). In the incision area the development of GR was significantly higher on the test (buccal) than on the control sites (oral). Both gingival biotypes were affected by GR. CONCLUSIONS: Orthognathic surgery causes statistically significant changes of periodontal parameters, but these changes do not necessarily impair the aesthetic appearance of the gingival margin.
TI  - Clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  - It has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. It is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. To investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. Factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for T. forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, Parvimonas micra, and Treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of A. oris, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus intermedius, Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Veillonella parvula. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while Fusobacterium nucleatum loaded on both. These findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.
TI  - Killing of anaerobic pathogens by predatory bacteria.
AB  - Recently, the predation of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on a periodontal pathogen has been described. The current study explores the potential antimicrobial activity of a range of predatory bacteria against key periodontal pathogens. A number of representatives from the Bdellovibrio, Bacteriovorax and Peredibacter lineages (called 'BALOs') were tested for their activity towards a group of key periodontal pathogens and an optimal multiplicity of infection was established. As the oral cavity contains a wide variety of bacteria that are not preyed upon, it was investigated if they can have an effect on the predation efficiency of BALOs. It was concluded that a number of important variables involved in bacterial predation are found to be compatible with the composition of the oral microbiota. This finding makes the case for continued study of the potential for BALOs to combat periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  - To culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. Micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus (HAIN Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) tests are two commercially available rapid PCR-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. In this study, we compared these commercial PCR-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. A total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. Aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. The overall agreement between both methods was excellent for Eubacterium nodatum, Tannerella forsythia and Porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for Capnocytophaga sp, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra (Micromonas micros), and Campylobacter rectus (86-78%). Discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i P. intermedia/Prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. Nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.
TI  - Distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in Japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. Accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. We investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. METHODS: A total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. Subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. Bacterial DNA was extracted from the specimens and PCR analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. In addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. RESULTS: The most frequently detected species was Capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and Campylobacter rectus (18.2%). Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and Porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. The total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. There were 10 subjects with positive reactions for T. denticola and/or T. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. Furthermore, subjects possessing C. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of species. CONCLUSION: We found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of T. denticola, T. forsythia, and C. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. Follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Comparison between polymerase chain reaction-based and checkerboard DNA hybridization techniques for microbial assessment of subgingival plaque samples.
AB  - AIM: To compare polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with subsequent reverse hybridization (micro-IDent test) and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization for the identification of 13 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were taken using paper points and curettes from two sites each with pocket depth <4, 4-6 and >6 mm at baseline and 3 months in 25 periodontitis subjects and two sites in 25 periodontally healthy subjects. Samples were analysed for their content of 13 bacterial species using both assays. Similarities for each species between techniques were determined using regression analysis. Differences between health and periodontitis were determined using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty samples were evaluated using both techniques. Regression analysis indicated that 10/13 test species showed significant positive correlations between the counts determined by checkerboard analysis and levels determined by the PCR-based test after adjusting for 13 comparisons. The highest rank correlations of 0.58, 0.49 and 0.46 were seen for Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Eubacterium nodatum, respectively (p<0.0001). Both tests could distinguish samples from healthy and periodontitis subjects. CONCLUSION: Detection patterns of 10/13 test species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis and healthy subjects were similar using the two molecular techniques.
TI  - Photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of periodontitis. However, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of PDT in the treatment of periodontitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of PDT to non-surgical periodontal treatment. METHODS: Twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of PDT (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). Full-mouth plaque score (FMPS), full-mouth bleeding score (FMBS), probing depth (PD), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (CAL) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. Primary outcome variables were changes in PD and CAL. Microbiologic evaluation of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Eubacterium nodatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. RESULTS: At 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to CAL, PD, FMPS, or microbiologic changes. At 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly greater improvement in FMBS was found in the test group. CONCLUSION: The additional application of a single episode of PDT to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of PD reduction and CAL gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.
TI  - Photodynamic therapy as adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients on periodontal maintenance: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  - Recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested the potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of periodontitis. However, currently, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of PDT in the treatment of periodontitis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of the adjunctive use of PDT in non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients receiving supportive periodontal therapy. Twenty-four patients receiving regularly supportive periodontal therapy were randomly treated with either subgingival scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of PDT (test) or subgingival scaling and root planing alone (control). The following parameters were evaluated at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy: full mouth plaque score (FMPS), full mouth bleeding score (FMBS), bleeding on probing (BOP) at experimental sites, probing pocket depth (PPD), gingival recession (REC), and clinical attachment level (CAL). Primary outcome variables were changes in PPD and CAL. Microbiological evaluation of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g.), Prevotella intermedia (P.i.), Tannerella forsythensis (T.f.), Treponema denticola (T.d.), Peptostreptococcus micros (P.m.), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.n.), Campylobacter rectus (C.r.), Eubacterium nodatum (E.n.), Eikenella corrodens (E.c.), and Capnocytophaga species (C.s.) was also performed at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy, using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. No differences in any of the investigated parameters were observed at baseline between the two groups. At 3 months and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of PPD, CAL and FMPS. At 3 months and 6 months, a statistically significantly higher improvement of BOP was found in the test group. At 3 months after therapy, the microbiological analysis showed a statistically significant reduction of F.n. and E.n. in the test group. At 6 months, statistically significantly higher numbers of E.c. and C.s. were detected in the test group. The additional application of a single episode of PDT to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of PPD reduction and CAL gain, but it resulted in significantly higher reduction of bleeding scores than following scaling and root planing alone.
TI  - Infection at titanium implants with or without a clinical diagnosis of inflammation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the microbiota at implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis, implant mucositis, or being clinically healthy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical and microbiological data were collected from 213 subjects (mean age: 65.7+/-14) with 976 implants in function (mean: 10.8 years, SD+/-1.5). Forty species were identified by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: Implant mean % plaque score was 41.8+/-32.4%. Periodontitis defined by bone loss was found in 44.9% of subjects. Implant mucositis was diagnosed in 59% and peri-implantitis in 14.9% of all cases. Neisseria mucosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, F. nucleatum sp. polymorphum, and Capnocytophaga sputigena dominated the implant sub-mucosal microbiota and the sub-gingival microbiota at tooth sites. Implant probing pocket depth at the implant site with the deepest probing depth was correlated with levels of Eikenella corrodens (r=0.16, P<0.05), the levels of F. nucleatum sp. vincentii (r=0.15, P<0.05), Porphyromonas gingivalis (r=0.14, P<0.05), and Micromonas micros (r=0.17, P=0.01). E. corrodens was found in higher levels at implants with mucositis compared with implant health (P<0.05). Subjects who lost teeth due to periodontitis had higher yields of F. nucleatum sp. vincentii (P<0.02) and N. mucosa (P<0.05). Independent of implant status subjects with teeth had higher levels of P. gingivalis (P<0.05), and Leptotrichia buccalis (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: At implant sites studied, few bacteria differed by whether subjects were dentate or not or by implant status.
TI  - Caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  - In vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. The aim of this investigation was to establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. Microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on Thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. Microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization analysis. pH was measured as an indicator of cariogenic potential. The composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. Artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and pH conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. Complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. Sucrose supplementation limited the decline of Streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance of mutans Streptococci. Sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to Actinomyces israelii, Rothia dentocariosa and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. The microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and pH.
TI  - Microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. METHODS: Ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. Subsequently, a period of 21 days of washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. Microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: The species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were Prevotella melaninogenica and Veillonella parvula. The mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). Proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus constellatus, Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and P. melaninogenica. CONCLUSION: The tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.
TI  - Association of Eubacterium nodatum and Treponema denticola with human periodontitis lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia. METHOD: Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. The samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (total samples = 21,832). Mean counts, % DNA probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. Significance of difference between groups was determined using the Mann-Whitney test. Association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. Analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of P. gingivalis plus T. forsythia less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. All analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: For the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens P. gingivalis and T. forsythia as well as Eubacterium nodatum and Treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. There were significantly more Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Streptococcus gordonii and Veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. E. nodatum, T. denticola, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation confirmed the strong association of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of E. nodatum and T. denticola with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. Other species, including S. oralis, Eikenella corrodens, S. intermedius and F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when P. gingivalis and T. forsythia were present in low proportions.
TI  - Distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria in saliva samples from Japanese children  and their mothers.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Treponema denticola) in children, and then compared their distribution in those children and their mothers, with special attention given to three of the species known as the red complex (P. gingivalis, T. forsythensis, and T. denticola) whose presence has been shown to be associated with conditions related to periodontal diseases. METHODS: One hundred thirteen pairs of children and their mothers were randomly selected from patients treated at the Pedodontic Clinic of Osaka University Dental Hospital. Saliva samples were taken at the second visit prior to receiving professional tooth brushing instruction. Genomic DNA was extracted from each saliva sample, followed by a polymerase chain reaction assay with species-specific sets of primers. RESULTS: A. actinomycetemcomitans was the most frequently detected species in the mothers, followed by C. sputigena, P. gingivalis, and T. forsythensis, while C. sputigena had the highest detection rate, followed by A. actinomycetemcomitans and T. denticola in the children. The detection rate of the red complex species in children whose mothers possessed the same species was significantly higher than in those whose mothers did not possess them. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a correlation between the presence of periodontal bacteria in children and their mothers, while the presence of red complex bacteria in children was highly associated with that in their mothers.
TI  - Prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a Chilean population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (AgP). Other periodontopathic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in Chilean patients with AgP. METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. Samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (CP) patients were taken as controls. Samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (RTF) and cultured. Periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. The identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: AgP showed a significatively higher prevalence of C. rectus than CP (P = 0.036). The only statistical difference found was for C. rectus. Patients with AgP showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, P. micros, and Capnocytophaga sp. A similar prevalence in both groups of patients was observed for F. nucleatum and P. intermedia/nigrescens, and A. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in AgP than CP patients. In localized AgP, P. intermedia/nigrescens, E. corrodens, F. nucleatum, and P. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized AgP patients who harbored A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and Capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: C. rectus, P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, P. micros, and Capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of AgP in this Chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between AgP and CP was for C. rectus, suggesting that the differences in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. In this study, the prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Effect of khat chewing on 14 selected periodontal bacteria in sub- and supragingival plaque of a young male population.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The habit of chewing khat (Catha edulis) for its amphetamine-like effects is highly prevalent in Yemen and east Africa, and has expanded to Western countries. The purpose of this study was to estimate and compare the prevalence and levels of 14 periodontal bacteria in gingival plaque of khat chewers and khat nonchewers, as well as of khat chewing sides and khat nonchewing sides. METHODS: A total of 408 sub- and supragingival plaque samples were collected from 51 young males (29 khat chewers and 22 khat nonchewers; age range 19-28 years) and analyzed using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical parameters were recorded for all teeth at six sites per tooth. RESULTS: Streptococcus intermedius and Veillonella parvula were significantly more prevalent in the subgingival plaque of chewers, which also showed significantly higher levels of V. parvula and Eikenella corrodens. Similar results were found for the subgingival plaque of the chewing sides compared to the nonchewing sides. However, there was a significantly higher prevalence and higher levels of Tannerella forsythia in the subgingival plaque of the nonchewing sides. No significant differences were observed for the supragingival plaque between the two study groups. There was a significantly lower prevalence of Capnocytophaga gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum in the khat chewing sides, and higher levels of V. parvula and Actinomyces israelii. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that khat chewing induces a microbial profile that is not incompatible with gingival health.
TI  - Differences in the subgingival microbiota of Swedish and USA subjects who were periodontally healthy or exhibited minimal periodontal disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown differences in the mean proportions of subgingival species in samples from periodontitis subjects in different countries, which may relate to differences in diet, genetics, disease susceptibility and manifestation. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether there were differences in the subgingival microbiotas of Swedish and American subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal periodontal disease. METHOD: One hundred and fifty eight periodontally healthy or minimally diseased subjects (N Sweden=79; USA=79) were recruited. Subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, BOP, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth. Subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed, in one laboratory, for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (total samples=4345). % DNA probe counts comprised by each species was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. Significance of differences in proportions of each species between countries was determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Cluster analysis was performed to group subjects based on their subgingival microbial profiles using a chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. RESULTS: On average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in both countries. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, 5 species were in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in Swedish than American subjects: Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 (9.7, 3.3); Streptococcus sanguis (2.5, 1.2); Eikenella corrodens (1.7, 1.0); Tannerella forsythensis (3.5, 2.3) and Prevotella melaninogenica (6.3, 1.8). Leptotrichia buccalis was in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in American (5.5) than Swedish subjects (3.0). Cluster analysis grouped 121 subjects into 8 microbial profiles. Twenty four of the 40 test species examined differed significantly among cluster groups. Five clusters were dominated by American subjects and 2 clusters by Swedish subjects. Fifty eight of 79 (73%) of the Swedish subjects fell into 1 cluster group dominated by high proportions of A. naeslundii genospecies 1, Prevotella nigrescens, T. forsythensis and P. melaninogenica. Other clusters were characterized by high proportions of Actinomyces gerencseriae, Veillonella parvula, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Eubacterium saburreum, L. buccalis and Neisseria mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: The microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from Swedish and American subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal disease differed. The heterogeneity in subgingival microbial profiles was more pronounced in the American subjects, possibly because of greater genetic and microbiologic diversity in the American subjects sampled.
TI  - Killing of periodontopathogenic bacteria by photodynamic therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate a new approach for killing periodontopathogenic bacteria using photodynamic therapy (PDT). METHODS: In this study, we investigated the photosensitizers chlorin e6, BLC 1010, and BLC 1014 by three different methods for their effect in PDT on the viability of periodontopathogenic bacterial species. The methods included examination of inhibition zones on agar plates, determination of colony-forming units (CFU), and the use of a bacterial viability kit. RESULTS: Using the CFU method, we were able to demonstrate that the anaerobic bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis can be photoinactivated completely by illumination with an intensity of 5.3 J/cm2 in the presence of 10 microM chlorin e6 and 10 microM BLC 1010. With the photosensitizers chlorin e6 and BLC 1010, we were able to induce zones of inhibition on agar plates. BLC 1014 failed to produce a zone of inhibition. The results of the bacterial viability test also showed that the photosensitizer BLC 1014 provides the lowest photodynamic effect in comparison to the others. CONCLUSION: The data collected to date suggest that photodynamic therapy with chlorin e6 and BLC 1010 is advantageous for suppressing periodontopathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Rate of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Although microbiological studies have identified more than 400 bacterial species  in periodontal pockets, only a limited number have been implicated as periodontal pathogens. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis. Bacterial samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets ((5 mm) of 203 patients: 92 males and 111 females, aged 35-55 years. The samples were cultured under anaerobic and capnophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and a commercial rapid test system. The isolates were Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (26.8%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (21.9%), Capnocytophaga sputigena (16.7%), Eikenella corrodens (13.2%), Prevotella intermedia (10.5 %), Prevotella disiens (3.1%), Peptostreptococcus micros (2.9%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (2.2%), Prevotella corporis (1.8%), Peptostreptococcus magnus (1.3%) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (0.4%). No periodontopathogenic bacterial growth was observed in 14 of the samples (6.2%). The number of samples associated with monobacterial growth and polybacterial growth were 74.9% and 18.2% respectively. It is concluded that the bacterial composition associated with a number of patients' samples is quite complex, and that some of cultivable anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria act as periodontal pathogens in chronic periodontitis.
TI  - Occurrence of periodontal bacteria in healthy children: a 2-year longitudinal study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the occurrence of specific periodontal bacteria in children and adolescents. METHODS: Ten putative periodontal bacteria were longitudinally examined in plaque and saliva samples from 119 periodontally healthy children (2-15 years old) using a polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: Capnocytophaga ochracea, C. sputigena, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently found in saliva, and tended to persist in saliva for the remainder of the study, whereas Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Prevotella intermedia were rarely detected. P. nigrescens was more frequently detected in plaque and its prevalence increased with age. Eikenella corrodens and Campylobacter rectus were sometimes detected in both plaque and saliva, while Tannerella forsythensis was occasionally detected in saliva. CONCLUSION: A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, P. nigrescens, C. rectus, and E. corrodens are common members of the oral microbial flora of healthy children, whereas P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and T. denticola appear to be transient organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of medicinal plant extracts against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - This study was performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of Althaea officinalis L. roots, Arnica montana L. flowers, Calendula officinalis L. flowers, Hamamelis virginiana L. leaves, Illicium verum Hook. fruits and Melissa officinalis L. leaves, against anaerobic and facultative aerobic periodontal bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Veilonella parvula, Eikenella corrodens, Peptostreptococcus micros and Actinomyces odontolyticus. The methanol extracts of H. virginiana and A. montana and, to a lesser extent, A. officinalis were shown to possess an inhibiting activity (MIC < or = 2048 mg/L) against many of the species tested. In comparison, M. officinalis and C. officinalis extracts had a lower inhibiting activity (MIC > or = 2048 mg/L) against all the tested species with the exception of Prevotella sp. Illicium verum methanol extract was not very active though it had a particular good activity against E. corrodens. The results suggest the use of the alcohol extracts of H. virginiana, A. montana and A. officinalis for topical medications in periodontal prophylactics.
TI  - Serum phenytoin concentration and IgG antibody titre to periodontal bacteria in patients with phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  - Epileptic patients taking phenytoin with gingival-overgrowth and those without gingival-overgrowth were compared for daily drug dose, plasma total phenytoin concentration, plasma free-phenytoin concentration and serum IgG antibody titre against 13 periodontal bacteria. Significantly higher daily drug dose was noted in patients with gingival overgrowth (P < 0.05) when compared with those without overgrowth. In addition, both total and free forms of plasma phenytoin concentration were significantly higher in sera of patients with gingival growth than of those without overgrowth (P < 0.01). Strong positive correlation was found between daily drug dose and serum phenytoin concentration in patients with gingival overgrowth, while weak correlation was found in patients without gingival overgrowth, suggesting a difference in drug metabolism in these two groups. However, no differences were found in serum IgG antibody titres to 13 periodontal bacteria examined between two groups. These results suggest that metabolic ability of phenytoin is one of the factors for developing gingival overgrowth, and that periodontal infection may not be a primary causative factor for gingival overgrowth but act as an additive factor which increase tissue mass for this unwanted side effect.
TI  - Proteolytic and hydrolytic enzymes from putative periodontal pathogens: characterization, molecular genetics, effects on host defenses and tissues and detection in gingival crevice fluid.
AB  
TI  - Stress and the periodontal diseases: effects of catecholamines on the growth of periodontal bacteria in vitro.
AB  - Microorganisms possess the ability to recognize hormones within the host and utilize them to adapt to their surroundings. Noradrenaline and adrenaline, which are released during human stress responses, may act as environmental cues to alter the growth of individual organisms within subgingival biofilms. The aims of this study were to modify, for anaerobic culture, existing methodology used in determining microorganism catecholamine responses and to investigate the growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline of 43 microorganisms found within subgingival microbial complexes. We established initial inocula for each strain using anaerobic culture, re-inoculated into a minimal serum-based medium and grown anaerobically at 35 degrees C. We assessed organism growth by optical density (OD(600nm)) readings, with test and control cultures performed in triplicate. Test cultures were supplemented with 50 microm noradrenaline or 100 microm adrenaline. We observed significant growth effects for supplementation with noradrenaline (20 species responding positively) and adrenaline (27 species responding positively), with differences in growth response observed within bacterial species and within and between microbial complexes. The most pronounced positive growth effects of noradrenaline were demonstrated in Actinomyces naeslundii (+ 49.4%), Actinomyces gerenscseriae (+ 57.2%), Eikenella corrodens (+ 143.3%) and Campylobacter gracilis (+ 79.9%). We also observed inhibitory effects of noradrenaline supplementation for Porphyromonas gingivalis (- 11.9%) and Bacteroides forsythus (- 22.2%). Responses to adrenaline tended to mirror the responses seen with noradrenaline. Individual organisms from different microbial complexes vary in their in vitro growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline. Such variation may influence the in vivo composition of the subgingival biofilm in response to stress-induced changes in local catecholamine levels and play a significant role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of the periodontal diseases.
TI  - Periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. We assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. METHODS: Plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. Using species-specific primers of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Treponema denticola, PCR amplification was performed with bacterial genomic DNA from plaque samples. RESULTS: The results indicated that C. rectus, E. corrodens, A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. ochracea, and C. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while B. forsythus and P. intermedia were detected less frequently, and P. gingivalis and T. denticola were not found. In contrast, the percentage of P. nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. Subject-based analyses suggested that the number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. CONCLUSIONS: The colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. However, colonization by P. gingivalis and T. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.
TI  - Microbiological characteristics of subgingival microbiota in adult periodontitis, localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis subjects.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of the cultivable subgingival microbiota in periodontal diseases and to draw attention to the polymicrobial nature of periodontic infections. METHODS: The study population consisted of 95 patients, 51 females and 44 males, aged 14-62 years. Twenty-nine patients exhibited adult periodontitis (AP), six localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP), and 60 rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP). Two to four pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. Samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets. The samples were cultured under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and by a commercial rapid test system. RESULTS: Prevotella intermedia and Capnocytophaga spp. were the most frequently detected microorganisms in all diagnostic groups. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Peptostreptococcus micros were found more frequently in AP and RPP patients, while Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Eikenella corrodens were associated with AP, LJP and RPP patients. The other bacterial species, including Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus spp. and Eubacterium spp., were detected at different levels in the three disease groups. CONCLUSIONS: The data show the complexity of the subgingival microbiota associated with different periodontal disease groups, indicating that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens are different in teeth affected by different forms of periodontal disease.
TI  - Relationship of periodontopathic bacteria with early-onset periodontitis in Down's syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Down's syndrome (DS) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of DS periodontitis. METHODS: Subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 DS young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (MD). The prevalence of 10 possible periodontopathic bacterial species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. The detection of P. gingivalis fimA genotypes was also performed in P. gingivalis-positive samples. RESULTS: Although DS subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with MD, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. The profiles of subjects with periodontitis were significant in DS, but not in MD. The prevalence of P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, and P. intermedia were significant in the DS periodontitis group, compared to DS gingivitis group. Moreover, the occurrence of P. gingivalis with the type II fimA gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both DS and MD, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in DS is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including P. gingivalis with type II fimA.
TI  - Comparison of microbial composition in the subgingival plaque of adult crowded versus non-crowded dental regions.
AB  - It has been reported in the literature that certain species of bacteria (periodontopathogens) present in the subgingival plaque are associated with destructive periodontal disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the presence and proportional distribution of periodontopathogens in the subgingival plaque of adult crowded versus non-crowded dental regions. Thirty adult patients with anterior dental crowding were selected from the Orthodontic Clinic of the University of Pennsylvania. After orthodontic records were taken and the periodontal examination was performed, subgingival plaque samples were collected from crowded (experimental) and contralateral non-crowded regions (control) of each patient. The presence of 9 periodontopathic species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga species, Fusobacterium species, Peptostreptococcus micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Bacteroides forsythus, was determined using culture and immunofluorescence techniques. The bacterial morphotype was also determined by the use of dark-field microscopy. It was found that supragingival plaque accumulation in crowded regions was significantly greater than in non-crowded regions. Analysis of the bacteria showed that the samples from crowded regions consistently contained more species of periodontopathogens than the samples from non-crowded regions. Morphologically, more spirochetes and motile rods were present in the crowded-region samples. In terms of the presence of individual periodontopathogens, Fusobacterium species, Capnocytophaga species, C rectus, and P micros were significantly more common in the crowded samples than in the non-crowded samples. It was concluded that: (1) more plaque accumulated in crowded areas; (2) more species of periodontopathogens were present in the subgingival plaque of crowded regions; (3) morphologically, more spirochetes and motile rods were present in crowded areas; and (4) Fusobacterium species, Capnocytophaga species, C rectus, and P micros were present more often in crowded areas than in non-crowded areas (P < 0.05).
TI  - [Bacterial virulence in the etiology of periodontal diseases].
AB  - Strong relationships have been very often described between various form of periodontal disease (PD) and certain bacterial species, so that nowadays periodontal disease is recognized as an infectious disease. Destruction of periodontal supporting tissues happens as a response to very intricate host-parasite interactions. When the clinician will be able to fully understand and identify such phenomena it would be possible to succeed in a properly diagnosis and control of the active phase of periodontal disease. The first step in such a direction would be to analyze the common characteristic of some bacterial species, the so called suspected periodontopathogens. Such species namely Gram-negative, associated with the outbreak of periodontal disease have in common the capacity to disrupt the integrity of the host defences by means of the so called virulence factors. These factors may enhance the bacterial colonization or may interfere with the host response that ultimately results in periodontal support breakdown. The present review focuses on the virulence factors of the main suspected periodontopathogens evaluating the effects on the host immune response and directly on the periodontal tissues.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Checkerboard assessments of serum antibodies to oral microbiota as surrogate markers of clinical periodontal status.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study addresses whether checkerboard assessments of serum IgG antibodies to oral bacteria may serve as surrogate markers of clinical periodontal status in epidemiologic studies. METHOD: The analysis involved data from 205 subjects, 132 periodontitis patients and 73 periodontally-intact controls, from whom full-mouth clinical periodontal data and serum IgG titers against 19 periodontal bacterial species were available. RESULTS: A logistic regression model involving titers against 6 species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eubacterium nodatum, Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2) classified correctly 74.5% of the subjects examined, with 84% sensitivity, 57.5% specificity, 78% positive predictive value and 66.7% negative predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: Checkerboard serology may be useful in providing surrogate markers for clinical periodontal status when such data are not readily available and, thus may serve as a valuable complement in the armamentarium of epidemiologic tools suited for the study of periodontal diseases.
TI  - "Checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum IgG responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. METHODS: One hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). Smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject; 2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic DNA probes. Serum IgG antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. RESULTS: Cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. Corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. Heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). Higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Eubacterium nodatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella parvula, and Actinomyces naeslundii in controls. Cases displayed higher IgG levels against P. gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against F. nucleatum, T. denticola, E. nodatum, and Capnocytophaga ochracea. Positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. In cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species out of which only one was positive (V. parvula). Both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. A logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. Smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. CONCLUSION: A combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - Periodontopathic bacteria in children with Down syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is widely known that individuals with Down syndrome (DS) often develop severe early-onset periodontal diseases. In this study, we examined the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in DS children to determine if specific pathogens are acquired in their childhood. METHODS: The subjects were 60 DS children (2 to 13 years old, 5 in each age bracket) and 60 age-matched controls. Ten pathogens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, P nigrescens, Capnocytophaga ochracea, C. sputigena, Campyrobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens were surveyed in subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction. Periodontal status was evaluated by probing depth, bleeding on probing, and gingival index. RESULTS: No significant difference in periodontal status was observed between the DS and control groups, however, all of the pathogens were detected with greater frequency in the DS children. B. forsythus, T. denticola, P. nigrescens, and C. rectus were significantly prevalent throughout all age brackets of the DS children (P <0.01 or 0.05). The occurrence of P. gingivalis was also significant in the DS subjects over 5 years old. A cluster analysis of the microbial profiles of the DS subjects showed that gingivitis severity was associated with increased varieties of the harboring pathogens and the distribution of P. gingivalis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that various periodontopathogens can colonize in the very early childhood of DS patients and maturation of subgingival components, including P. gingivalis, plays an important role in the initiation of gingival inflammation.
TI  - Comparative microbiological characteristics of failing implants and periodontally diseased teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this report was to compare the distribution of periodontal pathogens recovered from failing implants and teeth with adult and recurrent forms of periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 41 consecutive microbial samples from patients with failing implants (IMP) were received at the Microbiology Testing Laboratory (MTL) of the University of Pennsylvania over a 2-year period. Paired control samples were selected from samples received concurrently by MTL from 41 patients with a diagnosis of adult periodontitis (AP) and 41 with a diagnosis of recurrent or refractory periodontitis (RP). Patients' mean ages for the 3 categories were 59, 47, and 53 years, respectively. Samples were collected with paper points or scalers and shipped in prereduced medium by express mail to the laboratory where they were processed within 48 hours from the time of collection. Culture was used for detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, P. intermedia/nigrescens, E. corrodens, P. micros, Capnocytophaga and Fusobacterium sp., enteric Gram-negative rods, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus sp., and yeast. P. gingivalis and B. forsythus were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Morphotypes were enumerated by dark-field microscopy. RESULTS: The most frequently detected microorganisms from IMP were B. forsythus (59%), spirochetes (54%), Fusobacterium (41%), P. micros (39%), and P. gingivalis (27%). Recovery levels (mean +/- SD) were 1+/-1, 4+/-5, 4+/-5, 9+/-11, 1+/-2, respectively. The most frequently detected organisms for AP were B. forsythus (83%), Fusobacterium (80%), spirochetes (79%), P. gingivalis (59%), P. micros (51%), and E. corrodens (37%), at levels 2+/-2, 5+/-4, 9+/-6, 4+/-5, and 6+/-7, respectively. Corresponding data for RP were B. forsythus (85%), Fusobacterium (83%), P. gingivalis (60%), spirochetes (59%), C. rectus (56%), and P. micros (56%), at levels of 3+/-2, 8+/-8, 4+/-4, 2+/-2, 1+/-1, and 9+/-10, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens in failing implants are significantly different from that of teeth with periodontitis; however, the detection frequency and levels of recovery are similar in teeth affected by adult and refractory (recurrent) forms of periodontitis.
TI  - Relationship of the subgingival microbiota to a chairside test for aspartate aminotransferase in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between  the occurrence of certain specific periodontal pathogens and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF). METHODS: Thirty systemically healthy subjects with moderate to advanced periodontitis were selected. Within each subject, the AST contents of GCF from sites with probing depth between 5 mm and 7 mm were measured using a chairside colorimetric test. AST-positive site refers to one that had an AST level > or = 800 microIU. Subgingival plaque samples from one AST-positive and one negative site were collected for microbiological examination. One site with probing depth < or = 3 mm and no gingival inflammation was selected as a healthy control. Clinical parameters of the chosen sites, including the plaque index and gingival index scores, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were measured. Culture and immunofluorescence (IF) were used for detecting common periodontal pathogens, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga species, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between the AST test and certain specific pathogens. RESULTS: The GCF scores and total cultivable bacterial counts were higher in AST-positive sites than either AST-negative or healthy sites. The prevalence and proportions of specific periodontal pathogens such as C rectus, E. corrodens, F. nucleatum, Capnocytophaga species, P. intermedia, and P. gingivalis were significantly higher in positive than in negative sites. In analyzing the correlation of the proportion of 6 pathogens with the AST test by logistic regression, only P. gingivalis showed a significant positive correlation. The odds ratio of having a high proportion of P. gingivalis in the presence of a positive AST test was 1.21. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that at AST-positive sites, there is a higher prevalence and higher proportion of certain periodontal pathogens. Although only the correlation of P. gingivalis and AST values was statistically significant, the results imply that certain periodontal pathogens may be associated with elevation of AST levels in GCF.
TI  - Microbiological features and crevicular fluid aspartate aminotransferase enzyme activity in early onset periodontitis patients.
AB  - Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) reflects the immune and inflammatory reactions and the specific host-microbe interactions that lead to periodontal diseases. Aspartate aminotransferase enzyme (AST) is one of the components of GCF that is released as a result of cell death. In this study, periodontal sites (4 sites/patient) with a probing depth of > or =5 mm in early onset periodontitis (EOP) patients were first examined for the AST levels in GCF by the Periogard periodontal tissue monitor. To be eligible for the study, each of the patients had at least 1 AST positive site with clinical inflammatory changes (AST+, CIC+) and 1 AST negative site with no or minimum clinical inflammatory changes (AST-, CIC-). In 15 EOP patients who met the entry criteria, 30 AST+, CIC+ sites (1st group) and 19 AST-, CIC- sites (2nd group) were evaluated for microbiological variables. Certain microbial species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Prevotella intermedia were detected more frequently (p<0.001, p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively) in the 1st group, while gram-positive facultative organisms such as Actinomyces species were found more often (p<0.001) in the 2nd group. Parallel to the AST levels, the 2nd group had a lower number of total bacteria and proportion of obligate anaerobic and capnophilic micro-organisms than the first group (p<0.05 and p<0.05, respectively). Within the scope of this study, AST activity and microbiological data were found in agreement in the examined groups. These findings are encouraging and indicate the need for further studies to evaluate the ability of the AST test to differentiate the microbial flora of progressing sites and those that are inflamed, but not progressing.
TI  - Analysis of serum antibody responses to periodontopathogens in early-onset periodontitis patients from different geographical locations.
AB  - Serum antibody specificity to oral micro-organisms was used to delineate the pathogens associated with early-onset periodontal diseases in a Turkish population. Additionally, comparison of the findings to those derived from a clinically similar US patient population described differences in bacterial specific antibody between these 2 geographic regions. Serum from 89 (LJP), 86 (RPP) and 94 (normal) subjects was analyzed (ELISA) to determine IgG antibody to 14 oral micro-organisms. All LJP patients from Turkey exhibited elevated antibody levels to A. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes c and a significantly increased), while antibody levels to A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 and JP2 (serotype b) were significantly higher in US LJP patients. 50% of the Turkish RPP patients also showed elevated anti-A. actinomycetemcomitans antibody, although the US RPP patients exhibited significantly higher antibody levels and frequency of elevated antibody to the A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. Healthy subjects and LJP and RPP patients from the US exhibited higher antibody levels to all 3 P. gingivalis serogroups compared to those from Turkey, although, the frequency of elevated antibody to the P. gingivalis serogroups was significantly higher in LJP and RPP patients from Turkey than from the US. Interestingly, 87% and 77% of the LJP patients in the Turkish population had elevated antibody responses to P. gingivalis and E. corrodens, respectively, which was not observed in the US LJP patients. These data suggested that considerable variation exists in the systemic antibody levels to periodontopathogens between these 2 countries. This supports potential differences in subgingival colonization or antigenic composition of these pathogens between patient populations from different geographical regions.
TI  - Subgingival distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis and  their susceptibility to minocycline-HCl.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of several periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis, their in vitro susceptibility to minocycline-HCl, and whether the efficacy of the drug changes with a decrease in bacterial susceptibility. Twenty-one patients (43 to 75 years old) with 62 periodontal lesions from pockets > or =4 mm participated in the study. After subgingival sampling, an ointment containing 2% minocycline-HCl was applied locally to the selected pockets once a week for 4 weeks. The lesions were clinically examined after 1 and 4 weeks of administration. The distribution of the subgingival microorganisms included Capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), Prevotella intermedia (22.6%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%), and Eikenella corrodens (4.8%). The distribution was complex, with 76.8% of the sites containing 1 to 3 bacterial spieces. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of minocycline-HCl for each organism showed that most were inhibited by a minocycline-HCl concentration equal to or less than the MIC for reference strains. However, some clinical strains of Prevotella intermedia seemed to exihibit low susceptibility to minocycline-HCl. There were no significant differences among sites with strains exhibiting low or normal susceptibility to minocycline-HCl. The concentration of the drug applied to deep periodontal pockets inhibited the growth of most of the microorganisms investigated in this study.
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
TI  - Oral food consumption and subgingival microorganisms: subgingival microbiota of gastrostomy tube-fed children and healthy controls.
AB  - This study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. Microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16S rRNA-based PCR identification methods. Streptococcal and Actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. In decreasing order of prevalence, Fusobacterium, enteric rods, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Capnocytophaga, Propionibacterium, yeasts, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Campylobacter rectus, Bacteroides forsythus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. The cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. PCR detection showed C. rectus and Eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. In decreasing order of prevalence, PCR identified Treponema denticola, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. nigrescens, P. intermedia, B. forsythus, and P. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. Tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. It appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.
TI  - Subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that of non-smokers. The study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. The differences in bacterial counts using the Mann Whitney U test were statistically significant for Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, Bacteroides gracilis, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena and Candida albicans in smokers. Statistically significant differences for Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces naeslundii, Eubacterium lentum and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like E. coli, C. albicans and S. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - Rapid characterization of periodontal bacterial isolates by using fluorogenic substrate tests.
AB  - Eighty-nine species of subgingival bacteria, represented by 121 reference strains and 892 patient isolates, including gram-negative, gram-positive, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic species, were characterized with a panel of fluorogenic, 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked substrate tests. Identifications of all patient isolates were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of whole-cell proteins relative to reference strains. Characteristic profiles of positive fluorogenic reactions differentiated most of the species, including five Porphyromonas species, six pigmenting and five nonpigmenting Prevotella species, Bacteroides forsythus, three Capnocytophaga species, six Actinomyces species, four Propionibacterium species, and eight Streptococcus species. Two mannoside isomers differentiated Actinomyces israelii and Actinomyces gerencseriae. In addition to Porphyromonas gingivalis, B. forsythus, and Capnocytophaga species, Fusobacterium alocis, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Actinomyces meyeri, and Bifidobacterium dentium were all positive for so-called trypsin-like activity. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Campylobacter species were nonreactive with the carbohydrate-based substrates tested. Fluorogenic substrate tests provided a sensitive and simple method for biochemical characterization that could presumptively identify to species level most subgingival isolates within 4 h. The method was ideal for rapidly obtaining presumptive identifications of isolates prior to confirming identifications by definitive methods, such as SDS-PAGE.
TI  - [Subgingival distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontic patients and susceptibility of these bacteria to minocycline-HCl].
AB  - The present study was carried out to examine the distribution of six periodontopathic bacteria in deep periodontal pockets and to reconfirm the effect of Periocline on these periodontopathic bacteria. Samples from sixty-two periodontal pockets were collected at pocket depths of over 4 mm in twenty-one periodontitis patients aged 43 to 75 years. After sampling, Periocline was applied topically to the selected pockets once a week for four weeks and reexamined. The detected rates of the periodontopathic bacteria were Capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), Prevotella intermedia (22.6%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%) and Eikenella corrodens (4.8%). The distribution of the bacteria was compound because two or three bacterial species were found to coexist. In view of the MIC of minocycline-HCI for these bacteria, increase of most of the measured bacteria was suppressed by the concentration of drugs, including Periocline. However, clinical strains of P. i. were considered to have low susceptibility to minocycline-HCl. In view of the effect of topical application of drugs, no significant differences were found. From these results, it was suggested that Periocline contained effective concentration of minocycline-HCl.
TI  - Microbial alterations in supragingival dental plaque in response to a triclosan-containing dentifrice.
AB  - A total of 325 subjects were entered into a double-blind, stratified 2-treatment  clinical study that examined the effects of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan, 2% Gantrez copolymer and 0.243% sodium fluoride on supragingival dental plaque and gingivitis. A subset of 159 subjects including 72 men and 87 women participated in the microbiological component of this study, which was designed to detect shifts in supragingival bacterial species in response to triclosan. Subjects were divided into two groups: one performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice and a control group used a placebo dentifrice without triclosan. At baseline, 3 and 6 months during treatment and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks post-treatment, supragingival dental plaque was collected from the buccal and lingual surfaces of the 4 first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase-contrast microscopy; 2) select bacterial groups and bacterial species by culture; and 3) target periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia by immunofluorescence microscopy. There were few statistically significant differences between treatment groups in any of the 90 microbiological parameters measured at the 7 different time points. The control group demonstrated significantly higher levels of cultivable Neisseria and higher proportions at the 3-month treatment period of P. gingivalis-infected subjects and mean cells. After 6 months of treatment, the triclosan group demonstrated higher levels of fusiforms. Analysis of triclosan resistance data failed to detect a shift towards increased proportions of bacteria resistant to triclosan, and both treatment groups demonstrated triclosan-resistant strains, predominantly Veillonella dispar. This study confirms the microbiological safety of triclosan-containing dentifrices and suggests that continued use can be associated with beneficial alterations in the bacterial composition of supragingival dental plaque.
TI  - Occurrence of certain bacterial species and morphotypes in juvenile periodontitis in Chile.
AB  - The occurrence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga species, and certain bacterial morphotypes was determined in 18 affected and 18 unaffected sites in 10 localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) patients, and in 10 affected and 10 unaffected sites in 5 generalized juvenile periodontitis (GJP) patients. The subgingival proportion of the 7 bacterial species was determined by selective and nonselective culturing. The results showed that when considering the pure prevalence of bacteria ( > 0%) there were significant differences (P < 0.05) in the subgingival plaque microflora of the affected sites versus those of the unaffected sites for P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia, E. corrodens, C. rectus, and F. nucleatum in LJP, and for P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and F. nucleatum in GJP. The mean proportions of cocci, motile rods and spirochetes were also significantly different (P < 0.05) in affected sites compared to unaffected sites. Capnocytophaga sp, F. nucleatum, P. intermedia, and E. corrodens were found in more than 75% of affected sites in LJP. When taking the approach that an organism, to be associated with periodontal disease, has to be detected above a certain minimum threshold, the results indicated that bacteria most frequently associated with LJP and GJP in Chile are P. gingivalis (66% of LJP and 80% of GJP affected sites), and A. actinomycetemcomitans (44% of LJP and 50% in GJP affected sites). Different bacterial species may be judged to be important in the disease process depending upon whether a pure bacterial prevalence, or a prevalence above a certain detection level, is considered.
TI  - Effect of periodontal treatments on serum IgG antibody titers against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Serum IgG antibody titers to 7 periodontopathic bacteria in periodontitis patients were measured at the 1st visit and after various periodontal treatments with clinically successful improvement, in order to evaluate what kind of factors are associated with changes of serum antibody titers. 20 patients (10 male and 10 female from 23 to 61 years old) with adult, rapidly progressive periodontitis were enrolled in this study. All patients received initial preparation and most of them also underwent surgical procedure. After the treatments, the mean probing pocket depths decreased from 3.72 mm to 1.56 mm. Serum samples were collected from patients at the initial and final examinations. Serum IgG antibody titers against sonicated antigens of Porphyromonas gingivalis FDC 381, Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611, Prevotella loescheii ATCC 15930, Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum ATCC 25586, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDC Y4, Eikenella corrodens FDC 1073 and Capnocytophaga ochracea # M 12 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mean antibody titers to P. gingivalis and P. intermedia decreased significantly after the treatment as compared to their pretreatment levels. The antibody titer to P. gingivalis, especially, decreased in all of the patients examined. A significant relationship was found between the decreased antibody titer to P. gingivalis and the number of teeth which received periodontal surgery, as well as treatment length, and the relationship between the decreased antibody titer to P. intermedia and the number of extracted teeth was also significant. These results suggest that the changes of serum IgG titers against P. gingivalis and P. intermedia are related to the suppression of such pathogens in subgingival plague.
TI  - Some suspected periodontopathogens and serum antibody response in adult long-duration insulin-dependent diabetics.
AB  - The subgingival microflora and serum antibody response were examined in long-duration insulin-dependent diabetics and age- and sex-matched non-diabetics. The material consisted of 9 diabetics aged 40-49 years and 19 aged 50-59 years, 13 non-diabetics aged 40-49 years and 21 aged 50-59 years. The bacterial species studied (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga spp, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia) were recovered in diabetics as well as in non-diabetics. Significantly more diabetics in both age groups harboured P. gingivalis compared to non-diabetics. Prevalence of P. gingivalis was associated with deepened periodontal pockets among non-diabetics but not among diabetics. In diabetics and non-diabetics, the serum antibody titres for most antigens were similar.
TI  - Microbiological study of juvenile periodontitis in Chile.
AB  
TI  - Succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  - This report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. Tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. Tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. Microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. After implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly elevated. Following fixture placement, P. intermedia replaced P. melaninogenica as the predominant Black Pigmented Anaerobic Bacilli (BPAB) in the mouth. After abutment connection stage, levels of P. intermedia, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatun, Haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. Three months after bridge installations, P. intermedia and A. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. At six months after bridge installation, levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months. Porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their levels correlated with gingival redness. P. intermedia, Porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. Correlation was detected between P. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum. Our studies show a transitional increase in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their levels.
TI  - The gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  - A gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. Gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eubacterium nodatum and Fusobacterium nucleatum and one nonoral microorganism, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica. Of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were E. nodatum (72%) and A. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). More juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to P. intermedia, C. ochracea, E. nodatum and P. micros. No significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. Cluster analysis revealed the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of P. micros and C. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. The data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Coaggregation between Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola.
AB  - To elucidate an ecological profile of several periodontopathogens, the authors examined the coaggregation between cells of Porphyromonas gingivalis and oral bacterial strains including Treponema denticola in vitro. Coaggregation between cells of plaque bacteria was examined by visual assay and phase-contrast microscope. P. gingivalis cells coaggregated with strains of T. denticola and Treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii, but did not coaggregate with T. socranskii subspecies buccale, T. socranskii subspecies paredis, Treponema vincentii, or Treponema pectinovorum. The extracted hemagglutinin from P. gingivalis was active agglutinating T. denticola cells. Addition of serum and saliva somewhat affected the coaggregation, but no effects of tested sugars or amino acids were found. Heat treatment of T. denticola cells did not reduce the coagregation: heat treatment of P. gingivalis cells eliminated it. Growth inhibitory activity among these bacterial species was examined by the stab culture method. Strains of T. denticola ATCC 35404 and 35405 and T. vincentii inhibited the growth of some P. gingivalis strains, but not others. No strain of Treponema was inhibited by black-pigmented anaerobic rods. The coaggregation observed between P. gingivalis and T. denticola indicates the potential importance of their simultaneous existence in human periodontal pockets and development of the disease.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils and essential oil components towards oral bacteria.
AB  - A method for reproducibly determining minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations of plant extracts towards fastidiously and facultatively anaerobic oral bacteria, predicated upon measurements of optical densities in microtitre plate wells, was devised. The antimicrobial properties of some botanical oils were surveyed; of these, Australian tea tree oil, peppermint oil, and sage oil proved to be the most potent essential oils, whereas thymol and eugenol were potent essential oil components.
TI  - Identification and analyses of periodontal pathogens in Taiwan by microbiological tests.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to use microbiological tests for diagnosis of periodontal diseases in Taiwan. Anaerobic culture, direct microscopy, indirect immunofluorescence (IF), and biochemical tests were used to examine 336 samples for the specific microorganisms in subgingival plaque. The results indicated that gram-negative species and motile bacteria were less frequently detected, and in lower proportion, in samples from healthy sites. The bacteria found frequently in healthy group were the coccal forms. However, Bacteroides forsythus detected by IF showed a close association with periodontal inflammation. Porphyromonas gingivalis was found with about 53% frequency in the periodontitis group; in more than half the samples the proportion was above 5%. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was recovered with 48% frequency of periodontitis group. Other cultivable species including Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga species, Centipeda periodontii, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Selenomonas species, and the Spirochetes were detected in a significantly higher proportion in periodontitis group. The results strongly support the use of microbiological tests as adjuncts to diagnosis, and for assessment of the importance of microbiota in periodontal disease.
TI  - Modeling the relationship between clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters and alveolar bone levels in an elderly population.
AB  - A cross-sectional periodontal study of 74 subjects aged 65 to 75 years was performed. Clinical data were collected and related to microbiological and immunological data. A statistical model (step-wise multiple regression) of factors related to bone loss was created initially using clinical data only; then by adding either the microbiologic or immunologic data; and then by using clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic data together. When only clinical data were considered, three factors were found to have significant positive correlations with bone loss. Tooth mobility accounted for 17% of the variability in the alveolar bone level measurements, probing depth for 12%(r2), and plaque index for 3%, for a total of 32% of the variability explained by these clinical factors. Tooth mobility and probing depth were clinical factors which remained significant in the model when the microbiological data were also considered. As percentages of the total cultivable microbiota, E. corrodens (r2 = 14%) and black-pigmenting Prevotella intermedia (r2 = 4%) correlated positively with alveolar bone loss. The addition of the microbiologic data only increased the r2 to 33%. When immunological data were considered with the clinical data, pocket depth and tooth mobility were the clinical parameters which remained in the model. IgG antibody levels to P. gingivalis W83 and/or 381 (r2 = 24%) A. actinomycetemcomitans 627 (r2 = 2%) were the significant immunologic measures having a positive correlation with bone loss. Anti-F. nucleatum levels had a significant negative correlation. A total of 50% of the variability in alveolar bone level was accounted for in the model by the addition of specific serum antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms. When clinical, microbiological, and immunological measurements were all considered together, antibody to P. gingivalis W83 and/or 381 (r2 = 42%), percentage of B-lymphocytes (r2 = 3%), probing depth (r2 = 4%), anti-E. corrodens levels (r2 = 2%), and anti-P. gingivalis 33277 levels (r2 = 4%) all had significant positive correlation with loss of alveolar bone. The number of enteric bacteria, anti-F. nucleatum levels, and anti-P. intermedia levels each had a significant negative correlation with alveolar bone heights. The r2 for this model was 75%. These results indicated that antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms and tooth mobility were the best predictors of bone loss in the elderly patients tested in this study.
TI  - Detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival exudate by a dipeptide-enhanced trypsin-like activity.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque is an important risk factor for future periodontal attachment loss in susceptible adults. The elimination of P. gingivalis is usually concomitant with a healing process. Therefore, it should be valuable to have an easy chairside method to follow the effect of periodontal treatment on P. gingivalis detection as well as on its eventual reappearance during the maintenance period. We have previously reported the stimulation of amidolytic activity of P. gingivalis by the addition of glycyl-glycine to the assay buffer. In this study we determined the proportions of P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga spp, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens by cultivation technique and the amidolytic activity, using N-benzoyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA) as substrate, in gingival exudate before and during a 3-year treatment and maintenance period. P. gingivalis was the only species yielding a high and persistent correlation to stimulated amidolytic activity (P values < or = 0.0001) on both site (r = 0.5) and subject (r = 0.8) level. Testing pure cultures of suggested periodontal pathogens for effect of glycyl-glycine on amidolytic activity, we found that of P. gingivalis to be 5.9-fold increased. The amidolytic activity of Treponema denticola was only slightly stimulated (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 1.2) and that of Capnocytophaga slightly inhibited (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 0.8). The outcome of this study has the potential to be used for the development of a simple, rapid, and inexpensive assay for a qualitative and quantitative determination of P. gingivalis in gingival crevicular fluid.
TI  - Microbial associations in periodontitis sites before and after treatment.
AB  - Duplicate samples from 110 periodontal sites of 6 mm or more pocket depth in 16 patients were analyzed for the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Capnocytophaga spp., Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The sites were sampled before and after nonsurgical periodontal treatment. No statistically significant associations were found before treatment between any of the analyzed species. After treatment, statistically significant associations were found between E. corrodens and all the other species, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia; Capnocytophaga spp. and C. rectus; P. intermedia vs Capnocytophaga spp. and P. gingivalis; and C. rectus vs Capnocytophaga spp. and A. actinomycetemcomitans. Some of these associations could be explained either by patient-related factors or site-related characteristics such as the pocket depth. The proportion of P. gingivalis seemed to be unrelated to the proportion of P. intermedia in the samples. If one of the analyzed microbes was found in one of the sampled pockets in a patient, the probability of finding that microbe in all the sampled sites in the same patient before treatment was more than 50%. This probability was reduced after treatment for many species, especially P. gingivalis, which showed a probability of zero. The probability of detecting a bacterial species on at least one additional site if it was present on one in the same individual was nearly 100%, both before and after treatment, for all species studied. This study has shown several potential microbial associations in the subgingival plaque flora of deep periodontal pockets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Aspartame as a source of essential phenylalanine for the growth of oral anaerobes.
AB  - Phenylalanine and aspartic acid requirements were determined for 13 species of oral bacteria using the chemically defined medium OMIZ-W1. None of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Eikenella corrodens, Selenomonas sputigena, Treponema pectinovorum, T. socranskii, or Wolinella recta required either of these amino acid constituents of aspartame (L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methylester). Phenylalanine was essential for the growth of Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eubacterium timidum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. vincentii, while aspartic acid was not required. With the exception of E. timidum, all phenylalanine-dependent strains could grow when the free amino acid was replaced by aspartame at concentrations at least 10-fold lower than those used for aspartame as an artificial sweetener.
TI  - Microbial composition and pattern of antibiotic resistance in subgingival microbial samples from patients with refractory periodontitis.
AB  - A series of 993 subgingival microbial samples sent to a diagnostic microbiology laboratory included 196 samples that could be identified as compatible with a clinical diagnosis of refractory or recurrent periodontitis. In descending order of prevalence the associated microbiota included Bacteroides forsythus (84%), spirochetes (83%), motile rods (76%), Fusobacterium species (68%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (63%), Campylobacter rectus (47%), Capnocytophaga species (38%), Prevotella intermedia (23%), Peptostreptococcus micros (18%), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (16%), Candida (14%), enteric rods (9%), Staphylococcus species, not including aureus (5.6%). Eikenella corrodens (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (1.5%), and Enterococcus species (< 1%). Antibiotic resistance to tetracycline, penicillin G, or metronidazole was particularly noticeable for enteric rods, Fusobacterium species, Capnocytophaga species, Staphylococcus, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. It was largely absent for Campylobacter rectus. No antibiotic sensitivity data were obtained for Porphyromonas gingivalis or Bacteroides forsythus, as these species were detected by immunofluorescence. The results indicate that a substantial number of microorganisms associated with refractory periodontitis are variably resistant to commonly-used antibiotics. Diagnostic microbiology must be considered an essential adjunct to the therapist faced with periodontal lesions refractory to conventional treatment.
TI  - An analysis of the subgingival microflora in randomly selected subjects.
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the presence of some microbial species in the subgingival microflora of a randomly selected subject sample. A further objective was to analyze the association between some microbiological characteristics and the periodontal conditions of the subjects. A total of 171 individuals aged 30-65 years were included. A pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the mesial aspect of the 6 Ramfjord teeth by the use of the paper-point method. The samples were processed and analyzed according to standardized procedures. The periodontal condition of the subjects was examined clinically and included assessment of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth and probing attachment level. The results showed that 81% of the subjects were positive for Campylobacter rectus, 80% for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 77% for Streptococcus sanguis, 72% for Streptococcus mitis, 66% for Eikenella corrodens, 58% for Prevotella intermedia, 32% for Capnocytophaga, 27% for Selenomonas, 25% for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 14% for Porphyromonas gingivalis and 13% for Streptococcus mutans. Small differences in the periodontal conditions were observed between subjects harboring P. gingivalis, A. actinomytecomitans or > 5% P. intermedia and the rest of the sample. Similarly small differences in the clinical parameters were revealed when the subjects were grouped according to proportions of disease-associated and health-associated species in their subgingival samples.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of povidone-iodine solution to oral pathogenic bacteria in vitro.
AB  - Seven species of periodontal pathogenic bacteria (Bacteroides, gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga spp., Eikenella corrodens) and two control species (Streptococcus intermedius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were selected in order to study the bactericidal effects of 10% povidone-iodine (PVP-I) aqueous solution in vitro. The PVP-I solution was diluted to 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400 and 12800 x and contact times were 15, 30 and 60 seconds. The strongest bactericidal effects on the seven periodontal pathogenic bacteria and two control bacteria were seen at a dilution of 400 x and a contact time of 15 seconds. Based on these findings, we advocate a 0.25% solution of 10% aqueous PVP-I for oral mucosa and periodontal pocket irrigation.
TI  - Microbiota associated with residual clefts and neighboring teeth in patients with cleft lip, alveolus, and palate.
AB  - Twenty patients with residual clefts or pronounced soft tissue grooves, treated for uni- or bilateral cleft lip, alveolus, and palate were included in this study. Ten patients were recalled for dental prophylaxis at regular intervals, 10 patients were not. One microbiologic sample was obtained from the cleft area and two samples from a tooth adjacent to the cleft (sites adjacent and distant to the cleft). Between the recall and the nonrecall group there were notable differences in the presence of anaerobic Gram-negative organisms. Fusobacterium spp., Prevotella melaninogenica, and P. intermedia were more often found in nonrecall patients. While rarely seen in recall patients, spirochetes and motile rods were a common feature of nonrecall patients. The putative periodontal pathogens Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis were not detected in either group. The differences between the recall and the nonrecall groups were more pronounced when the respective samples from teeth were related to each other than when the samples obtained from the clefts were compared. The cleft flora was less complex irrespective of how good maintenance was and resembled the flora of teeth of well-maintained patients. Samples from clefts were never Wolinella positive, and harbored significantly less Capnocytophaga and Actinomyces viscosus than samples from dental sites.
TI  - Role of Porphyromonas gingivalis 40-kDa outer membrane protein in the aggregation of P. gingivalis vesicles and Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, an important pathogen in periodontitis, produces extracellular vesicles that aggregate with Actinomyces viscosus cells. A 40-kDa outer membrane protein (OMP)-coding gene from P. gingivalis was cloned and the protein was found to be localized in these vesicles. The recombinant 40-kDa OMP did not show aggregation activity. However, affinity-purified antibody against the recombinant protein significantly inhibited aggregation of P. gingivalis vesicles with A. viscosus cells. The antibody also inhibited cellular coaggregation of several strains of P. gingivalis with A. viscosus cells, but not with other periodontal pathogens. Moreover, aggregation of A. viscosus cells with P. gingivalis vesicles was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by pre-treatment of the A. viscosus cells with the recombinant protein. These findings suggest that the 40-kDa OMP may be an important aggregation factor of P. gingivalis.
TI  - E-test: a new technique for antimicrobial susceptibility testing for periodontal  microorganisms.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to validate the Epsilometer test (E-test) method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of selected periodontopathic microorganisms using the agar dilution method as a standard. The E-test has been developed to provide a direct quantification of antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms. The device consists of a predefined, continuous, and exponential gradient of antibiotic concentrations immobilized along a rectangular plastic test strip. After 48 hours incubation a drop-shaped inhibition zone intersects the graded test strip at the inhibitory concentration (IC) of the antibiotic. Twenty-two subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites were plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% rabbit blood or 5% sheep blood and trypticase soy agar supplemented with vancomycin and bacitracin. A total of 60 strains of key periodontal pathogens (Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, and Capnocytophaga) isolated from 22 sites of 12 patients were studied. The antibiotics tested were clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and ampicillin at concentrations above and below the achieved blood or gingival crevicular fluid levels. As a standard reference the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the agar dilution method. MICs were compared with ICs determined using the E-test method. The results showed an agreement ranging from 67% to 100%; sensitivity ranging from 75% to 100%; predictability ranging from 56% to 100% and specificity ranging from 33% to 96%. The E-test ICs for ampicillin, cefoxitin, and metronidazole against the Gram-negative capnophilic and microaerophilic rods and the black-pigmented anaerobic rods ICs for ampicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline showed a high percentage of agreement with the agar dilution MICS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Microbiology of healthy and diseased periodontal sites in poorly controlled insulin dependent diabetics.
AB  - A group of poorly-controlled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients  were examined in a cross-sectional design for total microbial levels, microbial incidence, and the percent levels of selected periodontal microorganisms. These organisms were selected on the basis of prior reports that associated them with either periodontal disease or health. One periodontally-healthy and one periodontally-diseased site were examined in each IDDM patient. Increased levels of the periodontal pathogens Prevotella intermedia, P. melaninogenica spp., Bacteroides gracilis, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Campylobacter rectus (formerly Wolinella recta) were found at the periodontal diseased sites. Increased prevalence of the organisms P. intermedia, P. melaninogenica spp., and C. rectus were found at the diseased sites. A significantly higher percentage of P. intermedia was found at the sites exhibiting deep pockets and attachment loss.
TI  - Minocycline slow-release formulation effect on subgingival bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the microbiological efficacy of an adjunctive minocycline periodontal formulation delivered subgingivally. Subjects were systemically healthy but exhibited severe periodontitis; i.e., probing depths greater than 6 mm. The two study groups included individuals who received minocycline or a placebo periodontal formulation after root planing. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained at baseline; prior to treatment; and at 1, 3, and 6 months. Plaque was evaluated by darkfield microscopy and further analyzed for total dark-pigmented Bacteroides species, P. intermedia, P. gingivalis and Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Eikenella, Actinobacillus, Capnocytophaga, and Fusobacterium species using cultivable flora techniques. In addition, plaque was evaluated for yeast on a selective agar medium. When compared to the placebo, the minocycline group had significantly lower proportions of spirochetes at 1 and 3 months and lower proportions of motile rods at 3 months. Furthermore, when compared to the placebo group, the minocycline patients had lower mean proportions of dark-pigmented Bacteroides spp. and P. intermedia at 1 and 3 months as well as lower proportions of E. corrodens at 1 month. The minocycline group had significant decreases in proportions of spirochetes at 1 and 3 months, motile rods at 1 and 3 months, and increases in cocci at 1, 3, and 6 months when compared to baseline. In the placebo group, root planing was also effective at decreasing spirochetes at 1, 3, and 6 months, but with significant differences seen only at 3 and 6 months. However, the degree of reduction in spirochete proportions was greater in the minocycline group when compared with the placebo group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Use of synthetic oligonucleotide DNA probes for the identification of different strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The ability of three different oligonucleotide probes to identify different oral  strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum was tested. Probes 119 and 214 were designed on the basis of known amino acid sequences from the N-terminal end of an outer membrane protein of F. nucleatum strain Fev1. Probe H 2.1, was a randomly cloned chromosomal DNA fragment of 2.1 kbp. The specificities of the probes were examined by testing each of them against a panel of five other species of Fusobacterium (six strains), oral and non-oral, and also against seven different oral species of six other genera. The chromosomal DNA of the bacteria to be examined was digested to completion using the restriction enzymes HincII, HindIII, EcoRI, EcoRV and Sau3AI. Digests were run on agarose gels and subjected to southern blotting before being hybridized with the probe in question. The results were confirmed by running a slot blot of genomic DNA from all of the 19 strains and hybridizing with a probe H 2.1. Probe H 2.1 turned out to be the most specific and useful of the three probes investigated. By use of this probe, interstrain identification of the six different strains of F. nucleatum could be performed and the strains could be distinguished from other oral species found in the oral cavity, such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens and Leptotrichia buccalis. The probe reacted weakly with other non-oral species of the genus Fusobacterium, and there was no problem in distinguishing between the different strains.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological patterns of adults with periodontitis.
AB  - Although current data suggest that periodontitis may actually be multiple diseases each with varying responses to therapy, little evidence exists to support this theory in adult patients. This report describes the design and initial findings of a longitudinal field trial involving the diagnosis and treatment of adult and refractory periodontitis patients in private practice. Adult patients (N = 221) who met specific clinical criteria were selected from the private practices of 22 periodontists. Clinical characteristics were recorded and subgingival plaque samples were sent to microbiology laboratories at either UCLA or The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA). Samples were processed according to protocols standardized between the 2 centers. Five different combinations of the initial clinical and microbial findings were evaluated for patterns in the data by means of cluster analysis. Plaque, bleeding on probing, bone loss scores, probing depth distributions, and microbial findings produced multiple cluster solutions. Solutions involving 6 clusters explained 39.4% to 76.4% of the variation between patients and produced ratios for variation between clusters to variation within clusters of 5.2 to 15.3. The optimal cluster solution incorporated both clinical and microbial findings, with some clusters characterized by high plaque and moderate bleeding on probing and bone loss, whereas others had low plaque but high bleeding on probing and bone loss. Microbial findings of each cluster exhibited distinct patterns with some clusters having a high prevalence (83% to 100%) of specific target bacterial species while other clusters had an absence of these species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Dental bacterial plaques. Nature and role in periodontal disease.
AB  - Antony van Leeuwenhoek first described oral bacteria. However, not until almost 200 years later was the famous Koch postulate introduced. Since then, research has extensively been performed regarding the development and microbiology of dental plaques. In spite of the complexity of the developing flora of supragingival plaque, culture studies have shown a remarkably orderly succession of organisms. Lately, the concept of microbial specificity in the etiology of periodontal diseases has been widely suggested, i.e., that different forms of periodontal disease are associated with qualitatively distinct dental plaques. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of the predominant cultivable microflora reveal that only a small number of the over 300 species found in human subgingival plaques are associated with periodontal disease. Among the commonly mentioned are: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Capnocytophaga sp., Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Wolinella recta, as well as certain gram-positive bacteria such as Eubacterium species. Anti-infective therapy for many systemic infections equals the use of antimicrobial drugs. However, for localized infections like periodontal diseases, treatment may consist of a combination of mechanical wound debridement and the application of an antimicrobial agent. The general effectiveness of mechanical anti-infective therapy and successful oral hygiene in the management of periodontal disease is well established in the literature and has met the test of success in clinical practice for most cases of periodontitis in adults. The definition of periodontal pathogens as either opportunistic pathogens, or as exogenous pathogens carries with it significant implications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Incidence of periodontitis recurrence in treated patients with and without cultivable Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, and Porphyromonas gingivalis: a prospective study.
AB  - A total of 98 adults previously treated for moderate to advanced periodontitis and on a trimonthly recall schedule were screened for the presence of critical levels of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, and Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis. Patients with at least 2 positive sites were placed in a positive group and patients without or with low levels of these bacteria in a negative group. During the 30-month study the incidence of disease recurrence was greater in the positive group, but did not reach statistical significance. Positive patients with deeper pockets tended to be at greater risk of developing recurrent disease than those with shallower pockets. In the positive group only, both A. actinomycetemcomitans recovery and antibody levels to A. actinomycetemcomitans strain NCTC 9710 (serotype c) were inversely correlated with disease recurrence. The presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. intermedia above critical levels did not reliably predict future episodes of disease recurrence in this population. The sparse recovery of P. gingivalis did not permit us to assess its diagnostic value. With the exception of P. gingivalis, for which insufficient data were available, the results indicate that the presence or absence of the above bacterial species cannot of itself serve as a reliable predictor of future episodes of recurrent disease in a population of treated patients on a regular trimonthly recall schedule.
TI  - Microbiological and immunological aspects of experimental periodontal disease in  rats: a review article.
AB  - Animal models in which microbiological and immunological aspects of periodontal disease can be studied prospectively seem well warranted. The rat bears much resemblance to man with respect to periodontal anatomy, development and composition of dental plaque, histopathology of periodontal lesions, and basic immunobiology. Furthermore, reproducible methods are available for assessment of periodontal disease in rats, and detectable periodontal destruction can be induced in a few weeks in these animals without traumatizing periodontal tissues with ligatures. Experimental periodontitis studies in germ-free rats have confirmed the pathogenicity of several suspected periodontal pathogens (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, and Fusobacterium nucleatum). The studies also suggest that the number of periodontal pathogens may be higher than generally believed, since species like Streptococcus sobrinus and Actinomyces viscosus are associated with periodontal bone loss in rats. Studies in rats with congenital or induced immune defects indicate that generalized or selective immunosuppression at the time of infection with periodontal pathogens may aggravate periodontal disease. Studies in immunized rats indicate that periodontal disease can be prevented by immunization against periodontal pathogens. However, it is also possible by immunization to induce periodontal destruction; i.e., the immune system has a destructive potential which should not be overlooked. In the future, the rat model may prove valuable for initial screening of antigen preparations and immunization regimens in the search for a periodontitis vaccine.
TI  - In vitro sensitivity of oral, gram-negative, facultative bacteria to the bactericidal activity of human neutrophil defensins.
AB  - Neutrophils play a major role in defending the periodontium against infection by  oral, gram-negative, facultative bacteria, such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga spp. We examined the sensitivity of these bacteria to a mixture of low-molecular-weight peptides and highly purified individual defensin peptides (HNP-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3) isolated from human neutrophils. Whereas the Capnocytophaga spp. strains were killed significantly by the mixed human neutrophil peptides, the A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. corrodens strains were resistant. Killing was attributable to the defensins. The bactericidal activities of purified defensins HNP-1 and HNP-2 were equal, and both of these activities were greater than HNP-3 activity against strains of Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. The strain of Capnocytophaga ochracea was more sensitive to defensin-mediated bactericidal activity than either C. sputigena or C. gingivalis was. The three human defensins were equipotent in killing C. ochracea. C. ochracea was killed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and over a broad pH range. Killing was most effective under hypotonic conditions but also occurred at physiologic salt concentrations. We concluded that Capnocytophaga spp. are sensitive to oxygen-independent killing by human defensins. Additional studies will be required to identify other components that may equip human neutrophils to kill A. actinomycetemcomitans, E. corrodens, and other oral gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Microbial patterns in pooled subgingival plaque samples from young adults with advanced marginal periodontitis.
AB  - Different bacterial profiles of subgingival plaque have been described for different clinical categories of marginal periodontitis. In the present investigation the subgingival microflora was studied in young adults with advanced marginal periodontitis. From 12 patients pooled subgingival plaque samples from 5 advanced stages of diseased sites were examined by direct differential phase-contrast microscopy and by cultivation on enriched and selective media. The proportions of the following genera and species were calculated: black-pigmented Bacteroides sp., B. gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veillonella sp., Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sp., Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter sp., and Candida sp. Spirochete identification was carried out ultrastructurally. Calculated percent minimum similarity levels between the individuals revealed that each patient harbored its characteristic cultivable subgingival microflora different from the other individuals. The spirochetes seemed to constitute the subgingival bacterial group with the smallest variation as certain morphotypes were dominating in almost all individuals.
TI  - The relationship of serum IgG antibody titers to periodontal pathogens to indicators of the host response in crevicular fluid.
AB  - In this study; the relationship of indicators of the local host response in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) to the serum antibody titer to periodontal pathogens was examined. 15 patients with chronic adult periodontitis were studied. GCF was collected and analyzed for the total amount of IgG, IgM, the lysosomal enzyme B-glucuronidase (BG) and alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M). At the same examination, serum from these patients was collected, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays used to determine the serum IgG antibody titer to a panel of 17 periodontal pathogens (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3 strains), Bacteroides gingivalis (4), Eikenella corrodens (2), Wolinella recta, Bacteroides intermedius (3), Fusobacterium nucleatum, and 3 Capnocytophaga species). Using Spearman rank order correlation analysis, correlation coefficients were calculated to relate the 4 indicators of host response in GCF to the serum IgG antibody titer to each of the 17 micro-organisms. The mean correlation between total IgG in GCF and the serum IgG antibody titer was positive (r = +0.30), and statistically significant correlations between total IgG in GCF and serum IgG antibody titer were observed for one strain of B. intermedius and C. ochracea. A weaker positive correlation was observed for IgM (r = 0.18). In contrast, the mean correlation between total BG in GCF and the serum antibody titer was negative (r = -0.34). Statistically significant negative correlations were observed for all 3 strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans, one strain of E. corrodens and W. recta. The mean correlation for alpha 2M was r = -0.06. These data suggest that elevated BG activity in GCF, believed to be a marker for lysosomal enzyme released from polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the crevicular environment, may be associated with a reduced serum IgG antibody response to suspected periodontal pathogens. Furthermore, these findings imply that the development of a serum IgG antibody response to suspected periodontal pathogens is consistent with a protective host response.
TI  - Sialidase (neuraminidase) activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic  bacteria.
AB  - A filter paper spot test with 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate was used to study the prevalence of sialidase activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria. A total of 567 isolates representing four genera of obligate anaerobes and four genera of capnophilic organisms was tested. Sialidase activity was detected in 94% of 66 isolates from the Bacteroides fragilis group, 98% of 66 B. bivius isolates, and all isolates of the following species (number of isolates follows species name): B. capillosus, 4; B. levii, 2; B. denticola, 22; B. loescheii, 23; B. melaninogenicus, 32; B. forsythus, 44; and B. buccalis, 2. However, sialidase activity was detected in only 29% of 7 B. buccae isolates, 79% of 14 B. disiens isolates, and 55% of 11 B. oralis isolates. Sialidase activity was not detected among any of 13 isolates of B. gracilis, 12 isolates of B. ureolyticus, 61 isolates of B. intermedius, or 26 isolates of B. corporis. Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) asaccharolytica (20 isolates) and P. endodontalis (8 isolates) did not demonstrate sialidase activity, while 25 isolates of P. gingivalis were sialidase positive. Sialidase activity was found in 10 (100%) of 10 isolates of Capnocytophaga ochracea of C. sputigena but not in any of 4 C. gingivalis isolates. Other gram-negative anaerobic or capnophilic bacteria, including the following, were negative for sialidase activity: Fusobacterium nucleatum, 39 isolates; Wolinella recta, 19 isolates; Eikenella corrodens, 17 isolates; Haemophilus aphrophilus, 10 isolates; and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 10 isolates. These data demonstrate sialidase activity in several species of the genera Bacteroides and Porphyromonas and suggest that this characteristic may be useful for identification.
TI  - The incidence of periodontopathic microorganisms in young children.
AB  - Thirty-six children in 4 cohorts of 0-1 week, 1-6 months, 1-2 years and 2-2 1/2 years of age were examined for the presence of black-pigmented Bacteroides species and some other bacteria suspected of being involved in the subsequent development of periodontal destruction. None of the sought-after bacteria were detected in the first week of life. Bacteroides intermedius and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were detected as early as 1 month after birth. Both of these bacteria were detected in 16-37% of children in the different cohorts. Bacteroides denticola was detected in one child. Other black-pigmented species including Bacteroides gingivalis and Bacteroides loescheii were not detected. Eikenella corrodens was detected in 62% of children under 6 months. Capnocytophaga spp. were detected in 12% and Fusobacterium nucleatum in 25% of children in this age group. With increasing age there was a trend towards an increase in the number of children with F. nucleatum but other bacteria were detected in similar numbers of children throughout the 3 older cohorts. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected at any age.
TI  - Prepubertal periodontitis: a review of diagnostic criteria, pathogenesis, and differential diagnosis.
AB  - This paper reviews the literature on prepubertal periodontitis (PP) according to  the definition and the classification of PP by Page. The generalized form of PP (G-PP) defined by Page was identified as the oral manifestation of a systemic disease called leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) and thus the pathogenesis is known at the molecular level. On the other hand, the localized form of PP (L-PP) is a disease defined by clinical criteria and its pathogenesis is not known at the molecular level. The reported prevalence of L-PP differs widely in reports, according to the methodology and population studied. However, it seems to be at least 0.84% or greater. Potential periodontal pathogens that have been associated with L-PP include the following bacteria: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.), Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides gingivalis, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Eikenella corrodens. Suggested contributing factors have included PMN or monocyte chemotactic defects and cementum defects. There is no unique pattern of bone loss in L-PP; however, there may be a type of periodontitis that affects all deciduous teeth, in the absence of LAD. L-PP may lead to localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) or generalized juvenile periodontitis (GJP). Histiocytosis X, hypophosphatasia and mild forms of blood dyscrasias may have minimal or no clinical signs and symptoms except for alveolar bone loss. Therefore diseases known to be associated with alveolar bone loss must be definitively excluded in prepubertal children until the pathogenesis of L-PP at the cellular and molecular levels is understood and L-PP can be definitively diagnosed either as a distinct disease entity or entities.
TI  - Humoral immune responses in experimental gingivitis in rats.
AB  - Serum IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody levels to extracts of rat dental plaque and five oral bacteria (Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans Y-4, Bacteroides gingivalis 381, Bact. intermedius ATCC 25261, Capnocytophaga sp. M-12, Eikenella corrodens ODU) were determined by ELISA. In addition, the presence of rat dental plaque and oral bacterial components in the inflamed gingival tissue was studied using immunofluorescence techniques. Serum and gingival tissue samples were obtained from ODU plaque-susceptible and plaque-resistant rats. In several susceptible rats, IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies against dental plaque and oral bacteria were detected. There was a correlation between the levels of IgG antibody to dental plaque and pocket probing depth, but not between pocket probing depth and the levels of IgM and IgA. Furthermore, components of rat dental plaque and oral bacteria were detected in the inflamed gingival tissue.
TI  - The predominant cultivable microbiota of crevicular epithelial cells.
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to compare the composition of the predominant cultivable microbiota associated with gingival crevicular epithelial cells with that of the unattached microbiota recovered from the same site. Samples were taken from 2 diseased sites from 8 periodontal patients, by scraping the epithelial lining of the pocket with a curette. The epithelial cells were separated from the unattached subgingival bacteria by centrifugation in a reduced 50% Percoll density gradient. Epithelial cells formed a band at the top of the gradient and were removed separately from the unattached bacteria located at the base. Each layer was dispersed, diluted and plated on Trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood and 50 isolates were characterized from each sample. The microorganisms associated with the epithelial layer harbored 5- to 20-fold higher mean percentages of Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius and Peptostreptococcus micros. The layer of unattached organisms exhibited 4- to 10-fold higher mean percentages of Streptococcus uberis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens and Veillonella parvula.
TI  - The comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (SE) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) was compared. Equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of SE were used to challenge HGF cultures. The cytotoxic potential of each SE was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit HGF proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3H-thymidine incorporation in HGF cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. The highest concentration (500 micrograms SE protein/ml) of any of the SEs used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the HGFs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. At the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms SE protein/ml); only SE from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the HGFs as determined by any of the criteria employed. SE from Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, or Wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less than that of the first group of three organisms named above. The SE of the three other organisms tested (Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. The data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.
TI  - Hemagglutinating activity of lipopolysaccharides from subgingival plaque bacteria.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparations from the Bacteroides species B. endodontalis, B. intermedius, B. denticola, and B. melaninogenicus and from Fusobacterium nucleatum, Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and Eikenella corrodens directly agglutinated erythrocytes of some kinds of animals. LPSs from the Bacteroides species B. gingivalis, B. asaccharolyticus, B. corporis, and B. loescheii and from Capnocytophaga ochracea did not possess any hemagglutinating activity. Pretreatment of LPSs with lipase and phospholipase C completely eliminated the hemagglutinating activity. The hemagglutinating activity was also affected by human serum, saliva, colistin, and polymyxin B but was not affected by sugars, amino acids, EDTA, or proteolytic enzymes. The role of this hemagglutinating activity in colonization by these microorganisms of the periodontal region is discussed.
TI  - Microbiology of subgingival plaque from children with localized prepubertal periodontitis.
AB  - Localized prepubertal periodontitis has been described as a host-defect mediated  form of bacterially induced periodontitis, with an early onset and rapid progression around a few teeth in children prior to puberty. To further our understanding of the etiology of this disease, we have examined the microbiological components of subgingival dental plaque in 9 children with localized prepubertal periodontitis to determine if patterns of putative pathogens existed, and have compared these results with those obtained from 4 children with no periodontitis. Subgingival plaque samples were plated onto a selective medium for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and onto a non-selective medium for anaerobes, and the predominant cultivable microbiota of 2 sites per child was determined. The subgingival microbiota of children with localized prepubertal periodontitis clearly differs from non-diseased children in the detection of high levels of several suspected pathogens, including A. actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga sputigena. These putative pathogens were found in various combinations. These findings suggest that localized prepubertal periodontitis is associated with specific subgingival bacteria which are generally not found in children without periodontitis.
TI  - Suspected periodontopathic microorganisms and their oral habitats in young children.
AB  - Samples of subgingival plaque from 67 children, 5-7 years of age, were examined for the presence of certain suspected periodontal pathogenic species using the conventional technique of anaerobic sonification, dilution and spiral plating. When this technique was compared with a direct plating procedure which involved no preliminary dispersion and dilution of plaque specimens, it was found that the direct method resulted in double the frequency of children in whom black-pigmented Bacteroides (BPB) were detected and a 10-times increase in the number of subjects harbouring Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Samples from the tongue, tonsils and saliva were also plated using the direct technique. BPB were detected less commonly in the plaque specimens (61.3% of children) than in saliva (89.5%), or on the tongue (86.6%) and tonsils (97.1%). Expressed as percentages of a pooled sample of the total BPB population, the most frequently detected species in plaque were Bacteroides intermedius (44.4%) and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (48.0%). The most prevalent isolate in all other oral sites was B. melaninogenicus. Expressed as percentages of children in whom BPB were detected, the most frequently isolated species from plaque using the conventional dilution technique was B. intermedius (21.3%), whereas other BPB species were present in fewer than 5% of children. Fusobacterium nucleatum and Capnocytophaga species were isolated most frequently from plaque but were also commonly detected in the various other oral sites.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of hydrogen peroxide and sodium bicarbonate individually and in combination against selected oral, gram-negative, facultative bacteria.
AB  - The topical application of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), individually and in combination, has been used empirically in the treatment of periodontal diseases. In this study, we examined both minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of these disinfectants individually and in combination against selected facultative, Gram-negative oral bacteria in a microtiter dilution assay. The bacteria studied included Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. These bacteria exhibited MBC (one hr) values ranging from 75 mumol/L to greater than 10 mmol/L and MIC from less than 5 to 500 mumol/L for H2O2. The tested bacteria exhibited MIC values for NaHCO3 of from 23 to 182 mmol/L, and the MBC (one hr) exceeded 728 mmol/L for most of the strains examined. At sublethal (sub-MIC) concentrations, sodium bicarbonate antagonized the ability of H2O2 to inhibit bacterial growth in MIC assays, but sublethal concentrations of H2O2 had no effect on the MIC values of NaHCO3. Lethal concentrations of H2O2 and NaHCO3 exhibited synergistic antimicrobial activity in combination in one-hour bactericidal assays. Since the bactericidal properties of these antimicrobial agents are synergistic, we conclude that it may be rational to use them in combination to treat certain forms of periodontal disease. Also, lower and perhaps safer concentrations of H2O2 can be used in combination with NaHCO3 when oxidative antimicrobial chemotherapy is indicated.
TI  - Assessment of serum antibody patterns and analysis of subgingival microflora of members of a family with a high prevalence of early-onset periodontitis.
AB  - In a study of members of a large family with a high prevalence of early-onset periodontitis, we sampled the subgingival microflora and characterized 40 isolates from each sample. We surveyed serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies reacting with any of a panel of 21 periodontal bacteria. The mother and 7 of her 13 children had early-onset periodontitis. Bacteroides gingivalis was not detected in the subgingival flora of any affected or unaffected family member, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was isolated from only one affected child. Capnocytophaga ochracea was isolated from five of seven affected children and from none of their normal siblings. We found no significant differences among the floras from family members who had rapidly progressive, juvenile, and prepubertal forms of periodontitis. Elevated levels of serum antibody reacting with one or more of the bacteria tested were found in all family members with disease, but in only one periodontally normal family member. Both children with prepubertal periodontitis had antibodies reacting with C. sputigena, a species not found in their subgingival floras, but with none of the other bacteria tested. All remaining affected family members had antibodies to one or more serotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans, and four had antibodies reacting with additional bacteria, including C. sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Haemophilus aphrophilus. Sera from patients contained antibodies specific for putative periodontal pathogens not found in their pocket flora, and conversely, putative periodontal pathogens for which no serum antibodies were found frequently comprised a large proportion (10% or more) of the pocket flora. In no case were both the bacterium and its antibody found. These observations are suggestive of sequential infection in the early-onset forms of periodontitis and of induction of protective immunity against reinfection by the same microorganism.
TI  - Gram negative species associated with active destructive periodontal lesions.
AB  - Apical subgingival plaque samples were taken from 19 subjects exhibiting active destructive periodontal disease. The predominant cultivable Gram negative species from 50 active sites were compared to 69 inactive sites of comparable pocket depth and attachment level loss. Active disease sites were chosen which showed a significant loss of attachment within a two-month interval. Proportions of Gram negative rods were higher in active periodontal disease sites than in inactive sites. Species which were found to be significantly elevated only in active sites were Bacteroides intermedius, "fusiform" Bacteroides, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Wolinella recta. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis and Eikenella corrodens were found in significantly increased proportions in active sites of some subjects and inactive sites of others.
TI  - Immunoglobulin G response to subgingival gram-negative bacteria in human subjects.
AB  - Serum and gingival crevicular fluid from normal healthy adults and patients with  periodontitis were screened for immunoglobulin G antibodies to antigens from Bacteroides gingivalis 381, Bacteroides intermedius 24, Bacteroides loescheii ATCC 15930, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586, Eikenella corrodens 1073, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522, and Capnocytophaga sp. strain M-12. Immunoglobulin G antibody titers to the antigens were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The antibody levels to B. gingivalis in serum and gingival crevicular fluid were significantly higher in the samples from patients with periodontitis than in samples from healthy individuals. Although there were individual differences within patient groups, a positive correlation (P less than 0.01) was found between the serum immunoglobulin G levels to B. gingivalis and the development of periodontitis. The antibodies to F. nucleatum (P less than 0.05), E. corrodens (P less than 0.05), and A. actinomycetemcomitans were slightly higher in patients with periodontitis than in normal subjects. There were no remarkable differences between the two groups in titers to B. intermedius, B. loescheii, and Capnocytophaga sp.
TI  - Ultrasonic dispersion of pure cultures of plaque bacteria and plaque.
AB  - This study compared the sonic sensitivity of 12 Gram-negative and two Gram-positive bacteria commonly encountered in plaque associated with periodontal diseases. Pure bacterial cultures were grown to standard turbidity, diluted in 1/4 strength prereduced anaerobically sterilized Ringer's solution, and aliquots dispersed for 0-180 s, using an MSE sonic oscillator at 6 micron under 80% N2, 10% H2 and 10% CO2. Viable recoveries were determined on anaerobically cultured trypticase soy 5% blood agar plates. Breakage of T. denticola was assessed by electron microscopy. Gram-positive organisms tolerated sonication better than Gram-negative. A. viscous was more resistant than Strep sanguis. Gram-negative bacteria could be divided into groups according to their sensitivity. Eikenella corrodens was most resistant, followed by F. nucleatum B asaccharolyticus, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, A actinomycetemcomitans, a strain (2097) of Group IV Bacteroides, and B melaninogenicus ss intermedius resisted sonication better than "corroding' Bacteroides and oral Campylobacter. T. denticola, Selenomonas sputigena and Wolinella were most sensitive with viable counts which declined after sonication for 5-10 s. Recoveries from plaque taken from five patients with periodontal diseases increased with sonication time, reaching higher values for suprangingival than for subgingival samples.
