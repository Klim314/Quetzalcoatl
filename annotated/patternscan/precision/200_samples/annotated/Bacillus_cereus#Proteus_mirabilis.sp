TI == antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI == lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB == lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. however, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct of the tomato processing industry. in this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "bull's heart" and "cherry" varieties were analyzed against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus and trichophyton rubrum). regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against gram-positive bacteria, e. faecalis being the most susceptible one (mic: 2.5-10 mg/ml). concerning antifungal activity, "bull's heart" extracts were the most active. in a general way c. albicans was the most susceptible species (mic: 5-10 mg/ml). the chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids, phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.

AB == water-distilled essential oils from leaves and bark of santiria trimera (oliv.) aubrev. (burseraceae) collected in gabon were analyzed using capillary gc-fid and gc-ms. the leaf essential oil, which is described for the first time, was dominated by sesquiterpenes (76.5%), among which alpha-humulene (34.6%) and beta-caryophyllene (14.9%) were the major components. the bark essential oil was almost exclusively monoterpenic, with alpha-pinene (51.5%) and alpha-terpineol (16.8%) as main constituents. the antimicrobial activities of both essential oils were tested against eight gram-positive and three gram-negative bacteria by using agar disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods; anticandidal effect was also tested on different strains of candida albica. the gram-negative bacteria were the less sensitive to the leaf essential oil, which was effective against bacillus cereus and enterococcus faecalis. the bark essential oil was more active and, in particular, exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against proteus mirabilis, which was resistant to the leaf oil. a weak anticandidal effect of both essential oils was observed.

TI == an assessment of the antibacterial activity in larval excretion/secretion of four species of insects recorded in association with corpses, using lucilia sericata meigen as the marker species.
AB == the relative antibacterial activities of excretion/secretion (es) from two carrion-feeding insects, calliphora vicina robineau-desvoidy and dermestes maculatus degeer, and a detritivore, tenebrio molitor linnaeus, were compared to that of lucilia sericata meigen, a species with es of known antibacterial capacity, in order to explore the antimicrobial potential of other carrion and detritivore species. viable counts were used to assess time-kill of es against five bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. antibacterial activity was recorded in all four insect species although t. molitor and d. maculatus were the most effective in controlling growth of p. mirabilis. the blowflies were more effective in controlling a wider range of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the larval es from all species was shown to reduce bacterial growth rate although differences in antibacterial spectrum were noted and the degree of potency varied between the four species. these differences may be explained ecologically by the different colonisation times of each insect species on the corpse. overall, this study demonstrates that research into other carrion-feeding insect species has potential to provide an increased source of antimicrobial chemicals to broaden the range of bacterial species beyond that currently controlled using l. sericata.

TI == antibacterial and antioxidant activities of the essential oil of artemisia echegarayi hieron. (asteraceae).
AB == artemisia echegarayi hieron. (asteraceae) is commonly known in argentina as "ajenjo". many studies report high efficacy of essential oils against food-borne pathogenic bacteria. the antimicrobial activity and minimal inhibitory concentration of a. echegarayi essential oil were evaluated against seven bacterial species of significant importance in food hygiene, by using the disc diffusion assay and the micro-well dilution method, respectively. volatile components of the extract were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and major components were determined. furthermore, the essential oil was tested for its antioxidant activity. the essential oil inhibited the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative tested bacteria, with the exception of proteus mirabilis. a. echegarayi essential oil presented the lowest minimal inhibitory concentration against listeria monocytogenes and bacillus cereus. two terpenes, thujone and camphor, were identified from this essential oil as the principal constituents responsible for antibacterial activity. the oil showed a free radical scavenging activity equivalent to 50% of the reference compound. these preliminary studies showed promising results since this essential oil may provide an alternative to promote its use as a natural food additive.

TI == growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB == the influence of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. a potassium salt of cla (cla-k) was tested against three gram-positive strains ( bacillus cereus , staphylococcus aureus , and streptococcus mutans ) and five gram-negative strains ( pseudomonas aeruginosa , salmonella typhimurium , vibrio parahemolyticus , klebsiella pneumoniae , and proteus mirabilis ). cla-k-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the gram-positive strains. the ic(50) value of cla-k was 0.3 mm for b. cereus, 1.2 mm for s. aureus, and 0.3 mm for s. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mm for k. pneumoniae, 1.2 mm for p. aeruginosa, 1.8 mm for s. typhimurium, 1.8 mm for v. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mm for p. mirabilis. the cla-k delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower cla-k concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. all cells grown in the medium containing cla-k contained cla in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in gram-positive than gram-negative strains. higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (ldh), protein content, and malondialdehyde (mda) content were evident in gram-positive strains than in gram-negative strains. these results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by cla mediated through the lipid peroxidation of cla in the membranes and in the medium.

TI == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast, under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

TI == bioactivity of secoiridoid glycosides from centaurium erythraea.
AB == as part of our on-going search for bioactive compounds from scottish plants, two  secoiridoid glycosides, swertiamarin and sweroside, have been isolated from the aerial parts of centaurium erythraea rafn (family: gentianaceae) by reversed-phase preparative hplc coupled with a photo-diode-array detector. the structures of these compounds were elucidated unambiguously by uv, fabms and extensive 1d and 2d nmr spectroscopic analyses and also by comparing experimental data with literature data. antibacterial, free radical scavenging activities and general toxicity of these glycosides have been assessed. both compounds inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli. while swertiamarin was also active against proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens, sweroside inhibited the growth of staphylococcus epidermidis. swertiamarin and sweroside exhibited significant general toxicity in brine shrimp lethality bioassay and the ld50 values were 8.0 microg/ml and 34 microg/ml, respectively, whereas that of the positive control podophyllotoxin, a well known cytotoxic lignan, was 2.79 microg/ml. chemotaxonomic implications of these compounds in the family gentianaceae have also been discussed briefly.

TI == vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB == objective: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between september 2001 and may 2002 at the cullen eye institute. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/ml, 1.34 +/- 0.34 micro g/ml, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/ml respectively. mean +/- sd sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low mic(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.

AB == the aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. the oil from the aerial parts of lantana xenica mold. (verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. the major constituent of the oil was (e)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene d (6.6 %). the antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of l. xenica inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus and proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (e)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus showed a lower inhibition. the bacteria micrococcus luteus, klebsiella sp., escherichia coli and the yeast candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (e)-caryophyllene.
