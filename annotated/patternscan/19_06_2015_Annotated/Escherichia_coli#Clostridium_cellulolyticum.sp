TI  == structure of d-tagatose 3-epimerase-like protein from methanocaldococcus jannaschii.
AB  == the crystal structure of a d-tagatose 3-epimerase-like protein (mj1311p) encoded  by a hypothetical open reading frame, mj1311, in the genome of the hyperthermophilic archaeon methanocaldococcus jannaschii was determined at a resolution of 2.64 a. the asymmetric unit contained two homologous subunits, and  the dimer was generated by twofold symmetry. the overall fold of the subunit proved to be similar to those of the d-tagatose 3-epimerase from pseudomonas cichorii and the d-psicose 3-epimerases from agrobacterium tumefaciens and clostridium cellulolyticum. however, the situation at the subunit-subunit interface differed substantially from that in d-tagatose 3-epimerase family enzymes. in mj1311p, glu125, leu126 and trp127 from one subunit were found to be  located over the metal-ion-binding site of the other subunit and appeared to contribute to the active site, narrowing the substrate-binding cleft. moreover, the nine residues comprising a trinuclear zinc centre in endonuclease iv were found to be strictly conserved in mj1311p, although a distinct groove involved in dna binding was not present. these findings indicate that the active-site architecture of mj1311p is quite unique and is substantially different from those of d-tagatose 3-epimerase family enzymes and endonuclease iv.

TI  == immobilization of clostridium cellulolyticum d-psicose 3-epimerase on artificial  oil bodies.
AB  == the rare sugar d-psicose possesses several fundamental biological functions. d-psicose 3-epimerase from clostridium cellulolyticum (cc-dpease) has considerable potential for use in d-psicose production. in this study, cc-dpease  was fused to the n terminus of oleosin, a unique structural protein of seed oil bodies and was overexpressed in escherichia coli as a cc-dpease-oleosin fusion protein. after reconstitution into artificial oil bodies (aobs), refolding, purification, and immobilization of the active cc-dpease were simultaneously accomplished. immobilization of cc-dpease on aob increased the optimal temperature but decreased the optimal ph of the enzyme activity. furthermore, the aob-immobilized cc-dpease had a thermal stability and a bioconversion rate similar to those of the free-form enzyme and retained >50% of its initial activity after five cycles of enzyme use. thus, aob-immobilized cc-dpease has potential application in the production of d-psicose at a lower cost than the free-form enzyme.

TI  == characterization of all family-9 glycoside hydrolases synthesized by the cellulosome-producing bacterium clostridium cellulolyticum.
AB  == the genome of clostridium cellulolyticum encodes 13 gh9 enzymes that display seven distinct domain organizations. all but one contain a dockerin module and were formerly detected in the cellulosomes, but only three of them were previously studied (cel9e, cel9g, and cel9m). in this study, the 10 uncharacterized gh9 enzymes were overproduced in escherichia coli and purified, and their activity pattern was investigated in the free state or in cellulosome chimeras with key cellulosomal cellulases. the newly purified gh9 enzymes, including those that share similar organization, all exhibited distinct activity  patterns, various binding capacities on cellulosic substrates, and different synergies with pivotal cellulases in mini-cellulosomes. furthermore, one enzyme (cel9x) was characterized as the first genuine endoxyloglucanase belonging to this family, with no activity on soluble and insoluble celluloses. another gh9 enzyme (cel9v), whose sequence is 78% identical to the cellulosomal cellulase cel9e, was found inactive in the free and complexed states on all tested substrates. the sole noncellulosomal gh9 (cel9w) is a cellulase displaying a broad substrate specificity, whose engineered form bearing a dockerin can act synergistically in minicomplexes. finally, incorporation of all gh9 cellulases in trivalent cellulosome chimera containing cel48f and cel9g generated a mixture of  heterogeneous mini-cellulosomes that exhibit more activity on crystalline cellulose than the best homogeneous tri-functional complex. altogether, our data  emphasize the importance of gh9 diversity in bacterial cellulosomes, confirm that cel9g is the most synergistic gh9 with the major endoprocessive cellulase cel48f, but also identify cel9u as an important cellulosomal component during cellulose depolymerization.

TI  == are cellulosome scaffolding protein cipc and cbm3-containing protein hycp, involved in adherence of clostridium cellulolyticum to cellulose?
AB  == clostridium cellulolyticum, a mesophilic anaerobic bacterium, produces highly active enzymatic complexes called cellulosomes. this strain was already shown to  bind to cellulose, however the molecular mechanism(s) involved is not known. in this context we focused on the gene named hycp, encoding a 250-kda protein of unknown function, containing a family-3 carbohydrate binding module (cbm3) along  with 23 hyaline repeat modules (hyr modules). in the microbial kingdom the gene hycp is only found in c. cellulolyticum and the very close strain recently sequenced clostridium sp bnl1100. its presence in c. cellulolyticum guided us to  analyze its function and its putative role in adhesion of the cells to cellulose. the cbm3 of hycp was shown to bind to crystalline cellulose and was assigned to the cbm3b subfamily. no hydrolytic activity on cellulose was found with a mini-protein displaying representative domains of hycp. a c. cellulolyticum inactivated hycp mutant strain was constructed, and we found that hycp is neither involved in binding of the cells to cellulose nor that the protein has an obvious role in cell growth on cellulose. we also characterized the role of the cellulosome scaffolding protein cipc in adhesion of c. cellulolyticum to cellulose, since cellulosome scaffolding protein has been proposed to mediate binding of other cellulolytic bacteria to cellulose. a second mutant was constructed, where cipc was inactivated. we unexpectedly found that cipc is only  partly involved in binding of c. cellulolyticum to cellulose. other mechanisms for cellulose adhesion may therefore exist in c. cellulolyticum. in addition, no  cellulosomal protuberances were observed at the cellular surface of c. cellulolyticum, what is in contrast to reports from several other cellulosomes producing strains. these findings may suggest that c. cellulolyticum has no dedicated molecular mechanism to aggregate the cellulosomes at the cellular surface.

TI  == size-modulated synergy of cellulase clustering for enhanced cellulose hydrolysis.
AB  == immobilization of enzymes onto nanoparticles for enhanced biocatalytic activity via enzyme clustering is a growing field. in this paper, the effect of nanoparticle size on the hydrolytic activity of artificial cellulosomes was investigated. a simple method based on metal affinity coordination was employed to directly conjugate two enzymes, an endoglucanase cela and an exoglucanase cele, onto cdse-zns core-shell quantum dots (qds) without the use of any chemical modification or linker molecules such as streptavidin. artificial cellulosomes were created by clustering the enzymes onto two different qds (5 and 10 nm) to systematically study the influence of particle size and qd to enzyme ratio on the enhancement in cellulose hydrolysis. our results indicate that enzyme proximity is the most important factor for activity enhancement while the influence of particle size is relatively modest. this detailed understanding will provide insights for the design of other artificial cellulosomes based on nanoclustering  of multiple catalytic domains with significantly enhanced activities, and may be  applicable for designing improved nanobiocatalysts for biofuel production, bioremediation, and drug design.

TI  == [bioconversion of d-fructose to d-allose by novel isomerases].
AB  == rare sugar is a kind of important low-energy monosaccharide that is rarely found  in nature and difficult to synthesize chemically. d-allose, a six-carbon aldose,  is an important rare sugar with unique physiological functions. it is radical scavenging active and can inhibit cancer cell proliferation. to obtain d-allose,  the microorganisms deriving d-psicose 3-epimerase (dpe) and l-rhamnose isomerase  (l-rhi) have drawn intense attention. in this paper, dpe from clostridium cellulolyticum h10 was cloned and expressed in bacillus subtilis, and l-rhi from  bacillus subtilis 168 was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). the obtained crude dpe and l-rhi were then purified through a histrap hp affinity chromatography column and an anion-exchange chromatography column. the purified dpe and l-rhi were employed for the production of rare sugars at last, in which dpe catalyzed d-fructose into d-psicose while l-rhi converted d-psicose into d-allose. the conversion of d-fructose into d-psicose by dpe was 27.34%, and the  conversion of d-psicose into d-allose was 34.64%.

TI  == self-assembled amyloid-like oligomeric-cohesin scaffoldin for augmented protein display on the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface.
AB  == in this study, a molecular self-assembly strategy to develop a novel protein scaffold for amplifying the extent and variety of proteins displayed on the surface of saccharomyces cerevisiae is presented. the cellulosomal scaffolding protein cohesin and its upstream hydrophilic domain (hd) were genetically fused with the yeast ure2p n-terminal fibrillogenic domain consisting of residues 1 to  80 (ure2p(1-80)). the resulting ure2p(1-80)-hd-cohesin fusion protein was successfully expressed in escherichia coli to produce self-assembled supramolecular nanofibrils that serve as a novel protein scaffold displaying multiple copies of functional cohesin domains. the amyloid-like property of the nanofibrils was confirmed via thioflavin t staining and atomic force microscopy.  these cohesin nanofibrils attached themselves, via a green fluorescent protein (gfp)-dockerin fusion protein, to the cell surface of s. cerevisiae engineered to display a gfp-nanobody. the excess cohesin units on the nanofibrils provide ample sites for binding to dockerin fusion proteins, as exemplified using an mcherry-dockerin fusion protein as well as the clostridium cellulolyticum cela endoglucanase. more than a 24-fold increase in mcherry fluorescence and an 8-fold increase in cela activity were noted when the cohesin nanofibril scaffold-mediated yeast display was used, compared to using yeast display with gfp-cohesin that contains only a single copy of cohesin. self-assembled supramolecular cohesin nanofibrils created by fusion with the yeast ure2p fibrillogenic domain provide a versatile protein scaffold that expands the utility of yeast cell surface display.

TI  == cloning, expression, and characterization of a d-psicose 3-epimerase from clostridium cellulolyticum h10.
AB  == the noncharacterized protein acl75304 encoded by the gene ccel_0941 from clostridium cellulolyticum h10 (atcc 35319), previously proposed as the xylose isomerase domain protein tim barrel, was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli . the expressed enzyme was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography with electrophoretic homogeneity and then characterized as d-psicose 3-epimerase. the  enzyme was strictly metal-dependent and showed a maximal activity in the presence of co(2+). the optimum ph and temperature for enzyme activity were 55 degrees c and ph 8.0. the half-lives for the enzyme at 60 degrees c were 6.8 h and 10 min when incubated with and without co(2+), respectively, suggesting that this enzyme was extremely thermostable in the presence of co(2+) but readily inactivated without metal ion. the michaelis-menten constant (k(m)), turnover number (k(cat)), and catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/k(m)) values of the enzyme for substrate d-psicose were estimated to be 17.4 mm, 3243.4 min(-1), and 186.4 mm min(-1), respectively. the enzyme carried out the epimerization of d-fructose to  d-psicose with a conversion yield of 32% under optimal conditions, suggesting that the enzyme is a potential d-psicose producer.

TI  == a whole cell biocatalyst for cellulosic ethanol production from dilute acid-pretreated corn stover hydrolyzates.
AB  == in this research, a recombinant whole cell biocatalyst was developed by expressing three cellulases from clostridium cellulolyticum--endoglucanase (cel5a), exoglucanase (cel9e), and beta-glucosidase--on the surface of the escherichia coli ly01. the modified strain is identified as ly01/pre1h-aeb. the cellulases were displayed on the surface of the cell by fusing with an anchor protein, pgsa. the developed whole cell biocatalyst was used for single-step ethanol fermentation using the phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose (pasc) and the dilute acid-pretreated corn stover. ethanol production was 3.59 +/- 0.15 g/l using 10 g/l of pasc, which corresponds to a theoretical yield of 95.4 +/- 0.15%. ethanol production was 0.30 +/- 0.02 g/l when 1 g/l equivalent of glucose in the  cellulosic fraction of the dilute sulfuric acid-pretreated corn stover (pcs) was  fermented for 84 h. a total of 0.71 +/- 0.12 g/l ethanol was produced in 48 h when the pcs was fermented in the simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation mode using the hemicellulosic (1 g/l of total soluble sugar) and  as well as the cellulosic (1 g/l of glucose equivalent) parts of pcs. in a control experiment, 0.48 g/l ethanol was obtained from 1 g/l of hemicellulosic pcs. it was concluded that the whole cell biocatalyst could convert both cellulosic and hemicellulosic substrates into ethanol in a single reactor. the developed c. cellulolyticum-e. coli whole cell biocatalyst also overcame the incompatible temperature problem of the frequently reported fungal-yeast systems.

TI  == functional assembly of minicellulosomes on the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface for cellulose hydrolysis and ethanol production.
AB  == we demonstrated the functional display of a miniscaffoldin on the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface consisting of three divergent cohesin domains from clostridium thermocellum (t), clostridium cellulolyticum (c), and ruminococcus flavefaciens (f). incubation with escherichia coli lysates containing an endoglucanase (cela) fused with a dockerin domain from c. thermocellum (at), an exoglucanase (cele) from c. cellulolyticum fused with a dockerin domain from the  same species (ec), and an endoglucanase (celg) from c. cellulolyticum fused with  a dockerin domain from r. flavefaciens (gf) resulted in the assembly of a functional minicellulosome on the yeast cell surface. the displayed minicellulosome retained the synergistic effect for cellulose hydrolysis. when a  beta-glucosidase (bgla) from c. thermocellum tagged with the dockerin from r. flavefaciens was used in place of gf, cells displaying the new minicellulosome exhibited significantly enhanced glucose liberation and produced ethanol directly from phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose. the final ethanol concentration of 3.5 g/liter was 2.6-fold higher than that obtained by using the same amounts of added purified cellulases. the overall yield was 0.49 g of ethanol produced per g of carbohydrate consumed, which corresponds to 95% of the theoretical value. this result confirms that simultaneous and synergistic saccharification and fermentation of cellulose to ethanol can be efficiently accomplished with a yeast strain displaying a functional minicellulosome containing all three required cellulolytic enzymes.

TI  == towards designer cellulosomes in clostridia: mannanase enrichment of the cellulosomes produced by clostridium cellulolyticum.
AB  == the man5k gene of clostridium cellulolyticum was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli. this gene encodes a 424-amino-acid preprotein composed of an n-terminal leader peptide, followed by a dockerin module and a c-terminal catalytic module belonging to family 5 of the glycosyl hydrolases. mature man5k displays 62% identity with mana from clostridium cellulovorans. two forms of the  protein were purified from e. coli; one form corresponds to the full-length enzyme (45 kda), and a truncated form (39 kda) lacks the n-terminal dockerin module. both forms exhibit the same typical family 5 mannanase substrate preference; they are very active with the galactomannan locust bean gum, and the  more galacto-substituted guar gum molecules are degraded less. the truncated form, however, displays fourfold-higher activity with galactomannans than the full-length enzyme. man5k was successfully overproduced in c. cellulolyticum by using expression vectors. the trans-produced protein was found to be incorporated into the cellulosomes and became one of the major enzymatic components. modified  cellulosomes displayed 20-fold-higher specific activities than control fractions  on galactomannan substrates, whereas the specific activity on crystalline cellulose was reduced by 20%. this work clearly showed that the composition of the cellulosomes is obviously regulated by the relative amounts of the enzymes produced and that this composition can be engineered in clostridia by structural  gene cloning.

TI  == electrotransformation studies in clostridium cellulolyticum.
AB  == electropermeabilization of clostridium cellulolyticum was optimized using atp leakage assays. electrotransformation was then performed under optimized conditions (6 to 7.5 kv x cm(-1) field strength applied during 5 ms to a mixture  containing methylated plasmids and late exponential phase cell suspensions (10 molecules:1 cell) in a sucrose-containing buffer). transformants were only obtained when 7 or 7.5 kv x cm(-1) pulses were applied. transformation efficiencies evaluated from the growth curves of transformed cells were between 10(5) and 10(7) transformants per microgram of plasmid dna for five different replicon-based plasmids. restriction nuclease digestion patterns of pjir418 purified from transformed clostridia and escherichia coli were indistinguishable, indicating that heterologous dna was structurally stable in the clostridium strain. copy numbers of 130, 70 and 10 were estimated from purification yield for pctc1, pknt19 and pjir418, respectively.

TI  == gene transfer to clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319.
AB  == although much is known about the bacterial cellulosome and its various protein components, their contributions to bacterial growth on cellulose and the process  of cellulolysis in vivo cannot currently be assessed. to remedy this, the authors have developed gene transfer techniques for clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319. firstly, transfer of tn1545 has been obtained using an enterococcus faecalis donor. secondly, incp-mediated conjugative mobilization of plasmids from escherichia coli donors has also been achieved. the yield of transconjugants in both cases was low and was probably limited by the suboptimal growth conditions that must of necessity be employed for the co-culture of oligotrophic c. cellulolyticum with copiotrophic donors. a restriction endonuclease was detected  in crude extracts of c. cellulolyticum. this enzyme, named cce:i, is an isoschizomer of msp:i (hpa:ii). electro-transformation was employed to establish  plasmids containing the replication functions of pamss1 (en. faecalis), pim13 (bacillus subtilis), pcb102 (clostridium butyricum), pip404 (clostridium perfringens) and pwv01 (lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris) in c. cellulolyticum. transformants were only obtained if the dna was appropriately methylated on the external c of the sequence 5'-ccgg-3' using either bsu:fi methylase in vivo or msp:i methylase in vitro. plasmids based on the pamss1 and pim13 replicons were more stably maintained than one based on the pcb102 replicon. selection of transformants on solid medium led to low apparent transformation efficiencies (approx. 10(2) transformants per microg dna) which might, in part, reflect the low plating efficiency of the organism. selection of transformants in liquid medium led to a higher apparent yield of transformants (between 10(5) and 10(7) transformants per microg dna). the methods developed here will pave the way for functional analysis of the various cellulosome components in vivo.

TI  == cloning, expression and characterization of a family 48 exocellulase, cel48a, from thermobifida fusca.
AB  == the gene for a 104-kda exocellulase, cel48a, formerly e6, was cloned from thermobifida fusca into escherichia coli and streptomyces lividans. the dna sequence revealed a type ii cellulose-binding domain at the n-terminus, followed  by a fniii-like domain and ending with a glycosyl hydrolase family 48 catalytic domain. the enzyme and catalytic domain alone were each expressed in and purified from s. lividans and had very low catalytic activity on swollen cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, bacterial microcrystalline cellulose and filter paper. however, in synergistic assays on filter paper, the addition of cel48a to a balanced mixture of t. fusca endocellulase and exocellulase increased the specific activity from 7.9 to 11.7 micromol cellobiose.min-1.ml-1, more than 15-fold higher than any single enzyme alone. cel48a retained > 50% of its maximum activity from ph 5 to 9 and from 40 to 60 degrees c. using swissmodel, the amino-acid sequence of the cel48acd was modeled to the known structure of clostridium cellulolyticum celf. family 48 enzymes are remarkably homologous at 35% identity for all their catalytic domains and some of the properties of the 10 members are discussed.

TI  == properties of exgs, a gene for a major subunit of the clostridium cellulovorans cellulosome.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of p70, one of the three major subunits of the clostridium cellulovorans cellulosome, has been determined. the gene designated as exgs (genbank accession no. u34793) consists of 2112 bp and encodes a protein  containing 703 amino acids with a molecular mass of 77.7 kda. exgs has a putative signal peptide sequence of 32 amino acids. the n-terminal region is separated from the c-terminal region by a short-pro-thr-pro linker. the c-terminal region of exgs contains a duplicated sequence (ds), each sequence consisting of 22 amino acids. exgs, located 67 bp downstream of cbpa in the chromosome, is immediately upstream of a gene encoding a family 9 type endoglucanase that we have designated as engh. this gene cluster to date consists of rega-cbpa-exgs-engh. recombinant exgs (rexgs) containing no signal peptide was expressed in e. coli. the rexgs actively digested several forms of cellulose, including avicel, sigmacell101, crystalline cellulose, and xylan, but not carboxymethyl cellulose (cmc). cellotetraose was the smallest oligosaccharide substrate for rexgs. the enzymatic studies indicated that exgs was an exoglucanase and had some properties similar to that of cels from c. thermocellum and celf from c.cellulolyticum. an exoglucanase has now been found to be a component of the c. cellulovorans cellulosome as well as the previously reported endoglucanases.

TI  == celg from clostridium cellulolyticum: a multidomain endoglucanase acting efficiently on crystalline cellulose.
AB  == the gene coding for celg, a family 9 cellulase from clostridium cellulolyticum, was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli. four different forms of the protein were genetically engineered, purified, and studied: celgl (the entire form of celg), celgcat1 (the catalytic domain of celg alone), celgcat2 (celgcat1  plus 91 amino acids at the beginning of the cellulose binding domain [cbd]), and  gst-cbd(celg) (the cbd of celg fused to glutathione s-transferase). the biochemical properties of celg were compared with those of cela, an endoglucanase from c. cellulolyticum which was previously studied. celg, like cela, was found to have an endo cutting mode of activity on carboxymethyl cellulose (cmc) but exhibited greater activity on crystalline substrates (bacterial microcrystalline  cellulose and avicel) than cela. as observed with cela, the presence of the nonhydrolytic miniscaffolding protein (minicipc1) enhanced the activity of celg on phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (pasc), but to a lesser extent. the absence  of the cbd led to the complete inactivation of the enzyme. the abilities of celg  and gst-cbd(celg) to bind various substrates were also studied. although the entire enzyme is able to bind to crystalline cellulose at a limited number of sites, the chimeric protein gst-cbd(celg) does not bind to either of the tested substrates (avicel and pasc). the lack of independence between the two domains and the weak binding to cellulose suggest that this cbd-like domain may play a special role and be either directly or indirectly involved in the catalytic reaction.

TI  == the processive endocellulase celf, a major component of the clostridium cellulolyticum cellulosome: purification and characterization of the recombinant  form.
AB  == the recombinant form of the cellulase celf of clostridium cellulolyticum, tagged  by a c-terminal histine tail, was overproduced in escherichia coli. the fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on a ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column. the intact form of celf (mr, 79,000) was rapidly degraded at the c terminus, giving a shorter stable form, called truncated celf (mr, 71,000). both  the entire and the truncated purified forms degraded amorphous cellulose (kcat =  42 and 30 min(-1), respectively) and microcrystalline cellulose (kcat = 13 and 10 min(-1), respectively). the high ratio of soluble reducing ends to insoluble reducing ends released by truncated celf from amorphous cellulose showed that celf is a processive enzyme. nevertheless, the diversity of the cellodextrins released by truncated celf from phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose at the beginning of the reaction indicated that the enzyme might randomly hydrolyze beta-1,4 bonds. this hypothesis was supported by viscosimetric measurements and by the finding that celf and the endoglucanase cela are able to degrade some of the same cellulose sites. celf was therefore called a processive endocellulase. the results of immunoblotting analysis showed that celf was associated with the cellulosome of c. cellulolyticum. it was identified as one of the three major components of cellulosomes. the ability of the entire form of celf to interact with cipc, the cellulosome integrating protein, or mini-cipc1, a recombinant truncated form of cipc, was monitored by interaction western blotting (immunoblotting) and by binding assays using a biacore biosensor-based analytical system.

TI  == molecular study and overexpression of the clostridium cellulolyticum celf cellulase gene in escherichia coli.
AB  == the celf-encoding sequence was isolated from clostridium cellulolyticum genomic dna using the inverse pcr technique. the gene lies between cipc (the gene encoding the cellulosome scaffolding protein) and celc (coding for the endoglucanase c) in the large cel cluster of this mesophilic cellulolytic clostridium species. comparisons between the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature celf (693 amino acids, molecular mass 77626) and those of other beta-glycanases showed that this enzyme belongs to the recently proposed family l of cellulases (family 48 of glycosyl hydrolases). the protein was overproduced in escherichia coli using the t7 expression system. it formed both cytoplasmic and periplasmic inclusion bodies when induction was performed at 37 degrees c. surprisingly, the protein synthesized from the cytoplasmic production vector was  degraded in the ion protease-deficient strain bl21(de3). the induction conditions were optimized with regard to the concentration of inductor, cell density, and temperature and time of induction in order to overproduce an active periplasmic protein (celfp) which was both soluble and stable. it was collected using the osmotic shock method. the enzymic degradation of various cellulosic substrates by celfp was studied. celfp degraded swollen avicel more efficiently than substituted soluble cm-cellulose or crystalline avicel and was not active on xylan. its activity is therefore quite different from that of endoglucanases, which are most active on cm-cellulose.

AB  == the 5' end of the cipc gene, coding for the n-terminal part of cipc, the scaffolding protein of clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319, was cloned and sequenced. it encodes a 586-amino-acid peptide, including several domains: a cellulose-binding domain, a hydrophilic domain, and two hydrophobic domains (cohesin domains). sequence alignments showed that the n terminus of cipc and cbpa of c. cellulovorans atcc 35296 have the same organization. the mini-cipc polypeptide, containing a cellulose-binding domain, hydrophilic domain 1, and cohesin domain 1, was overexpressed in escherichia coli and purified. the interaction between endoglucanase cela, with (cela2) and without (cela3) the characteristic clostridial c-terminal domain called the duplicated-segment or dockerin domain, and the mini-cipc polypeptide was monitored by two different methods: the interaction western blotting (immunoblotting) method and binding assays with biotin-labeled protein. among the various forms of cela (cela2, cela3, and an intermediary form containing only part of the duplicated segment),  only cela2 was found to interact with cohesin domain 1 of cipc. the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of the cela2-mini-cipc complex was 7 x 10(-9)m, which indicates that there exists a high affinity between these two proteins.

TI  == purification and characterization of endoglucanase c from clostridium cellulolyticum. catalytic comparison with endoglucanase a.
AB  == an escherichia coli clone was constructed to overproduce endoglucanase c (celccc) from clostridium cellulolyticum. this construction made it easier to isolate the  enzyme but, as observed in the case of endoglucanase a (celcca) from the same organism, the purification led to the isolation of two forms of the cellulase differing in their molecular masses, 48 kda and 41 kda. n-terminal sequence analysis of both purified enzymes showed that the shorter form was probably the result of partial proteolysis near the cooh-extremity. the difference in mass indicated that the shorter protein lacks the c-terminal reiterated domains (20-24-amino-acid twice-repeated sequences). these particular domains are characteristic of clostridial cellulases acting on cellulose by the mean of cellulosomal particles. biochemical and enzymic studies were performed on each form of celccc, and revealed that their temperature and ph optima were identical, but their catalytic parameters were quite different. furthermore, the differences of enzymic behavior observed between the two forms of celccc are almost identical to those already noted in the case of the two forms of celcca. the stereoselectivity of the reaction catalysed by celccc and celcca was determined using proton nmr spectroscopy; celccc acts by configuration inversion, whereas celcca acts by configuration retention. the degradation patterns on cellodextrins (ranging from cellotriose to cellohexaose) and chromophoric cellodextrins (from p-nitrophenyl-cellobiose to p-nitrophenyl-cellopentaose) were also investigated in both forms of celccc and celcca. it emerged that the natural cellodextrins degradation patterns of celccc and celcca were very similar but the utilization of p-nitrophenyl-cellodextrins showed the existence of considerable differences between these two endoglucanases in terms of cleavage-site position and catalytic parameters. celccc and celcca were found not to act synergistically on the tested substrates.

AB  == the endoglucanase gene, celccd, of clostridium cellulolyticum has been expressed  in escherichia coli. multiple active polypeptides were detected in the e. coli cells. the relative molecular mass (m(r)) of two major active polypeptides were 56,000 (d56) and 38,000 (d38), which were smaller than the deduced m(r) of the mature protein (63,401). d56 and d38 were purified from the periplasmic fraction. the n-terminal sequences of the two purified polypeptides were identical to that  of the mature endoglucanase (ala-ile-asn-ser-gln-asp-met-val---) deduced from the nucleotide sequence. these data indicated that these polypeptides were produced by processing the original mature protein in the c-terminal region. the enzymatic properties of these two polypeptides were very similar, except that the specific  activity of d38 was 2-3.5-fold higher than that of d56, and d38 was more heat stable than d56.

TI  == characterization and comparison of clostridium cellulovorans endoglucanases-xylanases engb and engd hyperexpressed in escherichia coli.
AB  == by the use of a t7 expression system, endoglucanases-xylanases engb and engd from clostridium cellulovorans were hyperexpressed and purified from escherichia coli. the two enzymes demonstrated both endoglucanase and xylanase activities. the substrate specificities of both endoglucanases were similar except that engd had  four-times-greater p-nitrophenyl beta-1,4-cellobiosidase activity. the two proteins were very homologous (80%) up to the pro-thr-thr region which divided the protein into -nh2- and -cooh-terminals. the -cooh- region of engb has high homology to the endoglucanases and a xylanase from clostridium thermocellum and to an endoglucanase from clostridium cellulolyticum and did not show strong binding to cellulose (avicel). however, the -cooh- region of engd, which had homology to the cellulose-binding domains of cellulomonas fimi exo- and endoglucanases and to pseudomonas fluorescens endoglucanase, demonstrated binding ability to cellulose even when the domain was fused to the n-terminal domain of engb. by probing the avicel-purified cellulase complex (f8) with anti-engb and anti-engd antibodies, both engb and engd were shown to be present on the cellulase complex of c. cellulovorans. many proteins homologous to engb and engd  were also present on the complex.

TI  == characterization of endoglucanase a from clostridium cellulolyticum.
AB  == a construction was carried out to obtain a high level of expression in escherichia coli of the gene celcca, coding for the endoglucanase a from clostridium cellulolyticum (egcca). the enzyme was purified in two forms with different molecular weights, 51,000 and 44,000. the smaller protein was probably  the result of proteolysis, although great care was taken to prevent this process  from occurring. evidence was found for the loss of the conserved reiterated domains which are characteristic of c. thermocellum and c. cellulolyticum cellulases. the two forms were extensively studied, and it was demonstrated that  although they had the same ph and temperature optima, they differed in their catalytic properties. the truncated protein gave the more efficient catalytic parameters on carboxymethyl cellulose and showed improved endoglucanase characteristics, whereas the intact enzyme showed truer cellulase characteristics. the possible role of clostridial reiterated domains in the hydrolytic activity toward crystalline cellulose is discussed.

TI  == overproduction of a clostridium cellulolyticum endoglucanase by mutant strains of escherichia coli.
AB  == we have studied the expression of an endoglucanase from clostridium cellulolyticum in mutant strains of escherichia coli that overproduce haemolysin. when these mutants were transformed with plasmids encoding the endoglucanase, they showed a significantly enhanced endoglucanase activity, compared to transformed parental strains. among the mutants, strain hha-2 showed the highest  production. we have identified the endoglucanase gene product synthesized in e. coli hha-2/pbp8 and detected an increased amount of the enzyme parallel to the increase of endoglucanase activity. this was mainly localized in the periplasm and only a small percentage of it was found in the culture fluid.

TI  == cloning and expression of two cellulase genes of clostridium cellulolyticum in escherichia coli.
AB  == two cellulase genes isolated from clostridium cellulolyticum strain atcc3519 were cloned in escherichia coli using plasmid pacyc184. plasmids pb52 and pb43 were isolated from the transformants producing carboxymethylcellulase (cmcase) and the two cloned cmcase-coding genes were found to be included in two ecori fragments of 5.7 kb and 2.6 kb, respectively. these two genes showed no homology. the cmcase-coding genes were found to be contained in a 1.8-kb kpni-hindiii fragment  and a 2.05-kb hindiii-pvuii fragment of the dna donor strain. expression of these genes in e. coli was found not to depend on their orientation in the cloning vector. hybridization experiments between these two fragments and clostridium thermocellum ncib10682 dna fragments carrying genes cela, celb, celc and celd were carried out and some homologies were detected.
