TI  == a microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. methods: samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, tannerella forsythia, enterococcus faecalis, neisseria  mucosa, campylobacter gracilis, and prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp  space cases they were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, n. mucosa, e. faecalis, e. saburreum, c. gracilis, and porphyromonas gingivalis. counts of f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, campylobacter sputigena, capnocytophaga showae, treponema socrenskii,  porphyromonas endodontalis, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (p < .05). conclusions: the data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and  an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp  space cases.

TI  == evaluation of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals. methods: the study was conducted with 49 alcoholic and 49 non-alcoholic males of the philippe  pinel institute, rio de janeiro, brazil. the subjects were selected by convenience and two criteria were used to diagnose alcohol dependence: the cage (cut-down, annoyed, guilt, eyes-opener) questionnaire and the international statistical classification of diseases, 10th edition (who). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 4 sites, 2 with probing depth (pd) >/= 4 mm and 2 sites with pd < 4 mm. the presence and levels of 45 bacterial taxa were analysed  using the checkerboard technique. results: the prevalence of bacterial species was not significantly different between groups. however, alcoholics showed significantly higher mean counts of aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis (adjusted p < 0.001). moreover, alcoholics harboured significantly higher mean levels of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, f. nuc. nucleatum, gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, p. gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii, and tannerella forsythia at sites with pd < 4 mm or >/= 4 mm compared to non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). of interest, shallow sites of alcoholics presented  significantly higher mean levels of f. nuc. vincentii, f. nuc nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia than sites with pd >/= 4 mm of non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). conclusions: alcoholics and non-alcoholics present a diverse and complex  microbiota; however, alcoholics harbour significantly higher levels of periodontopathic species in the subgingival microbiota than non-alcoholics.

TI  == microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development in the absence of oral hygiene in periodontal health and disease.
AB  == aim: to monitor microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development. materials  and methods: supra- and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28  teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects at baseline and immediately after tooth cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants during 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. species counts were averaged within subjects at each time point. significant differences in the counts between healthy and periodontitis subjects were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: the total supra- and subgingival counts were significantly higher in periodontitis on entry and reached or exceeded the baseline values after day 2. supragingival counts of veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and neisseria mucosa increased from 2 to 7 days. subgingival counts were greater  for actinomyces, green and orange complex species. significant differences between groups in supragingival counts occurred for 17 of 41 species at entry, 0  at day 7; for subgingival plaque, these values were 39/41 taxa at entry, 17/41 at day 7. conclusions: supragingival plaque re-development was similar in periodontitis and health, but subgingival species recolonization was more marked  in periodontitis.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  == aim: to examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. methodology: samples were collected by means of a size 15 h-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: the species found at the highest levels and prevalence were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, porphyromonas gingivalis,  veillonella parvula, enterococcus faecalis, campylobacter gracilis and neisseria  mucosa. total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: p > 0.05). e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus, capnocytophaga sputigena and capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (mann-whitney test, p < 0.05). higher levels of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. leptotrichia buccalis (or = 1.83; ci 95%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (or = 2.15; ci 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. conclusions: primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species.  specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.

TI  == improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  == background: terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. however, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) origins  is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. to minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. methods: genescan-1000 rox was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (mw) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (fam) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16s recombinant rna gene of porphyromonas gingivalis. using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of  the conventional method. microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new mw size definition. bacterial species were assigned to peaks using  trfma, a web-based tool for t-rflp analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. results: using the new size definition, the average  sizing error for 40 t-rfs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. more than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by t-rflp. conclusion: the size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the t-rflp analysis. this provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == infection at titanium implants with or without a clinical diagnosis of inflammation.
AB  == objectives: to assess the microbiota at implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis, implant mucositis, or being clinically healthy. material and methods: clinical and microbiological data were collected from 213 subjects (mean age: 65.7+/-14) with 976 implants in function (mean: 10.8 years, sd+/-1.5). forty species were identified by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: implant mean % plaque score was 41.8+/-32.4%. periodontitis defined by bone loss was found in 44.9% of subjects. implant mucositis was diagnosed in 59% and peri-implantitis in 14.9% of all cases. neisseria mucosa, fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, f. nucleatum sp. polymorphum, and capnocytophaga sputigena dominated the implant sub-mucosal microbiota and the sub-gingival microbiota at tooth sites. implant probing pocket depth at the implant site with the deepest probing depth was correlated with levels of eikenella corrodens (r=0.16, p<0.05), the levels of f. nucleatum sp. vincentii (r=0.15, p<0.05), porphyromonas gingivalis (r=0.14, p<0.05), and micromonas micros (r=0.17, p=0.01). e. corrodens was found in higher levels at implants with mucositis compared with implant health (p<0.05). subjects who lost teeth due to periodontitis had higher yields of f. nucleatum sp. vincentii (p<0.02) and n. mucosa (p<0.05). independent of implant status subjects with teeth had higher levels of p. gingivalis (p<0.05), and leptotrichia buccalis (p<0.05). conclusions: at implant sites studied, few bacteria differed by whether subjects were dentate or not or by implant status.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis subjects from different geographic locations.
AB  == background: most clinical studies assume that the subgingival microbiota is similar from one geographic location to another. the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the composition of the subgingival microbiota in chronic periodontitis subjects from four countries. method: subjects with chronic periodontitis (n, sweden=101; usa=115; brazil=58; chile=26) were recruited. subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bleeding on probing (bop), suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) at six sites per  tooth. subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples=6036). % dna probe counts comprised by each species was determined for each site and averaged across sites  in each subject. significance of differences in proportions of each species among countries was determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status. p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: on average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in the four countries. thirteen species differed significantly in adjusted mean proportions among countries even after adjusting for multiple comparisons. porphyromonas gingivalis, one species that differed in proportions among countries, comprised adjusted means of 7.5, 11.9, 1.6 and 6.6% of the microbiota  in subjects from brazil, chile, sweden and usa (p<0.001), while mean proportions  of treponema denticola were 6.7, 4.2, 0.8 and 2.3, respectively (p<0.001). in contrast, a key periodontal pathogen, tannerella forsythensis, exhibited mean proportions ranging from 6.2-8.5% and did not differ significantly among countries. besides these species, prominent species in brazil were actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 (8.4%, 7.2%) and prevotella intermedia (6.5%); in  chile, prevotella melaninogenica (6.4%) and neisseria mucosa (5.3%); in sweden a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (8.4%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (7.1%) and peptostreptococcus micros (5.0%); in usa a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (7.5%), p. intermedia (6.8%) and c. gingivalis (6.1%). conclusions: the microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from chronic periodontitis subjects in four countries showed surprisingly marked differences. these differences persisted after adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status.

TI  == distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.
