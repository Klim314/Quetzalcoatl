TI  == gram stains: a resource for retrospective analysis of bacterial pathogens in clinical studies.
AB  == we demonstrate the feasibility of using qpcr on dna extracted from vaginal gram stain slides to estimate the presence and relative abundance of specific bacterial pathogens. we first tested gram stained slides spiked with a mix of 10(8) cfu/ml of escherichia coli and 10(5) cfu/ml of lactobacillus acidophilus. primers were designed for amplification of total and species-specific bacterial dna based on 16s ribosomal gene regions. sample dna was pre-amplified with nearly full length 16s rdna ribosomal gene fragment, followed by quantitative pcr with genera and species-specific 16s rdna primers. pre-amplification pcr increased the bacterial amounts; relative proportions of escherichia coli and lactobacillus recovered from spiked slides remained unchanged. we applied this method to forty  two archived gram stained slides available from a clinical trial of cerclage in pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth. we found a high correlation between nugent scores based on bacterial morphology of lactobacillus, gardenerella and mobiluncus and amounts of quantitative pcr estimated genus specific dna (rrn copies) from gram stained slides. testing of a convenience sample of eight paired vaginal swabs and gram stains freshly collected from healthy women found similar  qpcr generated estimates of lactobacillus proportions from gram stained slides and vaginal swabs. archived gram stained slides collected from large scale epidemiologic and clinical studies represent a valuable, untapped resource for research on the composition of bacterial communities that colonize human mucosal  surfaces.

TI  == quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in port-a-cul and copan transport systems.
AB  == transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. in this study, the port-a-cul transport system and the copan  transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and  anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. combination i contained candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, lactobacillus crispatus, and staphylococcus aureus. combination ii  contained lactobacillus iners, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, mobiluncus curtisii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis. duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees c. both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees c than at 24 degrees c. prevotella bivia and prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. however, at 24 degrees c, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in copan transport  medium than when they were stored in port-a-cul transport medium for 96 h (p < 0.002). some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees c for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group b streptococci and candida albicans, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. organisms in copan medium than in port-a-cul medium was observed (p < 0.002). at room temperature, the port-a-cul system is superior to the copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == comparative in-vitro and in-vivo activity of am-1155 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of am-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin  and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. although  am-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the bacteroides fragilis group  and prevotella bivia (mic90s > or =3.13 mg/ml), 76% of the b. fragilis strains tested were inhibited at am-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/l. am-1155 was highly  active against prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and mobiluncus spp. (mic90s < or =0.39 mg/l). an in-vivo study using a mixed infection with am-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible  b. fragilis and escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. am-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective only against e. coli. these results correlated well to the higher pouch levels of am-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. clostridium difficile overgrowth was found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 days dosing, but not in am-1155-treated mice. these results suggest that the clinical efficacy of am-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic bacteria except for the b. fragilis group and p. bivia should be evaluated further.

TI  == bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == one hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (bv) were enrolled in this study. the bacteriological epidemiology of bv and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of bv were investigated. the epidemiology of bv was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (mtn), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (cldm) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. the major organisms occurring were streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus species, bacteroides species, prevotella species, and mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis. the therapeutic efficacy of cldm cream on bv appeared  to be preferable to oral mtn from clinical and bacteriological aspects. the clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of mtn and cldm in the treatment of bv suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms  in patients with bv.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == normal vaginal aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of the rhesus macaque (macaca mulatta).
AB  == the most common bacterial species isolated from the vaginas of 37 healthy rhesus  macaques were streptococcus viridans, coagulase negative staphylococcus, mobiluncus curtisii ss. curtisii, corynebacterium renale-like organisms, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, gardnerella-like organisms, and other corynebacterium species. the vaginal flora of the rhesus macaque differs from that previously reported for five other primate species. a two-year retrospective review of clinical cases of vaginitis and metritis found escherichia coli and coagulase positive staphylococci to be the most common pathogens isolated.

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == chemotaxis inhibition by gardnerella vaginalis and succinate producing vaginal anaerobes: composition of vaginal discharge associated with g vaginalis.
AB  == the influence of six succinate producing vaginal anaerobes and gardnerella vaginalis on the chemotactic activity of granulocytes was studied by the under agarose method. g vaginalis, mobiluncus species, and three gram negative anaerobes elicited hardly any response, but peptostreptococcus productus showed clear positive chemotaxis, as did the escherichia coli strain used as a control.  inhibition of the chemotactic response of white blood cells was found with all strains, but the high succinate producers from the genus bacteroides showed the most pronounced effect. the inhibition of chemotaxis by succinate producing anaerobes in the pathogenesis of non-specific vaginitis (nsv) is postulated, and  b ureolyticus or mobiluncus spp, rather than g vaginalis, are suggested as possible causes of nsv.

TI  == [cervico-vaginal pathogens and contraception: microbiological observations].
AB  == the authors relate the results about 172 vaginal and cervical swabs, in women with or without oral/local (iud) contraception, with or without vaginosis/vaginitis. gardnerella vaginalis was always prevalent; the authors observed an high correlation between cervical iud and vaginal gardnerella, more than iud and cervical chlamydia trachomatis. bacterial associations in gardnerella vaginalis (mobiluncus, obligate anaerobes) are related; incidence of  candida and trichomonas vaginalis are reported; correlation between these microbial agents and contraception are discussed.

TI  == activity of pefloxacin and thirteen other antimicrobial agents in vitro against isolates from hospital and genitourinary infections.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of the quinolone derivative pefloxacin was compared with that of three other quinolones, five beta-lactam antibiotics and three aminoglycosides against 367 isolates from hospital patients and from out-patients with genitourinary infections. mic90 of pefloxacin and norfloxacin for each strain was the same; that of ciprofloxacin was a little lower. all strains except escherichia coli were resistant to nalidixic acid. pefloxacin was highly active against staphylococcus aureus (39 strains; mic90 1.0 mg/l) and most strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (56; 4 mg/l), esch. coli (50; 0.25 mg/l), other  enterobacteria (33; 1.0 mg/l) and pseudomonas aeruginosa 6; 0.25 mg/l). with bacteroides spp. (total 78; 64 mg/l), the fragilis group (23) and the fusobacteria (19) were resistant, but the melaninogenicus-oralis group (31; range 0.06- greater than 64 mg/l) and b. ureolyticus (22; 0.125- greater than 64 mg/l)  gave variable results. amongst genitourinary isolates, neisseria gonorrhoeae (15) and haemophilus ducreyi (34) were sensitive (less than 0.06 mg/l) but gardnerella vaginalis (25) and mobiluncus spp. (11) were resistant (32 mg/l). pefloxacin was  more active than ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and piperacillin against s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci and than gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. no enterobacteria or pseudomonads were resistant to pefloxacin or other quinolones,  whereas some were resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.
