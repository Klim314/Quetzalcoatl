TI  == lactic acid production by streptococcus thermophilus alters clostridium difficile infection and in vitro toxin a production.
AB  == antibiotic treatment to treat specific infections has the potential to effectively target the offending microbe as well as other microbes that colonize  sites within a host. antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) is a classic example resulting from disruption of host microbial communities; 20% of patients with aad are likely to become colonized with clostridium difficile. restoration of a "normal" microbial community within the host using probiotic bacteria is one approach to circumvent aad and c. difficile infection. the goals of this study were to assess the interactions between streptococcus thermophilus, a potential probiotic organism and c. difficile using both in vitro and in vivo systems. exposure of c. difficile to filtered supernatants from s. thermophilus showed a dose-dependent, bactericidal effect due to lactic acid. additional studies show that levels of lactic acid (10 mm) that did not inhibit bacterial growth had the  potential to decrease tcda expression and tcda release into the extracellular milieu. in vivo, treatment with viable s. thermophilus significantly increased luminal levels of lactate in the cecum compared with uv-irradiated s. thermophilus. in the context of infection with c. difficile, mice treated with viable s. thermophilus exhibited 46% less weight loss compared with untreated controls; moreover, less pathology, diarrhea, and lower detectable toxin levels in cecal contents were evident more often in s. thermophillus treated mice. a significant, inverse correlation (spearman r = -0.942, p = 0.017) between the levels of luminal lactate and abundance of c. difficile were noted suggesting that lactate produced by s. thermophilus is a factor impacting the progression of c. difficile infection in the murine system.

TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI  == probiotics for children with diarrhea: an update.
AB  == this review focuses on the efficacy of probiotics for diarrhea in children in different settings: day-care centers, diarrhea acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 5 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus), and lactobacillus reuteri. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest: statistically significant for some strains only and in any case of minimal to mild clinical importance. few trials have examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spread of diarrhea in hospitalized children, an event most commonly due to either rotavirus or clostridium difficile, and they have yielded conflicting results. overall, these studies provide only weak evidence on the efficacy of probiotics. on the other hand, a large number of trials on the role of probiotics in preventing the  onset of antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been published. most commonly employed probiotics were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium spp., streptococcus spp., and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. today, we have a large number of published clinical trials on the role of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea in children, and many of them are randomized, blinded, and controlled. they consistently show  a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii, but also l. reuteri-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, primarily rotaviral, in infants and young children of developed countries. such a beneficial effect seems to result in a reduction of diarrhea duration of little more than 1 day, and to be exerted mostly on diarrhea due to rotavirus. the effect is not only strain-dependent, but also dose-dependent, with doses of at least 10 billion/d being necessary.

TI  == use of probiotic lactobacillus preparation to prevent diarrhoea associated with antibiotics: randomised double blind placebo controlled trial.
AB  == objective: to determine the efficacy of a probiotic drink containing lactobacillus for the prevention of any diarrhoea associated with antibiotic use  and that caused by clostridium difficile. design: randomised double blind placebo controlled study. participants: 135 hospital patients (mean age 74) taking antibiotics. exclusions included diarrhoea on admission, bowel pathology that could result in diarrhoea, antibiotic use in the previous four weeks, severe illness, immunosuppression, bowel surgery, artificial heart valves, and history of rheumatic heart disease or infective endocarditis. intervention: consumption of a 100 g (97 ml) drink containing lactobacillus casei, l bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus twice a day during a course of antibiotics and for one week after the course finished. the placebo group received a longlife sterile milkshake. main outcome measures: primary outcome: occurrence of antibiotic associated diarrhoea. secondary outcome: presence of c difficile toxin and diarrhoea. results: 7/57 (12%) of the probiotic group developed diarrhoea associated with antibiotic use compared with 19/56 (34%) in the placebo group (p=0.007). logistic regression to control for other factors gave an odds ratio 0.25 (95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.85) for use of the probiotic, with low albumin and sodium also increasing the risk of diarrhoea. the absolute risk reduction was 21.6% (6.6% to 36.6%), and the number needed to treat was 5 (3 to 15). no one in the probiotic group and 9/53 (17%) in the placebo group had diarrhoea caused by c difficile (p=0.001). the absolute risk reduction was 17% (7% to 27%), and the number needed to treat was 6 (4 to 14). conclusion: consumption of a probiotic drink containing l casei, l bulgaricus, and s thermophilus can reduce the incidence of antibiotic associated diarrhoea and c difficile associated diarrhoea. this has the potential to decrease morbidity, healthcare costs, and mortality if used routinely in patients aged over 50. trial registration: national research register n0016106821.

TI  == the icest1 element of streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a large family of integrative and conjugative elements that exchange modules and change their specificity of integration.
AB  == the 34,734-bp element icest1 from streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 is site-specifically integrated into the 3(') end of the gene fda. icest1 encodes integrative functions and putative transfer functions. six proteins of the putative conjugative system of icest1 are related to those encoded by the conjugative transposon tn916 from enterococcus faecalis. a comparison of these proteins with those encoded by the complete or partial genome sequences of various low g+c bacteria including bacillus subtilis, clostridium difficile, e. faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans revealed the presence of numerous putative site-specific integrative conjugative  elements and/or conjugative transposons within these genomes. sequence comparisons revealed that these elements possess a modular structure and that exchanges of unrelated or distantly related modules and genes have occurred between these elements, and also plasmids and prophages. these exchanges have probably led to modifications in the site specificity of integration of these elements. therefore, a distinction between low specificity integrative conjugative elements (i.e., conjugative transposons) and site-specific integrative conjugative elements does not appear to be relevant. we propose to call all the conjugative elements that excise by site-specific recombination and  integrate by recombination between a specific site of a circular intermediate and another site, "integrative and conjugative elements" (ices), irrespective of the  integration specificity.

TI  == the use of probiotics in gastrointestinal disease.
AB  == probiotics are living microorganisms that can affect the host in a beneficial manner. prebiotics are nondigestible food ingredients that stimulate the growth and activity of probiotic bacteria already established in the colon. efficacy of  probiotic compounds has been shown in a wide range of gastrointestinal diseases.  lactobacillus gg alone, or the combination of bifidobacterium bifidum and streptococcus thermophilus, is effective in the treatment of clostridium difficile, as well as in preventing the frequency and severity of infectious acute diarrhea in children. prevention of antibiotic-induced diarrhea with the concomitant administration of either lactobacillus gg or saccharomyces boulardii  has been demonstrated. the most successful studies involve the use of lactobacillus gg at a dose of 1 x 1010 viable organisms per day and the yeast boulardii at a dose of 1 g/day. a probiotic preparation (vsl#3 - 6 g/day) that uses a combination of three species of bifidobacterium, four strains of lactobacillus and one strain of streptocccus has shown promise in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis and pouchitis, as well as in preventing the postoperative recurrence of crohn's disease. the mechanism of action of probiotics may include receptor competition, effects on mucin secretion or probiotic immunomodulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. oral administration of probiotic compounds has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and safe. however, while probiotics have the potential to improve human health and to prevent and treat some diseases, major improvements are needed in labelling and quality assurance procedures for probiotic compounds. in addition, well planned and controlled clinical studies are necessary to delineate fully the potential for probiotic compounds.

TI  == pharmaceutical probiotics for the treatment of anaerobic and other infections.
AB  == pharmaceutical probiotics have been used as alternative treatments or preventative therapies for a variety of clinical diseases. the overuse of antibiotics and emergence of multiple-antibiotic resistant pathogens has refocused clinical attention on the field of probiotics. anaerobic infections which seem to respond well to probiotics are infections which involve the disruption of normal microbial flora. gastrointestinal infections (travelers' diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea,clostridium difficile disease, rotavirus diarrhea) have been studied using the following pharmaceutical probiotics:saccharomyces boulardii, lactobacillus casei gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, bifidobacterium bifidum, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. vaginitis has been experimentally studied  using l. acidophilus and l. casei gg. the efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of these various probiotics are reviewed. requirements for drug approval are similar for biologic probiotics and new drug entities and these requirements  involve preclinical tolerability studies, pharmacokinetic studies and large, well-controlled blinded clinical trials.

TI  == biotherapeutic agents. a neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. data sources: the medline database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and september 1995. search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, lactobacillus, saccharomyces, bifidobacterium, candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. the bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. study selection and data extraction: all placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. english-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. data synthesis: placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (lactobacillus caseigg, bifidobacterium longum, b longum with l acidophilus, and saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (bifidobacterium bifidum with streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent clostridium difficile disease (s  boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (enterococcus faecium  sf68, l caseigg, and s boulardii). there is also evidence for lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. few adverse effects have been reported. however, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. conclusions: there is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. in an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.
