TI  == periodontitis associated with plasminogen deficiency: a case report.
AB  == background: plasminogen deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease, which is associated with aggressive periodontitis and gingival enlargement. previously  described treatments of plasminogen deficiency associated periodontitis have shown limited success. this is the first case report indicating a successful therapy approach consisting of a non-surgical supra- and subgingival debridement  in combination with an adjunctive systemic antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal regimen over an observation period of 4 years. case presentation: the intraoral examination of a 17-year-old turkish female with severe plasminogen deficiency revealed generalized increased pocket probing depths ranging from 6 to 9 mm, bleeding on probing over 30%, generalized tooth mobility, and gingival hyperplasia. alveolar bone loss ranged from 30% to 50%. clinical attachment loss corresponded to pocket probing depths. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and eikenella corrodens have been detected by realtime polymerase chain reaction. periodontal treatment consisted of full mouth disinfection and adjunctive systemic administration of amoxicillin (500 mg tid) and metronidazole (400 mg tid). a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen every three month in terms of supra- and subgingival debridement was rendered. the reported therapy has significantly improved periodontal health and arrested disease progression. intraoral examination at the end of the observation period 3.5 years after non-surgical periodontal therapy showed generalized decreased pocket probing depths ranging from 1 to 6 mm, bleeding on probing lower 30%, and  tooth mobility class i and ii. furthermore, microbiological analysis shows the absence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola after therapy. conclusion: adjunctive antibiotic treatment may alter the oral microbiome and thus, the inflammatory response of periodontal disease associated to plasminogen deficiency and diminishes the risk of pseudomembrane formation and progressive attachment loss. this case report indicates that patients with plasminogen deficiency may benefit from non-surgical periodontal treatment in combination with an adjunctive antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen.

TI  == recovery of putative periodontal pathogens from curette sampling at different depths of periodontal lesions: an in vivo cross-sectional clinical study.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the depth of curette sample collection from periodontal lesions on the recovery of putative periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methods: twenty-two periodontal pockets 6 to 8 mm deep with bleeding on probing at a single-rooted tooth were sampled, yielding 66 separate samples. curette samples were obtained at three different levels of the periodontal lesion (orifice, shallow--2 mm into the pocket; or base of lesion), and processed using pcr to identify 10 periodontal pathogens. the chi-square procedure was used to determine whether probe depth affected the distribution of bacterial counts observed. a repeated measures analysis of variance tested the hypotheses related to level of  probe and microorganism on mean rank of bacterial counts. results: the effect of  probe level on mean bacterial counts depends on the type of microorganism. likewise, the effect of microorganism type on mean bacterial counts significantly depends on probe level, where sampling from 2 mm into the periodontal pocket was  found to yield significantly higher results than sampling from the orifice. overall mean counts of pathogenic microorganisms were found to differ significantly across the three probe depths. the microorganisms differed in their observed levels over all three probe levels. further analysis found several significant differences that characterize the nature of the interaction between probe level and microorganism type. conclusion: there is significant difference in the amount of putative periodontal pathogens at varying depths of the pocket when sampled with a periodontal curette.

TI  == effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (pt) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: the study was conducted from december 2013 to may 2014 at ewha womans university mokdong hospital, seoul, korea. forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups  in a 1:1 ratio: srp+pt and srp (control) groups. all participants underwent full-mouth srp. pt was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (ppd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. results: the clinical parameters improved in both the groups. at the follow-up assessment, ppd was significantly decreased in the srp+pt group (p=0.00). further, ppd and cal showed significantly greater changes in the srp+pt group than in the srp group (ppd, p=0.03; cal, p=0.04). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. conclusions: adjunctive pt seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial  effects is not sufficient. long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective pt protocol and compare the effectiveness of pt with and without exogenous photosensitizers.

TI  == microbial leakage at the implant/abutment connection due to implant insertion maneuvers: cross-sectional study 5 years post loading in healthy patients.
AB  == abstract the aim of this study was to test if stress on the prosthetic connection during insertion maneuvers can induce micro-warping at the implant-connection. from sept 2011 to july 20134, patients with implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were selected from all those that had received dental implant therapy in the past and coming to routine check-up or spontaneous visits during the study period. patients having implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were recruited. samples were obtained from inside the connection and the abutment surface (cias) using absorbent sterile paper tips. qrt-pcr was performed for total bacterial counts and loads of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema denticola (td), prevotella intermedia (pi), peptostreptococcus micros (pm), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), campylobacter rectus (cr), eikenella corrodens (ec), and candida albicans (ca). the anova test  was used to test for differences. nine patients (20 implants, mp group) and 5 patients (10 implants, me group) were included. regarding the red complex, tf was seen in 80% and 30% of mp and me implants respectively (p<0.001). significant differences were also found in microbial load. for td, proportions were 45% vs. 10% (p=0.022) with no significant differences at load levels. regarding the orange complex, higher prevalence values were found in mp implants, although differences were non-significant. microbial load levels for orange complex bacteria were higher for mp than me, being these differences statistically significant for fn (4.94 vs 3.09; p=0.001). finally, ec was only detected in the  mp group, and ca and aa were not found in either group. within its limitation (small sample size, retrospective analysis, indirect measurement method), the present study suggest that aa mounter not impacting on the prosthetic connection  should be used to reduce microbial contamination of implants.

TI  == influence of highly-active antiretroviral therapy on the subgingival biofilm in hiv-infected patients.
AB  == aim: highly-active antiretroviral therapy (haart) has been associated with alterations in subgingival biofilm and periodontal disease. the purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between different haart regimens and the prevalence of periodontal pathogens in hiv-infected patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: subgingival periodontal pathogens were determined by a dna chip microarray in a case series in 14 hiv-infected patients receiving haart  with different drug combinations: protease inhibitor (pi)-based haart versus non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nnrti)-based haart. a statistical analysis was conducted to determine whether specific haart regimens were associated with 10 periodontal pathogens using odds ratios (or). results: at baseline and after treatment, the patients did not show significant clinical and  immunological differences. in general, the highest or for the prevalence of periodontal pathogens were found in the pi haart group for actinomyces viscosus (a. viscosus) (or: 303), campylobacter rectus (or: 90), and treponema denticola (or: 25). in the nnrti haart group, higher or were documented for fusobacterium nucleatum (or: 56) and eikenella corrodens (or: 25). the association between a. viscosus and pi haart was statistically significant (p = 0.03). conclusions: the  results demonstrated statistical associations between subgingival bacteria and antiretroviral drug therapies. further investigation on the clinical significance and underlying mechanisms are needed to support these findings.

TI  == influence of the periodontal status on the initial-biofilm formation on titanium  surfaces.
AB  == background: dental implants will be exposed to a complex ecosystem once they are  placed in the oral cavity. the bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on these devices will depend not only on the physicochemical surface implant properties but also on the periodontal health conditions of the patients, as these devices are exposed. purpose: the aim of this study was to correlate the subgingival microbial profile with the composition of initial biofilm formed on different microstructured titanium (ti) surfaces. materials and methods: ten periodontitis and 10 periodontally healthy subjects were included in this study.  the subjects wore a removable acrylic device with four different fixed ti surfaces for 48 hours. microbial samples of subgingival plaque and the biofilm formed on each ti surface were individually analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization technique. results: despite the roughness or hydrophilicity of the  ti surfaces, a characteristic pattern of bacterial adhesion was observed on each  of the study groups. however, significant differences in the proportion of the species that colonized the ti surfaces were found between the periodontitis and periodontally healthy groups. treponema denticola, neisseria mucosa, eikenella corrodens, and tannerella forsythia were detected in higher proportions on the ti disks placed in the periodontitis subjects, while significant higher proportions  of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium periodonticum, prevotella melaninogenica, and streptococcus mitis were detected on the ti disks placed in the periodontally healthy group. conclusions: the results obtained in this study  shows that the composition and the proportion of the species that initially colonize ti surfaces are highly influenced by the periodontal status more than the surface characteristics of the ti implant.

TI  == microbiological assessment of the implant-abutment interface in different connections: cross-sectional study after 5 years of functional loading.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the bacterial microflora present inside the implant connection and in the peri-implant sulcus fluid of healthy implants, and to analyze the relationships between these harboring sites for four different implant systems after at least 5 years of functional loading. materials and methods: a cross-sectional study was performed involving 40 patients treated with metal-ceramic cemented bridges supported by at least two healthy implants functionally loaded for 5 years. four different implant-abutment connections were studied: external hexagon (control group), double internal hexagon (test group 1), internal hexagon with external collar (test group 2), and conical connection  (test group 3). samples for microbiological analysis were obtained from three types of sites: peri-implant sulci, connections' inside and abutments surface and, as control, gingival sulci of neighboring teeth. quantitative real-time pcr  was carried out for total bacterial count and for 10 microorganisms: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and candida albicans. the response variables were percentage of positive sites and absolute bacterial load. the relations of the response variables with the type of connection and of sampling site were assessed using generalized estimating equations. results: regarding the analysis of positivity to bacteria in the peri-implant sulcus no significant differences were observed. analyzing the connection's inside, none of the connection designs had the capacity to prevent microbiological leakage through the implant/abutment microgap. test group 3 presented the lowest mean values for red complex bacteria and control group the highest, although differences were non-significant. statistical significance was  only reached for treponema denticola in the bacterial load analysis inside the connection. test groups 1 and 2 yielded lower values for orange complex bacteria  but only for peptostreptococos micros the differences resulted significant. test  groups 2 and 3 had significantly lower total bacterial counts in the peri-implant sulcus and inside the connection. conclusions: outcomes suggested that all the analyzed connections resulted contaminated after 5 years of functional loading. however, the connection design might influence bacterial activity levels qualitatively and quantitatively, especially inside the implant connection.

TI  == the association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in brazilian adults with hiv: a multilevel analysis.
AB  == background: this study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load (hvl) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with hiv. methods: thirty-seven individuals with hiv were divided into two groups: 1) detectable hvl (n = 15); and 2) undetectable hvl (n = 22). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, fisher exact test, and mann-whitney u test were used to compare groups. multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between hvl and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. results: of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable hvl group than undetectable hvl group (p <0.001). these species included actinomyces naeslundii  ii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter concisus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and candida  albicans. significant associations between detectable hvl and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for a. naeslundii i, actinomyces gerencseriae, c. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythia, and dialister pneumosintes. conclusion: detectable plasmatic hvl in individuals with hiv was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as p. nigrescens, t. forsythia, and e. corrodens, as well as c. concisus, c. gingivalis, and d. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == evaluation of periodontal pathogens in amniotic fluid and the role of periodontal disease in pre-term birth and low birth weight.
AB  == background: pre-term birth and/or low birth weight (ptlbw) is a serious problem in developing countries. the absence of known risk factors in approximately 50% of ptlbw cases has resulted in a continued search for other causes. the aim of this study was to examine the effect of periodontitis on pregnancy outcomes. methods: samples were taken from 50 pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis. polymerase chain reaction was performed on amniotic fluid samples obtained during amniocentesis and on subgingival plaque samples to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia,  campylobacter rectus and eikenella corrodens. plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level were evaluated.  medical records were obtained after birth. results: social and demographic variables were similar among the gingivitis (g), localized periodontitis (lp) and generalized periodontitis (gp) groups. four subjects gave birth to ptlbw neonates. campylobacter rectus, t. forsythia, p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were detected in the amniotic fluid and subgingival plaque samples of three patients who gave birth to ptlbw neonates. the amniotic fluid sample from the fourth patient was not positive for any of the tested pathogens. conclusion: these findings suggest that the transmission of some periodontal pathogens from the oral cavity of the mother may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. the results contribute to an understanding of the association between periodontal disease and ptlbw, but further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship.

TI  == do elderly edentulous patients with a history of periodontitis harbor periodontal pathogens?
AB  == objectives: the presence of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity may impact implant survival. therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra in a specific elderly population with a history of periodontitis who have never worn dentures. material and methods: thirty dentate subjects (mean age 61.7 +/- 7.05 years) and 30 edentulous subjects (mean age 65.8 +/- 8.05 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. microbiological samples of cheek mucosa and the dorsum of  the tongue were taken from all subjects. in addition, sulcus samples were taken from the dentate group. all samples were analysed using a bacterial dna-specific  polymerase chain reaction. results: all the pathogens studied were detected in dentate and edentulous subjects. when cheek and tongue samples were combined, c.  rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens presented with a similar prevalence in both groups, whereas the other species were more prevalent specifically in the dentate group (p<0.05). in dentate subjects, p. intermedia and t. denticola were present in higher frequencies in the cheek mucosa (26.67% and 66.67%, respectively), whereas p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more prevalent in the tongue samples (26.67% and 56.67%, respectively). conclusions: periodontal pathogens may persist in the oral cavity of edentulous subjects who have had periodontal disease, even 1 year after the extraction of all teeth and in the absence of other hard surfaces in the mouth.

TI  == subgingival microbiota from cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  == this present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the tufted capuchin monkey procreation center (sao paulo state university - unesp) or free-ranging monkeys. for this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. the primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to vmga iii transport medium and ultrapure water. the microbiota was  cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial dna was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using pcr and real-time pcr. the actinomycetes, fusobacteria, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods, tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dialister pneumosintes and prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas treponema denticola was not found. populations of c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.

TI  == adjunctive azithromycin in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis: microbiological findings of a 12-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: to compare the subgingival microbiological outcomes of azithromycin or placebo as adjuncts to scaling and root planing (srp) in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis (agp), and to secondarily evaluate the microbiological effect of supragingival scaling in agp patients. methods: twenty-four agp subjects 13-26 years of age received a 15-day programme of supragingival scaling  (sc) and were then randomly assigned to srp with systemic azithromycin or placebo. subgingival samples were taken with sterile paper points at baseline, 15 days after sc, and at 3, 6 and 12 months following srp. microbiological analysis  was performed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: changes in bacterial levels from baseline to 15 days after sc were similar in the 2 groups.  when subjects were analysed as a single group, significant reductions after sc were observed for actinomyces gerencseriae, capnocytophaga ochracea, and treponema denticola. during the 12-month follow-up, levels of most of the bacteria decreased in both groups in a similar pattern. for instance, actinomyces israelli, veillonella parvula, streptococcus gordonii, c. ochracea, eikenella corrodens, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium periodonticum and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum decreased significantly within the groups. conclusions: azithromycin was ineffective in lowering the subgingival levels of important putative periodontal pathogens in young agp subjects compared to placebo. clinical significance: scaling and root planing with adjunctive systemic azithromycin provides little additional benefit compared to placebo in reductions of major subgingival periodontal pathogens.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens in the biofilm formation on voice prostheses: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives/hypothesis: voice rehabilitation with voice prostheses is a standard therapy in laryngectomized patients. biofilm formation on the surface of the voice prostheses causes device failure and requires frequent replacements. studies analyzing the biofilm of voice prostheses have mainly focused on aerobic  bacteria. anaerobic bacteria as an integral part of the biofilms on voice prostheses have not been investigated yet. study design: prospective pilot study  on the occurrence of anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens in biofilm formation on voice prostheses. methods: biofilm samples of 15 voice prostheses were analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction-based hybridization method regarding the presence of 11 selected anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens. results: in  80% of the voice prostheses, at least one and up to 10 of the tested bacteria could be identified. fusobacterium nucleatum was the pathogen most often present  (73%). other frequently occurring pathogens were treponema denticola (40%), tannerella forsythia (33%), and eikenella corrodens (33%). there was no correlation between the number of identified bacteria and the indwelling times (mean, 127 days; maximum, 344 days; minimum, 22 days). conclusions: for the first time, anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens have been identified as part of the biofilm formation on the surface of voice prostheses. those pathogens might be responsible for accelerated biofilm formation and reduced lifetime of the voice prostheses.

TI  == necrotizing periodontal diseases in hiv-infected brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  == objective: nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. method and materials: from a pool of 1,232 hiv-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. the presence and levels of  47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: all 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent  than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). the frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. species detected in  high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, dialister pneumosintes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus intermedius, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter rectus. in contrast, parvimonas micra, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium nodatum, and helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. conclusion: necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in hiv-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular t denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as e faecalis and d pneumosintes. in addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and aids-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.

TI  == detection of periodontal pathogens in newborns and children with mixed dentition.
AB  == we report the age-related prevalence of red complex periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, along with four strains of orange complex pathogens. the bacteria present in samples isolated from tongue, cheek, and subgingival sulcus in edentulous newborns and children with mixed dentition were monitored by polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  p. gingivalis was not detected in any site of any subject in the two groups tested. however, t. denticola was not only found in the 6-13 years age group, but also in edentulous newborns at a relatively high prevalence, indicating non-dentition-related colonization by t. denticola. campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra were found in the oral cavity of most subjects belonging to the 6-13 years age group compared to newborns. this suggested a pronounced association between these colonizing bacteria and the presence of teeth. there was also a strong relation between t. denticola and t. forsythia for their prevalence in the subgingival sulcus of the 6-13 years age group (p < 0.0001), but not in the other sites tested, suggesting that the colonization of dentition-related t. forsythia may be associated with the increased prevalence of non-dentition-related t. denticola in the subgingival sulcus. overall, these results suggest that dentition is a key determinant of bacterial colonization, especially orange complex bacteria and the red complex bacterium t. forsythia.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == short-term periodontal and microbiological changes following orthognathic surgery.
AB  == objective: aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of orthognathic surgery on the development of periodontal and microbiological changes. materials  and methods: fifteen consecutively treated patients with a mean age of 24.9+/-7.7 years receiving orthognathic surgery were included in the present study. plaque index (pi) and concentrations of 11 periodonto-pathogenic bacteria were recorded  one day prior to surgery (t(0)) and one week (t(1)) and six weeks (t(2)) post-surgery. in addition, a complete periodontal examination including pocket probing depth (ppd), gingival recession (gr), clinical attachment level (cal), bleeding on probing (bop) and width of keratinized gingiva (wkg) was conducted at t(0) and t(2). for statistical analysis, general linear model and paired t-test were applied. results: a significant increase of pi (t(0)-t(1), p=0.037) was followed by a significant decrease (t(1)-t(2), p=0.017). apart from eikenella corrodens (p=0.036), no significant microbiological changes were recorded. ppd significantly increased on oral sites (p=0.045) and gr especially on buccal sites (p=0.001). in the incision area the development of gr was significantly higher on the test (buccal) than on the control sites (oral). both gingival biotypes were affected by gr. conclusions: orthognathic surgery causes statistically significant changes of periodontal parameters, but these changes do not necessarily impair the aesthetic appearance of the gingival margin.

AB  == objective: to evaluate changes in subgingival microbiota before and during the leveling and alignment orthodontic stage using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (17 females and  13 males; aged 16.7 +/- 6.5 y) were included in this study. subgingival microbial samples were taken from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors, the left lower central incisors, the mesio-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper first molars, and the left lower first molars, at four  different times: at baseline, before placement of orthodontic appliances (t1), and 1 week (t2), 3 months (t3), and 6 months after placement of orthodontic appliances (t4). dna was extracted from the samples, and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobactor rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola, which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of t forsythia, c rectus, and p nigrescens significantly increased after placement of orthodontic appliances. for the other species, the frequency tended to increase but no statistically significant difference was noted. the frequency of the change, representing microorganisms not existing at t1 but newly developing at t2, t3, and t4, was higher at the molars than at the incisors. conclusion: the placement of orthodontic appliances affects the subgingival microbial composition even during  the early period of orthodontic treatment, increasing the prevalence of periodontopathogens, especially in the molar region.

TI  == [prevalence of helicobacter pylori detected by real-time pcr in the subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis].
AB  == background: helicobacter pylori plays a significant role in gastric disease. the  aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the prevalence of h. pylori detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time pcr) in the sub-gingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients and to determine periodontopathogens profile of positive sites at h. pylori. methodology: 109 subgingival samples collected from 17 subjects with chronic periodontitis were studied. the dna was extracted from the oral samples and analyzed for the presence of h. pylori by real-time pcr (lightcycler) using 16s rrna#120 primers which targeted the 16s rrna gene. dna from h. pylori dsm 4867 was used as a positive control. seven bacteria implicated in chronic periodontitis were selected to explore the presence of these periodontopathic species in the oral positive sites for h. pylori. results: 16 of 109 samples (14.7%) were positives of h. pylori. all the positives sites were also positives to fusobacterium nucleatum and eikenella corrodens, 62.5% to porphyromonas gingivalis, 31.25% to treponema denticola, 25% to prevotella intermedia, 12.5% to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and 6.25% to tannerella forsythia. conclusions: h. pylori may be present in the subgingival plaque samples of patients with chronic periodontitis who are resident in a developing country. f. nucleatum and e. corrodens could coaggregate with h. pylori in the subgingival dental plaque.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == prognosis of periodontitis recurrence after intensive periodontal treatment using examination of serum igg antibody titer against periodontal bacteria.
AB  == chronic periodontitis is associated with systemic diseases such as atherosclerosis. in this study, we evaluated the efficacy of serum igg antibody titer to periodontal bacteria for prognosis of periodontitis recurrence during supportive periodontal therapy (spt) phase. the 139 patients during spt phase were selected and divided to two groups as follows: "stable" and "recurrence" group at spt phase for case-control study: "high igg titer" and "normal igg titer" group before transition to spt phase for cohort study. we examined whether clinical findings or serum igg antibody titers to periodontal bacteria are risk factors for the development of periodontitis recurrence. case-control study showed that there were significant differences between the stable and recurrence  groups in age and number of teeth. the serum igg antibody titer to eikenella corrodens fdc1073, porphyromonas gingivalis su63, and campylobacter rectus atcc33238 was significantly higher in the recurrence group. next, we found, that  the recurrence ratio in the high igg titer group to gram-negative obligate anaerobe, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and c. rectus was significantly higher than that of the normal igg titer group. taken together, serum igg antibody titer test is useful in the prognosis of periodontitis recurrence during the spt phase.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens and severity of periodontitis in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.
AB  == objective: in this study of patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), the severity of the disease and the main periodontal pathogens identified in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) were compared with those detected in individuals without systemic disease. design: nineteen patients with cp without evidence of systemic disease (control group), 25 patients with cp and ckd who were in the pre-dialysis stages (pre-dialysis group), and 22 patients with cp and ckd who were on renal replacement therapy (rrt group) were examined. the severity of cp was based on the investigation of probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal). the definition and stage of ckd were based on the criteria proposed by the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative of the national kidney foundation. glomerular filtration rate (gfr) was estimated using  the equation of modification of diet in renal disease and the identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque was performed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: candida albicans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were more common in patients who were on rrt and pre-dialysis than in control subjects. cp was more severe in patients with ckd. a strong association was observed between the frequency of c. albicans (p =  0.056), p.gingivalis (p = 0.008), t. denticola (p = 0.013) and cal, when ckd patients were compared with the control group. conclusion: cp is more severe and  is associated with increased frequency of c. albicans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in patients with ckd.

TI  == examination of periodontal pathogens in stenotic valve specimens and in whole blood samples in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis may be a risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. the influence of periodontal pathogens in cardiovascular diseases needs  further investigation. therefore, the aims of this clinical study are: to test the presence of periodontal bacteria dna in aortic valves and to assess the concomitant presence of the same periodontal bacteria dna in whole blood samples  in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis. nineteen consecutive patients (12 males and 7 females, age: 49-85 years) were enrolled in  this study after having been subjected to a complete periodontal evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of chronic periodontitis. all patients were scheduled for aortic valve replacement surgery. after clinical and microbial periodontal examination, the aortic valve tissue specimens were obtained by excision during valve replacement surgery and the patients were subjected to the whole blood sampling before the surgery. the polymerase chain reaction technology was used to detect the putative periodontal pathogens tannerella forshytia, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens and treponema  denticola. neither the 19 aortic valve specimens nor the blood samples were positive for the genoma of the selected periodontal pathogens. the selected periodontal pathogens did not colonize the aortic valve of patients affected by stenosis and bacterial genoma was not present in whole blood samples. a high blood pressure at the aortic valve may prevent the adhesion and proliferation of  bacterial colonies.

TI  == do elderly edentulous patients with a history of periodontitis harbor periodontal pathogens?
AB  == objectives: the presence of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity may impact implant survival. therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens and parvimonas micra in a specific elderly population with a history of periodontitis who have never worn dentures. material and methods: thirty dentate subjects (mean age 61.7+/-7.05 years) and 30 edentulous subjects (mean age 65.8+/-8.05 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. microbiological samples of cheek mucosa and the dorsum of  the tongue were taken from all subjects. in addition, sulcus samples were taken from the dentate group. all samples were analysed using a bacterial dna-specific  polymerase chain reaction. results: all the pathogens studied were detected in dentate and edentulous subjects. when cheek and tongue samples were combined, c.  rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens presented with a similar prevalence in both groups, whereas the other species were more prevalent specifically in the dentate group (p<0.05). in dentate subjects, p. intermedia and t. denticola were present in higher frequencies in the cheek mucosa (26.67% and 66.67%, respectively), whereas p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more prevalent in the tongue samples (26.67% and 56.67%, respectively). conclusions: periodontal pathogens may persist in the oral cavity of edentulous subjects who have had periodontal disease, even 1 year after the extraction of all teeth and in the absence of other hard surfaces in the mouth.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes that occur in the subgingival microbiota after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (11 males and 19 females; aged 20 +/- 7.3 yr) were included in this study. subgingival plaque samplings were gathered from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors and the left lower central incisors, and from the mesio-buccal gingival  crevice of the left upper first molars and the left lower first molars, at two different times: 2 weeks before appliance removal (t1), and 3 months after appliance removal (t2). dna was extracted from the samples and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , tannerella forsythia , campylobacter rectus , eikenella corrodens , porphyromonas gingivalis , prevotella intermedia , prevotella nigrescens , and treponema denticola , which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of positive sites at t1 and t2 was 65% and 43.3% for c. rectus , and 53.3% and 30.8% for e. corrodens , respectively. for the other bacteria, the frequency tended to be reduced between  times. conclusion: periodontopathogens during orthodontic treatment were significantly reduced within 3 months of appliance removal. however, how long it  takes to return to the preorthodontic composition of the subgingival microbiota and whether it happens at all remain to be seen.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of  species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

TI  == prevalence of periodontal pathogens in coronary atherosclerotic plaque of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
AB  == background: chronic bacterial infections have been associated with an increased risk for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. the ability of oral pathogens to colonize in coronary atheromatous plaque is well known. the aim of our study was to detect the presence of four common periodontal pathogens in coronary plaques. we detected the presence of 16s rrna of treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis and campylobacter rectus in subgingival and atherosclerotic plaques of cabg surgery by using polymerase chain reaction. methods: 51 patients in the age group of 40 to 80 years with chronic periodontitis were recruited for the study. these patients were suffering from coronary artery disease (cad) and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg). dna was extracted from the subgingival plaque and coronary atheromatous plaque samples. universal primer for the general detection of bacterial dna and the primers for t.denticola, e. corrodens, c.rectus and p.gingivalis were used to amplify part of 16srrna gene by polymerase chain reaction. results: t.denticola,  e.corrodens, c.rectus and p.gingivalis were detected in 49.01 %, 27.45 %, 21.51%  and 45.10% of atherosclerotic plaque samples. in both subgingival and coronary plaque samples, t. denticola was detected in 39.21% of the cases, e.corrodens in  19.60%, c.rectus in 11.76% and p.gingivalis in 39.22% of the cases respectively.  conclusion: our study revealed the presence of significant bacterial dna of oral  pathogens in coronary plaques. this suggests possible relationship between periodontal infection and atherosclerosis and can help devise preventive treatment strategies.

TI  == the microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  == as the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. we hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could  also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means  of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. the most prevalent taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, and porphyromonas endodontalis. other  frequently found taxa included olsenella uli, streptococci, eikenella corrodens,  some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121), and newly named species (prevotella baroniae and dialister invisus). several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.

TI  == periodontal pathogen levels in adolescents before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
AB  == introduction: this purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. methods: dna gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of  8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. the 8 pathogens examined were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), treponema denticola (td), and campylobacter rectus (cr). chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. results: for 6 (pi, tf, ec, fn, td, cr) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased  significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to  pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. no pathogen level was  significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (ec, fn, td, cr) posttreatment. conclusions: orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == [identification of periodontopathogen microorganisms by pcr technique].
AB  == introduction: periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting tissues  of teeth and is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. the onset and progression  of periodontal disease is attributed to the presence of elevated levels of a consortium of pathogenic bacteria. gram negative bacteria, mainly strict anaerobes, play the major role. objective: the present study aimed to assess the  presence of the main types of microorganisms involved in the aetiopathogenesis of periodontal disease: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, tanerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia in different samples collected from the oral  cavity of 90 patients diagnosed with periodontitis. method: bacterial dna detection was performed in diverse biological materials, namely in dental plaque, gingival tissue and saliva, by means of multiplex pcr, a technique that allows simultaneous identification of two different bacterial genomes. results: in the dental plaque of the periodontitis patients, treponema denticola dominated. in the gingival tissue, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were the microbiota most frequently detected, whilst in saliva treponema denticola and eikenella corrodens were found with the highest percentage. conclusion: the identification of microorganisms by multiplex pcr is specific and sensitive. rapid and precise assessment of different types of periodontopathogens is extremely important for early detection of the infection and consequently for the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease. in everyday clinical practice, for routine bacterial evaluation in patients with periodontal disease, the dental plaque is the most suitable biological material, because it is the richest in periodontal bacteria.

TI  == factors affecting human supragingival biofilm composition. i. plaque mass.
AB  == background and objective: little is known about the factors that affect the microbial composition of supragingival biofilms. this study was designed to examine the relationship between total dna probe counts of supragingival biofilm  samples, clinical parameters and supragingival biofilm composition. material and  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 187 systemically healthy adult subjects (n = 4745 samples). all samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the relationship between total dna probe counts and microbial composition was examined by subsetting the data into 10 groups based on 10 percentile increments  of the total dna probe counts. differences among groups in terms of species counts and proportions were sought, as well as relationships of total plaque dna  probe count and clinical parameters. results: there was a wide distribution in mean total dna probe counts among the 187 subjects. with increasing total plaque  levels there was a change in the proportions of individual species and microbial  complexes. 'small plaques' were characterized by high proportions of species in the yellow, orange, purple and 'other' complexes; plaques of moderate mass were characterized by high proportions of actinomyces and purple complex species, while 'large plaques' exhibited increased proportions of green and orange complex species. measures of gingival inflammation, pocket depth and recession were significantly positively associated with total dna probe counts. increased plaque numbers were related to increased pocket depth irrespective of presence or absence of gingival inflammation. conclusion: the proportions of individual species and microbial complexes in supragingival biofilms are influenced by the total numbers of organisms in the biofilm.

TI  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  == background and objective: mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (cxcl6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal  inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally  and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. material and methods: gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using affymetrix u133plus2.0 arrays. the expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations. results: among all known chemokines, gcp-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to  a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mrna (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher  levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth,  but not with attachment loss. immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. conclusion: the level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the  severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

AB  == aim: various bacterial species are differentially prevalent in periodontal health, gingivitis or periodontitis. we tested the independent associations between three bacterial groupings and gingival inflammation in an epidemiological study. material and methods: in 706 oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest) participants > or =55 years, bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd) and subgingival plaque samples (n=4866) were assessed in eight sites per mouth. eleven bacterial species were quantitatively assayed and grouped as follows: (i) aetiologic burden (eb, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia); (ii) putative burden (pb, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  fusobacterium nucleatum, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia); (iii) health-associated burden (hab, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula). results: after mutual adjustment for eb, pb and hab, the bop prevalence increased by 45% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of eb while bop decreased by 13% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of hab. mean pd increased 0.8 mm and decreased 0.3 mm from the first to fourth quartiles of eb (p<0.0001) and hab ( p<0.0001), respectively. among 1214 plaque samples with fourth quartile eb, 60% were collected from sites with pd < or =3 mm. conclusion: bacterial species believed to be aetiologically related to periodontitis were associated with bop in sites with minimal pd and/or attachment level (al). species presumed to be associated with periodontal health demonstrated inverse associations with bop.

TI  == implant surface analysis and microbiologic evaluation of failed implants retrieved from smokers.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. after implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. periodontal pathogens such as aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples  and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.

TI  == the impact of a low-frequency chlorhexidine rinsing schedule on the subgingival microbiota (the teeth clinical trial).
AB  == background: information on the efficacy of chlorhexidine (chx) rinsing on the subgingival microbiota is limited. this study tested if intermittent chx rinsing  over 5 years had an impact on the subgingival microbiota. methods: subgingival plaque samples were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method in  a double-blind randomized chx rinse study. results: a total of 210 subjects were  included. the mean age of the subjects was 71.7 (+/- 4.1) years, and 56.2% were women. evidence of alveolar bone loss was found in 39% of subjects. bacterial loads were not correlated significantly with probing depth. at year 5, subjects in the chx rinse group with no evidence of bone loss presented with lower total bacterial counts than control subjects with no bone loss. the levels of the following bacteria were significantly lower in the chx group: lactobacillus acidophilus (p <0.05), eikenella corrodens (p <0.05), fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum (p <0.01), treponema denticola (p <0.05), leptotrichia buccalis (p <0.05), and eubacterium saburreum (p <0.05). no differences in bacterial loads were found between chx and control rinse subjects with alveolar bone loss. conclusions: older subjects with or without periodontitis carry a large variety of bacteria associated with periodontitis. intermittent rinsing with chx may provide a preventive benefit in reducing levels of bacteria but only in subjects  without alveolar bone loss.

TI  == the detection of eight putative periodontal pathogens in adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients: an institutional study.
AB  == purpose: periodontal disease is a commonly prevalent problem faced alike by both  the developed and third world countries but showing wide variations in prevalence and severity across different geographical areas. the purpose was to identify actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), ekinella corrodens (ec), campylobacter rectus (cr), bacteroides forsythus (bf), treponema denticola (td) and fusobacterium nucleatum  (fn) in indian adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients. materials and methods: paper points were used to collect the sample from 28 sites in both adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis (8 healthy/20 diseased sites) patients and dna analysis done. the categorical data was analysed by fishers exact test and difference in the clinical parameters was tested by mann-whitney test. results: in healthy sites of adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients, aa, ec, bf and aa, pg, pi, td, fn were detected respectively. however, when diseased and healthy sites were compared in  both adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients respectively, only pg( p =0.004), cr( p =0.04), fn( p =0.014) and pg( p =0.002),  cr( p =0.02), fn( p =0.008) were statistically significant. conclusion: the prevalence of the microorganisms correlate with the clinical parameters like probing depth and bleeding on probing as seen in the japanese and western periodontitis patients' population.

TI  == microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. methods: ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period  of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. subsequently, a period of 21 days of  washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella parvula. the mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and p. melaninogenica. conclusion: the tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a  role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.

TI  == association of eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola with human periodontitis lesions.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with  chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. method: subgingival  plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. the samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples = 21,832). mean counts, % dna probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. significance of difference between groups was determined using the mann-whitney test. association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of p. gingivalis plus t. forsythia  less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. all analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: for the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens p. gingivalis and t. forsythia as well as eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. there were significantly more capnocytophaga gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii and veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. e. nodatum, t. denticola, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher  counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions  of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. conclusions: this investigation confirmed the strong association of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of e. nodatum and t. denticola  with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. other species, including s. oralis, eikenella corrodens, s.  intermedius and f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were present in low proportions.

TI  == sampling strategy for intraoral detection of periodontal pathogens before and following periodontal therapy.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to identify a sampling strategy with high probability for detecting oral colonization by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, tannerella  forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola before and following mechanical periodontal therapy. methods: samples were taken from the following intraoral sites in 35 patients with untreated chronic periodontitis before and 1.5, 3, and 6 months after non-surgical periodontal therapy: supra- and subgingival plaque from the deepest pockets in each sextant; pooled supra- and subgingival plaque from another six randomly selected, less affected teeth; mucosal swab samples from the tongue, tonsils, throat, and buccal mucosa; and stimulated and unstimulated saliva. microbial species were identified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: of the sampling of all assessed sites, the highest probability for simultaneously detecting the tested pathogens was found in respect to the combination of supra-  and subgingival plaque samples taken from the most affected tooth in each sextant in untreated patients (probability: 83% to 95% for the assessed bacteria). these  results were consistently observed throughout the study period. conclusions: for  determining the intraoral carrier state of patients with periodontitis, a combined sample of supra- and subgingival plaque taken from the deepest periodontal pocket in each sextant may yield the most reliable result. this sampling strategy may be used in routine microbial testing and clinical research.

TI  == effectiveness of ultrasonic instruments in the therapy of severe periodontitis: a comparative clinical-microbiological assessment with curettes.
AB  == patients with deep periodontal pockets were treated with either vector system (tg) or manual instruments (cg). clinical assessments by supragingival plaque (pl+), gingival index (gi), bleeding on probing (bop), probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal) and subgingival plaque collection for microbiological analysis were made prior to and after treatment. multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. gi, pd, cal and the number of bop+ sites underwent a significant reduction over time in both groups. when compared to baseline, the pair-wise analyses showed significantly lower pd and cal at 6 months in the cg and significant reductions in the gi, pd, cal and a number of bop+ sites at 3 and 6 months in the tg. for microbiological results, significant  reductions were seen for c. rectus and r. gingivalis in the cg and for t. forsythensis, e. corrodens and t. denticola in the tg. the total bacterial count  underwent a reduction in both groups. both ultrasonic and manual debridement are  equally effective in non-surgical periodontal therapy of severe periodontitis in  terms of clinical and microbiological effects.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in atheromatous plaques by quantitative pcr.
AB  == this is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial dna from ten species, including periodontal species and chlamydia pneumoniae. we examined 129 samples of dna extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16s rdna sequences from ten different species: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), tannerella forsythensis, eikenella corrodens, prevotella intermedia, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, treponema denticola and c. pneumoniae. all determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods employing sybr green. species from the bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. almost half of the samples contained dna from a. a. and c. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. s. aureus and s. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. s. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. the proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic dna. the data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. we conclude  that dna from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of c. pneumoniae  to the inflammation may be minimal.

TI  == streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  == previously, we reported that intracellular actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal  epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. in this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using  the same double-labeling techniques to identify fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, oral campylobacter species, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. all those species were found within buccal cells. in every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular  flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (g. adiacens). this is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.

TI  == distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria in saliva samples from japanese children  and their mothers.
AB  == objective: we analyzed the distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola) in children, and then compared their distribution in those children and their mothers, with special attention given to three of the species  known as the red complex (p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, and t. denticola) whose presence has been shown to be associated with conditions related to periodontal diseases. methods: one hundred thirteen pairs of children and their mothers were  randomly selected from patients treated at the pedodontic clinic of osaka university dental hospital. saliva samples were taken at the second visit prior to receiving professional tooth brushing instruction. genomic dna was extracted from each saliva sample, followed by a polymerase chain reaction assay with species-specific sets of primers. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans was the most  frequently detected species in the mothers, followed by c. sputigena, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythensis, while c. sputigena had the highest detection rate, followed by a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola in the children. the  detection rate of the red complex species in children whose mothers possessed the same species was significantly higher than in those whose mothers did not possess them. conclusions: our results indicate a correlation between the presence of periodontal bacteria in children and their mothers, while the presence of red complex bacteria in children was highly associated with that in their mothers.

TI  == dna probe identification of bacteria colonizing internal surfaces of the implant-abutment interface: a preliminary study.
AB  == background: currently, there is limited knowledge concerning the specific genus and species of bacteria that may colonize internal surfaces of the implant-abutment interface (iai) of two-stage dental implants. the purpose of this study was to use dna probe analysis to identify those periodontopathic bacteria that may inhabit the internal surfaces and healing abutment screw-threads of the iai of dental implants in situ. methods: following osseointegration, bacterial samples for dna probe analysis were obtained from 54  two-stage hydroxyapatite plasma spray-coated implants in 32 patients. using sterile paper points, samples were obtained from the iai of 43 implants and the screw-threads of healing abutments in the other 11 implants. dna probes were available to detect the following microbes: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola. results: all samples taken from healing abutment screw-threads were negative for all target microbes. the aggregate percentage of positive results for each target microbe for samples from internal surfaces of the iai were: 41.9%, a. actinomycetemcomitans, 60.5%, t. forsythensis; 44.2%, c rectus; 60.5%,  e. corrodens; 48.8%, f. nucleatum; 46.5%, p. gingivalis; 55.8%, p. intermedia; and 51.2%, t. denticola. in addition, no significant differences were noted between colonization of individual microbial species when comparing anterior to posterior and maxillary to mandibular implant sites. conclusions: moderate to high levels of eight different periodontopathic microbes inhabiting the internal  surfaces of the iai of 43 two-stage implants in partially edentulous patients were identified by dna probe analysis. the microbes colonized these surfaces within 25 days following the second stage surgery and placement of the healing abutment. in contrast, all samples obtained from screw-threads of 11 healing abutments were dna probe negative. these findings appear to support those of other investigations demonstrating the translocation of bacteria from residual dentition to implants.

TI  == microbiological shifts in intra- and extraoral habitats following mechanical periodontal therapy.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the present study was to analyze the intra- and extraoral  colonization dynamics of periodontal pathogens following supra- and subgingival debridement. material and methods: thirty five patients with chronic periodontitis were enrolled in the study. supra- and subgingival plaque samples,  saliva, and swab samples from mucosa and extraoral sites were taken at baseline and 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after mechanical periodontal therapy. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), eikenella corrodens (ec), tannerella forsythensis (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), prevotella nigrescens (pn), and treponema denticola (td) were identified by pcr. results: supra- and subgingival debridement decreased the number of subgingival sites infected with the analyzed pathogens only transiently, if at all. however, the detection frequencies of tf, td, ec, pi, and pn in the supragingival region, of pg, td, and pn at the oral mucosa sites (mostly the tongue), and of all pathogens except aa in saliva increased over the 6-month observation period. td was the only pathogen recorded in notable quantities in the extraoral habitat (external ear canal). conclusion: the results indicate that supra- and subgingival debridement results in a dissemination of periodontal pathogens within the oral cavity.

TI  == microbial profile on metallic and ceramic bracket materials.
AB  == the placement of orthodontic appliances creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of a microbiota and food residues, which, in time, may cause caries  or exacerbate any pre-existing periodontal disease. the purpose of the present study was to compare the total bacterial counts present on metallic and ceramic orthodontic brackets in order to clarify which bracket type has a higher plaque retaining capacity and to determine the levels of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp on both types of brackets. thirty-two metallic brackets and 24  ceramic brackets were collected from orthodontic patients at the day of debonding. two brackets were collected from each patient; one from a maxillary central incisor and another from a maxillary second premolar. sixteen patients who used metallic brackets and 12 patients who used ceramic brackets were sampled. bacterial populations were studied using "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization, which uses dna probes to identify species in complex microbial samples. the significance of differences between groups was determined using the  mann-whitney u-test. results showed no significant differences between metallic and ceramic brackets with respect to the caries-inducing s mutans and l acidophilus spp counts. mean counts of 8 of 35 additional species differed significantly between metallic and ceramic brackets with no obvious pattern favoring one bracket type over the other. this study showed higher mean counts of treponema denticola, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, streptococcus anginosus, and eubacterium nodatum on metallic brackets while higher counts of eikenella corrodens, campylobacter showae, and selenomonas noxia were found on ceramic brackets.

TI  == periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  == background: little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. we assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. methods: plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. using species-specific primers of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola, pcr amplification was performed with bacterial genomic dna from plaque samples. results: the results indicated that c. rectus, e. corrodens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, and c. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while b. forsythus and p. intermedia were detected less frequently, and p. gingivalis and t. denticola were not found. in contrast, the percentage of p.  nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. subject-based analyses suggested that the  number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. conclusions: the colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. however, colonization by p. gingivalis and t. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.

TI  == the localization of periodontal-disease-associated bacteria in human periodontal  pockets.
AB  == some gram-negative anaerobes are associated with the incidence and progression of periodontal disease. in periodontal pockets, however, the localization of those bacteria is unknown. we investigated the localization of 5 bacterial species in human periodontal pockets. fifteen teeth with a part of periodontal pockets from  10 adult periodontitis patients were obtained, and the localization of bacteria was examined immunohistochemically. positive reactions with anti-prevotella nigrescens antibody were located at the epithelium-associated plaque area in the  middle pocket zones. in the middle and deep pocket zones, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola were especially localized in the unattached plaque area,  but eikenella corrodens was observed in the tooth-attached plaque area. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, detected in 2 of 15 samples examined, was found in the unattached plaque area, in the middle pocket zone. the present findings indicated that the 5 bacterial species examined localized at distinct regions in human periodontal pockets.

TI  == relationship of periodontopathic bacteria with early-onset periodontitis in down's syndrome.
AB  == background: down's syndrome (ds) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of ds periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 ds young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (md). the prevalence of 10 possible  periodontopathic bacterial species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. the detection of p. gingivalis fima genotypes was also performed in p. gingivalis-positive samples. results: although ds subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with md, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. the profiles of  subjects with periodontitis were significant in ds, but not in md. the prevalence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. intermedia were significant in the ds periodontitis group, compared to ds gingivitis group. moreover, the occurrence of p. gingivalis with the type ii fima gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both ds and md, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. conclusions: these results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in ds is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including p. gingivalis with type ii fima.

AB  == it has been assumed that there is a relationship between periodontal diseases and diabetes mellitus, however the putative periodontal microorganisms in non-diabetes mellitus (non-dm) individuals and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) patients have not been well studied. in this study, the detection rates of 5 putative periodontal pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, and candida albicans by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) between niddm  and non-dm adults were compared. a total of 246 adults were randomly recruited and periodontal parameters including: plaque index (p1i), gingival index (gi), probing depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected by sterile curettes from the most diseased and healthy sites based on pd and al. the differences in periodontal parameters and microbiological data in healthy and diseased sites between non-dm and niddm patients were compared by chi-square analysis. the results showed no significant  differences in age, gender, gi, p1i, pd, and prevalence of the 5 microorganisms between the niddm and the non-diabetic groups. however, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans, the prevalence of the periodontal microorganisms tested was significantly higher (p <0.001) in diseased sites than in the healthy sites in both groups. the p1i, gi, pd and al were significantly higher in t. denticola  positive sites than in negative sites. the results suggested that p. gingivalis,  t. denticola, e. corrodens and c. albicans may play important roles in the periodontitis of both niddm and non-dm individuals, however the etiology of periodontitis in both groups may not be different from each other.

TI  == comparison of profiles of key periodontal pathogens in periodontium and endodontium.
AB  == despite the established anatomical relationship between the periodontal and pulpal tissues, bacterial migration between endodontium and periodontium is still under discussion. the objective of this study was an investigation of profiles of periodontal pathogens in pulpal and periodontal diseases affecting the same tooth by means of 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr). 31 intact teeth with both pulp and marginal infections were investigated. the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiological examination. samples were taken from the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket, respectively, with sterile paper points before trepanation of the teeth. after trepanation sterile paper points and hedstroem files were used for taking samples from the root canal. specific pcr methods were used to detect the presence of the following pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. in addition, quantitative competitive pcr was used to determine the total bacterial count of the samples. the investigated pathogens were proven to be present in the endondontium in all disease categories. particularly in endodontic samples of "chronic apical periodontitis" and "chronic adult periodontitis" profiles of the periodontal pathogens were found. the results confirmed that periodontal pathogens often accompany endodontic infections and supported the idea that the periodontic-endodontic interrelationships should be considered as critical pathways which might contribute to refractory courses of endodontic or periodontal diseases.

TI  == prevalence of periodontal pathogens in localized and generalized forms of early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == the primary objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of 8 putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with early-onset periodontitis (eop) and to evaluate the microbial differences between localized and generalized forms of this periodontal disease condition. thirty-one females and 11 males with a mean age of 30.3 (s.d. 4.0) years were examined. seventeen subjects had generalized (geop) and 25 had localized early-onset periodontitis (leop). subgingival plaque samples were assayed using pcr which provided subject prevalence data for the pathogens; bacteroides forsythus 78.6%, treponema denticola 88.1%, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans 19.0%, porphyromonas gingivalis 16.7%, prevotella intermedia 40.4%, prevotella nigrescens 61.9%, eikenella corrodens 42.3% and campylobacter rectus 92.8%. only 3 healthy sites harbored one or more of these periodontal pathogens. seven of the 8 subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans had leop. p. intermedia was present in 58.8% of geop compared with 28% of leop subjects (p=0.046). at 82.4% of geop sites p. nigrescens was present while this bacteria was detected at 52% of leop (p=0.044). p. gingivalis was isolated from 22.6% of females but no male subjects  (p=0.084). c. rectus was recovered from all female subjects compared to 72.7% of  males (p=0.014). a. actinomycetemcomitans (37.5%) and c. rectus (86.5%) were more frequently identified in non-smokers compared to 7.6% and 68.8% of smokers, respectively (p <0.05). microbial associations coincided with the clinical division of the cases into leop and geop in 83% of the subjects.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == periodontopathic bacteria in english hiv-seropositive persons.
AB  == selected periodontopathic bacteria were sought in 20 hiv-infected english patients and eight noninfected control subjects with similar periodontal status,  using highly specific dna probes. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. a), porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently detected and were found at higher levels in hiv-infected individuals than in controls. significantly increased levels of treponema denticola but, in contrast, lower levels of eikenella corrodens were found in nonbleeding sites of hiv-infected patients compared with  controls. the results of the present investigation on english patients suggest a  periodontopathogenic role for a. a, p. gingivalis and c. rectus, and possibly p.  intermedia and are in general accord with most previously reported data from the  united states. longitudinal studies are now required to determine more precisely  the association between periodontopathic microflora, immune competence and periodontal health and disease in hiv-infected persons.

TI  == the prevalence of pathogenic periodontal microflora in healthy young adult smokers.
AB  == background: smoking is a major risk factor in periodontitis, although the mechanisms of its effects are not well understood. the overall goal of this clinical study was to determine if smoking enhances the colonization of the oral  cavity by pathogenic bacteria in a periodontitis-free population. the prevalence  of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola was investigated in 25 smokers and 25 non-smokers by using dna probes. methods: the subjects were 21 to 35 years of  age with a healthy periodontium or slight gingivitis and were systemically healthy. the test group included subjects who had a minimum of a 1.5 pack-year history of smoking, while the control subjects never smoked. subgingival plaque samples were taken by paper point following the assessment of multiple clinical parameters. results: this investigation showed: 1) no statistically significant differences were noted in any clinical parameter measured between the groups; 2)  of the 8 subjects who were infected by at least 1 tested pathogen, seven were smokers (p= 0.02); 3) infected smokers had a 15.7+/-3.5 pack-year history and smoked a mean of 27+/-5 cigarettes/day versus 4.4+/-0.8 pack years and 15+/-1 cigarettes/day for the non-infected smokers (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.004); and 4) smokers were 18 times more likely to exhibit the presence of pathogens than non-smokers. conclusions: these data indicate that the prevalence of colonization of the sulcus by pathogenic bacterial species in periodontitis-free individuals is related to the quantity and duration of cigarette smoking.

TI  == periodontopathic bacteria in children with down syndrome.
AB  == background: it is widely known that individuals with down syndrome (ds) often develop severe early-onset periodontal diseases. in this study, we examined the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in ds children to determine if specific pathogens are acquired in their childhood. methods: the subjects were 60 ds children (2 to 13 years old, 5 in each age bracket) and 60 age-matched controls.  ten pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, p nigrescens,  capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, campyrobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were surveyed in subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction. periodontal status was evaluated by probing depth, bleeding on probing, and gingival index. results: no significant difference in periodontal status was  observed between the ds and control groups, however, all of the pathogens were detected with greater frequency in the ds children. b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and c. rectus were significantly prevalent throughout all age brackets of the ds children (p <0.01 or 0.05). the occurrence of p. gingivalis was also significant in the ds subjects over 5 years old. a cluster analysis of the microbial profiles of the ds subjects showed that gingivitis severity was associated with increased varieties of the harboring pathogens and the distribution of p. gingivalis. conclusions: these results suggest that various periodontopathogens can colonize in the very early childhood of ds patients and maturation of subgingival components, including p. gingivalis, plays an important role in the initiation of gingival inflammation.

TI  == early-onset periodontitis associated with down's syndrome--clinical interventional study.
AB  == individuals with down's syndrome (ds) have an increased prevalence of periodontal disease compared with otherwise normal, age-matched control groups and other mentally handicapped patients of similar age distribution. the exaggerated immune-inflammatory response of the tissues cannot be explained by poor oral hygiene alone and might be the result of an impaired cell-mediated and humoral immunity and a deficient phagocytic system. as far as the progression and severity of destruction, the oral manifestations of ds patients are consistent with the juvenile periodontitis (jp) disease pattern. the purpose of the present  study was 1) to assess the periodontal clinical and microbiological status of 10  ds patients aged 20 to 31 years (mean: 26.3 years) relative to that of 11 patients with cerebral palsy (cp) aged 23 to 53 years (mean: 36 years) without defective immunological functions, and 2) to determine the effect of supragingival plaque control and oral hygiene instruction in these patient groups. subsequent to the initial examination and a professional tooth cleaning program, clinical and microbiological parameters were monitored over a period of  12 weeks. the clinical examination included the recording of plaque index (p1), gingival index (gi), probing depth (pd), and clinical attachment level (cal). subgingival plaque samples were always obtained from the same pocket with the highest disease activity (deepest bleeding site at baseline examination) in each  subject for a morphotype analysis by dark field microscopy and for identification and quantitation of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, and campylobacter rectus by dna probes. the results of the baseline examinations demonstrated that ds patients and patients with cerebral palsy had inflamed gingiva associated with a high amount of plaque. the mean probing depth and percentage of sites with probing depth> 4 mm corresponded to age and poor oral hygiene in cp patients. deep pockets in ds patients demonstrated a high prevalence of periodontal disease compared with age-matched children with mental retardation and non-handicapped patients. regarding the young age of onset, the severe destruction of periodontal tissues and pathogenesis of periodontitis in ds patients are consistent with the  juvenile periodontitis disease pattern. the missing clinical benefit and alteration of the subgingival flora following supragingival plaque control in ds  patients underlined the alteration in the immunological response.

TI  == subgingival microbial profile of papillon-lefevre patients assessed by dna-probes.
AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == association of oral spirochetes from periodontally healthy sites with development of gingivitis.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the presence of selected disease-associated bacteria in health-associated plaque correlated with  future gingivitis. sites of periodontal health were identified in 65 adults. six  months later (recall 1) plaque was collected from sites that remained in periodontal health, and 5 species of specific bacteria and pathogen-related oral  spirochetes were detected using monoclonal antibodies in a microscopic assay. members of the spirochete morphogroup were also identified by phase contrast microscopy. the relationship between site-specific detection of bacteria at recall 1 and development of gingivitis at recall 2 or 3 was evaluated by means of logistic regression using generalized estimating equations, from which odds ratios (or) were estimated. significance was conservatively defined as or > 2.0 and p < 0.05. we found that 488 of 1,424 healthy sites developed gingivitis over  the 12-month interval between recall 1 and 3. only the spirochete morphogroup (or =2.04; p=0.002) was significantly associated with the transition from health to gingivitis. the association of treponema socranskii with future gingivitis was higher than expected (or=2.27), but the relationship was not statistically significant (p=0.163). campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, and pathogen-related oral spirochetes did not correlate well with gingivitis (or < 2.0). health-associated plaque from 5 sites contained treponema  denticola, and all 5 sites progressed to gingivitis. an or could not be calculated because t. denticola was not detected in health-associated plaque from stable healthy sites. these findings indicated that the presence of t. denticola  and unidentified spirochetes in health-associated plaque was associated with increased susceptibility to gingival inflammation. future studies assessing a larger panel of dental plaque microorganisms, with shorter intervals between baseline and follow-up assessment, are necessary to more fully evaluate the association between detection of specific organisms at healthy sites and risk for gingivitis.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == association of oral spirochetes from sites of periodontal health with development of periodontitis.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the presence of disease-associated bacteria in health-associated plaque correlated with susceptibility to periodontitis over time. sites of periodontal health were identified in 65 adults. six months later (recall 1), plaque was collected from sites that remained in periodontal health, and specific bacteria were detected using monoclonal antibodies in a microscopic assay. the spirochete morphogroup was identified by phase contrast microscopy. the relationship between detection at recall 1 and development of periodontitis over two successive 6-month intervals (recalls 2 and 3) was evaluated by means of logistic regression using generalized estimating equations (gee), from which odds ratios (or) were estimated and tested for significance. significant relationships were defined as  those having ors with p < 0.05. ninety-three of 1,032 sites developed signs of early periodontitis over the 12-month interval between recall 1 and recall 3. the spirochete morphogroup (or = 3.13, p < 0.001) and pathogen-related oral spirochetes (pros) (or = 3.68, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with healthy sites that developed periodontitis. the association of treponema socranskii was not significant (or = 3.62, p = 0.0918). odds ratios for campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and porphyromonas gingivalis were less than 2.0 and not significant. treponema denticola was not detected in health-associated plaque from stable health sites and was detected in only three  sites that progressed to periodontitis. these findings indicate that the presence of pros and some unidentified spirochetes in health-associated plaque is associated with increased susceptibility to periodontitis.

AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of young adults with and without early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the associations between putative periodontal pathogens and early-onset periodontitis (eop) in a population of 248 subjects, 13 to 19 years of age at baseline, derived from a representative sample of u.s. young adults. the subjects were selected based on the presence or absence of attachment loss at baseline. the attachment level was assessed clinically at baseline and at a 6-year follow-up examination, and the presence of 7 bacterial species was assessed at follow-up using dna probes. the individuals were classified into generalized, localized, incidental eop, and no-periodontitis groups based on the  extent and severity of attachment loss; and classified as having rapid, moderate, slow, and no progression based on the rate of periodontal progression during the  6 preceding years. in the eop groups there were significantly higher percentages  of individuals with detectable levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola. in addition, the eop group had significantly higher levels of these 5  microorganisms compared to the no-periodontitis group. there were also higher percentages of individuals with these species and higher levels of bacteria in the group showing disease progression than the group without progression. in a descending order of importance, p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and p. intermedia were the microorganisms significantly associated with the generalized and/or rapidly progressing disease. f. nucleatum and c. rectus were also associated with eop, but to a lesser degree. in the present population actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not significantly associated with eop, though it was recovered more often from subjects with localized eop. eikenella corrodens was present equally in subjects with and without disease. the results show that several bacterial species are associated with eop, and that p. gingivalis and t.  denticola are of particular importance and may play a significant role in the more severe and progressive forms of eop.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction detection of 8 putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of gingivitis and advanced periodontitis lesions.
AB  == a 16s rrna-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia. prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola in subgingival specimens of 50 advanced periodontitis, 50 adult gingivitis and 50 pediatric gingivitis subjects. the optimal pcr conditions were determined for each study species. agarose gel electrophoresis of pcr products from each study species revealed a single band of the predicted size. restriction enzyme digestion of amplicons confirmed the specificity of the amplification. pcr detection limits were in the range of 25-100 cells. no cross-reactivity with other oral micro-organisms or nonspecific amplification was observed. the prevalence by pcr in advanced periodontitis, adult gingivitis and pediatric gingivitis subjects was 30%, 14% and 14% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 86%, 18% and 8% for b. forsythus, 74%, 52% and 78% for c. rectus, 80%, 70% and 66% for e.  corrodens, 70%, 10% and 14% for p. gingivalis, 58%, 12% and 18% for p. intermedia, 52%, 20% and 22% for p. nigrescens, and 54%, 16% and 16% for t. denticola, respectively. the prevalence was higher in the advanced periodontitis  group than in both adult gingivitis and pediatric gingivitis for a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens  and t. denticola at p < 0.01, and for e. corrodens at p < 0.05. the prevalence of c. rectus was significantly higher in the advanced periodontitis group than in the adult gingivitis group at p < 0.01. matching results between pcr and culture  occurred in 28% (b. forsythus) to 71% (a. actinomycetemcomitans) of the samples;  the major discrepancy occurred in the pcr-positive/culture-negative category. matching results between pcr and dna probe methods were found in 84% of the subjects (b. forsythus) and 70% (p. gingivalis). odds ratio analysis revealed statistically significant positive associations between 17 of the 28 possible combinations (p < 0.01). this study demonstrated the utility of a 16s rrna-based  pcr detection method for identifying important subgingival microorganisms. the results indicated a strong association between the study species and periodontitis. several previously unreported symbiotic relationships were found between the 8 species tested.

TI  == associations between porphyromonas gingivalis and oral treponemes in subgingival  plaque.
AB  == colonization and/or proliferation of treponema denticola may depend on the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis. the aims of this study were to confirm this synergistic relationship, to determine whether other oral bacteria were similarly associated with p. gingivalis and to relate coinfection to the periodontal status of plaque donors. subgingival plaque was collected from every tooth except third  molars in 106 subjects who were grouped by their worst periodontal condition. in  addition to p. gingivalis, monoclonal antibodies were used to identify campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, t. denticola, treponema socranskii and pathogen-related oral spirochetes. associations of these bacteria with coinfection by p. gingivalis were assessed by estimated odds ratios. the results  indicate that coinfection with p. gingivalis is linked to all tested bacteria, but each pair was associated with distinct periodontal conditions. the distribution of coinfected sites suggests biased colonization of facial surfaces  over lingual surfaces.

AB  == it is generally recognized that bacteria in dental plaque at sites of periodontal diseases are not commonly found at sites of periodontal health. one hypothesis to explain the etiology of periodontitis is that pathogenic bacteria from diseased sites infect healthy sites. it has been suggested that gingival inflammation may  predispose sites to colonization by bacteria associated with periodontal diseases. the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether the  detection frequency of selected bacteria at sites of periodontal health or gingivitis differed between subjects who were in good periodontal health, subjects who had gingivitis, or subjects with periodontitis. the clinical status  of every tooth (except third molars) from 106 subjects was characterized by means of clinical attachment level, probing depth and by signs of inflammation. subgingival plaque was collected from mesio-facial and disto-lingual surfaces. specific monoclonal antibodies were used in an immunocytochemical assay to identify campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pathogen-related oral spirochetes (pros, using treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum monoclonal antibodies), t. denticola (serotypes a-d), t. socranskii subspecies buccale and t. socranskii subspecies socranskii. differences in detection of bacteria between groups of subjects were measured using odds ratios  (or). results of this study indicate that pros was the only identified bacterium  at sites of both health and gingivitis that demonstrated a significant positive relationship with the presence of periodontitis. these findings do not prove that bacteria spread from periodontitis sites, nor do they imply that disease necessarily results from infection. however, these data do suggest that some bacteria associated with periodontitis are more likely than others to tolerate conditions at healthy sites and that the presence of periodontitis increases risk of infection at healthy sites.

TI  == detection of putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival specimens by 16s ribosomal dna amplification with the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the utility of the 16s ribosomal rna-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola was examined and compared with that of anaerobic culture. primer pairs consisting of 20-27 nucleotides amplified 404- to 688-bp regions of 16s ribosomal rna genes of these organisms. this method had a lower detection limit of 50 target cells in a background of 10(7) cells. its specificity for b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, and t. denticola seemed high. the primers for a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, and p. intermedia cross-reacted  with some closely related species but did not reveal amplification products in tests with more distantly related organisms. the primers for e. corrodens did not seem to cross-react with oral organisms. this pcr technique was sensitive, reproducible, and easy to perform. pcr-based amplification may prove valuable for the detection of some periodontal pathogens in crude subgingival specimens.

TI  == coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == to elucidate an ecological profile of several periodontopathogens, the authors examined the coaggregation between cells of porphyromonas gingivalis and oral bacterial strains including treponema denticola in vitro. coaggregation between cells of plaque bacteria was examined by visual assay and phase-contrast microscope. p. gingivalis cells coaggregated with strains of t. denticola and treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii, but did not coaggregate with t. socranskii subspecies buccale, t. socranskii subspecies paredis, treponema vincentii, or treponema pectinovorum. the extracted hemagglutinin from p. gingivalis was active agglutinating t. denticola cells. addition of serum and saliva somewhat affected the coaggregation, but no effects of tested sugars or amino acids were found. heat treatment of t. denticola cells did not reduce the coagregation: heat treatment of p. gingivalis cells eliminated it. growth inhibitory activity among these bacterial species was examined by the stab culture method. strains of t. denticola atcc 35404 and 35405 and t. vincentii inhibited the growth of some p. gingivalis strains, but not others. no strain of  treponema was inhibited by black-pigmented anaerobic rods. the coaggregation observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola indicates the potential importance of their simultaneous existence in human periodontal pockets and development of the disease.

TI  == bacteriological diagnosis of periodontal disease.
AB  == dental plaque bacteria cause virtually all the forms of inflammatory periodontal  disease. periodontitis is caused by the specific periodontopathic bacteria, which induce destruction of connective tissue attachment and adjacent alveolar bone. examinations to identify the infections by porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens and treponema denticola have recently become essential in diagnosis of periodontal disease. bacterial examination permits (1) identification of the causative bacteria, (2) assessment of disease activity and (3) monitoring of the effective  of periodontal treatments. the author describes details of accurate and rapid methods for detecting periodontopathogens. transmission of periodontopathic bacteria as clarified by bacterial examination is also discussed in this review.  the pathogenic potential of specific bacteria varies among patients and periodontally healthy individuals and can be controlled by host defense mechanisms such as immune responses. the roles of immune responses against periodontopathic bacteria in balance shifts of periodontal disease processes are  therefore also discussed in this review.

TI  == comparison of dna probe and elisa microbial analysis methods and their association with adult periodontitis.
AB  == the purposes of this study were two-fold: to compare the dna probe and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) microbial identification tests and correlate the levels of microorganisms with adult periodontitis. a single plaque sample were taken from each of 2 sites in 52 patients. twelve of these patients were also sampled during and after treatment. the experimental site had clinical indicators of disease (bleeding on probing, probing and attachment loss of > or = 6 mm) and the contralateral site (control) was clinically healthy. a total of 176 plaque samples were collected, divided, processed, and sent for both types of quantitative microbial analyses. all of these samples were used to compare the dna probe and elisa methods while only the initial 104 pretreatment sites were used to correlate microorganisms/method with clinical indicators of adult periodontitis. dna probes were used to assay for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, and c. rectus. an elisa utilizing monoclonal antibodies was used to assay for p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, t. denticola, and c. rectus. comparison of the two methods revealed that the elisa test identified p. gingivalis and c. rectus significantly more often than the dna probe method and that t. denticola was detected more frequently with the dna probe. the sensitivities and specificities  varied widely among organisms and by test. p. gingivalis, as identified by elisa, had the highest degree of sensitivity and specificity (0.90 and 0.82 respectively) to clinical indicators of adult periodontitis.

TI  == detection of porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival exudate by a dipeptide-enhanced trypsin-like activity.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque is an important risk factor for future periodontal attachment loss in susceptible adults. the elimination of p. gingivalis is usually concomitant with a healing process. therefore, it should be valuable to have an easy chairside method to follow the effect of periodontal treatment on p. gingivalis detection as well as on its eventual reappearance during the maintenance period. we have previously reported the stimulation of amidolytic activity of p. gingivalis by the addition of glycyl-glycine to the assay buffer. in this study we determined the proportions of p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga spp, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens by cultivation technique and the amidolytic activity, using n-benzoyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide (bapna) as substrate, in gingival exudate before and during a 3-year treatment and maintenance period. p. gingivalis was the only species yielding a high and persistent correlation to stimulated amidolytic activity (p values < or = 0.0001) on both site (r = 0.5) and subject (r = 0.8) level. testing pure cultures of suggested periodontal pathogens for effect of glycyl-glycine on amidolytic activity, we found that of p. gingivalis to be 5.9-fold increased. the amidolytic activity of treponema denticola was only slightly stimulated (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 1.2) and that of capnocytophaga slightly inhibited (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 0.8). the  outcome of this study has the potential to be used for the development of a simple, rapid, and inexpensive assay for a qualitative and quantitative determination of p. gingivalis in gingival crevicular fluid.

TI  == dna probe detection of periodontopathogens in advanced periodontitis.
AB  == species-specific dna probes were used to determine the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, prevotella  intermedia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and wolinella recta in subgingival plaque from deep pockets/sites of patients with advanced periodontitis. the subjects were 20 patients with severe adult periodontitis, 13 men and 7 women (mean age 45.6 +/- 6.7 yr). for each subject, 9-10 subgingival sites with the deepest probing depths from each quadrant were sampled by the paper point method, a total of 198 sites, with mean probing depth  7.2 +/- 1.6 mm and clinical attachment level 9.5 +/- 2.7 mm. a.a. was present in  at least one site in 75% of the subjects; p. gingivalis was found in 95%; p. intermedia and w. recta were found in 90%, respectively; and t. denticola, e. corrodens, and f. nucleatum were found in all subjects. in the 198 samples, a.a.  was detected in 25.8%, p. gingivalis in 51.5%, p. intermedia in 64.1%, t. denticola in 60.6%, e. corrodens in 72.9%, f. nucleatum in 74.7%, and w. recta in 65.7%. the predominant combination was the simultaneous presence of p. intermedia, t. denticola, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and w. recta in 89.5% of the subjects and 46.8% of the sites. of these sites, 51.1% showed the combined presence of p. gingivalis and 28.4% that of both a.a. and p. gingivalis. none of  the seven bacteria could be detected in 14.4% of the total sites sampled. the present study indicates that severe destructive adult periodontitis is a multibacterial infection and that certain combinations of periodontopathogens seem to be important in the pathogenesis of the disease.

TI  == aspartame as a source of essential phenylalanine for the growth of oral anaerobes.
AB  == phenylalanine and aspartic acid requirements were determined for 13 species of oral bacteria using the chemically defined medium omiz-w1. none of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, selenomonas sputigena, treponema pectinovorum, t. socranskii, or wolinella recta required either of these amino acid constituents of aspartame (l-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine  methylester). phenylalanine was essential for the growth of capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium timidum, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. vincentii, while aspartic acid was not required. with the exception of e. timidum, all phenylalanine-dependent strains could grow  when the free amino acid was replaced by aspartame at concentrations at least 10-fold lower than those used for aspartame as an artificial sweetener.

TI  == [microbial flora of periodontitis and monitoring of the effect of initial preparation by immunofluorescence microscopy].
AB  == the effect of initial preparation in adult periodontitis was evaluated by changes in clinical parameters and immunofluorescence microscopic counts of periodontal disease associated bacteria. subgingival plaque samples were taken with sterilized paper points from 10 sites of 5 periodontally healthy persons and 44 sites of 23 adult periodontitis patients. twenty-one diseased sites were periodically examined after plaque control and scaling, root planing. the direct  immunofluorescence technique was used to detect bacteroides gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and wolinella recta were counted by the indirect immunofluorescence technique. the proportions of b. gingivalis, b. forsythus, f. nucleatum, e. corrodens, t. denticola and w. recta in periodontitis lesions were significantly higher than those in healthy sites. the proportions of b. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly related to gi, pli, bi and pd, those of b. forsythus and w. recta to gi, pli and bi, e. corrodens to gi and pli, and f. nucleatum to bi. reduced proportions of t. denticola were found in samples taken after establishment of proper plaque control. subgingival scaling and root planing resulted in the reduction of proportions of b. gingivalis, e. corrodens, t. denticola and b. forsythus in the samples. the samples from positive bleeding sites contained higher proportions of b. gingivalis, t. denticola, b. forsythus and w. recta than did resolved sites. the present study shows that the immunofluorescence technique which detects b. gingivalis, t. denticola and b. forsythus is useful in monitoring the efficacy of initial preparation.

TI  == lymphoproliferative responses to oral bacteria in humans with varying severities  of periodontal disease.
AB  == we assessed in vitro the lymphocyte blastogenic resp onsess of peripheral blood lymphocytes to antigen extracts of a large battery of oral microorganisms in a population of humans with varying severities of periodontal disease. when the magnitudes and frequencies of statistically positive blastogenic responses to various oral microorganisms were compared, three general patterns emerged. the actinomyces species proved to be potent stimulators of lymphocyte blastogenesis in most subjects tested, whereas streptococcus sanguis, campylobacter, and eikenella corrodens stimulated few individuals. the response to these organisms correlated poorly with the severity of periodontal disease in the tested patients. however, several gram-negative anaerobic organisms, including bacteroides asaccharolyticus and treponema denticola, elicited statistically more frequent positive response in subjects with destructive periodontitis compared with patients with gingivitis. these results, taken together with recent microbiological findings, suggest that the specificity of the lymphocyte blastogenic response to antigens of oral bacteria correlates with the presence of these organisms in the subgingival microflora during various periodontal disease  states.
