TI  == plant immunity triggered by engineered in vivo release of oligogalacturonides, damage-associated molecular patterns.
AB  == oligogalacturonides (ogs) are fragments of pectin that activate plant innate immunity by functioning as damage-associated molecular patterns (damps). we set out to test the hypothesis that ogs are generated in planta by partial inhibition of pathogen-encoded polygalacturonases (pgs). a gene encoding a fungal pg was fused with a gene encoding a plant polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (pgip) and expressed in transgenic arabidopsis plants. we show that expression of the pgip-pg chimera results in the in vivo production of ogs that can be detected by  mass spectrometric analysis. transgenic plants expressing the chimera under control of a pathogen-inducible promoter are more resistant to the phytopathogens botrytis cinerea, pectobacterium carotovorum, and pseudomonas syringae. these data provide strong evidence for the hypothesis that ogs released in vivo act as  a damp signal to trigger plant immunity and suggest that controlled release of these molecules upon infection may be a valuable tool to protect plants against infectious diseases. on the other hand, elevated levels of expression of the chimera cause the accumulation of salicylic acid, reduced growth, and eventually  lead to plant death, consistent with the current notion that trade-off occurs between growth and defense.

TI  == the f-box protein max2 contributes to resistance to bacterial phytopathogens in arabidopsis thaliana.
AB  == background: the arabidopsis thaliana f-box protein more axillary growth2 (max2) has previously been characterized for its role in plant development. max2 appears essential for the perception of the newly characterized phytohormone strigolactone, a negative regulator of polar auxin transport in arabidopsis. results: a reverse genetic screen for f-box protein mutants altered in their stress responses identified max2 as a component of plant defense. here we show that max2 contributes to plant resistance against pathogenic bacteria. interestingly, max2 mutant plants showed increased susceptibility to the bacterial necrotroph pectobacterium carotovorum as well as to the hemi-biotroph pseudomonas syringae but not to the fungal necrotroph botrytis cinerea. max2 mutant phenotype was associated with constitutively increased stomatal conductance and decreased tolerance to apoplastic ros but also with alterations in hormonal balance. conclusions: our results suggest that max2 previously characterized for its role in regulation of polar auxin transport in arabidopsis, and thus plant development also significantly influences plant disease resistance. we conclude that the increased susceptibility to p. syringae and p. carotovorum is due to increased stomatal conductance in max2 mutants promoting pathogen entry into the plant apoplast. additional factors contributing to pathogen susceptibility in max2 plants include decreased tolerance to pathogen-triggered apoplastic ros and alterations in hormonal signaling.

TI  == effect of oxygen on the growth and biofilm formation of xylella fastidiosa in liquid media.
AB  == xylella fastidiosa is a xylem-limited bacterial pathogen, and is the causative agent of pierce's disease of grapevines and scorch diseases of many other plant species. the disease symptoms are putatively due to blocking of the transpiration stream by bacterial-induced biofilm formation and/or by the formation of plant-generated tylosis. xylella fastidiosa has been classified as an obligate aerobe, which appears unusual given that dissolved o2 levels in the xylem during  the growing season are often hypoxic (20-60 mumol l(-1)). we examined the growth  and biofilm formation of three strains of x. fastidiosa under variable o2 conditions (21, 2.1, 0.21 and 0 % o2), in comparison to that of pseudomonas syringae (obligate aerobe) and erwinia carotovora (facultative anaerobe) under similar conditions. the growth of x. fastidiosa more closely resembled that of the facultative anaerobe, and not the obligate aerobe. xanthomonas campestris, the closest genetic relative of x. fastidiosa, exhibited no growth in an n2 environment, whereas x. fastidiosa was capable of growing in an n2 environment in pw(+), chards, and xdm2-pr media. the magnitude of growth and biofilm formation in the n2 (0 % o2) treatment was dependent on the specific medium. additional studies involving the metabolism of x. fastidiosa in response to low o2 are warranted. whether x. fastidiosa is classified as an obligate aerobe or a facultative anaerobe should be confirmed by gene activation and/or the quantification of the metabolic profiles under hypoxic conditions.

TI  == overexpression of the brassica rapa transcription factor wrky12 results in reduced soft rot symptoms caused by pectobacterium carotovorum in arabidopsis and chinese cabbage.
AB  == chinese cabbage (brassica rapa l. ssp. pekinensis), an important vegetable crop,  can succumb to diseases such as bacterial soft rot, resulting in significant loss of crop productivity and quality. pectobacterium carotovorum ssp. carotovorum (pcc) causes soft rot disease in various plants, including chinese cabbage. to overcome crop loss caused by bacterial soft rot, a gene from chinese cabbage was  isolated and characterised in this study. we isolated the brwrky12 gene from chinese cabbage, which is a group ii member of the wrky transcription factor superfamily. the 645-bp coding sequence of brwrky12 translates to a protein with  a molecular mass of approximately 24.4 kda, and brwrky12 was exclusively localised in the nucleus. transcripts of brwrky12 were induced by pcc infection in brassica. heterologous expression of brwrky12 resulted in reduced susceptibility to pcc but not to pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato in arabidopsis.  defence-associated genes, such as atpdf1.2 and atpgip2, were constitutively expressed in transgenic lines overexpressing brwrky12. the expression of atwkry12, which is the closest orthologue of brwrky12, was down-regulated by pcc  in arabidopsis. however, the atwrky12-2 mutants did not show any difference in response to pcc, pointing to a difference in function of wrky12 in brassica and arabidopsis. furthermore, brwrky12 in chinese cabbage also exhibited enhanced resistance to bacterial soft rot and increased the expression of defence-associated genes. in summary, brwrky12 confers enhanced resistance to pcc through transcriptional activation of defence-related genes.

AB  == the effect of surface-active substances (sas's) of acinetobacter calcoaceticus imv b-7241, rhodococcus erythropolis imv ac-5017, and nocardia vaccinii k-8 on phytopathogenic bacteria has been studied. it was shown that the survival of cells (10(5)-10(7) in a milliliter) of the pseudomonas and xanthomonas phytopathogenic bacteria was found to be 0-33% after treatment with sas preparations of the imv ac-5017 and imv b-7241 strains for 2 h (0.15-0.4 mg/ml).  in the presence of n. vaccinii k-8 sas preparations (0.085-0.85 mg/ml), the number of cells of the majority of the studied phytopathogenic bacteria decreased by 95-100%. these data show prospects for using microbial sas's for the construction of ecologically friendly drugs for regulating the number of phytopathogenic bacteria.

TI  == a novel hairpin-like antimicrobial peptide from barnyard grass (echinochloa crusgalli l.) seeds: structure-functional and molecular-genetics characterization.
AB  == a novel plant hairpin-like defense polypeptide named ecamp3 was isolated from latent barnyard grass (echinochloa crusgalli l.) seeds. the native peptide and its recombinant analogue were characterized. ecamp3 displays antifungal and antibacterial activity in vitro. the gene family encoding ecamps precursor protein was also characterized; the genes and pseudogenes of this family show 97-100% homology. every member of ecamps precursor family contains seven identical cysteine motifs: c1xxxc2(11-13)c3xxxc4. one of those motifs corresponds to the isolated peptide. ecamp3 is the first member of the plant hairpin-like peptide family that inhibits the growth of phytopathogenic bacteria. obtained results can explain the nature of the complex resistance of barnyard grass to a variety of pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == elicitation of induced resistance against pectobacterium carotovorum and pseudomonas syringae by specific individual compounds derived from native korean  plant species.
AB  == plants have developed general and specific defense mechanisms for protection against various enemies. among the general defenses, induced resistance has distinct characteristics, such as broad-spectrum resistance and long-lasting effectiveness. this study evaluated over 500 specific chemical compounds derived  from native korean plant species to determine whether they triggered induced resistance against pectobacterium carotovorum supsp. carotovorum (pcc) in tobacco (nicotiana tabacum) and pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (pst) in arabidopsis thaliana. to select target compound(s) with direct and indirect (volatile) effects, a new petri-dish-based in vitro disease assay system with four compartments was developed. the screening assay showed that capsaicin, fisetin hydrate, jaceosidin, and farnesiferol a reduced the disease severity significantly in tobacco. of these four compounds, capsaicin and jaceosidin induced resistance against pcc and pst, which depended on both salicylic acid (sa) and jasmonic acid (ja) signaling, using arabidopsis transgenic and mutant lines, including npr1 and nahg for sa signaling and jar1 for ja signaling. the upregulation of the pr2 and pdf1.2 genes after pst challenge with capsaicin pre-treatment indicated that sa and ja signaling were primed. these results demonstrate that capsaicin and jaceosidin can be effective triggers of strong induced resistance against both necrotrophic and biotrophic plant pathogens.

TI  == de-novo design of antimicrobial peptides for plant protection.
AB  == this work describes the de-novo design of peptides that inhibit a broad range of  plant pathogens. four structurally different groups of peptides were developed that differ in size and position of their charged and hydrophobic clusters and were assayed for their ability to inhibit bacterial growth and fungal spore germination. several peptides are highly active at concentrations between 0,1 and 1 microg/ml against plant pathogenic bacteria, such as pseudomonas syringae, pectobacterium carotovorum, and xanthomonas vesicatoria. importantly, no hemolytic activity could be detected for these peptides at concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. moreover, the peptides are also active after spraying on the plant surface demonstrating a possible way of application. in sum, our designed peptides represent new antimicrobial agents and with the increasing demand for antimicrobial compounds for production of "healthy" food, these peptides might serve as templates for novel antibacterial and antifungal agents.

TI  == the fire blight pathogen erwinia amylovora requires the rpon gene for pathogenicity in apple.
AB  == rpon is a sigma(54) factor regulating essential virulence gene expression in several plant pathogenic bacteria, including pseudomonas syringae and pectobacterium carotovorum. in this study, we found that mutation of rpon in the  fire blight pathogen erwinia amylovora caused a nonpathogenic phenotype. the e. amylovora rpon tn5 transposon mutant rpon1250::tn5 did not cause fire blight disease symptoms on shoots of mature apple trees. in detached immature apple fruits, the rpon1250::tn5 mutant failed to cause fire blight disease symptoms and grew to population levels 12 orders of magnitude lower than the wild-type. in addition, the rpon1250::tn5 mutant failed to elicit a hypersensitive response when infiltrated into nonhost tobacco plant leaves, and rpon1250::tn5 cells failed to express hrpn protein when grown in hrp (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity)-inducing liquid medium. a plasmid-borne copy of the wild-type rpon gene complemented all the rpon1250::tn5 mutant phenotypes tested. the rpon1250::tn5 mutant was prototrophic on minimal solid and liquid media, indicating that the rpon1250::tn5 nonpathogenic phenotype was not caused by a defect in basic metabolism or growth. this study provides clear genetic evidence  that rpon is an essential virulence gene of e. amylovora, suggesting that rpon has the same function in e. amylovora as in p. syringae and pe. carotovorum.

TI  == modulation of quorum sensing in acylhomoserine lactone-producing or -degrading tobacco plants leads to alteration of induced systemic resistance elicited by the rhizobacterium serratia marcescens 90-166.
AB  == numerous root-associated bacteria (rhizobacteria) are known to elicit induced systemic resistance (isr) in plants. bacterial cell-density-dependent quorum sensing (qs) is thought to be important for isr. here, we investigated the role of qs in the isr elicited by the rhizobacterium, serratia marcescens strain 90-166, in tobacco. since s. marcescens 90-166 produces at least three qs signals, qs-mediated isr in strain 90-166 has been difficult to understand. therefore, we investigated the isr capacity of two transgenic tobacco (nicotiana  tabacum) plants that contained either bacterial acylhomoserine lactone-producing  (ahl) or -degrading (aiia) genes in conjunction with s. marcescens 90-166 to induce resistance against bacterial and viral pathogens. root application of s. marcescens 90-166 increased isr to the bacterial pathogens, pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci, in ahl plants and decreased isr in aiia plants. in contrast, isr to cucumber mosaic virus was reduced in ahl plants treated with s. marcescens 90-166 but enhanced in aiia plants. taken together, these data indicate that qs-dependent isr is elicited by  s. marcescens 90-166 in a pathogen-dependent manner. this study provides insight  into qs-dependent isr in tobacco elicited by s. marcescens 90-166.

TI  == one shot-two pathogens blocked: exposure of arabidopsis to hexadecane, a long chain volatile organic compound, confers induced resistance against both pectobacterium carotovorum and pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == bacteria and plant derived volatile organic compounds have been reported as the chemical triggers that elicit induced resistance in plants. previously, volatile  organic compounds (vocs), including acetoin and 2,3-butanediol, were found to be  emitted from plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (pgpr) bacillus subtilis gb03,  which had been shown to elicit isr and plant growth promotion. more recently, we  reported data that stronger induced resistance could be elicited against pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola es4326 in plants exposed to c13 voc from another pgpr paenibacillus polymyxa e681 compared with that of strain gb03. here, we assessed whether another long hydrocarbon c16 hexadecane (hd) conferred protection to arabidopsis from infection of a biotrophic pathogen, p. syringae pv maculicola and a necrotrophic pathogen, pectobacterium carotovorum subsp carotovorum. collectively, long-chain vocs can be linked to a plant resistance activator for protecting plants against both biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens at the same time.

TI  == effects of pesticides on the reduction of plant and human pathogenic bacteria in  application water.
AB  == overhead spray applications of in-field tomato treatments dissolved in aqueous solutions have specific pest targets (fungal, bacterial, insect, or other). any organism present in the solution or on treated plant surfaces that is not a specific target of the application is unlikely inactivated and can instead be spread through the phyllosphere. in this laboratory study, commercially labeled pesticides (including actigard 50wg, bravo weather stik 6f, cabrio 20eg, kasumin, kocide 3000 46wg, oxidate 27l, penncozeb 75df, prophyt 54.5l, stimplex 100l, firewall, 22.4wp, and tanos 50df) in common use in commercial tomato production fields of the eastern shore of virginia were investigated for activity against in vitro bacterial contamination of pesticide application waters. pesticides of interest were tank mixed individually with one of the plant pathogens ralstonia solanacearum, xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, or one of two serovars (newport and montevideo) of the human pathogen salmonella enterica to assess reduction values  during the average time between mixing and initial application. observations suggested that while some treatments had a noticeable effect on population levels, only the oxidizer, peroxyacetic acid, showed significant and consistent levels of suppression against all bacteria investigated, at levels that could have practical implications.

TI  == production of a de-novo designed antimicrobial peptide in nicotiana benthamiana.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are important defense compounds of higher organisms that can be used as therapeutic agents against bacterial and/or viral infections. we designed several antimicrobial peptides containing hydrophobic and positively charged clusters that are active against plant and human pathogens. especially peptide sp1-1 is highly active with a mic value of 0.1 mug/ml against xanthomonas vesicatoria, pseudomonas corrugata and pseudomonas syringae pv syringae. however, for commercial applications high amounts of peptide are necessary. the synthetic  production of peptides is still quite expensive and, depending on the physico-chemical features, difficult. therefore we developed a plant/tobacco mosaic virus-based production system following the 'full virus vector strategy' with the viral coat protein as fusion partner for the designed antimicrobial peptide. infection of nicotiana benthamiana plants with such recombinant virus resulted in production of huge amounts of virus particles presenting the peptides all over their surface. after extraction of recombinant virions, peptides were released from the coat protein by chemical cleavage. a protocol for purification  of the antimicrobial peptides using high resolution chromatographic methods has been established. finally, we yielded up to 0.025 mg of peptide per g of infected leaf biomass. mass spectrometric and nmr analysis revealed that the in planta produced peptide differs from the synthetic version only in missing of n-terminal amidation. but its antimicrobial activity was in the range of the synthetic one.  taken together, we developed a protocol for plant-based production and purification of biologically active, hydrophobic and positively charged antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == consequences of flagellin export through the type iii secretion system of pseudomonas syringae reveal a major difference in the innate immune systems of mammals and the model plant nicotiana benthamiana.
AB  == bacterial flagellin is perceived as a microbe (or pathogen)-associated molecular  pattern (mamp or pamp) by the extracellular pattern recognition receptors, fls2 and tlr5, of plants and mammals respectively. flagellin accidently translocated into mammalian cells by pathogen type iii secretion systems (t3sss) is recognized by nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor nlrc4 as a pattern of pathogenesis and induces a death-associated immune response. the non-pathogen pseudomonas fluorescens pf0-1, expressing a pseudomonas syringae t3ss, and the plant pathogen p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 were used to seek evidence of an analogous cytoplasmic recognition system for flagellin in the model plant nicotiana benthamiana. flagellin (flic) was secreted in culture and translocated  into plant cells by the t3ss expressed in pf0-1 and dc3000 and in their deltaflgghi flagellar pathway mutants. deltaflic and deltaflgghi mutants of pf0-1 and dc3000 were strongly reduced in elicitation of reactive oxygen species production and in immunity induction as indicated by the ability of challenge bacteria inoculated 6 h later to translocate a type iii effector-reporter and to  elicit effector-triggered cell death. agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in n. benthamiana of flic with or without a eukaryotic export signal peptide, coupled with virus-induced gene silencing of fls2, revealed no immune response that was not fls2 dependent. transiently expressed flic from dc3000 and pectobacterium carotovorum did notinduce cell death in n. benthamiana, tobacco or tomato leaves. flagellin is the major pseudomonas mamp perceived by n. benthamiana, and although flagellin secretion through the plant cell wall by the  t3ss may partially contribute to fls2-dependent immunity, flagellin in the cytosol does not elicit immune-associated cell death. we postulate that a death response to translocated mamps would produce vulnerability to the many necrotrophic pathogens of plants, such as p. carotovorum, which differ from p. syringae and other (hemi)biotrophic pathogens in benefitting from death-associated immune responses.

TI  == different roles of glycine-rich rna-binding protein7 in plant defense against pectobacterium carotovorum, botrytis cinerea, and tobacco mosaic viruses.
AB  == glycine-rich rna-binding protein7 (atgrp7) has previously been demonstrated to confer plant defense against pseudomonas syringae dc3000. here, we show that atgrp7 can play different roles in plant defense against diverse pathogens. atgrp7 enhances resistance against a necrotrophic bacterium pectobacterium carotovorum scc1 or a biotrophic virus tobacco mosaic virus. by contrast, atgrp7  plays a negative role in defense against a necrotrophic fungus botrytis cinerea.  these results provide evidence that atgrp7 is a potent regulator in plant defense response to diverse pathogens, and suggest that the regulation of rna metabolism  by rna-binding proteins is important for plant innate immunity.

TI  == disease resistance to pectobacterium carotovorum is negatively modulated by the arabidopsis lectin receptor kinase lecrk-v.5.
AB  == plant stomata function in disease resistance by restricting bacteria entry inside leaves. during plant-bacteria interactions, stomatal closure is initiated by the  recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (mamps). recently, we have shown that the lectin receptor kinase v.5 (lecrk-v.5) negatively regulates bacterium- and mamp-induced stomatal closure upstream of reactive oxygen species  (ros) production mediated by abscisic acid signaling. closed stomata in lecrk-v.5 mutants are correlated with constitutive high level of ros in guard cells. consequently, lecrk-v.5 mutants are more resistant to hemi-biotrophic pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv tomato dc3000 (pst dc3000). in this report, we further investigate the role of lecrk-v.5 in resistance against necrotrophic bacteria pectobacterium carotovorum ssp. carotovorum (pcc). upon surface-inoculation lecrk-v.5 mutants exhibited enhanced resistance against pcc whereas a wild-type level of resistance was observed using infiltration-inoculation, an inoculation method that bypasses the epidermal barrier. enhanced resistance of dip-inoculated lecrk-v.5 mutants against necrotrophic bacteria, that induce different defense responses than hemi-biotrophic bacteria, further suggests a possible role for lecrk-v.5 in stomatal immunity.

TI  == top 10 plant pathogenic bacteria in molecular plant pathology.
AB  == many plant bacteriologists, if not all, feel that their particular microbe should appear in any list of the most important bacterial plant pathogens. however, to our knowledge, no such list exists. the aim of this review was to survey all bacterial pathologists with an association with the journal molecular plant pathology and ask them to nominate the bacterial pathogens they would place in a  'top 10' based on scientific/economic importance. the survey generated 458 votes  from the international community, and allowed the construction of a top 10 bacterial plant pathogen list. the list includes, in rank order: (1) pseudomonas  syringae pathovars; (2) ralstonia solanacearum; (3) agrobacterium tumefaciens; (4) xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae; (5) xanthomonas campestris pathovars; (6) xanthomonas axonopodis pathovars; (7) erwinia amylovora; (8) xylella fastidiosa;  (9) dickeya (dadantii and solani); (10) pectobacterium carotovorum (and pectobacterium atrosepticum). bacteria garnering honourable mentions for just missing out on the top 10 include clavibacter michiganensis (michiganensis and sepedonicus), pseudomonas savastanoi and candidatus liberibacter asiaticus. this  review article presents a short section on each bacterium in the top 10 list and  its importance, with the intention of initiating discussion and debate amongst the plant bacteriology community, as well as laying down a benchmark. it will be  interesting to see, in future years, how perceptions change and which bacterial pathogens enter and leave the top 10.

TI  == development of an engineered bioluminescent reporter phage for detection of bacterial blight of crucifers.
AB  == bacterial blight, caused by the phytopathogen pseudomonas cannabina pv. alisalensis, is an emerging disease afflicting important members of the brassicaceae family. the disease is often misdiagnosed as pepper spot, a much less severe disease caused by the related pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola. we have developed a phage-based diagnostic that can both identify and detect the causative agent of bacterial blight and differentiate the two pathogens. a recombinant "light"-tagged reporter phage was generated by integrating bacterial luxab genes encoding luciferase into the genome of p. cannabina pv. alisalensis phage pbspca1. the pbspca1::luxab reporter phage is viable and stable and retains properties similar to those of the wild-type phage. pbspca1::luxab rapidly and sensitively detects p. cannabina pv. alisalensis by conferring a bioluminescent signal response to cultured cells. detection is dependent on cell viability. other bacterial pathogens of brassica species such as p. syringae pv. maculicola, pseudomonas marginalis, pectobacterium carotovorum, xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, and x. campestris pv. raphani either do not produce a response or produce significantly attenuated signals with the reporter phage. importantly, the reporter phage detects p. cannabina pv. alisalensis on diseased plant specimens, indicating its potential for disease diagnosis.

TI  == the lectin receptor kinase-vi.2 is required for priming and positively regulates  arabidopsis pattern-triggered immunity.
AB  == plant cells can be sensitized toward a subsequent pathogen attack by avirulent pathogens or by chemicals such as beta-aminobutyric acid (baba). this process is  called priming. using a reverse genetic approach in arabidopsis thaliana, we demonstrate that the baba-responsive l-type lectin receptor kinase-vi.2 (lecrk-vi.2) contributes to disease resistance against the hemibiotrophic pseudomonas syringae and the necrotrophic pectobacterium carotovorum bacteria. accordingly, lecrk-vi.2 mrna levels increased after bacterial inoculation or treatments with microbe-associated molecular patterns (mamps). we also show that  lecrk-vi.2 is required for full activation of pattern-triggered immunity (pti); notably, lecrk-vi.2-1 mutants show reduced upregulation of pti marker genes, impaired callose deposition, and defective stomatal closure. overexpression studies combined with genome-wide microarray analyses indicate that lecrk-vi.2 positively regulates the pti response. lecrk-vi.2 is demonstrated to act upstream of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, but independently of reactive oxygen production and botrytis-induced kinase1 phosphorylation. in addition, complex formation between the mamp receptor flagellin sensing2 and its signaling  partner brassinosteroid insensitive1-associated kinase1 is observed in flg22-treated lecrk-vi.2-1 mutants. lecrk-vi.2 is also required for full baba-induced resistance and priming of pti. our work identifies lecrk-vi.2 as a novel mediator of the arabidopsis pti response and provides insight into molecular mechanisms governing priming.

TI  == biotin deficiency causes spontaneous cell death and activation of defense signaling.
AB  == in addition to its essential metabolic functions, biotin has been suggested to play a critical role in regulating gene expression. the first committed enzyme in biotin biosynthesis in arabidopsis, 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid synthase, is encoded by at5g04620 (bio4). we isolated a t-dna insertion mutant of bio4 (bio4-1) with a spontaneous cell death phenotype, which was rescued both by exogenous biotin and genetic complementation. the bio4-1 plants exhibited massive accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and constitutive up-regulation of a number of genes that are diagnostic for defense and reactive oxygen species signaling. the  cell-death phenotype was independent of salicylic acid and jasmonate signaling. interestingly, the observed increase in defense gene expression was not accompanied by enhanced resistance to bacterial pathogens, which may be explained by uncoupling of defense gene transcription from accumulation of the corresponding protein. characterization of biotinylated protein profiles showed a substantial reduction of both chloroplastic biotinylated proteins and a nuclear biotinylated polypeptide in the mutant. our results suggest that biotin deficiency results in light-dependent spontaneous cell death and modulates defense gene expression. the isolation and molecular characterization of the bio4-1 mutant provides a valuable tool for elucidating new functions of biotin.

TI  == pectobacterium carotovorum elicits plant cell death with dspe/f but the p. carotovorum dspe does not suppress callose or induce expression of plant genes early in plant-microbe interactions.
AB  == the broad-host-range bacterial soft rot pathogen pectobacterium carotovorum causes a dspe/f-dependent plant cell death on nicotiana benthamiana within 24 h postinoculation (hpi) followed by leaf maceration within 48 hpi. p. carotovorum strains with mutations in type iii secretion system (t3ss) regulatory and structural genes, including the dspe/f operon, did not cause hypersensitive response (hr)-like cell death and or leaf maceration. a strain with a mutation in the type ii secretion system caused hr-like plant cell death but no maceration. p. carotovorum was unable to impede callose deposition in n. benthamiana leaves,  suggesting that p. carotovorum does not suppress this basal immunity function. within 24 hpi, there was callose deposition along leaf veins and examination showed that the pathogen cells were localized along the veins. to further examine hr-like plant cell death induced by p. carotovorum, gene expression profiles in n. benthamiana leaves inoculated with wild-type and mutant p. carotovorum and pseudomonas syringae strains were compared. the n. benthamiana gene expression profile of leaves infiltrated with pectobacterium carotovorum was similar to leaves infiltrated with a pseudomonas syringae t3ss mutant. these data support a  model where pectobacterium carotovorum uses the t3ss to induce plant cell death in order to promote leaf maceration rather than to suppress plant immunity.

TI  == gdsl lipase-like 1 regulates systemic resistance associated with ethylene signaling in arabidopsis.
AB  == systemic resistance is induced by necrotizing pathogenic microbes and non-pathogenic rhizobacteria and confers protection against a broad range of pathogens. here we show that arabidopsis gdsl lipase-like 1 (glip1) plays an important role in plant immunity, eliciting both local and systemic resistance in plants. glip1 functions independently of salicylic acid but requires ethylene signaling. enhancement of glip1 expression in plants increases resistance to pathogens including alternaria brassicicola, erwinia carotovora and pseudomonas syringae, and limits their growth at the infection site. furthermore, local treatment with glip1 proteins is sufficient for the activation of systemic resistance, inducing both resistance gene expression and pathogen resistance in systemic leaves. the pdf1.2-inducing activity accumulates in petiole exudates in  a glip1-dependent manner and is fractionated in the size range of less than 10 kda as determined by size exclusion chromatography. our results demonstrate that  glip1-elicited systemic resistance is dependent on ethylene signaling and provide evidence that glip1 may mediate the production of a systemic signaling molecule(s).

TI  == modulation of defense signal transduction by flagellin-induced wrky41 transcription factor in arabidopsis thaliana.
AB  == flagellin, a component of the flagellar filament of pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci 6605 (pta), induces hypersensitive reaction in its non-host arabidopsis thaliana. we identified the wrky41 gene, which belongs to a multigene family encoding wrky plant-specific transcription factors, as one of the flagellin-inducible genes in a. thaliana. expression of wrky41 is induced by inoculation with the incompatible pathogen p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 (pto) possessing avrrpt2 and the non-host pathogens pta within 6-h after inoculation, but not by inoculation with the compatible pto. expression of wrky41 was also induced by inoculation of a. thaliana with an hrp-type three secretion system (t3ss)-defective mutant of pto, indicating that effectors produced by t3ss in the pto wild-type suppress the activation of wrky41. arabidopsis overexpressing wrky41 showed enhanced resistance to the pto wild-type but increased susceptibility to erwinia carotovora ec1. wrky41-overexpressing arabidopsis constitutively expresses the pr5 gene, but suppresses the methyl jasmonate-induced pdf1.2 gene expression. these results demonstrate that wrky41 may be a key regulator in the cross talk of salicylic acid and jasmonic acid pathways.

TI  == disturbance of the ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent signalling pathway is responsible  for the resistance of arabidopsis dnd1 against pectobacterium carotovorum infection.
AB  == summary arabidopsis thaliana wild-type col-0 and its mutant, 'defence, no death'  (dnd) 1-1, were infected with biotrophic pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain dc3000 and necrotrophic pectobacterium carotovorum strain kacc 10228, and cellular and molecular responses among them were then analysed. col-0 wild-type was susceptible to both pathogens. by contrast, neither dc3000 nor kacc 10228 infected dnd1-1 (yu et al., 1998. proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 95: 7819-7824). neither of the pathogens triggered cell death or accumulation of active oxygen species in dnd1-1. kacc 10228 induced accelerated transcriptions of pdf1.2 and atebp genes in wild-type col-0, while dc3000-induced transcriptions of them were  relatively retarded. neither of the pathogens modified the constitutive transcription of pr1 in dnd1-1. pdf1.2 and atebp transcriptions were not induced  by the same treatments. hydrogen peroxide scavengers, catalase and ascorbic acid, and lacl(3), an inhibitor of ca(2+) influx, diminished cell death and protected the wild-type plant from kacc 10228 infection, while egta inhibited cell death and pathogen growth. exogenous ca(2+) nullified resistance against kacc 10228 challenge in dnd1-1. w-7 and chloropromazine, two calmodulin antagonists, also triggered cell death in dnd1-1 and abolished resistance against kacc 10228. in summary, cell death is correlated with kacc 10228 infection and disease development. furthermore, the resistance of dnd1-1 against p. carotovorum is dependent on calmodulin and inhibition of cytosolic ca(2+) increment.

TI  == atptr3, a wound-induced peptide transporter needed for defence against virulent bacterial pathogens in arabidopsis.
AB  == mutation in the wound-induced peptide transporter gene atptr3 (at5g46050) of arabidopsis thaliana has been shown to affect germination on media containing a high salt concentration. the heterologous expression in yeast was utilized to verify that the atptr3 protein transports di-and tripeptides. the t-dna insert in the atptr3-1 mutant in the arabidopsis ecotype c24 revealed two t-dna copies, the whole vector sequence, and the gus marker gene inserted in the second intron of the atptr3 gene. an almost identical insertion site was found in the atptr3-2 mutant of the col-0 ecotype. the atptr3 expression was shown to be regulated by several signalling compounds, most clearly by salicylic acid (sa), but also methyl jasmonate (meja) and abscisic acid. real-time pcr experiments suggested that the wound-induction of the atptr3 gene was abolished in the sa and ja signalling mutants. the atptr3 mutant plants had increased susceptibility to virulent pathogenic bacteria erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora and pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, and produced more reactive oxygen species when grown on media containing paraquat or rose bengal. public microarray data suggest that the atptr3 expression was induced by pseudomonas elicitors and by avirulent p. syringae pathovars and type iii secretion mutants. this was verified experimentally for the hrpa mutant with real-time pcr. these results suggest that atptr3 is one of the defence-related genes whose expression is reduced by virulent bacterium by type iii dependent fashion. our results suggest that atptr3 protects the plant against biotic and abiotic stresses.

AB  == root colonization by a plant-beneficial rhizobacterium, pseudomonas chlororaphis  o6, induces disease resistance in tobacco against leaf pathogens erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora scc1, causing soft-rot, and pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci, causing wildfire. in order to identify the bacterial determinants involved in induced systemic resistance against plant diseases, extracellular components produced by the bacterium were fractionated and purified. factors in the culture filtrate inducing systemic resistance were retained in the aqueous fraction rather than being partitioned into ethyl acetate. fractionation on high-performance liquid chromatography followed by nuclear magnetic resonance mass spectrometry analysis identified the active compound as 2r, 3r-butanediol. 2r, 3r butanediol induced systemic resistance in tobacco to e. carotovora subsp.  carotovora scc1, but not to p. syringae pv. tabaci. treatment of tobacco with the volatile 2r, 3r-butanediol enhanced aerial growth, a phenomenon also seen in plants colonized by p. chlororaphis o6. the isomeric form of the butanediol was important because 2s, 3s-butandiol did not affect the plant. the global sensor kinase, gacs, of p. chlororaphis o6 was a key regulator for induced systemic resistance against e. carotovora through regulation of 2r, 3r-butanediol production. this is the first report of the production of these assumed fermentation products by a pseudomonad and the role of the sensor kinase gacs in  production of 2r, 3r-butanediol.

TI  == effect of horticultural waste composting on infected plant residues with pathogenic bacteria and fungi: integrated and localized sanitation.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the effect of composting on the viability of plant pathogenic fungi and bacteria. the research consisted of pilot-scale composting of horticultural waste in compost windrows. studies were carried out on vegetable residues infected with plant pathogenic microorganisms included by either integrated or localized infection. in the first case, the plant pathogen viability was investigated when infected material was mixed throughout compost, while the localized infection was used to study the effect of the composting process on plant waste spot-inoculated with pathogenic microorganisms. results for localized sanitation showed the total elimination of all tested phytopathogens between 48 and 120 h after composting began. in this case significant differences were observed in relation to 9 different zones in the pile. the disappearance of these microorganisms was similar when all plant waste  included in the windrow was infected (integrated infection). additionally, the results obtained confirmed that the bacteria showed a greater capacity to persist during composting than the fungi. composting is therefore considered a useful method for recycling horticultural waste and eliminating phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi that inhabit this kind of residue.

TI  == altering glucosinolate profiles modulates disease resistance in plants.
AB  == plant diseases are major contributing factors for crop loss in agriculture. here, we show that arabidopsis plants with high levels of novel glucosinolates (gss) as a result of the introduction of single cyp79 genes exhibit altered disease resistance. arabidopsis expressing cyp79d2 from cassava accumulated aliphatic isopropyl and methylpropyl gs, and showed enhanced resistance against the bacterial soft-rot pathogen erwinia carotovora, whereas arabidopsis expressing the sorghum cyp79a1 or over-expressing the endogenous cyp79a2 accumulated p-hydroxybenzyl or benzyl gs, respectively, and showed increased resistance towards the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae. in addition to the direct toxic effects of gs breakdown products, increased accumulation of aromatic gss was shown to stimulate salicylic acid-mediated defenses while suppressing jasmonate-dependent defenses, as manifested in enhanced susceptibility to the fungus alternaria brassicicola. arabidopsis with modified gs profiles provide important tools for evaluating the biological effects of individual gss and thereby show potential as biotechnological tools for the generation of plants with tailor-made disease resistance.

AB  == an entomopathogenic bacterium, xenorhabdus nematophila, is known to have potent antibiotic activities to maintain monoxenic condition in its insect host for effective pathogenesis and ultimately for optimal development of its nematode symbiont, steinernema carpocapsae. in this study we assess its antibacterial activity against plant-pathogenic bacteria and identify its unknown antibiotics.  the bacterial culture broth had significant antibacterial activity that increased with development of the bacteria and reached its maximum at the stationary growth phase. the antibiotic activities were significant against five plant-pathogenic bacterial strains: agrobacterium vitis, pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum, p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci, and ralstonia solanacearum. the antibacterial factors were extracted with butanol and fractionated using column chromatography with the eluents of different hydrophobic intensities. two active antibacterial subfractions were purified, and the higher active fraction was further fractionated and identified as a single compound of benzylideneacetone (trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one). with heat stability, the synthetic compound showed equivalent antibiotic activity and spectrum to the purified compound. this study reports a new antibiotic compound synthesized by x. nematophila, which is a monoterpenoid compound and active against some gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == quantification of disease progression of several microbial pathogens on arabidopsis thaliana using real-time fluorescence pcr.
AB  == an accurate monitoring of disease progression is important to evaluate disease susceptibility phenotypes. over the years, arabidopsis thaliana has become the model species to serve as a host in plant-pathogen interactions. despite the efforts to study genetic mechanisms of host defense, little efforts are made for  a thorough pathogen assessment, often still depending on symptomology. this manuscript describes the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to assess pathogen growth in the host arabidopsis for a number of frequently studied pathogens. a wide range of correlations between pathogen biomass and fluorescence is demonstrated, demonstrating the theoretical sensitivity of the technique. it is also demonstrated that host dna does not interfere with the quantification of  pathogen dna over a wide range. finally, quantification of pathogen biomass in different plant genotypes with a varying degree of resistance shows the capability of this technique to be used for assessment of pathogen development in disease progression.

TI  == erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora and erwinia-derived elicitors hrpn and peha  trigger distinct but interacting defense responses and cell death in arabidopsis.
AB  == we have used an hrp-positive strain of the soft rot pathogen erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora to elucidate plant responses to this bacterial necrotroph. purified virulence determinants, harpin (hrpn) and polygalacturonase (peha), were used as tools to facilitate this analysis. we show that hrpn elicits lesion formation in arabidopsis and tobacco and triggers systemic resistance in arabidopsis. establishment of resistance is accompanied by the expression of salicylic acid (sa)-dependent, but also jasmonate/ethylene (ja/et)-dependent, marker genes pr1 and pdf1.2, respectively, suggesting that both sa-dependent and  ja/et-dependent defense pathways are activated. use of pathway-specific mutants and transgenic nahg plants show that both pathways are required for the induction of resistance. arabidopsis plants treated simultaneously with both elictors peha, known to trigger only ja/et-dependent defense signaling, and hrpn react with accelerated and enhanced induction of the marker genes pr1 and pdf1.2 both locally and systemically. this mutual amplification of defense gene expression involves both sa-dependent and ja/et-dependent defense signaling. the two elicitors produced by e. carotovora subsp. carotovora also cooperate in triggering increased production of superoxide and lesion formation.

TI  == regulation of erwinia carotovora hrpl(ecc) (sigma-l(ecc)), which encodes an extracytoplasmic function subfamily of sigma factor required for expression of the hrp regulon.
AB  == in erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (ecc) strain 71 (ecc71), hrpl(ecc), an alternate sigma factor of the extracytoplasmic function subfamily, plays a central role in the expression of the hrp (hypersensitive reaction and pathogenicity) regulon. we document here that sigma-54 (rpon) is required for full expression of hrpl(ecc) and that hrps, in conjunction with sigma-54, activates hrpl(ecc) transcription. we also made the novel observation that integration host factor is required for the activation of the hrpl(ecc) promoter. our findings reveal that the rsma/rsmb rna-mediated post-transcriptional system,  known to control extracellular enzyme and harpin production, affects hrpl(ecc) expression as well. for example, hrpl(ecc) rna levels are barely detected in an rsmb- strain. conversely, hrpl(ecc) mrna levels are much higher in rsma- bacteria than in the rsma+ parent. this effect is due to rsma-promoted decay of hrpl(ecc)  rna. moreover, the following regulators known to control the production of either rsma, rsmb rna, or both also affect hrpl(ecc) expression: gaca (response regulator of a two-component system), kdgr (an icii type repressor), hexa (a lysr type repressor), rsmc (a putative transcriptional adapter). based upon the data now available for ecc and extrapolating from the evidence in other systems, we propose a tentative model that depicts the hrp regulatory system of ecc and explains the basis for coregulation of extracellular enzyme production and expression of the hrp regulon.

TI  == constitutive expression of hrap gene in transgenic tobacco plant enhances resistance against virulent bacterial pathogens by induction of a hypersensitive  response.
AB  == hypersensitive response-assisting protein (hrap) has been previously reported as  an amphipathic plant protein isolated from sweet pepper that intensifies the harpin(pss)-mediated hypersensitive response (hr). the hrap gene has no appreciable similarity to any other known sequences, and its activity can be rapidly induced by incompatible pathogen infection. to assess the function of the hrap gene in plant disease resistance, the camv 35s promoter was used to express  sweet pepper hrap in transgenic tobacco. compared with wild-type tobacco, transgenic tobacco plants exhibit more sensitivity to harpin(pss) and show resistance to virulent pathogens (pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci and erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora). this disease resistance of transgenic tobacco does not originate from a constitutive hr, because endogenous level of salicylic acid  and hsr203j mrna showed similarities in transgenic and wildtype tobacco under noninfected conditions. however, following a virulent pathogen infection in hrap  transgenic tobacco, hsr203j was rapidly induced and a micro-hr necrosis was visualized by trypan blue staining in the infiltration area. consequently, we suggest that the disease resistance of transgenic plants may result from the induction of a hr by a virulent pathogen infection.

TI  == effects of the two-component system comprising gaca and gacs of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora on the production of global regulatory rsmb rna, extracellular enzymes, and harpinecc.
AB  == posttranscriptional regulation mediated by the regulator of secondary metabolites (rsm) rsma-rsmb pair is the most important factor in the expression of genes for  extracellular enzymes and harpinecc in erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. rsma is a small rna-binding protein, which acts by lowering the half-life of a mrna species. rsmb specifies an untranslated regulatory rna and neutralizes the rsma effect. it has been speculated that gaca-gacs, members of a two-component system, may affect gene expression via rsma. because expa, a gaca homolog, and exps (or rpfa), a gacs homolog, have been identified in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, we examined the effects of these gaca and gacs homologs on the expression of rsma, rsmb, and an assortment of exoprotein genes. the gaca gene of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain 71 stimulated transcription of genes for several extracellular enzymes (pel-1, a pectate lyase gene; peh-1, a polygalacturonase gene; and celv, a cellulase gene), hrpnecc (an e. carotovora subsp. carotovora gene specifying the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction), and rsmb in gaca+ and gacs+ e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strains. similarly, the e. carotovora subsp. carotovora gaca gene stimulated csrb (rsmb) transcription in escherichia coli. a gacs- mutant of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ah2 and a gaca- mutant of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ecc71 compared with their parent strains produced very low levels of rsmb, pel-1, peh-1, celv, and hrpnecc transcripts but produced similar levels of rsma rna and rsma protein as well as transcripts of hyperproduction of extracellular enzymes (hex) hexa, kdgr (repressor of genes for uronate and pectate catabolism), rsmc, and rpos (gene for sigma-s, an alternate sigma factor). the levels of rsmb, pel-1, peh-1, celv, and  hrpnecc transcripts as well as production of pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, cellulase, protease, and harpinecc proteins were stimulated in gacs- and gaca- mutants by gacs+ or gaca+ plasmids, respectively. the gaca effect on exoenzyme genes and hrpnecc was abrogated in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora mutants deficient in rsma and rsmc or rsma, rsmc, and rsmb rna. the expression of lacz transcriptional fusions of rsmb of erwinia amylovora and erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae was markedly reduced in a gaca- and a gacs- mutant of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. southern blot hybridization revealed the presence of gaca  and gacs homologs in all tested strains of soft-rotting erwinia spp. and several  nonsoft-rotting erwinia species such as e. amylovora, e. rhapontici, e. herbicola, e. stewartii, and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae. these findings establish that the gaca-gacs system controls transcription of rsmb of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, e. amylovora, and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae and  support the hypothesis that the effects of this two-component system on extracellular protein production in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora is mediated,  at least in part, via the levels of rsmb transcripts.

TI  == hexa of erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora strain ecc71 negatively regulates production of rpos and rsmb rna, a global regulator of extracellular proteins, plant virulence and the quorum-sensing signal, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone.
AB  == the soft-rotting bacterium, erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora (e. c. carotovora), produces an array of extracellular enzymes (= exoenzymes), including pectate lyase (pel), polygalacturonase (peh), cellulase (cel) and protease (prt), as well as harpinecc, the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction (hr). the production of these exoenzymes and harpinecc responds to plant products and the quorum-sensing signal [n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone; ohl] and is subject to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. hexa of e. c. carotovora strain ecc71 (hereafter hexa71), like that of another e. c. carotovora strain, negatively controls the production of exoenzymes, ohl and virulence in e. c. carotovora strain ecc71. in addition to exoenzymes, hexa71 negatively regulates the expression of hrpnecc, the structural gene for harpinecc. exoenzyme overproduction is abolished by ohl deficiency in a hexa- and ohll- double mutant, indicating that hexa and ohl are components of a common regulatory pathway controlling exoenzyme production. hexa71 negatively affects rpos, as the levels of this alternative sigma factor are higher in the hexa- mutant than in the hexa+ strain. however, a hexa- and rpos double mutant produces higher levels of exoenzymes and transcripts of pel-1, peh-1 and celvgenes than the hexa- and rpos+ parent. thus, the elevated levels of rpos protein in the hexa- mutant do not account for exoenzyme overproduction. the following evidence  associates for the first time the phenotypic changes in the hexa mutant to overproduction of rsmb rna, a global regulator of exoenzymes, harpinecc, ohl and  secondary metabolites. analyses of rsmb transcripts and expression of an rsmb-laczoperon fusion in e. c. carotovora strain ecc71 revealed that hexa71 negatively regulates transcription of rsmb. multiple copies of hexa71+ dna suppress various phenotypes, including exoenzyme production in e. c. carotovora strain ecc71, and concomitantly inhibit the production of rsmb, pel-1, peh-1, celv and hrpnecc transcripts. multiple copies of rsmb+ dna, on the other hand, stimulate exoenzyme production by relieving the negative effects of a chromosomal copy of hexa+. the occurrence of hexa homologues and the negative effect of the dosage of hexa71 dna on rsmb transcripts were also detected in other e. c. carotovora strains as well as erwinia carotovora atroseptica and erwinia carotovora betavasculorum. extrapolating from the findings with lrha, the escherichia coli homologue of hexa, and the presence of spre homologues in e. carotovora subspecies, we propose that hexa71 controls several regulatory pathways in e. carotovora including rsmb transcription and the production of spreecc which, in turn, affects rpos levels. a model is presented that integrates the findings presented here and our current knowledge of the major regulatory network that controls exoprotein production in soft-rotting erwinia carotovora subspecies.

TI  == rsmc of the soft-rotting bacterium erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora negatively controls extracellular enzyme and harpin(ecc) production and virulence by modulating levels of regulatory rna (rsmb) and rna-binding protein (rsma).
AB  == previous studies have shown that the production of extracellular enzymes (pectate lyase [pel], polygalacturonase [peh], cellulase [cel], and protease [prt]) and harpin(ecc) (the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction) in erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora is regulated by rsma, an rna-binding protein, and rsmb, a regulatory rna (rsm stands for regulator of secondary metabolites) (y. liu et al., mol. microbiol. 29:219-234, 1998). we have cloned and characterized a novel  regulatory gene, rsmc, that activates rsma production and represses extracellular enzyme and harpin(ecc) production, rsmb transcription, and virulence in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora. in an rsmc knockout mutant of e. carotovora subsp.  carotovora ecc71 carrying the chromosomal copy of the wild-type rsma(+) allele, the basal levels of pel, peh, cel, prt, and harpin(ecc) as well as the amounts of rsmb, pel-1, peh-1, celv, and hrpn(ecc) transcripts are high, whereas the levels  of rsma transcripts and rsma protein are low. furthermore, the expression of an rsma-lacz gene fusion is lower in the rsmc(-) mutant than in the rsmc(+) parent.  conversely, the expression of an rsmb-lacz operon fusion is higher in the rsmc(-) mutant than in the rsmc(+) parent. these observations establish that rsmc negatively regulates rsmb transcription but positively affects rsma production. indeed, comparative studies with an rsmc(-) mutant, an rsma(-) mutant, and an rsma(-) rsmc(-) double mutant have revealed that the negative effects on exoprotein production and virulence are due to the cumulative regulatory effects  of rsmc on rsma and rsmb. exoprotein production by the rsmc(-) mutant is partially dependent on the quorum sensing signal, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine  lactone. southern blot data and analysis of pcr products disclosed the presence of rsmc sequences in e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, e. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, and e. carotovora subsp. carotovora. these findings collectively  support the idea that rsma and rsmb expression in these plant pathogenic erwinia  species is controlled by rsmc or a functional homolog of rsmc.

AB  == sarcotoxin ia is a cecropin-type antibacterial protein produced by the flesh fly, sarcophaga peregrina. similar to other bactericidal small proteins produced by insects, sarcotoxin ia is released into the hemolymph of larvae and nymphs upon mechanical injury or bacterial infection. the gene (sarco) that encodes this toxin was introduced into saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells and was expressed  under a constitutive yeast promoter. the transformed yeast cells were grown in a  liquid medium, and a peptide with a similar molecular size to that of the mature  sarcotoxin ia was detected in the medium by western blot analysis. the secreted sarcotoxin-like peptide (slp) had a potent cytotoxic effect against several bacteria, including plant pathogenic bacteria, similar to the toxic effects of the authentic sarcotoxin ia. erwinia carotovora was more susceptible to the toxic medium than pseudomonas solanacearum and pseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans. thus, yeast may be used in the production of such proteins for employment against various bacterial pathogens.

AB  == erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora produces extracellular pectate lyase (pel),  polygalacturonase (peh), cellulase (cel), and protease (prt). the concerted actions of these enzymes largely determine the virulence of this plant-pathogenic bacterium. e. carotovora subsp. carotovora also produces harpinecc, the elicitor  of the hypersensitive reaction. we document here that kdgrecc (kdg, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate; kdgr, general repressor of genes involved in pectin and  galacturonate catabolism), a homolog of the e. chrysanthemi repressor, kdgrech and the escherichia coli repressor, kdgreco, negatively controls not only the pectinases, pel and peh, but also cel, prt, and harpinecc production in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora. the levels of pel-1, peh-1, celv, and hrpnecc transcripts are markedly affected by kdgrecc. the kdgrecc- mutant is more virulent than the kdgrecc+ parent. thus, our data for the first time establish a  global regulatory role for kdgrecc in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora. another novel observation is the negative effect of kdgrecc on the transcription of rsmb  (previously aeph), which specifies an rna regulator controlling exoenzyme and harpinecc production. the levels of rsmb rna are higher in the kdgrecc- mutant than in the kdgrecc+ parent. moreover, by dnase i protection assays we determined that purified kdgrecc protected three 25-bp regions within the transcriptional unit of rsmb. alignment of the protected sequences revealed the 21-mer consensus  sequence of the kdgrecc-binding site as 5'-g/aa/ta/tgaaa[n6]tttcag/tg/ta-3'. two  such kdgrecc-binding sites occur in rsmb dna in a close proximity to each other within nucleotides +79 and +139 and the third kdgrecc-binding site within nucleotides +207 and +231. analysis of lacz transcriptional fusions shows that the kdgr-binding sites negatively affect the expression of rsmb. kdgrecc also binds the operator dnas of pel-1 and peh-1 genes and represses expression of a pel1-lacz and a peh1-lacz transcriptional fusions. we conclude that kdgrecc affects extracellular enzyme production by two ways: (i) directly, by inhibiting  the transcription of exoenzyme genes; and (ii) indirectly, by preventing the production of a global rna regulator. our findings support the idea that kdgrecc  affects transcription by promoter occlusion, i.e., preventing the initiation of transcription, and by a roadblock mechanism, i.e., by affecting the elongation of transcription.

TI  == characterization of a novel rna regulator of erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora that controls production of extracellular enzymes and secondary metabolites.
AB  == the enterobacterium erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora strain 71 (hereafter ecc71) produces extracellular enzymes such as pectate lyase isozymes (pels), cellulase (cel), polygalacturonase (peh) and protease (prt). these enzymes degrade plant cell wall components and are largely responsible for the elicitation of soft-rot diseases in plants and plant products. ecc71 also produces harpinecc, the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction (hr) and the quorum-sensing signal, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (ohl). ohl controls extracellular enzyme and harpinecc production. the levels of these enzymes, as well as the expression of hrpnecc, the structural gene for harpinecc, and ohll, the gene specifying ohl synthesis, are negatively regulated by rsmaa. rsmb, formerly aeph, on the other hand, positively regulates extracellular enzyme production. 6his-rsma recombinant protein purified from e. coli binds rsmb rna as indicated by gel mobility shift assays. rsmb comprises 547 bp dna, which is transcribed from a single start site immediately after a sigma70-like promoter. in ecc71, two rsmb rna species are detected: a full-length 479 base rsmb rna and  a 259 base rsmb' rna. rsmb' dna hybridizes with the 259 base and the 479 base transcripts. a 3' rnase protection assay revealed that the 259 base and the 479 base rna species end at the same position immediately after the putative rho-independent terminator. the expression of rsmb-lacz transcriptional fusions established that the rsmb' rna is not produced because of the activation of an internal promoter. these data strongly suggest that the 259 base rsmb' rna is derived by processing of the primary rsmb rna. in ecc71, rsmb' expression driven  by the lac promoter causes overproduction of pel, peh, cel and prt, and accumulation of pel-1, peh-1, hrpnecc and ohll transcripts. by contrast, a plasmid with the rsmb' dna sequence deleted fails to cause overproduction of the  extracellular enzymes in ecc71. the rsmb' effect also occurs in escherichia coli  as glycogen accumulation is stimulated in the presence of rsmb'. in vivo and in vitro translation as well as mutational analysis of rsmb' have established that rsmb' rna does not yield a translational product. therefore, we concluded that the rsmb' rna itself functions as the regulator. indeed, the expression rsmb' dna leads to neutralization of the negative effects of the rna-binding protein, rsma, in ecc71 and serratia marcescens strain sm274. we propose a model that explains how rsma and rsmb control the expression of genes for extracellular enzymes.

TI  == rpos (sigma-s) controls expression of rsma, a global regulator of secondary metabolites, harpin, and extracellular proteins in erwinia carotovora.
AB  == rpos (sigma-s or sigma-38) controls a large array of genes that are expressed during stationary phase and under various stress conditions in escherichia coli and other bacteria. we document here that plant pathogenic and epiphytic erwinia  species, such as e. amylovora; e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, betavasculorum,  and carotovora; e. chrysanthemi; e. herbicola; e. rhapontici; and e. stewartii, possess rpos genes and produce the alternate sigma factor. we show that rpos transcription in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora is driven from a major promoter  which resides within the nlpd gene located upstream of rpos as in e. coli. rpos-  e. carotovora subsp. carotovoa strain ac5061, constructed by marker exchange, is  more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, carbon starvation, and acidic ph than its rpos+ parent strain, ac5006. the basal levels of extracellular pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, and cellulase as well as those of transcripts of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora hrpn (hrpnecc), the gene for the elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction, are higher in the rpos- strain than in the rpos+ parent. likewise, compared to ac5006, ac5061 causes more extensive maceration of celery petioles. our findings with the rpos- mutant and strains carrying multiple copies rpos+ dna reveal that rpos positively controls rsma expression. we also present evidence that supports the hypothesis that the rpos effect on extracellular enzyme levels, hrpnecc expression, and virulence manifests itself by the modulation of rsma expression.

TI  == avirulence gene d of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato may have undergone horizontal gene transfer.
AB  == avirulence gene d (avrd) is carried on the b-plasmid of the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato with plasmid-borne avrd homologs widely distributed among the pseudomonads. we now report sequences in the soft rot pathogen erwinia carotovora that cross-hybridize to avrd suggesting a conserved function beyond avirulence. alternatively, avrd may have been transferred horizontally among species: (i) dna linked to avrd shows evidence of class ii transpositions and contains a novel is3-related insertion sequence, and (ii) short sequences linked to avrd are similar to pathogenicity genes from a variety  of unrelated pathogens. we have also identified the gene cluster that controls b-plasmid stability.

TI  == identification of a pathogenicity locus, rpfa, in erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora subsp. carotovora that encodes a two-component sensor-regulator protein.
AB  == a mutant of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, ah2552, created by a mud1 insertion was found to be reduced in plant pathogenicity and deficient in extracellular protease and cellulase activity, although it produced normal levels of pectate lyase and polygalacturonase. a cosmid clone, pec462, was isolated from a wild-type e. carotovora subsp. carotovora dna library that concomitantly restored pathogenicity and protease and cellulase activities of ah2552 to wild-type levels when present in trans. the genetic locus that was disrupted in ah2552 by insertion of mud1 has been designated rpfa, for regulator of pathogenicity factors. sequencing of the rpfa region identified an open reading frame of 2,787 bp, and the predicted 929-amino acid polypeptide shared high identity with several two-component sensor-regulator proteins: bara from escherichia coli, apda from pseudomonas fluorescens, phen from p. tolaasii, repa  from p. viridiflava, lema from p. syringae pv. syringae, and rpfc from xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. the rpfa locus described in this study encodes a putative sensor kinase protein that is involved in both extracellular protease and cellulase production and the pathogenicity of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora on potato tubers.

TI  == the rsma- mutants of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ecc71 overexpress hrpnecc and elicit a hypersensitive reaction-like response in tobacco leaves.
AB  == erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora wild-type strain ecc71 does not elicit the hypersensitive reaction (hr) in tobacco leaves. by mini-tn5-km and chemical mutagenesis we have isolated rsma- mutants of ecc71 that produce high basal levels of pectate lyases, polygalacturonase, cellulase, and protease; they also are hypervirulent. the rsma- mutants, but not their parent strains, elicit an hr-like response in tobacco leaves. this reaction is characterized by the rapid appearance of water soaking followed by tissue collapse and necrosis. the affected areas remain limited to the region infiltrated with bacterial cells, and the symptoms closely resemble a typical hr, e.g., the reactions caused by pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi. moreover, low concentrations of cells of the mini-tn5-km insertion rsma- mutant, ac5070, infiltrated into tobacco leaf tissue  prevent elicitation of the rapid necrosis by ac5070 or by p. syringae pv. pisi. elicitation of the hr-like response by the mutants is not affected by the deficiency of n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone, the cell density (quorum) sensing signal. cloning and sequence analysis have disclosed that e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ecc71 possesses a homolog of e. chrysanthemi hrpn known  to encode an elicitor of the hr; the corresponding ecc71 gene is designated hrpnecc. northern (rna) blot data show that the level of hrpnecc mrna is considerably higher in the rsma- mutants than in the rsma+ strains. moreover, a low copy plasmid carrying the rsma+ allele severely reduces the level of the hrpnecc transcripts in the rsma- mutants. these constructs, like the rsma+ e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strains, do not elicit the hr-like response. these data taken along with the effects of rsma on exoenzyme production and pathogenicity (a. chatterjee et al., 1995, appl. environ. microbiol. 61:1959-1967) demonstrate that this global regulator gene plays a critical role in plant interaction of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora.
