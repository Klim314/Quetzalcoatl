TI  == murimonas intestini gen. nov., sp. nov., an acetate-producing bacterium of the family lachnospiraceae isolated from the mouse gut.
AB  == three strains of an anaerobic, gram-stain-positive coccobacillus were isolated from the intestines of mice. these strains shared 100 % similarity in their 16s rrna gene sequences, but were distantly related to any described members of the family lachnospiraceae (<94 %). the most closely related species with names that  have standing in nomenclature were robinsoniella peoriensis, ruminococcus gnavus, blautia producta and clostridium xylanolyticum. phylogenetic relationships based  on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis were confirmed by partial sequencing of hsp60  genes. the use of an in-house database search pipeline revealed that the new isolates are most prevalent in bovine gut samples when compared with human and mouse samples for ruminococcus gnavus and b. producta. all three isolated strains shared similar cellular fatty acid patterns dominated by c16 : 0 methyl ester. differences in the proportions of c12 : 0 methyl ester, c14 : 0 methyl ester and  c18 : 1 cis-11 dimethyl acetal were observed when compared with phylogenetically  neighbouring species. the major short-chain fatty acid produced by strain srb-530-5-h(t) was acetic acid. this strain tested positive for utilization of d-fructose, d-galacturonic acid, d-malic acid, l-alanyl l-threonine and l-glutamic acid but was negative for utilization of amygdalin, arbutin, alpha-d-glucose, 3-methyl d-glucose and salicin, in contrast to the type strain of the closest related species robinsoniella peoriensis. the isolates were not able to use mannitol for growth. based on genotypic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, we propose to create the new genus and species murimonas intestini gen. nov., sp. nov. to accommodate the three strains srb-530-5-h(t) ( = dsm 26524(t) = ccug 63391(t)) (the type strain of murimonas intestini), srb-509-4-s-h ( = dsm 27577 = ccug 64595) and srb-524-4-s-h ( = dsm 27578 = ccug 64594).

TI  == clostridium glycyrrhizinilyticum sp. nov., a glycyrrhizin-hydrolysing bacterium isolated from human faeces.
AB  == screening of faecal bacteria for glycyrrhetic acid (ga) production by hydrolysing of glycyrrhizin (gl) resulted in the isolation of two strains, designated zm35t and zm38. strains zm35t and zm38 were gram-positive, obligate anaerobic, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped bacteria. analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences indicated that strains zm35t and zm38 belonged to cluster xiva of the genus clostridium. the 16s rrna gene sequences of strains zm35t and zm38 were identical. strain zm35t exhibited approximately 94% to 95% identity with the validly described species, clostridium oroticum(94.5%), eubacterium contortum(93.8%), ruminococcus gnavus(94.5%) and r. torques(95.1%). in an experiment of dna-dna hybridization, it was confirmed that strains zm35t and zm38 were the same species. the guanine-plus-cytosine (g+c) content of strain zm35t is 45.7 mol%. based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic findings, we propose that strains zm35t and zm38 be assigned to a novel species named clostridium glycyrrhizinilyticum. the type strain is zm35t (=jcm 13368t=dsm 17593t).
