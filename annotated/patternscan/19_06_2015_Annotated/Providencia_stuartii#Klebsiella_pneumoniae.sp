TI  == molecular epidemiology of kpc-2-producing enterobacteriaceae (non-klebsiella pneumoniae) isolated from brazil.
AB  == in brazil, since 2009, there has been an ever increasing widespread of the blakpc-2 gene, mainly in klebsiella pneumoniae. this study aims to assess the molecular epidemiology and genetic background of this gene in enterobacteriaceae  (non-k. pneumoniae) species from 9 brazilian states between 2009 and 2011. three  hundred eighty-seven isolates were analyzed exhibiting nonsusceptibility to carbapenems, in which the blakpc-2 gene was detected in 21.4%. by disk diffusion  and e-test, these isolates exhibited high rates of resistance to most of the antimicrobials tested, including tigecycline (45.6% nonsusceptible) and polymyxin b (16.5%), the most resistant species being enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae. we found great clonal diversity and a variety of blakpc-2-carrying plasmids, all of them exhibiting a partial tn4401 structure. therefore, this study demonstrates the dissemination of kpc-2 in 9 enterobacteriaceae species, including species that were not previously described  such as pantoea agglomerans and providencia stuartii.

TI  == evaluation of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae in an italian setting: report from the trench.
AB  == the spread of carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) has recently become a matter of concern in public health, mainly due to the wide distribution of carbapenemase genes. italy is a country considered endemic for the spread of blakpc klebsiella pneumoniae (kp). the aim of this study was to depict the epidemiological trend of cre in one italian hospital over a long period (3 years  surveillance, from may 2011 to april 2014). based on defined mic cut-off for specific carbapenems, 164 strains isolated from 146 different patients were analyzed both phenotypically and genotypically to establish the resistance genes. molecular typing was performed using the rapd technique. 77 strains were demonstrated to harbor the blakpc gene (73 kp, 4 escherichia coli - ec), 51 strains the blavim gene (44 kp, 3 ec, 2 enterobacter cloacae and 2 klebsiella oxytoca), 8 the blandm gene (3 kp, 4 ec and one providencia stuartii), 3 the blaoxa-48 gene (2 kp, 1 ec), whereas 25 out of the 164 isolates (of different genera and species) had a negative multiplex-pcr amplification for all the targets tested. 39 out of the 164 strains analyzed (23.8%) revealed discrepancies between the mics obtained with automated instrument and gradient mics of more than two logs of difference; the broth microdilution provided a better agreement  with the results obtained with the gradient mic. the use of rapd allowed to distinguish different clusters, closely related, both for blakpc and for blavim kp.

TI  == antibacterial activity of silver-doped hydroxyapatite nanoparticles against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == ag-doped nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (ag:hap-nps) (ca10-xagx(po4)6(oh)2, xag = 0.05, 0.2, and 0.3) with antibacterial properties are of great interest in the development of new products. coprecipitation method  is a promising route for obtaining nanocrystalline ag:hap with antibacterial properties. x-ray diffraction identified hap as an unique crystalline phase in each sample. the calculated lattice constants of a = b = 9.435 a, c = 6.876 a for xag = 0.05, a = b = 9.443 a, c = 6.875 a for xag = 0.2, and a = b = 9.445 a, c =  6.877 a for xag = 0.3 are in good agreement with the standard of a = b = 9.418 a, c = 6.884 a (space group p63/m). the fourier transform infrared and raman spectra of the sintered hap show the absorption bands characteristic to hydroxyapatite. the ag:hap nanoparticles are evaluated for their antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia stuartii, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. the results showed that the antibacterial activity of these materials, regardless of the sample types, was greatest against s. aureus, k. pneumoniae, p. stuartii, and c. freundii. the results of qualitative antibacterial tests revealed that the tested ag:hap-nps had an important inhibitory activity on p. stuartii and c. freundii. the absorbance values measured at 490 nm of the p. stuartii and c. freundii in the presence of ag:hap-nps decreased compared with those of organic solvent used (dmso) for all the samples (xag = 0.05, 0.2, and 0.3). antibacterial activity increased with the increase of xag in the samples. the ag:hap-np concentration had little influence  on the bacterial growth (p. stuartii).

TI  == antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of selected egyptian medicinal plants.
AB  == medicinal plants have been used as a source of remedies since ancient times in egypt. the present study was designed to investigate the antibacterial activity and the cytotoxicity of the organic extracts from 16 selected medicinal plants of egypt. the study was also extended to the isolation of the antiproliferative compound jaeschkeanadiol p-hydroxybenzoate (fh-25) from ferula hermonis. the microbroth dilution was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of the samples against twelve bacterial strains belonging to four species,  providencia stuartii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli, while a resazurin assay was used to assess the cytotoxicity of  the extracts on the human pancreatic cancer cell line miapaca-2, breast cancer cell line mcf-7, ccrf-cem leukemia cells, and their multidrug resistant subline,  cem/adr5000. the results of the mic determination indicated that all the studied  crude extracts were able to inhibit the growth of at least one of the tested bacterial species, the best activity being recorded with the crude extracts from  f. hermonis and vitis vinifera, whichwere active against 91.7% and 83.3% of the studied bacteria, respectively. the lowest mic value of 128 mug/ml was recorded against p. stuartii atcc 29916 and e. coli atcc 10536 with the extract from v. vinifera and commiphora molmol, respectively. in the cytotoxicity study, ic50 values below 20 mug/ml were recorded for the crude extract of f. hermonis on all  four studied cancer cell lines. fh-25 also showed good cytotoxicity against mcf-7 cells (ic50: 2.47 mug/ml). finally, the results of the present investigation provided supportive data for the possible use of the plant extracts investigated  herein, mostly f. hermonis and v. vinifera in the treatment of bacterial infections and jaeschkeanadiol p-hydroxybenzoate in the control of cancer diseases.

TI  == metallo-beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae from routine samples in an italian tertiary-care hospital and long-term care facilities during 2008.
AB  == the emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae is a serious public health concern. producers have been repeatedly isolated from patients and long-term care facility (ltcf) residents around bolzano, and we sought to assess their prevalence and clinical impact. all routine enterobacteriaceae isolates from a bolzano tertiary-care hospital and associated  long-term care facilities in 2008 (n = 5500) were screened for mbls, with case details reviewed for the source patients. in total, 36 producers were obtained from 29 patients, comprising 14 escherichia coli, six klebsiella pneumoniae, four klebsiella oxytoca, four citrobacter freundii, two enterobacter cloacae and two morganella morganii, as well as single citrobacter amalonaticus, enterobacter aerogenes, providencia stuartii and proteus mirabilis isolates. all were pcr-positive for bla(vim) and 25 were pcr-positive for qnrs; 19 non-k. pneumoniae had bla(shv) and one had bla(ctx-m-group1); 13 were from 12 ltcf residents and 23 were from 17 acute-care patients. all these patients had serious underlying diseases with prolonged hospitalization or ltcf stay; only seven had infections due to the mbl producers, comprising four urinary tract infections, two catheter-related bloodstream infections and one patient with both a surgical site infection and pneumonia. five patients had more than one mbl-producing organism.  pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a cluster of six related e. coli, whereas pairs of k. pneumoniae and c. freundii isolates had >85% profile similarity. transformants prepared from two isolates were shown to be pcr-positive for bla(vim), qnrs and bla(shv); their plasmids gave similar restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, and bla(vim-1), qnrs1 and bla(shv-12) were detected by sequencing.

TI  == novel vim metallo-beta-lactamase variant from clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from algeria.
AB  == five different strains of bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae were isolated from two patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the central military hospital of algiers, algeria. all five strains, one providencia  stuartii strain, two escherichia coli strains, and two klebsiella pneumoniae strains, were intermediate or resistant to all beta-lactams, including carbapenems. synergy between imipenem and edta was observed for all five strains. the results of the pcr experiment confirmed the presence of a bla(vim) gene in all five strains. the bla(vim) genes were located as part of a class 1 integron on a 180-kb conjugative plasmid. they encoded a novel metallo-beta-lactamase designated vim-19, which differed from the parental enzyme vim-1 by only two substitutions: ser228arg, previously observed in the closely related enzyme vim-4, and asn215lys, not previously observed in other vim-type carbapenemases. vim-19 was further characterized after purification through determination of its  kinetic constants. this enzyme was inhibited by edta and hydrolyzed penicillins,  cephalosporins, and carbapenems, as observed for other vim-type carbapenemases but with greater catalytic efficiency against penicillins than vim-1. vim-19 is the first carbapenemase enzyme identified from an isolate from algeria. these results confirm the emergence of vim-4-like enzymes in members of the family enterobacteriaceae from mediterranean countries.

TI  == crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  == the problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. these organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the ph of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. in this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary ph above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. morganella morganii and staphylococcus aureus elevated the ph of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and  caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the ph of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. the most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. this strategy raises the nucleation ph (ph(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a ph(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. it is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.

TI  == novel ctx-m {beta}-lactamase genotype distribution and spread into multiple species of enterobacteriaceae in changsha, southern china.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to undertake a survey of the occurrence of  ctx-m and shv extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) genotypes in enterobacteriaceae from hunan province, china. methods: clinical isolates (425) from three major hospitals in changsha, hunan province, were collected between october 2004 and july 2005, and their antimicrobial susceptibilities of the genotype of bla(ctx-m) and bla(shv) were determined. random amplified polymorphic dna was used to characterize the clonality of all of the isolates. results: the overall rate of esbl-positive isolates was 33.4% (142/425). the dominant esbls were ctx-m types, and were found in 109/142 (76.8%) isolates comprising seven different genera/species, namely escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris and providencia stuartii. the most common bla(ctx-m) genotypes were bla(ctx-m-14) (47.7%), bla(ctx-m-3) (29.4%) and bla(ctx-m-15) (17.4%). a novel gene derived from bla(ctx-m-15), bla(ctx-m-82) (ala-40-->pro), was identified. conclusions: the dominant esbl genotype in hunan province was bla(ctx-m). the high prevalence (17.4%) of bla(ctx-m-15) has not previously been reported from china. our results identify that an epidemic of bla(ctx-m) in changsha, hunan province, has evolved with the appearance and spread of bla(ctx-m-15) against the dominant genotypes bla(ctx-m-14) and bla(ctx-m-3.) the worldwide dominance of bla(ctx-m-15) could be poised to spread to china, displacing the current prevailing genotypes.

TI  == evaluation of different laboratory tests for the detection of metallo-beta-lactamase production in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == objectives: clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (91), escherichia coli (49), enterobacter spp. (27), proteus mirabilis (17), citrobacter freundii (2), providencia stuartii (3) and serratia spp. (5), with various mics of imipenem, were examined for production of metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) with different phenotypic laboratory tests that have been previously published to detect mbls in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. methods: a total of 194 (95 mbl-positive and 99 mbl-negative) clinical isolates with imipenem mics < or = 0.25 to > 256 mg/l were examined. all isolates were evaluated by the double-disc  synergy test (ddst), the combination disc test (cdt), the mbl etest and the modified hodge test. the presence of bla(vim) and bla(imp) genes was evaluated by in situ hybridization with specific probes and was certified by pcr. results: in  30 bla(vim)-positive isolates that exhibited mics of imipenem < or = 4 mg/l, mbl  etest could not be evaluated. cdt with ceftazidime and 1900 or 750 microg of edta, and ddst after applying an imipenem disc 10 mm apart from a disc containing approximately 1900 microg of edta, showed the highest sensitivity (97.9% to 100%) and specificity (87.9% to 96%) rates among the analysed procedures. cdt with imipenem and 1900 microg of edta exhibited a sensitivity of 94.7% and showed very good specificity (98%). conclusions: the cdt with imipenem/imipenem+0.5 m edta or ceftazidime/ceftazidime+0.2 m edta and the ddst with imipenem 10 mm apart from edta are the most effective methods for the detection of mbls in enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == species interactions in mixed-community crystalline biofilms on urinary catheters.
AB  == previous experimental investigations of the crystalline biofilms that colonize and block urinary catheters have focussed on their formation by pure cultures of  proteus mirabilis. in the urine of patients undergoing long-term catheterization, p. mirabilis is commonly found in mixed communities with other urinary tract pathogens. little is known about the effect that the other species have on the rate at which p. mirabilis encrusts catheters. in the present study, a set of data on the nature of the bacterial communities on 106 catheter biofilms has been analysed and it was found that while species such as providencia stuartii and klebsiella pneumoniae were commonly associated with p. mirabilis, when escherichia coli, morganella morganii or enterobacter cloacae were present, p. mirabilis was rarely or never found. the hypothesis that the absence of p. mirabilis from some biofilm communities could be due to its active exclusion by other species has also been examined. experiments in laboratory models showed that co-infection of p. mirabilis with m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli had  no effect on the ability of p. mirabilis to encrust and block catheters. co-infection with ent. cloacae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, significantly  increased the time that catheters took to block (p <0.05). the growth of ent. cloacae, m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli in the model for 72 h prior to superinfection with p. mirabilis significantly delayed catheter blockage. in the  case of ent. cloacae, for example, the mean time to blockage was extended from 28.7 h to 60.7 h (p < or =0.01). in all cases, however, p. mirabilis was able to  generate alkaline urine, colonize the biofilms, induce crystal formation and block the catheters. the results suggest that although there is a degree of antagonism between p. mirabilis and some of the other urinary tract organisms, the effects are temporary and whatever the pre-existing urinary microbiota, infection with p. mirabilis is thus likely to lead to catheter encrustation and blockage.

TI  == prevalence of community-occurring extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in brazil.
AB  == the occurrence of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains in the community was investigated in a private laboratory located in juiz de fora, brazil. all enterobacterial isolates analysed were collected from urine of human  patients between the years 2000 and 2002. esbl production was confirmed by double disk screening, combination disk method, and etest esbl strip. the isoelectric point of each beta-lactamase was determined in the crude extracts from each isolate. detection of esbl genes was performed by polymerase chain reaction and the genetic relatedness of the isolates determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). of the 1,481 isolates, 22 (12 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 escherichia coli, 1 providencia stuartii, 1 citrobacter freundii, and 1 serratia  marcescens) were identified as esbl producers. the frequency of esbl producers in the community was 1.48%. tem-type enzymes were identified in 95.4% of the isolates, followed by the shv type. seven strains produced ctx-m-type enzymes. this study showed that strains producing multiple beta-lactamases are also present in community-acquired bacterial isolates. multiple strains exhibiting identical pfge genotypes were found in individual patients indicating a common source of acquisition.

TI  == accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a prospective study is carried out to evaluate the performance of a protocol for  the accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and other gram-negative bacteria. a modified double-disc test (mddt) is incorporated in a gram-negative template for routine susceptibility testing. the mddt identified accurately esbls in all isolates subsequently confirmed as esbl-producers by the  standard clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) combined disc method. of  1213 isolates tested, 98 (8%) were positive for esbls by mddt and 95 (7.8%) were  positive by the clsi method. esbls were detected in 48 (7.8%) e. coli, 21 (8%) k. pneumoniae, 12 (5.8%) proteus mirabilis, 13 (18.8%) providencia stuartii and four (6.8%) enterobacter cloacae isolates. time required for esbl detection by the mddt method was one day. the protocol described provides a simple, rapid and low-cost method for early detection of esbls in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == trends in production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteria of medical interest: report of the second italian nationwide survey.
AB  == results of a 2003 survey carried out in italy to evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteria are presented. eleven italian microbiology laboratories investigated 9,076 consecutive nonreplicate isolates (inpatients, 6,850; outpatients, 2,226). esbl screening was performed by mic data analysis. confirmation was obtained using the double-disk synergy test and the combination disk test based on clsi methodology. esbl determinants were investigated by colony blot hybridization and confirmed by sequencing. results were compared to those of the 1999 italian survey (8,015 isolates). the prevalence of esbl producers was 7.4% among isolates from inpatients (in 1999, 6.3%) and 3.5% among outpatients (no data were available for 1999). among hospitalized patients, the most prevalent esbl-positive species was  escherichia coli (klebsiella pneumoniae in 1999). proteus mirabilis was the most  prevalent esbl-positive species among outpatients. in both groups, most esbl-positive pathogens were obtained from urinary tract infections. tem-type esbls were the most prevalent enzymes (45.4%). non-tem, non-shv determinants emerged: ctx-m-type in e. coli and k. pneumoniae, and per-type in p. mirabilis, providencia spp., and e. coli. with the exception of 3/163 p. mirabilis isolates  and 1/44 providencia stuartii isolate (all of which were intermediate for imipenem), carbapenems were active against all esbl-positive enterobacteria. susceptibility to other drugs was as follows: 84.7% for amikacin, 84.4% for piperacillin-tazobactam, 48.0% for gentamicin, and 32.8% for ciprofloxacin. carbapenems appear to be the drug of choice. amikacin and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations represent an alternative in non-life-threatening infections. the appearance of esbl-positive enterobacteria in the community makes it mandatory that family physicians learn how to treat these pathogens.

AB  == objectives: to examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. methods: models of the catheterized  bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. hplc was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. results: when catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/l) the formation of catheter biofilm by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis was prevented. the numbers of enterococcus faecalis and providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (p<0.05). serratia marcescens, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. only p. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/l of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. conclusions: triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by p. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several  other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. it had little effect on urease-producing p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens or m. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in community and private health care centers.
AB  == in 1999, 39 of 2,599 isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae (1.5%) collected by eight private laboratories in the aquitaine region in france produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). among these were 19 enterobacter aerogenes isolates; 8 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; 6 escherichia coli isolates; 3 proteus mirabilis isolates; and 1 isolate each of serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and providencia stuartii. esbl producers were isolated from 38 patients, including 33 residents of 11 clinics or nursing homes  and 5 ambulatory patients. seven different esbls were characterized. these mainly consisted of tem-24 (25 isolates) and tem-21 (9 isolates), but tem-15 (2 isolates) and tem-3, tem-19, shv-4, and ctx-m-1 (1 isolate each) were also characterized. seven strains showed the coexistence of different tem- and/or shv-encoding genes, including a new shv-1 variant, shv-44, defined by the substitution r205l previously reported for shv-3 in association with s238g. the epidemiology of the esbl producers was investigated by random amplification of polymorphic dna, typing by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr, analysis of resistance cotransferred with the esbl, and analysis of the restriction profiles of the esbl-encoding plasmids. of the tem-24-expressing strains, 18 were e. aerogenes isolates, including 9 from the same clinic, that were representatives of the epidemic clone disseminating in france. of the tem-21-producing strains that belonged to different species of the family enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis), 8 were isolated in the same nursing home. outbreaks due to strain and/or plasmid dissemination in these clinic and nursing home were demonstrated. the presence of esbl producers in five ambulatory patients probably resulted from nosocomial acquisition. our data highlight the serious need to monitor patients for esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in general practice.

TI  == indole can act as an extracellular signal to regulate biofilm formation of escherichia coli and other indole-producing bacteria.
AB  == we demonstrated previously that genetic inactivation of tryptophanase is responsible for a dramatic decrease in biofilm formation in the laboratory strain escherichia coli s17-1. in the present study, we tested whether the biochemical inhibition of tryptophanase, with the competitive inhibitor oxindolyl-l-alanine,  could affect polystyrene colonization by e. coli and other indole-producing bacteria. oxindolyl-l-alanine inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, indole production and biofilm formation by strain s17-1 grown in luria-bertani (lb) medium. supplementation with indole at physiologically relevant concentrations restores biofilm formation by strain s17-1 in the presence of oxindolyl-l-alanine and by mutant strain e. coli 3714 (s17-1 tnaa::tn5) in lb medium. oxindolyl-l-alanine also inhibits the adherence of s17-1 cells to polystyrene for a 3-h incubation time, but mutant strain 3714 cells are unaffected. at 0.5 mg/ml, oxindolyl-l-alanine exhibits inhibitory activity against biofilm formation in lb  medium and in synthetic urine for several clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, providencia stuartii, and morganella morganii but has no affect on indole-negative klebsiella pneumoniae strains. in conclusion, these data suggest that indole, produced by the action of tryptophanase, is involved in polystyrene colonization by several indole-producing bacterial species. indole may act as a signalling molecule to regulate the expression of adhesion and biofilm-promoting factors.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in buenos aires, argentina, public hospitals.
AB  == resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). in order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of esbls in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from april to may 2000. extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. from a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. the national committee for clinical laboratory standards' screening and confirmatory tests for esbl production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and pcr amplification using specific primers. three different esbls were detected: shv-related (4 isolates), per-2-type (9 isolates), and ctx-m-2-related (26 isolates). sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed ctx-m-2 in 19 of 21 and ctx-m-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. ctx-m-2 (or its variant) was detected in all escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and providencia stuartii strains, while per-2 was detected in enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and klebsiella pneumoniae; shv-related esbl were found only in k. pneumoniae. these results clearly show that ctx-m-2 is the most prevalent esbl produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in buenos aires.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae: an italian survey.
AB  == the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production by consecutive non-repeated isolates of enterobacteriaceae was determined over a 6-month period. a total of 8015 strains were isolated from ten italian laboratories and 509 (6.3%) of these were designated esbl producers from the results of a double-disk synergy test. escherichia coli was the most isolated microrganism, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. providencia stuartii (28.1%) was the most frequently isolated esbl producer, followed by k. pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes (20.5%). however, amongst all esbl producers, k. pneumoniae (38.2%) was the most represented followed by p. mirabilis (25.7%). all the strains positive to dd tests were confirmed for the carriage of tem and shv genes using colony-blot hybridisation (ch). a total of 447 strains (88.0%) were ch-positive, of which 42.3% hybridised with the tem-type probe, 30.1% with the shv-type probe and 15.6% with both probes. in conclusion, our findings indicate that 6.3% of all enterobacteriaceae tested produced esbls,  42.3% of which were tem-derived enzymes. more than 20% of p. stuartii, k. pneumoniae and e. aerogenes harbour these enzymes. the double-disk test seems to  be a useful test to identify esbl producing strains.

AB  == from the guts of new and old colonies (female and male) of mexican fruit flies, anastrepha ludens (diptera: tephritidae), we identified a total of 18 different bacterial species belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae, vibrionaceae, micrococcaceae, deinococcacea, bacillaceae, and the genus listeria. enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated genera, with citrobacter, streptococcus, aerococcus, and listeria found less frequently. we found bacillus cereus, enterobacter sakazakii, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa only in the new colony, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae spp. pneumoniae only in the old colony. we also studied resistance/sensitivity to 12 antibiotics for six bacterial isolates such as enterobacter cloacae, e. sakazakii, k. pneumoniae spp., providencia rettgeri, p. aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus. isolates on the whole were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin (five of six isolates) and sensitive to rifampin and streptomycin (six of six isolates). antibiotic resistance profiles might be useful characteristics for distinguishing among species and strains of these bacteria, probably having ecological significance with respect to intra- and inter-specific competition within host cadavers, and could have implications for the utility of these organisms for biological control, including the alternative control strategy, paratransgenesis.

TI  == gyra mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in eight species of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == fluoroquinolone resistance (fq-r) in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae species has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. two mechanisms of fq-r have been identified in gram-negative organisms: mutations in  dna gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. a single point mutation in gyra has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. to determine the extent of gyra mutations associated with fq-r in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdr) of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. this set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the qrdrs from 8 enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens. although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80.8 to 93.3%, when compared with that of e. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyra qrdr were highly conserved. conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the qrdrs of the susceptible type strains of c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. oxytoca (ser-83 to  thr), and p. stuartii (asp-87 to glu). strains with ciprofloxacin mics of >2 microg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the gly-81, ser-83, or  asp-87 position. fluoroquinolone mics varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyra mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyra contribute to  resistance. the type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. high-level fq-r frequently was associated with single gyra mutations in all species of enterobacteriaceae in this study except e. coli.

TI  == a bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and morganella morganii at low ph.
AB  == to infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach.  in this study, we showed that y. enterocolitica serotype o8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as ph 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-ph conditions. acid tolerance of helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was  not specifically activated by low-ph conditions. a ure mutant strain of y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea  was the sole nitrogen source. examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but escherichia coli 1021, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases  were activated in vitro by low ph with an unusually low activity optimum of ph 5.5. in whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below ph 3.0 for y. enterocolitica and ph 5.5 for m. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. dna sequence analysis of portions of the m. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of y. enterocolitica urease. one region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of lactobacillus fermentum. this region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases since  the l. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low ph optimum for activity.

TI  == in vitro activity of an oxycephem ocp 9-176 compared with its sulfur analog and other beta-lactams.
AB  == ocp 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at c-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at c-3. ocp 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog me 1228 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia  stuartii, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. activity against enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii was equivalent. ocp 9-176 was twofold less active than me-1228 against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. activity of the two agents was similar against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. although ocp 9-176 inhibited e. coli containing tem-1 and tem-2, it was less active than me-1228. klebsiella organisms with shv-1 and k-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but tem-3-containing isolates had mics of 16  micrograms/ml. ocp 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by tem-1, pse-1, k-1, and p99,  and it was a poor inhibitor of p99. replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at c-3.

TI  == combination of ofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == we evaluated the combination of ofloxacin with piperacillin, gentamicin, vancomycin, rifampin, clindamycin, and metronidazole by the checkerboard agar dilution method against 165 isolates which included escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and citrobacter perfringens. synergy of piperacillin-ofloxacin was demonstrated for 50% and 40% respectively of e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa. some ofloxacin and  piperacillin-resistant isolates were susceptible with the combination. ofloxacin-gentamicin was indifferent for aerobic gram-negative species. ofloxacin and vancomycin or gentamicin was indifferent for s. aureus and e. faecalis, but rifampin-ofloxacin showed addition. combination of ofloxacin and metronidazole or clindamycin or erythromycin was indifferent for aerobic and anaerobic species. ofloxacin could be combined with piperacillin with benefit against p. aeruginosa, but combination with aminoglycosides is not of benefit.

AB  == bmy-28232, an aminothiazolyl imino methoxy cephalosporin which is available as an orally absorbed acetoxyethyl ester, inhibited strains of methicillin-susceptible  staphylococcus aureus, hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and many strains of proteus and providencia stuartii at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, including isolates resistant to cephalexin and cefaclor. it had activity similar to that of cefixime, but was  more active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci. bmy-28232 was a poor substrate for beta-lactamases but was destroyed by the new tem-3 enzyme, and had  less activity against enterobacter species, citrobacter freundii, and proteus vulgaris isolates. methicillin-resistant staphylococci, pseudomonas species, enterococci, listeria monocytogenes, corynebacterium jeikeium, bacteroides fragilus and some strains of clostridium species were resistant to bmy-28232.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. against the enteric pathogens salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei, yersinia enterocolitica and  campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. meropenem was also more active than imipenem against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.25 mg/l), against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against acinetobacter spp. and  two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. both  meropenem and imipenem were inactive against ps. (xanthomonas) maltophilia.

TI  == blockage of urinary catheters: role of microorganisms and constituents of the urine on formation of encrustations.
AB  == long-term indwelling urinary catheters may become blocked in some patients by formation of encrustations made up of aggregated struvite crystals while other patients rarely develop blocked catheters. we have designated these groups as "blockers", "intermediates" or "non-blockers". to further understand this phenomenon we followed 32 catheterized elderly women in a nursing home. catheters were changed six times at 2 week intervals. patients tended to remain as "blockers", "intermediates" or "non-blockers" consistently over time. there were  no significant differences in use of antibiotics, clinical manifestations of urinary infection or fever among the groups. "blockers" were significantly more often colonized with proteus mirabilis and providencia stuartii than "non-blockers", and significantly less often with klebsiella pneumoniae. however, there was no evidence of interference among the organisms. "blockers" excreted a  significantly more alkaline urine, and lesser amounts of magnesium, urea and phosphate in their urine. two "blockers" in whom proteus sp. were eliminated by coincidental antimicrobial therapy converted to "non-blockers". these findings support the concept that "blockers" are patients who have prolonged colonization  with urease producing proteus mirabilis and providencia stuartii.

TI  == enzymatic degradation of urinary indoxyl sulfate by providencia stuartii and klebsiella pneumoniae causes the purple urine bag syndrome.
AB  == the etiology of the purple urine bag syndrome (pubs), in which the urinary catheter bag of some elderly patients develops intense purple coloration, was studied. the purple was found to be a mixture of indirubin dissolved in the plastic and indigo on its surface. six patients with pubs were studied, and providencia stuartii was isolated from the urine of five and klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from the urine of one. these strains produced indigo in 7.9 mm indoxyl sulfate-containing agar. one hundred and fifty isolates of 41 species of bacteria were tested for their ability to produce indigo on agar containing indoxyl sulfate, but only 17 of 27 strains of p. stuartii, a single strain of klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter agglomerans were positive. all  of the indigo-producing bacteria had an indoxyl phosphatase with a pi of 6.4. this enzyme also possessed indoxyl sulfatase activity and was not present in strains that were unable to produce indigo from indoxyl sulfate. we conclude that pubs results from the decomposition of urinary indoxyl sulfate to indigo and indirubin by bacteria (notably p. stuartii). as elderly catheterized patients often have high urinary indoxyl sulfate levels and colonization of their urinary  tract with p. stuartii, the condition is most commonly seen in them.

TI  == assessment of antiseptic bladder washout procedures using a physical model of the catheterised bladder.
AB  == a simple physical model of the catheterised bladder has been used to assess the activities of antiseptic agents that have been recommended as bladder instillations in the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients with indwelling catheters. the activities of povidone-iodine, phenoxyethanol, chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine supplemented with edta + tris, noxythiolin and neomycin were examined against selected species of uropathogens. except for phenoxyethanol against pv. stuartii and possibly ps. aeruginosa, single applications of these antibacterials for 30 min were not effective in sterilising urine in the artificial bladder. however, a second application 1 h later of phenoxyethanol but not chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine did eradicate ps. aeruginosa. it is suggested that bacteria growing as a film on the bladder wall are particularly resistant to antimicrobials.

AB  == a prevalence study was carried out on a 100-bed veterans administration nursing home care unit to determine the extent of colonization with gentamicin-resistant  gram-negative bacilli (grgnb). hand cultures of 12 employees and 17 environmental cultures were negative. twenty-six of 86 (30%) patients were colonized with 49 grgnb. sixteen patients (19%) had urinary colonization. multivariate analysis revealed significant associations between rectal or perineal colonization (p less than 0.01), and the presence of a urinary device (82% condom catheters) (p less than 0.05), with urinary colonization. the most common isolates were providencia  stuartii (20), escherichia coli (nine) and klebsiella pneumoniae (nine). twenty-six of 49 isolates carried plasmids. restriction endonuclease digestion of plasmid dna was performed for 21. cross-colonization, as defined by the presence  of the identical species with the identical restriction endonuclease digestion profile of purified plasmid dna found in different patients, was observed for eight of 21 (38%) strains. all were geographically clustered. no strains could transfer gentamicin-resistance by conjugation and only two plasmids could transform our e coli recipient to gentamicin resistance. one e coli plasmid was identical to two citrobacter freundii plasmids and a p stuartii plasmid isolated  from three different patients. this 105 kb plasmid is conjugative and encodes resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin, tetracycline, and sulfonamides. thus, 57% of strains were cross-colonizing or contained identical r-plasmids. southern  hybridization using a 1 kb tem-1 gene probe demonstrated sequences homologous to  this probe in five of five nursing home plasmids examined.(abstract truncated at  250 words)

TI  == do clinical microbiology laboratories report complete bacteriology in urine from  patients with long-term urinary catheters?
AB  == bacteriuria associated with long-term urinary catheters (those in place for greater than or equal to 30 days) appears to be the most common nosocomial infection in u.s. medical care facilities. this bacteriuria is polymicrobial and  dynamic and accompanied by fevers, catheter obstructions, bacteremias, and deaths. we compared the reporting by our research laboratory of bacteria present  in urine from long-term-catheterized nursing home patients with that by two commercial laboratories. the commercial laboratories isolated significantly fewer bacterial species at 10(5) cfu/ml of urine specimen. organisms well recognized as causes of urinary tract infections in noncatheterized patients (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae) were isolated in comparable frequencies by both the research and commercial laboratories. however, other organisms, including uncommon uropathogens like providencia stuartii and morganella morganii, which were actually among the most frequent bacteriuric species in these long-term-catheterized patients, were isolated significantly less frequently by the commercial laboratories. reasons for the discrepancies are unclear but may involve use of different techniques. more complete reporting may  lead to better understanding of the polymicrobial bacteriuria of long-term catheters and its associated complications. this, in turn, may result in improved patient care and infection control in nursing homes.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. the compound was highly active against the common members of the enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. ym-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii. the activity of ym-13115 against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. against haemophilus influenzae ym-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. ym-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the concentrations of ym-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78  and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit streptococcus faecalis. ym-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. ym-13115 is extremely active  against p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of current disinfectants for leg bags.
AB  == an in vitro study was performed investigating the bactericidal ability of five common cleaning agents for leg bags against organisms frequently causing urinary  tract infection in spinal cord injured (sci) patients. individual disposable uridrain leg bags were inoculated with urine containing greater than 10(5) colonies/ml of the selected organism. the organisms used were: pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, herellea, and enterococcus. each pair of inoculated bags (one bag for immediate or 0 hour culture and one bag for 24 hour culture) was filled with 30 ml of the test solution, cleaned, drained, and then cultured. the  tested solutions included: plain tap water, 1/4% acetic acid, 3% hydrogen peroxide, sporicidin 1:16 dilution, and 0.06% sodium hypochlorite. the results demonstrated that plain tap water had no effect on reducing the bacterial counts  and that 1/4% acetic acid and 3% hydrogen peroxide had only a marginal effect across the spectrum of organisms. sporicidin and 0.06% sodium hypochlorite exhibited complete bactericidal ability. in the final analysis, 0.06% sodium hypochlorite is the most cost efficient and readily accessible to patients. in practical application, disinfecting daily with 0.06% sodium hypochlorite can decrease external contamination of urinary drainage appliances in sci patients.

TI  == selection of multiple antibiotic resistance by quinolones, beta-lactams, and aminoglycosides with special reference to cross-resistance between unrelated drug classes.
AB  == the ability of three quinolones, two beta-lactams, and one aminoglycoside to select resistant mutants was examined in tests with 30 isolates of commonly encountered nosocomial pathogens. ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, two new quinolone derivatives, were no more likely to select resistant mutants than amikacin, whereas nalidixic acid, an older quinolone derivative, was the most likely of the six drugs examined to select resistant mutants. mutational frequencies of 10(-7) to 10(-8) were observed in most instances. in general, the  mutants were 8 to 16 times less susceptible to the drug used for selection. although most quinolone-selected mutants were cross-resistant only to other drugs within this class, certain mutants of klebsiella pneumoniae selected by nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, or norfloxacin were also less susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. this unusual pattern of multiple drug resistance was associated with changes in outer membrane proteins of the organism. multiple drug resistance was  also observed in beta-lactam-selected mutants of enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa (beta-lactams), amikacin-selected mutants of providencia stuartii and p. aeruginosa (aminoglycosides), and beta-lactam- or amikacin-selected mutants of serratia marcescens (beta-lactams plus aminoglycosides). these results underscore the need to examine carefully the frequency with which resistance to any new antibiotic develops, as well as the patterns of multiple drug resistance which may occur simultaneously.

TI  == detection of pse-2 beta-lactamase in enterobacteria.
AB  == pse-2, a plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase which was previously considered pseudomonas specific, was observed in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia stuartii, and enterobacter cloacae. all four isolates transferred pse-2 production, together with resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and sulfamethoxazole, into escherichia coli j62-1 and pseudomonas aeruginosa pu21. transfer correlated with acquisition by the transconjugants of a 65-megadalton plasmid, and this element was considered to encode pse-2 expression. the pse-2 enzyme conferred high-level carbenicillin resistance on both j62-1 and pu21 transconjugants, although the pse-2-producing providencia stuartii isolate was susceptible to carbenicillin.

AB  == the recently updated ms-2 bacterial identification system software (abbott laboratories, diagnostic division, irving, tex.) was compared with the original ms-2 bacterial identification software and the api 20e, using 968 strains of enterobacteriaceae. the updated ms-2 software correctly identified 94.4% of the isolates tested. api 20e and the original ms-2 software correctly identified 91 and 85.3% of the strains, respectively. ms-2 responses were considered to be equivocal (needing additional tests for verification) if the percent likelihood values were less than 80%. the percentage of equivocal responses was reduced from 6.5% with the original software to 2.2% with the updated software, and the percentage of incorrect identifications was reduced from 8.2 to 3.4% with the original and updated software, respectively. organisms belonging to 25 taxonomic  groups were tested. direct comparison of the two ms-2 programs showed that the updated ms-2 software increased the identification accuracy of salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, providencia stuartii, escherichia coli, shigella spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter  calcoaceticus. a decrease in accuracy was seen with citrobacter freundii, hafnia  alvei, enterobacter agglomerans, and yersinia pseudotuberculosis when the updated software was used. the remaining 12 taxonomic groups were not affected by the software changes. the updated ms-2 software appears to significantly improve the  identification accuracy of the ms-2 bacterial identification system.

TI  == plasmid pattern analysis of natural bacterial isolates and its epidemiological implication.
AB  == natural isolates of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and providencia stuartii were analysed to determine their plasmid content. this data allowed the identification of nosocomial strains of k. pneumoniae and p. stuartii and helped in the differentiation of epidemic strains  of e. coli 0111 and s. typhimurium. phenotypically similar isolates of s. typhimurium could be shown to be of independent origin using plasmid pattern analysis. the dissemination of a particular plasmid through different strains of  s. typhimurium resulted in a simulation of a very widely distributed epidemic strain, because the plasmid interfered with the phage type of its host strain in  addition to determining resistance properties. plasmid pattern analysis disclosed two independently existing but interacting epidemic processes: a bacterial 'epidemic' strain may become disseminated over a large territory and may predominate there for a long time; a single plasmid, however, may also become distributed through many different bacterial strains and may spread over a large  territory. plasmid pattern analysis provides a valuable and universal epidemiological laboratory method.

AB  == thirty-five patients underwent 38 treatment courses with cefotaxime. documented infections included 11 bacteremias, 7 cases of nosocomial pneumonia, 6 surgical wound infections, 3 bone infections, 1 biliary infection, and 1 urinary tract infection. granulocytopenic patients with fever received 15 courses of empiric cefotaxime therapy alone; in 8 courses, no definite site of infection or pathogen was isolated. broad-spectrum antibiotics had been administered to 23 patients before cefotaxime. thirty-seven bacterial pathogens were isolated from 25 patients. three such pathogens were resistant to cefotaxime and required alternative therapies. pathogenic isolates included 13 serratia marcescens, 12 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 escherichia coli, 2 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia stuartii, 1 enterobacter cloacae, 1 haemophilus influenzae, 1 enterococcus, and 1 staphylococcus aureus. of the treatment courses, 25 of 38 resulted in a favorable response to cefotaxime, including 9 of 15 in granulocytopenic patients. superinfection was seen in one patient. the emergence  of resistance was documented in another patient. of 15 patients with multiply resistant pathogens, 12 improved with cefotaxime. of 12 patients with pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 favorably responded. possible complications of cefotaxime were observed in 14 of 42 treatment courses. cefotaxime is most useful in treatment of infections due to multiply resistant, gram-negative pathogens other than pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB  == the activities in vitro of ceftazidime and of cefuroxime have been compared against 201 strains of bacteria which had been isolated either from outbreaks of  nosocomial infection or were typical of strains causing such outbreaks. ceftazidime was found to be about 1000 times more active against pseudomonas spp. and proteus vulgaris, and between 10 and 100 times more active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, proteus rettgeri, proteus morganii, providencia stuartii, alcaligenes faecalis and acinetobacter spp. on the other hand, cefuroxime was more active against staphylococcus epidermidis. an increase in inoculum size to 106 had little effect on the activity of ceftazidime, except in the case of pr. vulgaris strains, which grew, although only to a very limited extent, even in the presence of high concentrations of ceftazidime. anaerobic and hypercapnic conditions did not adversely affect the activity of ceftazidime. our in-vitro results thus indicate  that ceftazidime had as broad a spectrum as gentamicin, and is more intrinsically active.

AB  == the action of two restriction endonucleases on polyoma virus dna has been examined and the sites at which they cleave the dna located. one of the enzymes,  kpni from klebsiella pneumoniae ok8, cleaves polyoma dna twice at about 11-6 and  59-2% from the ecori site. the other enzyme, psti from providencia stuartii 164,  cleaves polyoma dna five times at about 14-8, 16-5, 32-6, 50-3 and 80-0% from the ecori site. some of the cleavages produced by these enzymes alone, or in conjunction with other endonucleases, may be of use in the isolation of regions of particular interest from the virus dna.

TI  == use of bile-esculin agar for rapid differentiation of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == bile-esculin agar has been used for several years for the presumptive identification of group d streptococci. all members of the enterobacteriaceae family will also grow on this medium, but only certain ones can hydrolyze esculin to 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin, which reacts with iron to produce a characteristic blackening of the medium. one thousand and six cultures from clinical specimens representing 20 genera were isolated and identified. heavy inocula from fresh pure culture isolates on heart infusion agar were placed on bile-esculin agar slants and incubated at 35 c. the slants were examined at 4 h and again at 18 h for esculin hydrolysis. shigella, salmonella, arizona, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, providencia alcalifaciens, and providencia stuartii all produced negative results. klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, and serratia rubidaea produced a positive reaction in 4 h. the other  remaining eight genera exhibited varying results. the use of this medium in conjunction with triple sugar iron-lysine iron agar has been of great value in differentiating the klebsiella-enterobacter-serratia group from other enterobacteriaceae.
