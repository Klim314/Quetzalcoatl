TI  == activity of oritavancin tested against uncommonly isolated gram-positive pathogens responsible for documented infections in hospitals worldwide.
AB  == objectives: to assess the oritavancin spectrum and activity against 2811 rarer species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), streptococci and other gram-positive species. methods: a total of 2057 cons (14 species), 674 streptococci (7 groups) and 80 other gram-positive species (3 genera) collected over a 5 year period as part of the sentry program (2008-12) were included. isolates were primarily identified by the participating laboratory and identification was confirmed by the reference monitoring laboratory (jmi laboratories, north liberty, ia, usa). isolates were tested for susceptibility by broth microdilution following the clsi m07-a9 and m100-s23 documents. results: overall, oritavancin was active against all cons (mic50/mic90, 0.015/0.06 mg/l),  with mic50 values of </=0.008-0.03 mg/l. streptococci exhibited oritavancin mic50 results of </=0.008 mg/l, except for the streptococcus bovis (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus dysgalactiae (0.06 mg/l) and streptococcus salivarius/vestibularis  (0.06 mg/l) groups. micrococcus spp., listeria monocytogenes and corynebacterium  spp. had oritavancin mic50 results of </=0.008 mg/l. conclusions: this study expands the oritavancin in vitro data against several species of gram-positive organisms.

TI  == evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16s rrna-encoding, reca, seca, and secy gene sequences.
AB  == background: streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. two of these species, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. given that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis share several  physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one  would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to s. thermophilus. however, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that s. vestibularis is more closely related to s. thermophilus. to determine whether  this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from seca and secy, the general secretion housekeeping genes, reca, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16s rrna-encoding gene sequences using  other streptococcal species as outgroups. results: the maximum likelihood (ml) and maximum parsimony (mp) phylogenetic inferences derived from the seca and reca gene sequences provided strong support for the s. vestibularis/s. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16s rrna-encoding and secy-based analyses could not  discriminate between alternate topologies. phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus. conclusion: our results corroborated the sister-relationship between s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of s. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

TI  == study of the intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility of partial single base c-sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and its applicability for the identification of members of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the use of single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene (sbcs) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of reference strains of 30 different species within the genus streptococcus. for sbcs, only dd-ctp's are used in the sequencing reactions instead of the four dideoxy bases and the primer is fluorescently labeled. the reproducibility, interlaboratory exchangeability and discriminative power of this method were studied by comparing the patterns obtained in three laboratories under highly standardized conditions. the interlaboratory reproducibility proved  to be high, enabling the construction of a common database for the identification of strains belonging to the streptococcal species studied. most of the examined species generated distinguishable profiles. sbcs did not differentiate between the closely related species s. constellatus and s. intermedius. also s. thermophilus and s. vestibularis as well as s. mitis and s. pneumoniae showed highly resembling profiles. the previously reported heterogeneity within the species s. equinus was reflected by sbcs. for all other species, strains belonging to the same species generated indistinguishable patterns. in conclusion, single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene  could be a useful and widely applicable method for the identification of bacteria at the species level, with the added advantage of being more rapid and easier to  automatize than full sequence determination.

TI  == speciation of presumptive viridans streptococci from early onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == twenty isolates resembling viridans streptococci, 16 from blood and four from gastric aspirates, from 17 cases of early onset neonatal sepsis were identified by the api20 strep, rapid id 32 strep and conventional tests plus hydrolysis of methylumbelliferyl glycoside substrates. nineteen of the isolates were identified as species of viridans streptococci and one as a leuconostoc sp. ten of the isolates were streptococcus oralis, three s. mitis biotype 1, two s. mitis biotype 2 and one each of s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius and s. intermedius. the rapid id 32 strep and conventional plus methylumbelliferyl tests gave the same species identity for 17 of the isolates. s. intermedius was identified by the rapid id 32 strep as s. constellatus and s. salivarius as s. equinus, with s. salivarius at lower probability. the api20 strep failed to identify s. vestibularis and identified s. salivarius as s. defectivus. the absence of certain critical tests, including urea hydrolysis, does not allow the  api20 strep to identify all the currently recognised species of viridans steptococci. the species distribution was unexpected and the incidence of s. oralis and other viridans streptococci in vaginal swabs from prenatal patients is being investigated further.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
