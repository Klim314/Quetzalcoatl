administration of lactobacillus salivarius li01 or pediococcus pentosaceus li05 improves acute liver injury induced by d-galactosamine in rats.
this work investigated the effect of the intragastric administration of five lactic acid bacteria from healthy people on acute liver failure in rats. sprague-dawley rats were given intragastric supplements of lactobacillus salivarius li01, lactobacillus salivarius li02, lactobacillus paracasei li03, lactobacillus plantarum li04, or pediococcus pentosaceus li05 for 8 days. acute liver injury was induced on the eighth day by intraperitoneal injection of 1.1 g/kg body weight d-galactosamine (d-galn). after 24 h, samples were collected to determine the level of liver enzymes, liver function, histology of the terminal ileum and liver, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, bacterial translocation, and composition of the gut microbiome. the results indicated that pretreatment with l. salivarius li01 or p. pentosaceus li05 significantly reduced elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, prevented the increase in total bilirubin, reduced the histological abnormalities of both the liver and the terminal ileum, decreased bacterial translocation, increased the serum level of interleukin 10 and/or interferon-gamma, and resulted in a cecal microbiome that differed from that of the liver injury control. pretreatment with l. plantarum li04 or l. salivarius li02 demonstrated no significant effects during this process, and pretreatment with l. paracasei li03 aggravated liver injury. to the best of our knowledge, the effects of the three species-l. paracasei, l. salivarius, and p. pentosaceus-on d-galn-induced liver injury have not been previously studied. the excellent characteristics of l. salivarius li01 and p. pentosaceus li05 enable them to serve as potential probiotics in the prevention or treatment of acute liver failure.
quorum sensing in sourdough lactobacillus plantarum dc400: induction of plantaricin a (plna) under co-cultivation with other lactic acid bacteria and effect of plna on bacterial and caco-2 cells.
this work aimed at showing the effect of pheromone plantaricin a (plna) by lactobacillus plantarum dc400 towards other sourdough lactic acid bacteria and the potential of plna to protect the function of the human intestinal barrier. growth and survival of sourdough lactic acid bacteria were differently affected by co-cultivation with l. plantarum dc400. compared to mono-cultures, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dppma174 and pediococcus pentosaceus 2xa3 showed growth inhibition and decreased viability when co-cultured with l. plantarum dc400. l. sanfranciscensis dppma174 induced the highest synthesis of plna. survival of strain dppma174 only slightly varied by comparing the addition of plna to the culture medium and the co-cultivation with l. plantarum dc400. compared to mono-culture, the proteome of l. sanfranciscensis dppma174 grown in co-culture with l. plantarum dc400 showed the variation of expression of 58 proteins (47 over expressed and 11 repressed). thirty-four of them were also over expressed or repressed during growth of dppma174 with plna. fifty-one of the above 58 proteins were identified. they had a central role in stress response, amino acid, energy and nucleotide metabolisms, membrane transport, regulation of transcription, and cell redox homeostasis. plna markedly increased the viability of human caco-2/tc7 cells and the transepithelial electrical resistance.
coculture with specific bacteria enhances survival of lactobacillus plantarum nc8, an autoinducer-regulated bacteriocin producer, in olive fermentations.
bacteriocin production in lactobacillus plantarum nc8 is activated by coculture with specific bacteriocin production-inducing bacterial strains. the system is further regulated by a three-component regulatory system involving a specific autoinducer peptide (plnc8if). we have used l. plantarum nc8 as a starter culture in spanish-style green olive fermentations and examined the influence of coculturing in its survival. we found that l. plantarum nc8 greatly enhanced its growth and survival in the olive fermentations when co-inoculated with two specific bacteriocin-production inducing strains, i.e. enterococcus faecium 6t1a-20 and pediococcus pentosaceus fbb63, when compared to singly-inoculated fermentations. in addition, a constitutive bacteriocin-producer nc8-derivative strain was used as a control in the olive fermentations and showed also better viability than the parental nc8 strain. our results suggest the involvement of bacteriocin production in the viability enhancement found in both cases. we postulate that the presence of specific bacteria is recognized by l. plantarum nc8 as an environmental stimulus to switch a specific adaptive response on, most probably involving bacteriocin production. the design of novel bacteriocin-producing starter cultures for food fermentations should consider their constitutive versus regulated character.
lactic acid bacteria in hamei and marcha of north east india.
hamei and marcha are mixed dough inocula used as starters for preparation of various indigenous alcoholic beverages in manipur and sikkim in india, respectively. these starters are traditionally prepared from rice with wild herbs and spices. samples of hamei and marcha, collected from manipur and sikkim, respectively, were analysed for lactic acid bacterial composition. the population of lactic acid bacteria (lab) was 6.9 and 7.1 log cfu/g in hamei and marcha, respectively. on the basis of phenotypic and genotypic characters, lab strains isolated from hamei and marcha were identified as pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis. technological properties of lab such as antimicrobial properties, effect on acidification, ability to produce biogenic amines and ethanol, degree of hydrophobicity and enzymatic activities were also performed. pediococcus pentosaceus hs: b1, isolated from hamei, was found to produce bacteriocin. none of the strains produced biogenic amines. lab strains showed a strong acidifying ability and they also produced a wide spectrum of enzymes.
the effect of prebiotics on production of antimicrobial compounds, resistance to  growth at low ph and in the presence of bile, and adhesion of probiotic cells to intestinal mucus.
aims: screening of five bile salt-resistant and low ph-tolerant lactic acid bacteria for inhibitory activity against lactic acid bacteria and bacterial strains isolated from the faeces of children with hiv/aids. determining the effect of prebiotics and soy milk-base on cell viability and adhesion of cells to intestinal mucus. methods and results: lactobacillus plantarum 423, lactobacillus casei lhs, lactobacillus salivarius 241, lactobacillus curvatus df 38 and pediococcus pentosaceus 34 produced the highest level of antimicrobial activity (12,800 au ml(-1)) when grown in mrs broth supplemented with 2% (m/v) dextrose. growth in the presence of raftilose synergy1, raftilose l95 and raftiline gr did not lead to increased levels of antimicrobial activity. cells grown in the presence of raftilose synergy1 took longer to adhere to intestinal mucus, whilst cells grown in the absence of prebiotics showed a linear rate of binding. conclusions: a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were inhibited. dextrose stimulated the production of antimicrobial compounds. adhesion to intestinal mucus did not increase with the addition of prebiotics. significance and impact of the study: the strains may be incorporated in food supplements for hiv/aids patients suffering from gastro-intestinal disorders.
characterization of mesentericin st99, a bacteriocin produced by leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99 isolated from boza.
lactic acid bacteria isolated from boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from belogratchik, bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. with the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum. the cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99, inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, several lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus. clostridium spp., carnobacterium spp., l. mesenteroides and gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (au)/ml, was recorded in mrs broth after 24 h at 30 degrees c. incubation in the presence of protease iv and pronase e resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin st99. no loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea, triton x-100, n-laurylsarcosin, edta and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. mesentericin st99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees c and after 2 h of incubation at ph 2 to 12. metabolically active cells of l. innocua treated with mesentericin st99 did not undergo lysis. mesentericin st99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain st99. precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by sep-pack c18 chromatography and reverse-phase hplc on a c18 nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.
purification and genetic characterization of plantaricin nc8, a novel coculture-inducible two-peptide bacteriocin from lactobacillus plantarum nc8.
a new, coculture-inducible two-peptide bacteriocin named plantaricin nc8 (plnc8)  was isolated from lactobacillus plantarum nc8 cultures which had been induced with lactococcus lactis mg1363 or pediococcus pentosaceus fbb63. this bacteriocin consists of two distinct peptides, named alpha and beta, which were separated by c(2)-c(18) reverse-phase chromatography and whose complementary action is necessary for full plantaricin nc8 activity. n-terminal sequencing of both purified peptides showed 28 and 34 amino acids residues for plnc8 alpha and plnc8 beta, respectively, which showed no sequence similarity to other known bacteriocins. mass spectrometry analysis showed molecular masses of 3,587 da (alpha) and 4,000 da (beta). the corresponding genes, designated plnc8a and plnc8b, were sequenced, and their nucleotide sequences revealed that both peptides are produced as bacteriocin precursors of 47 and 55 amino acids, respectively, which include n-terminal leader sequences of the double-glycine type. the mature alpha and beta peptides contain 29 and 34 amino acids, respectively. an open reading frame, orfc, which encodes a putative immunity protein was found downstream of plnc8b and overlapping plnc8a. upstream of the putative -35 region of plnc8b, two direct repeats of 9 bp were identified, which agrees with the consensus sequence and structure of promoters of class ii bacteriocin operons whose expression is dependent on an autoinduction mechanism.
analysis of the genetic determinant for production of the pediocin p of pediococcus pentosaceus pep1.
pediococcus pentosaceus pep1 is a vacuum-packaged turkish sausage isolate which produces a potentially novel bacteriocin of the pediocin (anti-listeria) family of peptides designated as pediocin p. curing experiments and plasmid profile analysis indicated that both bacteriocin immunity and production determinants were linked and encoded by 9.0 mda plasmid, phd1.0. attempts to transform purified plasmid phd1.0 into recipient escherichia coli jm109 cells by electroporation were successful but none of the e. coli jm109 cells were able to express and/or release pediocin p. however, p. pentosaceus pc, a plasmid-cured variant of p. pentosaceus pep1 was successfully transformed with phd1.0 by electroporation and bac-bacs p. pentosaceus pc cells restarted to express and/or release pediocin p again as indicated by the presence of zone of growth inhibition of l. plantarum ncdo 955 around colonies.
bacteriocin-mediated inhibition of clostridium botulinum spores by lactic acid bacteria at refrigeration and abuse temperatures.
the bacteriocinogenicity of lactococcus lactis atcc 11454, pediococcus pentosaceus atcc 43200, p. pentosaceus atcc 43201, lactobacillus plantarum bn, l. plantarum lb592, l. plantarum lb75, and lactobacillus acidophilus n2 against clostridium botulinum spores at 4, 10, 15, and 35 degrees c was investigated by modified deferred and simultaneous antagonism methods. all the strains, except l. acidophilus n2, produced inhibition zones on lawns of c. botulinum spores at 30 degrees c. l. plantarum bn, l. lactis atcc 11454, and p. pentosaceus atcc 43200 and 43201 were bacteriocinogenic at 4, 10, and 15 degrees c. supplementation of brain heart infusion agar with 0 to 5% nacl increased the radii of inhibition zones during simultaneous antagonism assays. detectable bacteriocin activities were extracted from freeze-thawed agar cultures of l. plantarum bn and l. lactis atcc 11454 which had been grown at 4 and 10 degrees c. these results suggest that low levels of l. plantarum bn or l. lactis atcc 11454, in the presence of 3 or 4% nacl, could be formulated into minimally processed refrigerated food products for protection against possible botulism hazards.
the occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees c) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the ph of the mix to 4.5-4.7. significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis. micrococcus varians and micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. less growth was exhibited by bacillus megaterium and yeasts. pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (p. pentosaceus and l. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. the growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. inoculated escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella sofia, and staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. lesser growth occurred for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and vibrio parahaemolyticus. growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with p. acidilactici.
antibacterial activity of plantaricin sik-83, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum.
lactobacillus plantarum sik-83 produces a bacteriocin, designated plantaricin sik-83, which inhibits 66 of 68 lactic acid bacteria from the genera lactobacillus, leuconostoc, pediococcus and streptococcus. a 500-fold dilution of l. plantarum sik-83 mrs culture supernatant with phosphate buffer was sufficient to kill 10(5) cells/ml of pediococcus pentosaceus within 120 s. the killing of a sensitive population followed exponential kinetics. it was shown that the bacteriocin binds specifically to sensitive cells but not to nonsensitive lactic acid bacteria, the producer strain or gram-negative bacteria. sensitive cells, after exposure to the bacteriocin, could be rescued by treatment with proteolytic enzymes. in buffer, plantaricin sik-83 was adsorbed to the cell surface almost immediately, and morphological lesions were observed within 2 h after the cells were exposed to the bacteriocin. the lethal mode of action appeared to be due to damage to the cell membrane, resulting in cell lysis, which was detected by electron microscopy and by determination of released intracellular components.
plasmid-associated bacteriocin production and sucrose fermentation in pediococcus acidilactici.
production of bacteriocin activity designated pediocin pa-1 was associated with the presence of a 6.2-megadalton plasmid in pediococcus acidilactici pac1.0. the bacteriocin exhibited activity against p. acidilactici, p. pentosaceus, lactobacillus plantarum, l. casei, l. bifermentans, and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum. partial characterization of pediocin pa-1 is described. the molecular weight of pediocin pa-1 was ca. 16,500. additionally, strain pac1.0 was found to contain a 23-megadalton plasmid associated with sucrose-fermenting ability.
