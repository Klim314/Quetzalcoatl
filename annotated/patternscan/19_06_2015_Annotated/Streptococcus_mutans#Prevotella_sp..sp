TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == extensive description and comparison of human supra-gingival microbiome in root caries and health.
AB  == knowledge of the polymicrobial etiology of root caries is limited. to conduct a comprehensive research study on root caries, we utilized 454-pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene libraries and quantitative pcr to compare supra-gingival bacterial  communities from healthy sites and carious sites of 21 patients with root caries  (patient-controls and patient-cases) and the sites of 21 healthy individuals (healthy-controls) from two nursing homes. healthy-controls and patient-cases showed no significant differences in terms of biomass, species richness, and species diversity. however, as for beta diversity based on either community membership metric (unweighted unifrac) or community structure metric (weighted unifrac), healthy-controls and patient-cases were clearly distinguished from each other, appearing more variable in the community membership and structure in root  caries microbiome but relatively conserved in the health microbiome. the patient-controls group was at an intermediate stage between healthy-controls and  patient-cases, but was more inclined to the former. demonstrated in both relative abundance and prevalence of species in health and root caries, propionibacterium  acidifaciens, streptococcus mutans, olsenella profusa, prevotella multisaccharivorax, and lactobacillus crispatus were found to be most associated  with root caries, whereas delftia acidovorans, bacteroidetes[g-2] sp., lachnospiraceae[g-3] sp., and prevotella intermedia are most associated with health. our study provides a basis for further elucidating the microbial etiology of root caries in the elderly.

TI  == comparison of bacterial culture and 16s rrna community profiling by clonal analysis and pyrosequencing for the characterization of the dentine caries-associated microbiome.
AB  == culture-independent analyses have greatly expanded knowledge regarding the composition of complex bacterial communities including those associated with oral diseases. a consistent finding from such studies, however, has been the under-reporting of members of the phylum actinobacteria. in this study, five pairs of broad range primers targeting 16s rrna genes were used in clonal analysis of 6 samples collected from tooth lesions involving dentine in subjects  with active caries. samples were also subjected to cultural analysis and pyrosequencing by means of the 454 platform. a diverse bacterial community of 229 species-level taxa was revealed by culture and clonal analysis, dominated by representatives of the genera prevotella, lactobacillus, selenomonas, and streptococcus. the five most abundant species were: lactobacillus gasseri, prevotella denticola, alloprevotella tannerae, s. mutans and streptococcus sp. hot 070, which together made up 31.6 % of the sequences. two samples were dominated by lactobacilli, while the remaining samples had low numbers of lactobacilli but significantly higher numbers of prevotella species. the different primer pairs produced broadly similar data but proportions of the phylum bacteroidetes were significantly higher when primer 1387r was used. all of the primer sets underestimated the proportion of actinobacteria compared to culture. pyrosequencing analysis of the samples was performed to a depth of sequencing of 4293 sequences per sample which were identified to 264 species-level taxa, and resulted in significantly higher coverage estimates than  the clonal analysis. pyrosequencing, however, also underestimated the relative abundance of actinobacteria compared to culture.

TI  == identification of the microbiota in carious dentin lesions using 16s rrna gene sequencing.
AB  == while mutans streptococci have long been assumed to be the specific pathogen responsible for human dental caries, the concept of a complex dental caries-associated microbiota has received significant attention in recent years.  molecular analyses revealed the complexity of the microbiota with the predominance of lactobacillus and prevotella in carious dentine lesions. however, characterization of the dentin caries-associated microbiota has not been extensively explored in different ethnicities and races. in the present study, the bacterial communities in the carious dentin of japanese subjects were analyzed comprehensively with molecular approaches using the16s rrna gene. carious dentin lesion samples were collected from 32 subjects aged 4-76 years, and the 16s rrna genes, amplified from the extracted dna with universal primers,  were sequenced with a pyrosequencer. the bacterial composition was classified into clusters i, ii, and iii according to the relative abundance (high, middle, low) of lactobacillus. the bacterial composition in cluster ii was composed of relatively high proportions of olsenella and propionibacterium or subdominated by heterogeneous genera. the bacterial communities in cluster iii were characterized by the predominance of atopobium, prevotella, or propionibacterium with streptococcus or actinomyces. some samples in clusters ii and iii, mainly related to atopobium and propionibacterium, were novel combinations of microbiota in carious dentin lesions and may be characteristic of the japanese population. clone library analysis revealed that atopobium sp. hot-416 and p. acidifaciens were specific species associated with dentinal caries among these genera in a japanese population. we summarized the bacterial composition of dentinal carious  lesions in a japanese population using next-generation sequencing and found typical japanese types with atopobium or propionibacterium predominating.

TI  == dental caries and microbiota in children with black stain and non-discoloured dental plaque.
AB  == aim: we aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (bs) and non-discoloured plaque. methods: forty-six children with bs and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. dental caries was scored using who criteria. samples of bs and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. the dna of the samples was extracted and real-time pcr was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus sp., actinomyces naeslundii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results: children with bs had lower dmft (p = 0.013), lower dt values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. plaque samples of the bs group contained higher numbers of a. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of f. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with  bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus  sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience  in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

TI  == white-spot lesions and gingivitis microbiotas in orthodontic patients.
AB  == white-spot lesions (wsl) associated with orthodontic appliances are a cosmetic problem and increase risk for cavities. we characterized the microbiota of wsl, accounting for confounding due to gingivitis. participants were 60 children with  fixed appliances, aged between 10 and 19 yrs, half with wsl. plaque samples were  assayed by a 16s rrna-based microarray (homim) and by pcr. mean gingival index was positively associated with wsl (p = 0.018). taxa associated with wsl by microarray included granulicatella elegans (p = 0.01), veillonellaceae sp. hot 155 (p < 0.01), and bifidobacterium cluster 1 (p = 0.11), and by qpcr, streptococcus mutans (p = 0.008) and scardovia wiggsiae (p = 0.04) taxa associated with gingivitis by microarray included: gemella sanguinis (p = 0.002), actinomyces sp. hot 448 (p = 0.003), prevotella cluster iv (p = 0.021), and streptococcus sp. hot 071/070 (p = 0.023); and levels of s. mutans (p = 0.02) and bifidobacteriaceae (p = 0.012) by qpcr. species' associations with wsl were minimally changed with adjustment for gingivitis level. partial least-squares discriminant analysis yielded good discrimination between children with and those without wsl. granulicatella, veillonellaceae and bifidobacteriaceae, in addition  to s. mutans and s. wiggsiae, were associated with the presence of wsl in adolescents undergoing orthodontic treatment. many taxa showed a stronger association with gingivitis than with wsl.

TI  == clinical status and detection of periodontopathogens and streptococcus mutans in  children with high levels of supragingival biofilm.
AB  == knowledge about the presence of some important oral pathogens is an important step in better identifying children at risk for periodontal and/or caries diseases in later life. the purpose of this study was to detect the presence of streptococcus mutans (sm), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), campylobacter rectus (cr), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), and tannerella forsythia (tf) in gingival biofilm samples from 196 children, and to assess whether any of these pathogens are more associated with gingival inflammation extension and the decayed/missing/filled teeth (dmft/dmft)  index. the subjects presented plaque index greater than 80% and were divided in 3 groups according to the bleeding index (bi): i) low bleeding (< 30%), ii) medium  bleeding (31 - 59%) and iii) high bleeding (> 60%). the presence of each pathogen was determined by pcr. the prevalence of sm was 71.9% and the mean dmft/dmft was  6.68. the prevalence in low, medium and high bleeding groups was 43.5%, 34.5% and 46.7% for aa; 43.5%, 37.9%, and 36.7% for cr; 99.1%, 100%, and 96.7% for pg; 56.5%, 56.9%, and 66.7% for pi; and 58.3%, 60.3%, and 56.7% for tf, respectively. pg (99.0%) was the most prevalent periodontal pathogen detected followed by tf (58.7%), pi (58.2%), aa (41.3%) and cr (40.8%). our study indicated that in this  high plaque index population studied, a high prevalence of sm and high mean dmft  were observed. in addition, the presence of pi was associated with the presence of inflammation (p < 0.05) whereas cr was associated with periodontal health (p < 0.05).

TI  == correlates of periodontal decline and biologic markers in older adults.
AB  == background: there is limited information on infectious and host responses distinguishing older people with or without active periodontitis. this study measured bacterial and serum cytokine and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hscrp) levels in older persons. methods: elders (mean age: 67 years), whose periodontal status had declined most or least (20% worst or 20% best) over 5 years, were enrolled. two years later, they were classified as periodontally declining (active periodontitis [ap]), if they had at least five teeth with probing depth (pd) > or =5 mm, or stable (stable periodontally [sp]), if they did not. groups were compared with respect to demographics, pd, clinical loss of attachment, subgingival bacteria, serum hscrp, interleukin (il)-1beta and -6, and chronic diseases. results: ten ap and 24 sp subjects were identified; 13% of women and 44% of men from the original sample were in the ap group (p <0.05). most asians were sp; most whites and all african americans were classified as having ap (p <0.01). more ap elders had osteoporosis (p <0.01), but the ap and sp groups did not differ with respect to il-1beta and -6 or hscrp. bacterial counts  were higher in the ap group for parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros) (7.7 x 10(5) cells versus 3.8 x 10(5) cells; p <0.05), prevotella intermedia (25.7 x 10(5) cells versus 9.8 x 10(5) cells; p <0.01), tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (16.2 x 10(5) cells versus 8.0 x 10(5) cells; p <0.05), and streptococcus mutans (6.2 x 10(5) cells versus 2.0 x 10(5) cells; p <0.01). three risk factors were most predictive of periodontal decline: pd, osteoporosis, and being white or african american. conclusion: periodontal decline was associated with osteoporosis, ethnicity, pd,  gender, serum hscrp, and levels of four bacterial species.

TI  == antimicrobial effect and ph of chlorhexidine gel and calcium hydroxide alone and  associated with other materials.
AB  == the purposes of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of 2% chlorhexidine (chx) gluconate gel, calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] and their combination with iodoform and zinc oxide powder as intracanal medications against select microorganisms, and to measure the ph changes caused by these medications. antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method. the zones of  growth inhibition were measured and the results were analyzed statistically by kruskal-wallis test (p<0.05). the ph of the pastes was measured right after preparation, after 24 h and 1 week later. the largest mean zones of microbial inhibition were produced by 2% chx gel, followed by ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel + iodoform, ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel, ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel + zinc oxide, and ca(oh)2 +  water. the mean ph of all medications stayed above 12.0 during the whole experiment, except for chx gel (ph=7.0). the results of this study showed that all medications had antimicrobial activity, but the most effective against the tested microorganisms were 2% chx gel, followed by its combination with ca(oh)2 and iodoform.

TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.
