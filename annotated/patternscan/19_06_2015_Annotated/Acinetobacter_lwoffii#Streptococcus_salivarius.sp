TI  == identification of host-immune response protein candidates in the sera of human oral squamous cell carcinoma patients.
AB  == one of the most common cancers worldwide is oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc),  which is associated with a significant death rate and has been linked to several  risk factors. notably, failure to detect these neoplasms at an early stage represents a fundamental barrier to improving the survival and quality of life of oscc patients. in the present study, serum samples from oscc patients (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 25) were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de) and silver staining in order to identify biomarkers that might allow early diagnosis. in this regard, 2-de spots corresponding to various  up- and down-regulated proteins were sequenced via high-resolution maldi-tof mass spectrometry and analyzed using the mascot database. we identified the following  differentially expressed host-specific proteins within sera from oscc patients: leucine-rich alpha2-glycoprotein (lrg), alpha-1-b-glycoprotein (abg), clusterin (clu), pro2044, haptoglobin (hap), complement c3c (c3), proapolipoprotein a1 (proapo-a1), and retinol-binding protein 4 precursor (rbp4). moreover, five non-host factors were detected, including bacterial antigens from acinetobacter lwoffii, burkholderia multivorans, myxococcus xanthus, laribacter hongkongensis,  and streptococcus salivarius. subsequently, we analyzed the immunogenicity of these proteins using pooled sera from oscc patients. in this regard, five of these candidate biomarkers were found to be immunoreactive: clu, hap, c3, proapo-a1 and rbp4. taken together, our immunoproteomics approach has identified  various serum biomarkers that could facilitate the development of early diagnostic tools for oscc.
