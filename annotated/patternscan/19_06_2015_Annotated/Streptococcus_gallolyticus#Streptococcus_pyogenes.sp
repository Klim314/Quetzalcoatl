TI  == icesp1116, the genetic element responsible for erm(b)-mediated, inducible resistance to erythromycin in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == icesp1116, responsible for erm(b)-mediated, inducible erythromycin resistance in  streptococcus pyogenes, was comprehensively characterized, and its chromosomal integration site was determined. it displayed a unique mosaic organization consisting of a scaffold, related to tngallo1 from streptococcus gallolyticus, with two inserted fragments separated by is1216. one fragment, containing erm(b), displayed high-level identity to a portion of the s. pyogenes plasmid psm19035; the other, containing a truncated tet(m) gene, displayed high-level identity to the right-hand portion of clostridium difficile tn5397.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == the gram-positive tonsillar and nasal flora of piglets before and after weaning.
AB  == aims: to investigate gram-positive nasal and tonsillar microbial flora of piglets before and after weaning. methods and results: the nasal and tonsillar gram-positive bacterial flora of 20 non-weaned piglets (2 weeks of age) and 20 weaned piglets (6 weeks of age), obtained from four different piggeries, was quantified by culture and identified by tdna-pcr. the most widely occurring species from nasal conchae before as well as after weaning in the different piglets investigated were streptococcus suis and rothia nasimurium. after weaning a wide variety of lactobacillus species appeared but in low numbers. in the tonsils, strep. suis, strep. dysgalactiae, s. hyicus, s. aureus, arcanobacterium  pyogenes and actinomyces hyovaginalis were the species isolated from the largest  number of pigs before and after weaning. s. aureus and most lactobacilli became more prevalent after weaning. bacteria not known to be associated with pigs found in the present study included r. nasimurium, strep. gallolyticus, pediococcus pentosaceus and some lactobacillus species. conclusions: over 30 different gram-positive bacterial species may occur in nasal conchae and tonsils of unweaned piglets at 2 weeks of age and of 6-week-old weaned piglets. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrated that weaning is associated with  changes in prevalence of only a small minority of the highly diversified bacterial flora of the nares and tonsils of pigs.
