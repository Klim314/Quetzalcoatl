TI  == [role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  == according to the data of the international agency for research on cancer (iarc),  at least 6 virus species (hpv, ebv, hhv-8/kshv, htlv-1, hbv, hcv), 4 helminthes species (schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis) and i bacterium species (helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. the analysis of the data available shows that merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), john cunningham polyomavirus (jcv), monkey virus 40 (sv40), cytomegalovirus (cmv), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xmrv), helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, campylobacter jejuni, fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella spp., streptococcus bovis and anginosus, treponema denticola, salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, borrelia burgdorferi, bartonella spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, propionibacterium acnes, tropheryma whippelii, schistosoma mansoni, opistorchis felineus, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia solium, candida  spp., paracoccidioides brasiliensis, histoplasma capsulatum and trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == [microorganisms and cancer: scientific evidence and new hypotheses].
AB  == microorganism involvement in cancer has been known for over a century, and different types of parasites, bacteria and viruses have been associated with oncogenic processes. among the bacteria, the first recognised was helicobacter pylori which causes gastric cancer and might be related to extra-gastric cancer in humans. helicobacter hepaticus has been associated with liver cancers using animal models. other bacteria, such as chlamydia psitacii, borrelia burgdorferi and streptococcus bovis, have been associated with ocular, skin and colorectal cancers, respectively. also, a commensal bacterium in the human intestine, bacteroides fragilis, has been linked, very recently, with colorectal cancer using animal models.

TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of hindgut bacteria associated with the development of equine laminitis.
AB  == carbohydrate-induced laminitis in horses is characterized by marked changes in the composition of the hindgut microbiota, from a predominantly gram-negative population to one dominated by gram-positive bacteria. the objective of this study was to monitor changes in the relative abundance of selected hindgut bacteria that have previously been implicated in the pathophysiology of equine laminitis using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). caecal cannulae were surgically implanted in five standardbred horses and laminitis induced by oral administration of a bolus dose of oligofructose. caecal fluid and faecal specimens were collected over a 48 h period at 2 to 4 h intervals post-oligofructose administration and subjected to fish using probes specific for nine bacterial groups to determine changes in their relative abundance compared with total bacteria hybridizing to the generic eubmix probe. additionally, hoof biopsies were taken over the course of the experiment at 6 h intervals and evaluated for histopathological changes consistent with laminitis, allowing changes in hindgut microbiota to be correlated with the onset of lesions in the foot. of the microorganisms specifically targeted, streptococci of the streptococcus bovis/equinus complex were the only bacteria that consistently proliferated in both caecal fluid and faeces immediately before the onset of histological signs of laminitis. furthermore, lactobacilli, enterobacteriaceae, allisonella histaminiformans, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, mitsuokella jalaludinii and clostridium difficile did not establish significant populations in the hindgut before the onset of equine laminitis.

TI  == [community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. iii. microbiological aspects].
AB  == a retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the ivrea-castellamonte hospital (turin, italy). a total of 4386 vials  from 619 patients were examined. there were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. there were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). a total of 165 microorganism were isolated: gram-positive (52.7%) and gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). the predominant families were: enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), micrococcaceae (27.3%), pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and streptococcus "genus" (18.8%). the species frequencies  were: escherichia coli (20%), staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), enterococcus (8.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), proteus mirabilis (4.2%), brucella spp. (2.4%), bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus bovis e propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). these findings are compared with those published in the italian and international literature. stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.

TI  == noma in an unusual case of perforated appendicitis with pneumoperitoneum.
AB  == noma is a very rare gangrenous infection of the oral cavity usually associated with debilitating diseases, immunosuppression, or malnutrition. its development in a previously healthy 13-year-old boy with perforated appendicitis is presented. streptococcus bovis type ii and e coli were isolated from the noma and streptococcus bovis, bacteroides fragilis, and bacteroides asacharolyticus from the peritoneal fluid. a transient impaired immune cellular function was found and may have contributed to the development of the noma in this child.

TI  == in vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  == flurithromycin is an (8,s)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of streptomyces erythraeus atcc 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. the range of mic for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group a is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline ph. among anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, other species of bacteroides and peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. flurithromycin also showed some  activity on mycobacterium bovis, m. scrofulaceum and m. phley. the determination  of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 x mic. a combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. the possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. at concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.
