TI  == effect of fiber digestibility and conservation method on feed intake and the ruminal ecosystem of growing steers.
AB  == fiber digestibility is an important factor regulating dmi in ruminants. additionally, the ensiling process can also affect digestibility and chemical composition of the forage. the objective of this study was to investigate effects of sugarcane ndf digestibility (ndfd) and conservation method on intake, rumen kinetics, and the ruminal ecosystem of steers. eight ruminally cannulated nellore steers (275+/-22 kg bw) were used in a replicated 4x4 latin square design with a  2x2 factorial arrangement of treatments. two sugarcane genotypes divergent for stalk ndfd were used: iac86-2480 with high ndfd and sp91-1049 with low ndfd. experimental diets were formulated with 40% sugarcane, either freshly cut or as silage, and 60% concentrate on a dm basis. each experimental period lasted for 14 d, with the last 4 d used for determination of intake, ruminal evacuation, and ruminal fluid collection. the effect of fiber digestibility on dm and ndf intake  was dependent on the forage conservation method (p=0.01). high ndfd increased (p<0.01) dmi only when sugarcane was offered as silage, having no effect (p=0.41) on dmi when offered as freshly cut. conservation method had no effect on total ruminal mass, with only a tendency (p<0.10) for greater ndf and indigestible ndf  ruminal mass in steers fed the low-ndfd genotype. the ndf turnover and passage rates were greater (p<0.05) for the genotype with high ndfd but only when offered as silage. liquid turnover rate in the rumen was greater (p=0.02) for diets containing silage, with no effect of genotype (p=0.87). there was no effect of ndfd genotype on ruminal ph (p=0.77); however, diets containing sugarcane as silage increased (p<0.01) ruminal ph. total concentration of short chain fatty acids (p=0.05) and proportions of propionate (p=0.01) were greater for diets containing fresh sugarcane. diets with fresh sugarcane increased the ruminal population of streptococcus bovis (p<0.01) and ruminococcus albus (p=0.03). the relative population of r. albus was also greater (p=0.04) for diets containing the sugarcane genotype with high ndfd. feeding diets containing the sugarcane genotype with high ndfd increased fibrobacter succinogenes population but only when sugarcane was fed as freshly cut (p=0.02). using sugarcane genotypes with high ndfd can increase intake and benefit fiber-degrading bacteria in the rumen.

TI  == active dry saccharomyces cerevisiae can alleviate the effect of subacute ruminal  acidosis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of the study was to determine the effect of active dry saccharomyces cerevisiae (adsc) supplementation on dry matter intake, milk yield, milk components, ruminal ph, and microbial community during a dietary regimen that leads to subacute ruminal acidosis (sara). sixteen multiparous, rumen-cannulated lactating holstein cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments that included adsc (biomate; ab vista, marlborough, uk; 8 x 10(10) cfu/head per day) or control. during wk 1 to 6, all cows received a high-forage (hf) diet (77:23, forage:concentrate). cows were then abruptly switched during wk 7 to a high-grain (hg) diet (49:51, forage:concentrate) and remained on the hg until the end of wk 10. feed intake and milk yields were recorded daily. ruminal  ph was recorded continuously using an indwelling system for 1 to 2 d per week during the pre-experimental phase, and wk 6, 7, and 10. ruminal digesta samples were collected at the end of the experiment and analyzed for relative change in microbial communities using real-time quantitative pcr. cows were considered to have sara if the duration below ph 5.6 was >/=300 min/d. ruminal ph during wk 6 (hf plateau) was not different across treatments (15 +/- 46 min/d at ph <5.6). the dietary regimen successfully induced sara during wk 7 (transition from hf to  hg diet), and ruminal ph (551 +/- 46 min/d at ph <5.6) was not different across treatments. however, cows receiving adsc had an improved ruminal ph (122 +/- 57 vs. 321 +/- 53 min/d at ph <5.6) during wk 10 (hg plateau) compared with control. additionally, cows receiving adsc had a better dry matter intake (23.3 +/- 0.66 vs. 21.6 +/- 0.61 kg/d) and 4% fat-corrected milk yield (29.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 26.5 +/- 1.2 kg/d) than control cows during the hg phase (wk 8 to 10). during hg feeding, cows receiving adsc had greater total volatile fatty acid and propionate concentrations (175 +/- 7.5 vs. 154 +/- 7.5 and 117 +/- 6.1 vs. 94 +/- 5.7 mm for adsc and control, respectively) and lower acetate:propionate ratio (0.26 +/- 0.5  vs. 0.36 +/- 0.05 for adsc and control, respectively). microbial analyses conducted on samples collected during wk 10 showed that cows supplemented with s. cerevisiae had a 9-fold, 2-fold, 6-fold, 1.3-fold, and 8-fold increase in s. cerevisiae, fibrobacter succinogenes, anaerovibrio lipolytica, ruminococcus albus, and anaerobic fungi, respectively, which suggested an increase in cellulolytic microbes within the rumen. cows supplemented with adsc had 2.2-fold  reduction in prevotella albensis, which is a gram-negative bacterium predominant  during sara. prevotella spp. are suggested to be an important source of lipopolysaccharide responsible for inflammation within the rumen. cows supplemented with adsc had a 2.3-fold increase in streptococcus bovis and a 12-fold reduction in megasphaera elsdenii. the reduction in m. elsdenii may reflect lower concentration of lactic acid within the rumen for adsc cows. in conclusion, adsc supplementation to dairy cows was demonstrated to alleviate the  condition of sara caused by abrupt dietary changes from hf to hg, and can potentially improve rumen function, as indicated by greater numbers of cellulolytic microorganisms within the rumen.

TI  == use of real-time pcr technique in determination of major fibrolytic and non fibrolytic bacteria present in indian surti buffaloes (bubalus bubalis).
AB  == in the milk industry in india, buffalo breeds are most commonly used for milk production. efficiency of fiber digestion in ruminants is critical for animal productivity. bacteria play an important role in fiber digestion and utilization. absolute quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify ten bacterial species  in rumen fluid of surti buffalo fed green fodder, dry roughage and compound concentrate mixture. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as a fraction  of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of ruminococcus albus, which comprised 5.66% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 0.9% to 4.24% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the ruminal fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens and prevotella species. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus bovis, ruminobacter amylophilus, treponema bryantii and anaerovibrio lipolytica was even less abundant, each comprising < 0.11% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == effects of hop varieties on ruminal fermentation and bacterial community in an artificial rumen (rusitec).
AB  == background: there is a growing interest in the use of hops (humulus lupulus) as an alternative to antibiotics to manipulate ruminal fermentation. however, the effects of different hop varieties on ruminal fermentation and bacterial populations have not been studied. here the effects of three hop varieties, cascade (cas), millennium (mil) and teamaker (tm), at a level of 800 microg ml(-1) inoculum on ruminal fermentation and microbial populations in an artificial rumen system (rusitec) fed a barley silage-based total mixed ration were investigated. bacterial populations were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and expressed as a percentage of total bacterial 16s rrna gene copies. results: all hops reduced (p < 0.001) total gas, methane and the acetate:propionate ratio. liquid-associated fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus albus and streptococcus bovis were reduced (p < 0.05) by mil and tm. feed particle-associated s. bovis was reduced (p < 0.01) by mil and tm, but tm and cas increased (p < 0.01) ruminobacter amylophilus and prevotella bryantii respectively. methanogens were decreased (p < 0.05) by mil in both liquid and solid fractions and by cas in the solid fraction. the total amount of alpha- and  beta-acids in hops affected the ruminal fermentation. conclusion: hop-induced changes in fermentation and microbial populations may improve energy efficiency use in the rumen. further research is needed to determine the effects of hops on  in vivo ruminal fermentation, microbial populations and animal performance.

TI  == catalytic efficiency diversification of duplicate beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases from neocallimastix patriciarum j11.
AB  == four types of beta-1,3-1,4 glucanase (beta-glucanase, ec 3.2.1.73) genes, designated bgla13, bgla16, bgla51, and bglm2, were found in the cdna library of neocallimastix patriciarum j11. all were highly homologous with each other and demonstrated a close phylogenetic relationship with and a similar codon bias to streptococcus equinus. the presence of expansion and several predicted secondary  structures in the 3' untranslated regions (3'utrs) of bgla16 and bglm2 suggest that these two genes were duplicated recently, whereas bgla13 and bgla16, which contain very short 3'utrs, were replicated earlier. these findings indicate that  the beta-glucanase genes from n. patriciarum j11 may have arisen by horizontal transfer from the bacterium and subsequent duplication in the rumen fungus. beta-glucanase genes of streptococcus equinus, ruminococcus albus 7, and n. patriciarum j11 were cloned and expressed by escherichia coli. the recombinant beta-glucanases cloned from s. equinus, r. albus 7, and n. patriciarum j11 were endo-acting and had similar substrate specificity, but they demonstrated different properties in other tests. the specific activities and catalytic efficiency of the bacterial beta-glucanases were also significantly lower than those of the fungal beta-glucanases. our results also revealed that the activities and some characteristics of enzymes were changed during the horizontal gene transfer event. the specific activities of the fungal beta-glucanases ranged from 26,529 to 41,209 u/mg of protein when barley-derived beta-glucan was used as the substrate. they also demonstrated similar ph and temperature optima, substrate specificity, substrate affinity, and hydrolysis patterns. nevertheless, bgla16 and bglm2, two recently duplicated beta-glucanases, showed much higher k(cat) values than others. these results support the notion that duplicated beta-glucanase genes, namely, bgla16 and bglm2, increase the reaction efficiency  of beta-glucanases and suggest that the catalytic efficiency of beta-glucanase is likely to be a criterion determining the evolutionary fate of duplicate forms in  n. patriciarum j11.

TI  == description of development of rumen ecosystem by pcr assay in milk-fed, weaned and finished lambs in an intensive fattening system.
AB  == this study examined the reticulo-rumen characteristics of the microbial community and its fermentative characteristics in milk-fed, at weaning and finished lambs in a conventional fattening system. five lambs were assigned to each of three groups: milk-fed lambs slaughtered at 30 days (t30), weaned lambs slaughtered at  45 days (t45) and 'finished lambs' slaughtered at 90 days (t90). at slaughter, rumen size, fermentation parameters (ph, volatile fatty acids and microbial enzyme activity) and protozoal counts were recorded. quantitative pcr was used to quantify the genes encoding 16s and 18s ribosomal dna of the rumen bacterial and  protozoal populations, respectively, and the sequential colonization of the rumen by cellulolytic (ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens) and amylolytic (prevotella ruminicola, streptococcus bovis) bacteria, and protozoa (entodinium sp.). denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to study the development of rumen microbiota biodiversity. intake of solid food before weaning caused a significant increase in rumen weight (p < 0.0001) and bacterial dna (p < 0.05) and volatile fatty acid analysis concentration (p < 0.01), whereas ph declined. in milk-fed lambs, cellulolytic bacteria were evident after 30 days. thereafter,  in the 45-day and 90-day groups, the proportions of r. flavefaciens decreased and r. albus increased. amylolytic bacteria were present in milk-fed lambs; the proportion of p. ruminicola increased in fattening lambs and s. bovis was the least abundant species. protozoal concentrations were irregular; milk-fed lambs had a significant number of protozoa species from entodinium and subfamily isotrichiidae, but they disappeared at weaning. lamb rumen were refaunated in some individuals at 90 days (entodinium and subfamily diplodiniinae spp.), although individual concentrations were variable.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

TI  == dominance of prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time pcr.
AB  == relative quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as  a fraction of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal prevotella species prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola and prevotella brevis. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens, selenomonas ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. proportions for ruminobacter amylophilus and eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus albus and megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == in vitro bacterial growth and in vivo ruminal microbiota populations associated with bloat in steers grazing wheat forage.
AB  == the role of ruminal bacteria in the frothy bloat complex common to cattle grazing winter wheat has not been previously determined. two experiments, one in vitro and another in vivo, were designed to elucidate the effects of fresh wheat forage on bacterial growth, biofilm complexes, rumen fermentation end products, rumen bacterial diversity, and bloat potential. in exp. 1, 6 strains of ruminal bacteria (streptococcus bovis strain 26, prevotella ruminicola strain 23, eubacterium ruminantium b1c23, ruminococcus albus sy3, fibrobacter succinogenes ssp. s85, and ruminococcus flavefaciens c94) were used in vitro to determine the  effect of soluble plant protein from winter wheat forage on specific bacterial growth rate, biofilm complexes, vfa, and ruminal h2 and ch4 in mono or coculture  with methanobrevibacter smithii. the specific growth rate in plant protein medium containing soluble plant protein (3.27% nitrogen) was measured during a 24-h incubation at 39 degrees c in hungate tubes under a co2 gas phase. a monoculture  of m. smithii was grown similarly, except under h2:co2 (1:1), in a basal methanogen growth medium supplemented likewise with soluble plant protein. in exp. 2, 6 ruminally cannulated steers grazing wheat forage were used to evaluate  the influence of bloat on the production of biofilm complexes, ruminal microbial  biodiversity patterns, and ruminal fluid protein fractions. in exp. 1, cultures of r. albus (p < 0.01) and r. flavefaciens (p < 0.05) produced the most h2 among  strains and resulted in greater (p < 0.01) ch4 production when cocultured with m. smithii than other coculture combinations. cultures of s. bovis and e. ruminantium + m. smithii produced the most biofilm mass among strains. in exp. 2, when diets changed from bermudagrass hay to wheat forage, biofilm production increased (p < 0.01). biofilm production, concentrations of whole ruminal content (p < 0.01), and cheesecloth filtrate protein fractions (p < 0.05) in the ruminal  fluid were greater on d 50 for bloated than for nonbloated steers when grazing wheat forage. the molecular analysis of the 16s rdna showed that 2 different ruminal microbiota populations developed between bloated and nonbloated animals grazing wheat forage. bloat in cattle grazing wheat pastures may be caused by increased production of biofilm, resulting from a diet-influenced switch in the rumen bacterial population.

TI  == assessment of biases associated with profiling simple, model communities using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism-based analyses.
AB  == community profiles based on terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analyses of amplified ribosomal rna genes are used to monitor changes in microbial community structure and are sometimes employed for semi-quantitative estimates of species richness and abundance in environmental samples. to assess the accuracy of t-rflp community profiles representing the relative abundance of  bacteria in a sample, five species of ruminal bacteria were used to construct simple "communities". template dna for pcr amplification was generated either by  mixing equal quantities of genomic dna from pure cultures or by mixing equal numbers of cells prior to dna extraction. pairwise mixtures of fibrobacter succinogenes s85 with ruminococcus albus 8, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49 and streptococcus bovis jb1 were created and a 5-member community was constructed. with genomic dna mixes, relative abundance calculations based on t-rflp patterns did not reflect input ratios. these discrepancies could not be accounted for by differences in genome size and rrna operon copy number. in cell mixing experiments, easily lysed cells were overrepresented. to determine if a numerical correction factor could be used to compensate for observed discrepancies, we attempted to quantify biases attributed to dna extraction and pcr amplification. biases attributable to these factors led to deviations from expected pcr product ratios by 6% to 38%. we found that interactions were so complex that a suitable factor could not be derived. the unsystematic dependence of t-rflp peak ratios on variability of dna extraction and pcr amplification prevents accurate quantification of the relative abundance  of microorganisms designed to represent simplified natural populations.

TI  == expression of ruminococcus albus xylanase gene ( xyna) in streptococcus bovis 12-u-1.
AB  == the objective of this study was to ligate the xylanase gene a ( xyna) isolated from ruminococcus albus 7 into the promoter and signal-peptide region of the lichenase [beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase] gene of streptococcus bovis jb1. this fusion gene was inserted into the psbe11 vector, and the resulting recombinant, plasmid  pxa, was used to transform s. bovis 12-u-1 cells. the transformant, s. bovis 12uxa, secreted the xylanase, which was stable against freeze-thaw treatment and  long-time incubation at 37 degrees c. the introduction of pxa and production of xylanase did not affect cell growth, and the xylanase produced degraded xylan from oat-spelt and birchwood.

TI  == competition among three predominant ruminal cellulolytic bacteria in the absence  or presence of non-cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  == competition among three species of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria - fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1 and ruminococcus albus 7 - was studied in the presence or absence of the non-cellulolytic ruminal bacteria selenomonas ruminantium or streptococcus bovis. co-cultures were grown under either batch or continuous conditions and populations were estimated using species-specific oligonucleotide probes to 16s rrna. the three cellulolytic species co-existed in cellobiose batch co-culture, but inclusion of either sel. ruminantium or str. bovis yielded nearly a monoculture of the non-cellulolytic competitor. in cellobiose chemostats, r. albus completely dominated the triculture, but r. flavefaciens became predominant over f. succinogenes and r. albus when sel. ruminantium was co-inoculated into the chemostats. similar effects on competition were observed in the presence of str. bovis at a lower (0.021 h(-1)), but not at a higher (0.045 h(-1)) dilution rate. in cellulose batch co-cultures, r. albus was more abundant than both f. succinogenes and r. flavefaciens, regardless of the presence of the non-cellulolytic species. co-existence among the three cellulolytic species was observed in almost all cellulose chemostats, but sel. ruminantium altered the relative proportions of the cellulolytic species. r. albus and r. flavefaciens were found to produce inhibitors that suppressed growth of r. flavefaciens and f. succinogenes, respectively. these data indicate that interactions among cellulolytic bacteria,  while complex, can be modified further by non-cellulolytic species.

TI  == regulation of h(+)-atpase synthesis in response to reduced ph in ruminal bacteria.
AB  == the capacity of ruminal bacteria to regulate h(+)-atpase synthesis in response to reduced ph was investigated to explain acid tolerance. the activity of h(+)-atpase in streptococcus bovis, an acid-tolerant bacterium, was 2.2-fold higher at ph 4.5 than at ph 5.5. the increase in the amount of h(+)-atpase protein was similar, suggesting that the increase in h(+)-atpase activity is owing to the increase in h(+)-atpase synthesis. the level of atp-mrna at ph 4.5 was 2.5-fold higher than at ph 5.5, indicating that h(+)-atpase synthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level, responding to low ph. in ruminococcus albus, an acid-sensitive bacterium, h(+)-atpase activity, the amount of h(+)-atpase protein, and the level of atp-mrna at ph 7.0 were similar to the values at ph 6.0, the lowest ph permitting growth. this result suggests that r. albus is incapable of enhancing h(+)-atpase synthesis at low ph. thus, acid tolerance appeared to be related to the capacity to augment the synthesis of h(+)-atpase responding to low ph.

TI  == effect of steroidal saponin from yucca schidigera extract on ruminal microbes.
AB  == the effects of steroidal saponins (sap) isolated from yucca schidigera extract on ruminal bacteria and fungi were investigated in pure culture studies. prevotella  bryantii, ruminobacter amylophilus, selenomonas ruminantium and streptococcus bovis were cultured through ten 24-h transfers in ruminal fluid medium containing 0 or 25 microg sap ml-1 (measured as smilagenin equivalents). the four strains, each non-exposed or pre-exposed to sap, were then inoculated into medium containing 0 or 250 microgram smilagenin equivalents ml-1 and 24-h growth curves  were determined. the cellulolytic ruminal bacteria ruminococcus flavefaciens, fibrobacter succinogenes and rc. albus were cultured for 72 h on whatman no. 1 filter paper in medium containing 0, 9, 90 or 180 microgram sap ml-1 for the determination of filter paper digestion and endoglucanase activity. the ruminal bacteria differed in their responses to sap. steroidal saponins in the medium reduced the growth of strep. bovis (p < 0.01 at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 h), p. bryantii (p < 0.05 at 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 24 h) and rb. amylophilus (p < 0.05 at 14 and 24 h), but the growth of s. ruminantium was enhanced (p < 0.05) at 10, 14  and 24 h. the growth curves of all four non-cellulolytic species were similar (p  > 0.05) between pre-exposed and non-exposed cultures and the concentrations of total sap and soluble (deglycosylated) sap in the liquid fraction were unchanged  (p > 0.05) over time. steroidal saponins inhibited the digestion of filter paper  by all three cellulolytic bacteria, but f. succinogenes was less (p < 0.05) sensitive to sap and more (p < 0. 05) effective at deglycosylating sap than were  rc. flavefaciens or rc. albus. transmission electron microscopy revealed that sap altered the cell walls of the sap-inhibited non-cellulolytic bacteria. the ruminal fungi, neocallimastix frontalis and piromyces rhizinflata, were cultured  on filter paper in medium containing 0, 0. 45, 2.25 or 4.5 microgram sap ml-1. filter paper digestion by both fungi was completely inhibited by 2.25 microgram sap ml-1. steroidal saponins from y. schidigera inhibit cellulolytic ruminal bacteria and fungi, but their effects on amylolytic bacteria are species dependent and similar to the effects of ionophores. as such, sap may be useful in nutritional applications targeting starch-digesting ruminal micro-organisms.

TI  == feasibility of using total purines as a marker for ruminal bacteria.
AB  == a procedure for measuring total purine content of mixed ruminal bacteria was adapted for use in the determination of purines in pure cultures of ruminal bacteria. recovery of adenine and guanine, alone or in mixture, was quite variable. the problem was traced to solubility of the silver salt of adenine in the acid wash solution. when the precipitating solution was used as the wash, recovery of the purines was over 97%. recovery of a 1:1 mixture of adenine and guanine added to yeast rna was 100.6+/-3.2%. purine, protein, and bacterial concentrations were determined for 10 pure cultures of ruminal bacteria: butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, d16f, h10b, and h17c; fibrobacter succinogenes b21a; lachnospira multiparus d25e; lactobacillus lactis ard26e; prevotella ruminicola h15a; ruminococcus albus 7; ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b; and streptococcus bovis ard5d. the cv for the most-probable-number (mpn) assay (bacterial concentrations), purine analysis, and protein analysis were 55.86, 5.25 and 6.52%, respectively. considerable variation was found among bacterial species and strains when purine and protein concentrations were compared as the amount per individual cell. more consistent values were obtained when these components were  expressed on a dry matter basis. purine:protein ratios for the 10 pure cultures ranged from .023 to .1299, with a mean value of .0883. for samples of mixed bacteria separated from ruminal fluid, this ratio was found to average .0306, which is approximately one-third of the value for the pure cultures. the value determined for the mixed bacterial sample is similar to previously reported values. based on the ratio obtained with the pure cultures, the microbial protein flow out of the rumen has probably been overestimated in most previous reports. limited studies suggest that the samples of mixed ruminal bacteria used as a standard are probably contaminated with feed particles containing protein, which  results in lower purine:protein ratios.

TI  == activity of h(+)-atpase in ruminal bacteria with special reference to acid tolerance.
AB  == batch culture experiments showed that permeabilized cells and membranes of ruminococcus albus and fibrobacter succinogenes, acid-intolerant celluloytic bacteria, have only one-fourth to one-fifth as much h(+)-atpase as megasphaera elsdenii and streptococcus bovis, which are relatively acid tolerant. even in the cells grown in continuous culture at ph 7.0, the acid-intolerant bacteria contained less than half as much h(+)-atpase as the acid-tolerant bacteria. the amounts of h(+)-atpase in the acid-tolerant bacteria were increased by more than  twofold when the cells were grown at the lowest ph permitting growth, whereas little increase was observed in the case of the acid-intolerant bacteria. these results indicate that the acid-intolerant bacteria not only contain smaller amounts of h(+)-atpase at neutral ph but also have a lower capacity to enhance the level of h(+)-atpase in response to low ph than the acid-tolerant bacteria. in addition, the h(+)-atpases of the acid-intolerant bacteria were more sensitive to low ph than those of the acid-tolerant bacteria, although the optimal phs were similar.

TI  == effects of potassium ion concentrations on the antimicrobial activities of ionophores against ruminal anaerobes.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of monensin and lasalocid against representative strains of ruminal bacteria were evaluated in medium containing three different concentrations of potassium (1.3, 7.9, or 23.3 mm). the growth of eubacterium ruminantium was inhibited by low concentrations of ionophores (less than or equal to 0.16 mg/liter), while the strain of streptococcus bovis tested was resistant to high concentrations of ionophores (40 mg/liter) at all potassium concentrations tested. the mics of the ionophores for strains of bacteroides succinogenes, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens and for one strain of bacteroides ruminicola increased with increasing potassium concentrations in the medium. high concentrations of ionophores (40 mg/liter) decreased the maximum cell yields or increased the lag times or both in cultures of one strain of bacteroides ruminicola and two strains of selenomonas ruminantium but did not completely inhibit the growth of these organisms. increased potassium concentrations in the medium (from 7.9 to 23.3 mm) decreased the lag times or increased the cell yields or both when these three strains were grown in ionophore-containing medium, while the activities of lasalocid and monensin against these organisms were enhanced in the medium containing low potassium concentrations (1.3 mm). the data from this study suggest that extracellular potassium concentrations may influence the antimicrobial activities of ionophores in the rumen.

TI  == seasonal changes in the cecal microflora of the high-arctic svalbard reindeer (rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus).
AB  == the dominant cecal bacteria in the high-arctic svalbard reindeer were characterized, their population densities were estimated, and cecal ph was determined in summer, when food quality and availability is good, and in winter,  when it is very poor. in summer the total culturable viable bacterial population  was (8.9 +/- 5.3) x 10(8) cells ml-1, whereas in winter it was (1.5 +/- 0.7) x 10(8) cells ml-1, representing a decrease to 17% of the summer population density. of the dominant species of cultured bacteria, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens  represented 23% in summer and 18% in winter. streptococcus bovis represented 17%  in summer and 5% in winter. bacteroides ruminicola represented 10% in summer and  26% in winter. in summer and winter, respectively, the proportion of the viable population showing the following activities was as follows: fiber digestion, 36 and 48%; cellulolysis, 10 and 6%; xylanolysis, 33 and 48%; and starch utilization, 77 and 71%. the most abundant cellulolytic species in summer was butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, representing 62% of the total cellulolytic population, and in winter it was ruminococcus albus, representing 80% of the total cellulolytic population. the most abundant xylanolytic species in summer was butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and in winter it was bacteroides ruminicola, representing 59 and 54% of the xylanolytic isolates in summer and winter, respectively. the cecal bacterial of the svalbard reindeer have the ability to digest starch and the major structural carbohydrates of the diet that are not digested in the rumen. the cecum in these animals has the potential to contribute very substantially to the digestion of the available plant material in both summer and winter.

TI  == antibiotic activity of an isocyanide metabolite of trichoderma hamatum against rumen bacteria.
AB  == a metabolite of trichoderma hamatum, 3-(3-isocyanocyclopent-2-enylidene)propionic acid, was tested for its effects on growth of and carbohydrate metabolism in 11 strains of functionally important rumen bacteria. to standardize the biological activity of this unstable metabolite, a rapid, aerobic disc diffusion assay was developed using escherichia coli atcc 11775. in an anaerobic broth dilution assay using a medium lacking rumen fluid and containing a soluble carbohydrate, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the metabolite which completely inhibited growth of the rumen bacteria for 18 h at 39 degrees c was generally less than 10  micrograms x ml-1; however, the minimum inhibitory concentrations for megasphaera elsdenii b159 and streptococcus bovis pe(1)8 were 10-25 and 25-64 micrograms x ml-1, respectively. in general, the gram-negative strains were more sensitive than the gram positive. the minimum inhibitory concentration for bacteroides ruminicola 23 grown with glucose was 1 micrograms x ml-1; for b. ruminicola ga33  (glucose), b. succinogenes s85 (cellobiose), and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 24 (maltose), it was 2 microgram x ml-1. when added to a cellulose-containing rumen  fluid medium, 1-4 micrograms x ml-1 of the metabolite delayed cellulose hydrolysis by b. succinogenes s85, ruminococcus albus 7, and r. flavefaciens fd1  for up to 4 days, and 6-7 micrograms x ml-1 prevented hydrolysis for at least 1 month. in the presence of the metabolite, the proportion of acetate produced from soluble carbohydrate by the majority of strains increased, but with some strains  net production of acetate decreased relative to production of other acidic fermentation products.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == influence of plant phenolic acids on growth and cellulolytic activity of rumen bacteria.
AB  == isolated rumen bacteria were examined for growth and, where appropriate, for their ability to degrade cellulose in the presence of the hydroxycinnamic acids trans-p-coumaric acid and trans-ferulic acid and the hydroxybenzoic acids vanillic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. ferulic and p-coumaric acids proved to be the most toxic of the acids examined and suppressed the growth of the cellulolytic strains ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens, and bacteroides succinogenes when included in a simple sugars medium at concentrations of >5 mm. the extent of cellulose digestion by r. flavefaciens and b. succinogenes but not r. albus was also substantially reduced. examination of rumen fluid from sheep maintained on dried grass containing 0.51% phenolic acids  showed the presence of phloretic acid (0.1 mm) and 3-methoxyphloretic acid (trace) produced by hydrogenation of the 2-propenoic side chain of p-coumaric and ferulic acids, respectively. the parent acids were found in trace amounts only, although they represented the major phenolic acids ingested. phloretic and 3-methoxyphloretic acids proved to be considerably less toxic than their parent acids. all of the cellulolytic strains (and streptococcus bovis) showed at least  a limited ability to hydrogenate hydroxycinnamic acids, with ruminococcus spp. proving the most effective. no further modification of hydroxycinnamic acids was  produced by the single strains of bacteria examined. however, a considerable shortfall in the recovery of added phenolic acids was noted in media inoculated with rumen fluid. it is suggested that hydrogenation may serve to protect cellulolytic strains from hydroxycinnamic acids.

TI  == effects of lasalocid or monensin on lactate-producing or -using rumen bacteria.
AB  == lasalocid or monensin inhibited most of the lactate-producing rumen bacteria (butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, eubacterium cellulosolvens, e. ruminantium, lachnospira multiparus, lactobacillus ruminis, l. vitulinus, ruminococcus albus,  r. flavefaciens, streptococcus bovis). minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from .38 to 3.0 micrograms/ml. among the lactate producers, those that produce succinate as a major end product (bacteroides, selenomonas, succinimonas, succinivibrio) were not inhibited by lasalocid or monensin. also, none of the major lactate fermenters (anaerovibrio, megasphaera, selenomonas) was inhibited by lasalocid or monensin. veillonella alcalescens was inhibited by 24 micrograms/ml of lasalocid but was resistant to monensin. hence, the reported increase in propionate in lasalocid- or monensin-fed cattle may result from selection for succinate producers and lactate fermenters. lasalocid and monensin  appeared to inhibit selectively the production of l(+), but not d(-) lactic acid. the inhibition of major lactate-producing bacteria (streptococcus and lactobacillus) suggests that lasalocid or monensin may be used to prevent lactic  acidosis in ruminants.

TI  == effect of ph on the efficiency of growth by pure cultures of rumen bacteria in continuous culture.
AB  == a total of 10 strains of rumen bacteria, selenomonas ruminantium hd4, megasphaera elsdenii b159, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens a38, streptococcus bovis jb1, lactobacillus vitulinus ga1, bacteroides ruminicola b14, b. ruminicola ga33, ruminococcus albus 7, ruminococcus flavefaciens c94, and bacteroides succinogenes s85, were grown in energy-limiteh of the medium reservoir was lowered approximately 0.3 ph units, and the energy source concentration remaining in the  culture vessel, optical density, cell mass, and ph were determined. a low ph appeared to have a detrimental effect on cell yields. large variations were seen  among strains in both the magnitude of yield depressions at lower ph values and in the ph at which the culture washed out. lactate analysis indicated ta are discussed in relation to the effect of ph on the efficiency of protein synthesis  in the rumen and rumen microbial ecology.

TI  == effects of heavy metals and other trace elements on the fermentative activity of  the rumen microflora and growth of functionally important rumen bacteria.
AB  == the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of essential and non-essential trace elements were tested on the rumen microflora using the rate of fermentation in vitro as the assay. the elements (and the concentration causing 50% inhibition) in decreasing order of toxicity were hg2+ (20 microgram/ml), cu2+ (21 microgram/ml), cr6+ (70 microgram/ml), se4+ (73 microgram/ml), ni2+ (160 microgram/ml), cd2+ (175 microgram/ml), as3+ (304 microgram/ml) and as5+ (1610 microgram/ml). the elements tested that were either weak or noninhibitory at concentrations greater than 400 microgram/ml included zn2+, cr2+, fe2+, mn2+, pb2+, and co2+. methylmercury was as inhibitory as mercuric chloride to the fermentation. when the inhibitory effect of cd2+ was tested on separated bacterial and protozoal fractions, it was more inhibitory to the bacteria. the inhibitory effects of trace elements were also determined for a number of axenic  cultures of rumen bacteria. the bacteria which most frequently exhibited the greatest sensitivity were bacteroides succinogenses, ruminococcus albus, bacteroides amylophilus, and eubacterium ruminantium. those often exhibiting intermediate sensitivities included butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, selenomonas ruminantium, and megasphera elsdenii, while streptococcus bovis was very refractory to all elements tested. rumen fluid provided a modest protective effect for the bacteria.

TI  == enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms.
AB  == joyner, a. e., jr. (university of california, davis), and r. l. baldwin. enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms. j. bacteriol. 92:1321-1330. 1966.-the activities of enzymes representing the major pathways of  carbohydrate metabolism and anaerobic electron transport in cell-free extracts of whole rumen contents have been reported. the effects of diet upon the activities  of several enzymes suggested that enzymatic measurements might prove useful for the study of rumen metabolism. in the present study, the distribution and characteristics of aldolase, succinate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, lactyl-coenzyme a dehydrase, lactate dehydrogenase, and other enzymes were measured in cell-free extracts of pure cultures of ruminococcus flavefaciens, r.  albus, bacteroides succinogenes, b. ruminicola, b. amylophilus, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, peptostreptococcus elsdenii, streptococcus bovis, and selenomonas ruminantium. some enzymes were widely distributed (aldolase, glutamate dehydrogenase), whereas others were observed in one or two species (lactyl-coenzyme a dehydrase). the cofactor requirements and kinetic characteristics of enzymes varied considerably with species. enzymes that vary with species might be employed as indices for estimating the activities of various groups of microorganisms in whole rumen contents.
