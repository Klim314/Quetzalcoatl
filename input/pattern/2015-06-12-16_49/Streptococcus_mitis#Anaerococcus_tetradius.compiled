TI  - The predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  - PURPOSE: To detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. Cultures were made from clinical materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. RESULTS: The following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: Streptococcus milleri Group (SMG) (23.8%) [Streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and Streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], Streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), Streptococcus mitis (4.7%), Streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), Peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), Prevotella buccae (4.7%), Prevotella intermedia (4.7%), Actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), Propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), Bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), Staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), Rothia denticariosa (4.7%), Gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. It was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. Although no specific microorganism was found, Streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially SMG (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. Furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. Although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.
TI  - Subgingival microflora in inflammatory bowel disease patients with untreated periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the subgingival microflora composition of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with untreated chronic periodontitis and compare them with systemically healthy controls also having untreated chronic periodontitis. METHOD: Thirty IBD patients [15 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 15 with ulcerative colitis (UC)] and 15 control individuals participated in the study. All patients had been diagnosed with untreated chronic periodontitis. From every patient, subgingival plaque was collected from four gingivitis and four periodontitis sites with paper points. Samples from the same category (gingivitis or periodontitis) in each patient were pooled together and stored at -70 degrees C until analysis using a checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique for 74 bacterial species. RESULTS: Multiple-comparison analysis showed that the groups differed in bacterial counts for Bacteroides ureolyticus, Campylobacter gracilis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Treponema denticola (P<0.001). CD patients had significantly higher levels of these bacteria than UC patients either in gingivitis or in periodontitis sites (P<0.05). CD patients harbored higher levels of P. melaninogenica, S. aureus, S. anginosus, and S. mutans compared with controls both at gingivitis and at periodontitis sites (P<0.05). UC patients harbored higher levels of S. aureus (P=0.01) and P. anaerobius (P=0.05) than controls only in gingivitis sites. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that even with similar clinical periodontal parameters, IBD patients harbor higher levels of bacteria that are related to opportunistic infections in inflamed subgingival sites that might be harmful for the crucial microbe-host interaction.
TI  - Microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  - PURPOSE: Advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. Recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. A prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. RESULTS: Upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. Streptococcus and Peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. On determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and 18.8% were resistant. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.
TI  - Oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. However, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. AIM: To investigate the effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: H400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. Cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and NF-kappaB activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial NF-kappaB activation and cytokine responses. An oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest IL-8 and TNF-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.
TI  - Anterior chest wall abscess--an unusual complication of an odontogenic infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A majority of odontogenic infections can be successfully managed with routine incision and drainage and empirical antibiotics. Sometimes an odontogenic infection may spread to contiguous spaces and descend along the neck causing significant morbidity and rarely even mortality. CASE REPORT: We report a case of an odontogenic infection which had an unusual spread to the anterior chest wall.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of aloe vera tooth gel and two popular commercial toothpastes: an in vitro study.
AB  - Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller) has been suggested for a wide variety of ailments but its use in dentistry is limited. This article reviews the uses of the plant and describes an in vitro investigation that compared the antimicrobial effectiveness of aloe vera tooth gel with two popular, commercially available dentifrices. The preliminary results showed that aloe vera tooth gel and the toothpastes were equally effective against Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Aloe vera tooth gel demonstrated enhanced antibacterial effect against S. mitis.
TI  - The microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. METHODS: Microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the Dental School of the University of Athens, who were split into three age groups. A total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: All of the test species, except Parvimonas micra and Porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial profiles for the different oral surfaces. Supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of Actinomyces species and Green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the Yellow complex. The profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. Many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. Periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. Specifically, the Red complex species (Tannerella forsythia, P. gingivalis, Treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (P < 0.05) in all sample locations. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. Differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of Orange and Red complex species.
TI  - Assessment of the microbiota in root canals of human primary teeth by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vivo the prevalence of microorganisms in root canals of human primary teeth, by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. METHODS: Fifty-five root canals of primary teeth with irreversible pulpitis (group 1) and 51 root canals of teeth with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis (group 2) were selected. Microbiological samples were collected and submitted to checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization using 34 genomic DNA probes. The results were analyzed statistically by Mann-Whitney U-test at a 5% significance level. RESULTS: The most prevalent species in group 1 were: (1) Campylobacter rectus (87%); (2) Gemella morbilorum (78%); (3) Streptococcus gordonii (71%); (4) Capnocytophaga ochracea (69%); (5) Treponema denticola (58%); and (6) Streptococcus intermedius (49%). The most prevalent species in group 2 were: (1) C. rectus (90%); (2) T. denticola (88%); (3) S. intermedius (77%); (4) G. morbilorum (73%); (5) Streptococcus oralis (67%); (6) C. ochracea (63%); (7) S. gordonii (55%); (8) Streptococcus mitis (51%); and (9) Leptotrichia buccalis (51%). Except for Peptostreptococcus micros and Actinomyces israelii, the most prevalent bacterial strains in the root canals with apical periodontitis were also those found in larger numbers (P<.05). Groups 1 and 2 differed significantly (P<.05) regarding the total number of bacterial cells detected in the root canal samples, with group 2 showing remarkably larger bacterial cell numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Root canals of primary teeth have a great bacterial diversity, characterizing a polymicrobial endodontic infection with presence of: (1) anaerobic and facultative micro organisms; (2) black-pigmented rods; and (3) streptococci. A large number of anaerobic species were detected in teeth with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis, and a significantly smaller number of bacterial cells were found in teeth with irreversible pulpitis.
TI  - The bacteriology of the supragingival plaque of child dental patients in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bacterial flora of the gingival plaques of pediatric dental patients in order to establish baseline data for future studies on the complex microbiota of the oral cavity of this group of child dental patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty subjects, aged 3-12 years, were enrolled and investigated after informed consent was obtained. During the patients' first visit to the dental clinic supragingival plaque samples were collected from the gingival area of buccal and lingual tooth surfaces of all primary and permanent molar teeth using sterile curettes. Serially diluted samples were inoculated onto a set of selective and nonselective media and then incubated at the appropriate atmospheric conditions and temperatures. Representative colonies of isolates were identified by standard methods, including hemolytic characteristics on blood agar and profiling on API 20S and API 20A as appropriate. RESULTS: A total of 183 isolates (123 aerobes and 60 anaerobes) were recovered from the 40 patients with a mean count of 3 per sample of aerobes compared to 1.5 per sample for the anaerobes. Streptococcus sanguis was the predominant aerobic species (23.6%) isolated from 29 (72.5%) of the 40 patients, followed by Streptococcus mitis, 19.5 and 60%, Streptococcus salivarius, 17.1 and 52.5% and Streptococcus mutans, 17.1 and 52.5%. The frequency of isolation of anaerobic bacteria was Prevotella spp. 50% from 30 (75%) of the 40 patients, Fusobacterium spp., 18.3 and 27.5%, Bacteroides spp., Porphyromonas spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp., 6.7 and 10%, 6.7 and 10%, and 5 and 7.5%, respectively. Prevotella intermedia was the single most common species. CONCLUSION: The results show that there were more aerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria than the obligate anaerobes in the dental plaque of the pediatric dental patients in Kuwait. The high prevalence of the pioneering streptococci as well as black-pigmented Prevotella spp. and Fusobacterium spp. indicates that the dental plaques of the children were in the developing stage, a precursor to the development of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Frozen cancellous bone allografts: positive cultures of implanted grafts in posterior fusions of the spine.
AB  - We have carried out a study on the behaviour pattern of implanted allografts initially stored in perfect conditions (aseptically processed, culture-negative and stored at -80 degrees C) but which presented positive cultures at the implantation stage. There is no information available on how to deal with this type of situation, so our aim was to set guidelines on the course of action which would be required in such a case. This was a retrospective study of 112 patients who underwent a spinal arthrodesis and in whom a total of 189 allograft pieces were used. All previous bone and blood cultures and tests for hepatitis B and C, syphilis and HIV (via PCR techniques) were negative. The allografts were stored by freezing them at -80 degrees C. A sample of the allograft was taken for culture in the operating theatre just before its implantation in all cases. The results of the cultures were obtained 3-5 days after the operation. There were 22 allografts with positive culture results (12%) after implantation. These allografts were implanted in 16 patients (14%). Cultures were positive for staphylococci coagulase negative (ECN) in 10 grafts (46%), Pseudomonas stutzeri in two grafts (9%), Corynebacterium jeikeium in two grafts (9%), staphylococci coagulase positive in two grafts (9%) and for each of the following organisms in one case each (4%): Corynebacterium spp., Actinomyces odontolyticus, Streptococcus mitis, Peptostreptococcus spp., Rhodococcus equi and Bacillus spp. No clinical infection was seen in any of these patients. Positive cultures could be caused by non-detected contamination at harvesting, storing or during manipulation before implantation. The lack of clinical signs of infection during the follow-up of our patients may indicate that no specific treatment different from our antibiotic protocol is required in the case of positive culture results of a graft piece after implantation.
TI  - Bacteriological study of root canals associated with periapical abscesses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify microorganisms from root canals  with periapical abscesses and to ascertain the susceptibility of Peptostreptococcus prevotii and Fusobacterium necrophorum to antimicrobials. Study design Thirty root canals were microbiologically sampled by using sterile paper points. The concomitant microorganisms were identified through the use of established methods. The susceptibility of P prevotii and F necrophorum to antimicrobials was evaluated by using the E test method. RESULTS: A total of 117 different bacterial strains were recovered, including 75 strict anaerobes or microphilic species. The most frequently isolated strict anaerobes were P prevotii, Peptostreptococcus micros, and F necrophorum. Facultative bacteria such as Gemella morbillorum and Streptococcus mitis were also found, albeit less frequently. The data revealed that P prevotii and F necrophorum were susceptible to the tested antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria predominate in the mixed microbiota of root canals with periapical abscesses. Moreover, P prevotii and F necrophorum are susceptible to the tested antibiotics.
TI  - Differences in antimicrobial activity of four commercial 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthrinse formulations: an in vitro contact test and salivary bacterial counts study.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of four commercial 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthrinses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The in vitro antimicrobial activity test consisted in a modified contact test where 20 selected bacterial species were tested during 1 min with each test product. After the contact, the inoculum was cultured, and the results were expressed in terms of survival/resistance and the percentage of survival as compared to a saline control. The in vivo test consisted of a double-blind, randomized, crossover salivary bacterial counts study. 10 volunteers rinsed during 1 min with each tested product. Saliva samples were obtained before rinsing, and after 5 min, and 1, 3, 5 and 7 h. These samples were cultured both aerobically and anaerobically. Percentages of survival, in regard to baseline, were calculated for each time point. Comparisons among products were tested using anova and selected paired t-test. RESULTS: The in vitro contact test showed no survival in any tested species with CHX+CPC, while three species (Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mitis and Peptostreptococcus micros) were resistant to the other three products. CHX and CHX+NaF demonstrated additional resistant species (three and four species, respectively). The in vivo salivary bacterial counts test showed higher reductions of CHX+CPC and CHX+ALC in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, lasting for 5 h. Significant differences were detected at multiple time points, when these two products were compared both with the control and the other tested products. CONCLUSION: Important differences in activity, among 0.12% CHX products, were detected by both in vitro and in vivo tests. The formulation with alcohol was more active than those without alcohol, excepting the formulation with CHX+CPC, in which the reformulation and addition of CPC not only compensate but rather increase the antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (II). Effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (Crest Complete) or power (Braun 3D Plaque Remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. METHODS: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. At baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. After random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. Clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. Significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the Quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. Streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while Streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. Mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. Major reductions occurred in both groups for A. naeslundii, A. israelii/gerencseriae, Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella parvula, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis and S. constellatus/intermedius. All taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. The reductions in prevalence were greater for A. naeslundii, S. constellatus/intermedius, V. parvula, A. israelii/gerencseriae, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis, P. micros, Streptococcus mutans and P. intermedia/nigrescens. Mean prevalence was decreased more for Porphyromonas gingivalis, Campylobacter rectus/showae, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. CONCLUSIONS: The major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the subgingival microbiota. Counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. This reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. Further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - Isolation of bacteria from cervical lymph nodes in patients with oral cancer.
AB  - Thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. All 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection) with free flap reconstruction. A total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. Viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). Bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. Bacterial translocation was found more often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). Gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). As the gingival carcinoma group includes more T4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. Oral streptococci (Streptococcus intermedius, Strep. constellatus, Strep. oralis, Strep. mitis, Strep. sanguis, Strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. Aerobic enteric bacteria (Enterococcus, Escherichia, Klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. Among the anaerobic bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. Damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
TI  - Prospective study of bacteremia rate after elastic band ligation and sclerotherapy of esophageal varices in patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Esophageal band ligation is considered to be as efficient as endoscopic sclerotherapy, with a lower complication rate, including bacteremia. There are few studies comparing the two methods. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of bacteremia after both treatments in patients with portal hypertension secondary to schistosomiasis. METHODS: Endoscopic sclerotherapy and band ligation were performed using standard techniques. Blood samples were obtained 5 and 30 minutes after endoscopic band ligation or sclerotherapy and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. RESULTS: In the sclerotherapy group 2 of 43 (4.6%) blood cultures were positive (Peptostreptococcus sp and Streptococcus mitis). A similar result was obtained in the band ligation group: 2 of 35 (5.7%) had positive cultures, both with Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in the frequency of bacteremia after treatment of esophageal varices with endoscopic sclerotherapy or endoscopic band ligation in patients with portal hypertension secondary to schistosomiasis.
TI  - Use of the isolator 1.5 microbial tube for culture of synovial fluid from patients with septic arthritis.
AB  - Synovial fluid specimens obtained from patients with arthritis were plated onto solid media (conventional cultures) or inoculated into an Isolator 1.5 microbial tube (Isolator cultures), and the yield and time to detection of organisms were compared. Overall, 144 specimens obtained from 137 patients were processed, and 31 (21.5%) cultures obtained from 29 patients were positive by at least one method. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 12 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Kingella kingae were isolated from 4 patients each, group G streptococci were isolated from 3 patients, Staphylococcus epidermidis and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 2 patients each, and Streptococcus mitis and Peptostreptococcus prevotii were isolated from 1 patient each. Overall, the causative organism was detected in 31 of 31 (100.0%) Isolator cultures and 24 of 31 (77.4%) conventional cultures (P < 0.02). Twenty-nine of 31 (93.5%) positive Isolator cultures and 20 of 24 (83.3%) conventional cultures were positive by the second day of incubation. Among the 24 cultures positive by both methods, higher numbers of CFU per milliliter were detected with the Isolator system in 13 cultures and with conventional cultures in 2 cultures (P < 0.002). Inoculation of synovial fluid into an Isolator 1.5 microbial tube improves the recovery of organisms causing septic arthritis.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Changes in root canal microbiota during the development of rat periapical lesions.
AB  - Periapical lesions are reproducibly induced in rats by pulp exposure and infection from the oral cavity. Lesions expand rapidly between day 7 and day 15-20 (active phase), with slowed expansion thereafter. In the present study we characterized the root canal microbiota present during the active phase of lesion development in this system. The mandibular first molars of Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed on day 0. The teeth were extracted after 7 days (n = 10 animals) and 15 days (n = 10), and the microbiota present in roots was isolated and characterized. The number of colonies isolated per tooth was similar on day 7 (1.53 +/- 0.64 colony-forming units x 10(3)) and day 15 (1.49 +/- 0.37 colony-forming units x 10(3)). No colonies were isolated from unexposed control teeth. Anaerobic bacteria increased significantly between day 7 (24.3 +/- 5.7%) and day 15 (47.3 +/- 7.5%), and the proportion of gram-negative organisms increased from day 7 (24.3 +/- 6.1) to day 15 (46.9 +/- 6.8). The predominant bacteria included, on day 7: Streptococcus and Bacteroides species; on day 15: species of Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Neisseria and Peptostreptococcus. Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus rattus, Bacteroides pneumosintes and Bacteroides ureolyticus were frequently isolated at both points. Although approximately the same mean number of different species (approximately 3.5) was isolated per tooth on both day 7 and 15, the overall diversity of the isolates increased on day 15.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial colonization and degradation of demineralized dentin matrix in situ.
AB  - Lesion formation in dentin involves demineralization followed by degradation of the exposed organic matrix. Proteinases from microorganisms present in the dentin are believed to play an important role in the breakdown of the dentinal collagen. In this study, the microflora colonizing decalcified dentin matrix, placed in situ, was identified. The gelatinolytic activity of the isolated strains was assessed and related to the degradation of the dentin matrix. The predominant species found were Streptococcus mitis. Peptostreptococcus productus, Lactobacillus casei, Propionibacterium species and Veillonella parvula. Marked interindividual variation in the composition of the microflora was observed. The microflora possessed gelatinolytic activity, although no correlation was found with the severity of dentin matrix degradation. The chemically determined loss of collagen varied between 0 and 67 wt% per participant and corresponded with the extent of collagen degradation observed by transmission electron microscopy.
TI  - Physico-chemical and structural properties of the surfaces of Peptostreptococcus  micros and Streptococcus mitis as compared to those of mutans streptococci, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - The surface properties of nine Streptococcus mitis and four Peptostreptococcus micros strains from the oral cavity were examined and compared with a large group of oral streptococci. Zeta potential and contact angle measurements were employed to determine physico-chemical cell surface properties. In addition, elemental surface concentration ratios were obtained via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and surface structures were examined with transmission electron microscopy. The S. mitis and P. micros strains were found to have higher isoelectric points, higher hydrophobicities and higher N/C surface concentration ratios than some other oral streptococci. The combined data suggest that both species possess large amounts of surface protein. All the S. mitis strains displayed abundant surface fibrils in negative staining, but the P. micros strains were devoid of surface appendages indicating that surface protein is present in different forms in the two species. The surfaces of S. mitis and P. micros type strains differed significantly from the other strains examined.
TI  - Enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  - This study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and DNA probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. Fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on Trypticase soy agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood. Colonies of reference strains were lifted onto Nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial DNA to the filters. Positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. Cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of Streptococcus mitis reacted with the probe to Streptococcus sanguis II. Subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of 26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. Samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees C. Colonies were lifted as described above. Filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes. The probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. The colony lift method and DNA probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. In addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.
TI  - Predominant cultivable flora in pericoronitis.
AB  - The predominant cultivable flora in pericoronitis was investigated by culturing pus from affected sites in 20 patients. Twenty colonies were picked at random from non-selective plates and identified using conventional biochemical and physiological tests, analysis of metabolic end-products by gas chromatography and protein profile analysis. The most frequently isolated organisms were Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella species, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus mitis. Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis was not isolated and asaccharolytic Eubacterium species were virtually absent. The predominant cultivable microflora in pericoronitis was found to be highly anaerobic in nature and superficially similar to that found in chronic periodontitis, although proposed marker organisms of severe periodontitis were absent.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological findings on newly inserted hydroxyapatite-coated and pure titanium human dental implants.
AB  - The clinical and microbiologic features of 30 hydroxyapatite-coated root-form endosseous dental implants (Tri-Stage) were compared to 10 similar pure titanium implants without hydroxyapatite coatings. In 7 of 9 partially edentulous patients studied, pure titanium fixtures were placed adjacent to hydroxyapatite-coated implants. Implants in the maxilla were submerged beneath mucosal tissues after implant placement for a minimum of 6 months, and in the mandible for at least 4 months. All patients were prescribed short-term beta-lactam antibiotic therapy after fixture placement, and 8 of 9 used chlorhexidine mouthrinses after fixture exposure. Clinical and microbiological examination was carried out 7-10 months after fixed prosthetic loading of the implants. Clinical measurements included the gingival index, plaque index, bleeding on probing and peri-implant probing depths determined with the Florida Probe system. Subgingival microbial samples were collected with paper points and transported in VMGA III. Specimens were examined by direct phase-contrast microscopy and were plated onto nonselective and selective culture media for anaerobic and aerobic incubation. No significant mean clinical or microbiological differences were found between the implant types, although one hydroxyapatite-coated implant exhibited deep probing depths, bleeding on probing and marked radiographic crestal bone loss. Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis were the most predominant organisms recovered from clinically stable implants, whereas high proportions of Fusobacterium species and Peptostreptococcus prevotii were isolated from the ailing hydroxyapatite-coated implant. One or more implants in 8 of the study subjects yielded enteric rods, pseudomonads, enterococci or staphylococci. The prognosis of implants with varying early microbiotas needs to be established in longitudinal studies.
TI  - The growth of oral bacteria on saliva.
AB  - The present experiments were aimed at studying the degradation of salivary glycoproteins by the oral microflora. To this end, S. sanguis I strain Ny476 and S. sanguis II (S. mitior) strain Ny581 were grown continuously in human-whole saliva. Under these conditions, the strains produced a variety of cell-associated hydrolytic activities, including glycosidases, exo- and endopeptidases, and esterases. S. sanguis II generally exhibited higher levels of enzyme activity than did S. sanguis I, in particular of neuraminidase that was produced only by S. sanguis II. In accordance, S. sanguis II had a higher cell yield and consumed a higher proportion of the sugars and sialic acid in the glycoproteins than did S. sanguis I. Interestingly, S. sanguis I, which is devoid of neuraminidase, is known to have a lectin with specificity for sialic acid, whereas S. sanguis II has affinity for galactose residues in the glycoproteins. We propose that specific binding of glycoproteins by oral bacteria constitutes a mechanism to collect nutrients in the vicinity of the cell. The special ability of S. sanguis II to utilize saliva for growth was further exemplified by its selection in batch-wise enrichments of dental plaque on saliva. The microflora in these enrichment cultures always consisted of Peptostreptococcus micros, S. sanguis II, and Fusobacterium nucleatum as the dominant organisms. Further, S. mitis and Gemella haemolysans were generally found to be present. The enrichment cultures produced a wide variety of mainly cell-bound hydrolytic enzymes. This resulted in almost complete breakdown of salivary glycoproteins in the culture.
TI  - Microbiota of gingivitis in man.
AB  - A study on the predominant cultivable microorganisms inhabiting gingival crevices affected with a chronic gingivitis was carried out using the roll tube culture technique. Samples were obtained from nine individuals 25--42 years of age. Gram-positive rods make up 29.1% of the isolates and included mainly Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, and Actinomyces viscosus. Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis together made up 26.8% of the cultivable organisms. Peptostreptococcus averaged 3.0% of the organisms recovered. Gram-negative anaerobic rods constituted 25.0% of the total isolates with Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. intermedius. Bacteriodes ochraceus, other Bacteroides species, Selenomonas sputigena, and Campylobacter sputorum as the most predominant isolates. Haemophilus parainfluenzae averaged about 14% and Veillonella species 4.3% of the cultivable microflora. The data presented indicate that the subgingival microflora of a chronic gingivitis differs from those of healthy periodontium and advanced adult and juvenile periodontis. This might suggest that different infectious processes may be operative in various clinical entities of periodontal disease.
TI  - Urease assay and urease-producing species of anaerobes in the bovine rumen and human feces.
AB  - A growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. Using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that Peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. Also, some fecal strains of Ruminococcus albus, Clostridium innocuum, and Clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. Single strains of Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Coprococcus catus, and Streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. Urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. They include Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, Treponema sp., Ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), Butyrivibrio sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides ruminicola, and P. productus. Most P. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. The urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and Trypticase.
TI  - Bacteremia after tooth extractions studied with the aid of prereduced anaerobically sterilized culture media.
AB  - Both prereduced molten agar and broth and aerobic molten agar and broth were inoculated with blood samples collected from patients with periodontitis, but in otherwise good health, both before and after extraction of two or more teeth. Postoperative blood samples from 23 of 25 patients sampled yielded anaerobic and facultative species. Colony counts from nine samples yielded from less than 1 to over 100 colonies per ml of blood. Organisms detected were species belonging to the genera Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Leptotrichia, Propionibacterium, Peptococcus, Veillonella, plus Streptococcus mitis, S. salivarius, vibrio forms, and strains resembling S. mutans. The data indicate that prereduced anaerobically sterilized culture medium with polyanethol sulfonate is effective for detecting anaerobic species in bacteremia and that anaerobic species can be prevalent in bacteremias immediately after tooth extraction in patients with periodontitis.
TI  - ESTABLISHMENT OF HUMAN INDIGENOUS BACTERIA IN GERM-FREE MICE.
AB  - Gibbons, R. J. (Forsyth Dental Center and Harvard School of Dental Medicine, Boston, Mass.), S. S. Socransky, and B. Kapsimalis. Establishment of human indigenous bacteria in germ-free mice. J. Bacteriol. 88:1316-1323. 1964.-Thirteen strains of bacteria indigenous to the gingival crevice area of man were tested for their ability to establish as monocontaminants in germ-free mice. Three facultative organisms, Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus albus, and a "diphtheroid," established, as well as three anaerobes. Fusobacterium fusiforme, an anaerobic diphtheroid, and a Bacteroides strain. Seven other anaerobes (two strains of B. melaninogenicus, and one strain each of Treponema microdentium, Veillonella alcalescens, a Peptostreptococcus strain, Vibrio sputorum, and B. oralis) failed to establish. A mixture consisting of ten organisms representative of the predominant groups of cultivable bacteria present in the gingival crevice area of man was inoculated intraorally into germ-free mice. All organisms with the exception of B. melaninogenicus and T. microdentium became established as polycontaminants. Escherichia coli could be established in the above polycontaminated mice, as well as in those contaminated directly with human gingival debris. E. coli comprised approximately 50 and 6% of the fecal flora in the two groups, respectively. Diet, cecal contents, and feces of germ-free and polycontaminated mice were tested for inhibitory action against T. microdentium and B. melaninogenicus. None inhibited T. microdentium, whereas all three inhibited B. melaninogenicus. The inhibitory effect appeared to be due to dietary alfalfa. B. melaninogenicus could become established in mice monocontaminated with a facultative diptheroid and maintained on an alfalfa-free diet. These experiments indicate that human indigenous bacteria can become established in germ-free mice, and that microbial interactions and diet composition are important determinants.
