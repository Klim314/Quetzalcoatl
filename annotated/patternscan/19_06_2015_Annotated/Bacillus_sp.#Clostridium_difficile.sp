TI  == spirotetronate antibiotics with anti-clostridium activity from actinomadura sp. 2eps.
AB  == the rare actinomycetes strain 2eps was isolated from soil and analysis of cultural, morphological characteristics, diaminopimelic acid content of its cell  wall, and 16s rrna gene sequence indicates that 2eps belongs to genus actinomadura. in addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also confirmed the  relationships of this strain to other members of actinomadura. a butanol extract  with antibacterial activity was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to obtain three bioactive compounds, designated as compounds 1, 2 and 3. the structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis ((1)h-nmr and (13)c-nmr) and mass spectrometric analysis (hr-tof-ms). compounds 1-3 were identified and found to be the same as those included in the japanese patent number jp 09227587 for spirotetronate antibiotics and are be-45722a (1), be-45722b (2) and be-45722c (3), respectively. all compounds were active against  gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, bacillus cereus atcc 14579, and b. subtilis atcc 6633) with low mic values between 0.08 and 5.0 microg/ml. moreover, both 1 and 3 also exhibited strong activity, with similar mic values, against clostridium perfringens s107 at 0.63 microg/ml and c. difficile 630 at 0.08 microg/ml. these results suggest the identified spirotetronate compounds may have potential in the treatment of clostridium infections. overall, this analysis demonstrates that rare actinomycetes are a promising source for discovery of antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == spoiva and sipl are clostridium difficile spore morphogenetic proteins.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a major nosocomial pathogen whose infections are difficult to treat because of their frequent recurrence. the spores of c. difficile are responsible for these clinical features, as they resist common disinfectants and antibiotic treatment. although spores are the major transmissive form of c. difficile, little is known about their composition or morphogenesis. spore morphogenesis has been well characterized for bacillus sp.,  but bacillus sp. spore coat proteins are poorly conserved in clostridium sp. of the known spore morphogenetic proteins in bacillus subtilis, spoiva is one of the mostly highly conserved in the bacilli and the clostridia. using genetic analyses, we demonstrate that spoiva is required for proper spore morphogenesis in c. difficile. in particular, a spoiva mutant exhibits defects in spore coat localization but not cortex formation. our study also identifies sipl, a previously uncharacterized protein found in proteomic studies of c. difficile spores, as another critical spore morphogenetic protein, since a sipl mutant phenocopies a spoiva mutant. biochemical analyses and mutational analyses indicate that spoiva and sipl directly interact. this interaction depends on the  walker a atp binding motif of spoiva and the lysm domain of sipl. collectively, these results provide the first insights into spore morphogenesis in c. difficile.

TI  == the role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  == the use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a  beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. there is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. however, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly lactobacillus sp. and bifidobacterium sp. however, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., enterococcus sp., bacteroides sp., bacillus sp., propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea  caused by rotavirus, shigella, salmonella, enterotoxigenic e. coli, vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. there are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be  undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.

TI  == isolation and characterization of two bacteriocins of lactobacillus acidophilus lf221.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus lf221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: bacillus cereus, clostridium sp., listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus d. l. acidophilus lf221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin lf221 a and acidocin lf221 b, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase fplc. the  antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase k) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide a and 35 of peptide b were determined. among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. no significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin lf221 a and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology  was found between acidocin lf221 b and brevicin 27. l. acidophilus lf221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.

TI  == synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive gene probe for the detection of c.perfringens alpha toxin.
AB  == the synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. a vector free digoxigenin-dutp-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the cloned plc gene of c.perfringens strain atcc 13124. in a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of c.perfringens were tested for plc. none of the strains failed in hybridization. presence of plc was even demonstrated in c.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. none different clostridia sp. tested, e.g. c.bifermentans, c.tertium, c.novyi, c.chauvoei, c.sporogenes, c.difficile, c.putrifucum, c.sordellii, c.botulinum, c. septicum and c.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with dna hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of c.perfringens plc.
