TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  - The biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic LAB from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.LAB were isolated using MRS and M17 media. The agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) producing LAB using Lactobacillus sakei and Listeria innocua as indicator organisms. Out of 138 LAB isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C against L. innocua, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against Penicillium expansum, Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. The effect of selected LAB strains on L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.Twenty percent of our isolates produced BLS inhibiting the growth of L. innocua and/or Lact. sakei. Organic acids and/or H2O2 produced by LAB and not the BLS had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of E. coli. Ent. faecium, Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. Bacteriocinogenic LAB present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
TI  - Coexpression of the superoxide dismutase and the catalase provides remarkable oxidative stress resistance in Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are generally sensitive to oxidative stress caused by  reactive oxygen species (ROS). Antioxidant enzymes, especially superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), can protect against ROS by eliminating superoxide and H(2)O(2), respectively. Lactobacillus rhamnosus is a valuable probiotic starter culture but is deficient in both SOD and CAT, and is thus likely to suffer from oxidative stress in industrial fermentation. To confer high level of oxidative resistance on L. rhamnosus , the SOD gene sodA from Streptococcus thermophilus and CAT gene katA from L. sakei were coexpressed in L. rhamnosus AS 1.2466. The enzyme activities of SOD and CAT were 147.80 +/- 1.08 U/mg protein and 2.53 mumol of H(2)O(2) /min/10(8) cfu, respectively, in the recombinant L. rhamnosus CS. After incubation with 10 mM H(2)O(2), the survival ratio of L. rhamnosus CS was 400-fold higher than that of L. rhamnosus CAT. In long-term aerated conditions, viable cells of L. rhamnosus CS remained approximately 10(6) cfu/mL after incubation for 7 days, while no living cells of the control were detected. These results showed that the cooperation between SOD and CAT could significantly enhance oxidative resistance in L. rhamnosus . To our best knowledge, this is the first report of two synergistic antioxidant genes being coexpressed in the same Lactobacilli.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 increases lactacin B production when it senses live target bacteria.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 is a probiotic strain used in dairy products. Production of bacteriocin by L. acidophilus La-5 was achieved when it was grown in co-cultures with the yogurt starter species Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. However, bacteriocin induction was not observed when heat-killed cells were used as inducers. This study demonstrates that L. acidophilus La-5 produces lactacin B and that the bacteriocin expression is controlled by an auto-induction mechanism involving the secreted peptide IP_1800. The transcript level of the lactacin B gene cluster expression was investigated in co-cultures between L. acidophilus La-5 and S. thermophilus STY-31 and a remarkable increase of the bacteriocin structural gene (lbaB) transcription was observed. However, lbaB was transcribed constitutively in uninduced L. acidophilus La-5 cells, but the levels of the secreted bacteriocin were not enough to be detected by the agar diffusion assay. A new method for bacteriocin detection was formulated based on the monitoring on real time of Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei growth in presence of the supernatant and the cell wall extracts of pure and induced L. acidophilus La-5. These results showed that part of lactacin B secreted remains adhered to cell envelope.
TI  - Optimization of conditions for profiling bacterial populations in food by culture-independent methods.
AB  - In this study we used culture-independent methods to profile bacterial populations in food products. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were employed in order to identify bacterial species without the need of isolation and biochemical identification. The protocols used to extract the DNA, subsequently subjected to PCR amplification for DGGE, as well as the hybridization procedure for FISH, were optimised. Moreover, an extensive study on the primers and probes to be used for the direct detection and identification of microorganisms commonly found in food, was carried out. Meat and cheese samples, fresh or processed, were subjected to DGGE and FISH analysis and the results obtained highlighted how the processing in food industry is decreasing the bacterial biodiversity. Not only processed cheese or meat but also fermented products were dominated by only one or few species. Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus and Brochothrix thermosphacta were the main species found in meat products, while in cheese(s) Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Leuconostoc spp. were repeatedly detected. The results obtained by the two culture-independent methods used always correlated well.
TI  - A novel area of predictive modelling: describing the functionality of beneficial  microorganisms in foods.
AB  - Predictive microbiology generally focuses on the potential outgrowth of spoilage  bacteria and foodborne pathogens in foods. Little attention has been paid to the biokinetics of beneficial foodgrade microorganisms, such as lactic acid bacteria. The latter is commonly used in the food fermentation industry, mainly for the in situ production of the antimicrobial lactic acid to extend the shelf life of the food. Furthermore, many strains show additional industrial potential as novel starter cultures since they produce functional metabolites, such as bacteriocins and exopolysaccharides. The production of these functional metabolites has been demonstrated during in vitro experiments, but in many cases these novel starter cultures seem to be less efficient when applied in a food system. A modelling approach may contribute to a better understanding of the tight relation between the food environment and bacterial functionality. Primary modelling can be applied to fit the experimental data concerning cell growth, sugar metabolism, and the production of functional metabolites for a given set of environmental conditions. This led to conclusions concerning the growth-associated production of bacteriocin and exopolysaccharides, the inactivation of these molecules when cell growth levels off, and a minimum cell concentration to trigger on bacteriocin production. Examples deal with the production of the bacteriocin sakacin K by the natural fermented sausage isolate Lactobacillus sakei CTC 494, and the production of heteropolysaccharides by the yoghurt starter culture Streptococcus thermophilus LY03. Secondary modelling of biokinetic parameters quantifies the production of bacteriocin and exopolysaccharides in function of environmental factors. As an example, the specific bacteriocin production by Lb. sakei CTC 494 decreases with increasing sodium chloride concentrations. Furthermore, since the assessment of functionality is frequently hampered by the nature of the food system, mathematical modelling techniques may help to predict the functional behaviour of novel lactic acid bacteria starter cultures in a food matrix, and hence quantify in situ production. For example, a model may simulate cell growth and exopolysaccharide production of S. thermophilus LY03 in a milk environment, where direct measurements are difficult to perform.
TI  - Biodegradability of food-associated extracellular polysaccharides.
AB  - Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by lactic acid bacteria, which are common in fermented foods, are claimed to have various beneficial physiological effects on humans. Although the biodegradability of EPSs is important in relation to the bioactive properties, knowledge on this topic is limited. Therefore, the biodegradability of eight EPSs, six of which were produced by lactic acid bacteria, was compared with microorganisms from human feces or soil. EPS-degradation was determined from the decrease in polysaccharide-sugar concentration and by high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). Xanthan, clavan, and the EPSs produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SFi 39 and SFi 12 were readily degraded, in contrast to the EPSs produced by Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris B40, Lactobacillus sakei 0-1, S. thermophilus SFi20, and Lactobacillus helveticus Lh59. Clearly, the susceptibility of exopolysaccharides to biological breakdown can differ greatly, implying that the physiological effects of these compounds may also vary a lot.
