TI  == diets high in resistant starch and arabinoxylan modulate digestion processes and  scfa pool size in the large intestine and faecal microbial composition in pigs.
AB  == the effects of a high level of dietary fibre (df) either as arabinoxylan (ax) or  resistant starch (rs) on digestion processes, scfa concentration and pool size in various intestinal segments and on the microbial composition in the faeces were studied in a model experiment with pigs. a total of thirty female pigs (body weight 63.1 (sem 4.4) kg) were fed a low-df, high-fat western-style control diet  (wsd), an ax-rich diet (axd) or a rs-rich diet (rsd) for 3 weeks. diet significantly affected the digestibility of dm, protein, fat, nsp and nsp components, and the arabinose:xylose ratio, as well as the disappearance of nsp and ax in the large intestine. rs was mainly digested in the caecum. ax was digested at a slower rate than rs. the digesta from axd-fed pigs passed from the  ileum to the distal colon more than twice as fast as those from wsd-fed pigs, with those from rsd-fed pigs being intermediate (p< 0.001). axd feeding resulted  in a higher number of faecalibacterium prausnitzii, roseburia intestinalis, blautia coccoides-eubacterium rectale, bifidobacterium spp. and lactobacillus spp. in the faeces sampled at week 3 of the experimental period (p< 0.05). in the caecum, proximal and mid colon, axd feeding resulted in a 3- to 5-fold higher pool size of butyrate compared with wsd feeding, with the rsd being intermediate  (p <0.001). in conclusion, the rsd and axd differently affected digestion processes compared with the wsd, and the axd most efficiently shifted the microbial composition towards butyrogenic species in the faeces and increased the large-intestinal butyrate pool size.

TI  == effect of prebiotics on the fecal microbiota of elderly volunteers after dietary  supplementation of bacillus coagulans gbi-30, 6086.
AB  == in advancing age, gut populations of beneficial microbes, notably bifidobacterium spp., show a marked decline. this contributes to an environment less capable of maintaining homoeostasis. this in vitro investigation studied the possible synergistic effects of probiotic supplementation in modulating the gut microbiota enabling prebiotic therapy to in elderly persons. single stage batch culture anaerobic fermenters were used and inoculated with fecal microbiota obtained from volunteers after taking a 28 day treatment of bacillus coagulans gbi-30, 6086 (ganedenbc30 (bc30)) or a placebo. the response to prebiotic supplements fructooligosaccharides (fos) and galactooligosaccharides (gos) in the fermenters  was assessed. bacterial enumeration was carried out using fluorescent in situ hybridisation and organic acids measured by gas chromatography. baseline populations of faecalibacterium prausnitzii, clostridium lituseburense and bacillus spp. were significantly higher in those having consumed bc30 compared to the placebo. both prebiotics increased populations of several purportedly beneficial bacterial groups in both sets of volunteers. samples from volunteers having ingested the bc30 also increased populations of c. lituseburense, eubacterium rectale and f. prausnitzii more so than in persons who had consumed the placebo, this also resulted in significantly higher concentrations of butyrate, acetate and propionate. this shows that consumption of bc30 and subsequent use of prebiotics resulted in elevated populations of beneficial genres of bacteria as well as organic acid production.

TI  == senior thai fecal microbiota comparison between vegetarians and non-vegetarians using pcr-dgge and real-time pcr.
AB  == the fecal microbiotas were investigated in 13 healthy thai subjects using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). among the 186 dna bands detected on the polyacrylamide gel, 37 bands were identified as representing 11 species: bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides  ovatus, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium colicanis, eubacterium eligenes, e. rectale, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, megamonas funiformis, prevotella copri, and roseburia intestinalis, belonging mainly to the groups of bacteroides, prevotella, clostridium, and f. prausnitzii. a dendrogram  of the pcr-dgge divided the subjects; vegetarians and non-vegetarians. the fecal  microbiotas were also analyzed using a quantitative real-time pcr focused on bacteroides, bifidobacterium, enterobacteriaceae, clostrium coccoides-eubacterium rectale, c. leptum, lactobacillus, and prevotella. the nonvegetarian and vegetarian subjects were found to have significant differences in the high abundance of the bacteroides and prevotella genera, respectively. no significant  differences were found in the counts of bifidabacterium, enterobacteriaceae, c. coccoides-e. rectale group, c. leptum group, and lactobacillus. therefore, these  findings on the microbiota of healthy thais consuming different diets could provide helpful data for predicting the health of south east asians with similar  diets.

TI  == disrupted intestinal microbiota and intestinal inflammation in children with cystic fibrosis and its restoration with lactobacillus gg: a randomised clinical  trial.
AB  == background & aims: intestinal inflammation is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (cf). administration of probiotics can reduce intestinal inflammation and the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations. we investigated the composition of intestinal microbiota in children with cf and analyzed its relationship with intestinal inflammation. we also investigated the microflora structure before and after lactobacillus gg (lgg) administration in children with cf with and without antibiotic treatment. methods: the intestinal microbiota were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). intestinal inflammation was assessed by measuring fecal calprotectin (clp) and rectal nitric oxide (rno) production in children with cf as compared with healthy controls. we  then carried out a small double-blind randomized clinical trial with lgg. results: twenty-two children with cf children were enrolled in the study (median  age, 7 years; range, 2-9 years). fecal clp and rno levels were higher in children with cf than in healthy controls (184+/-146 microg/g vs. 52+/-46 microg/g; 18+/-15 vs. 2.6+/-1.2 micromol/l no2 (-), respectively; p<0.01). compared with healthy controls, children with cf had significantly different intestinal microbial core structures. the levels of eubacterium rectale, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were reduced in children with cf. a similar but more extreme pattern was observed in children with cf who were taking antibiotics. lgg administration reduced fecal clp and partially restored intestinal microbiota. there was a significant correlation between reduced microbial richness and intestinal inflammation. conclusions: cf causes qualitative and quantitative changes in intestinal microbiota, which may represent a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cf. administration of probiotics restored gut microbiota, supporting the efficacy of probiotics in reducing intestinal inflammation and pulmonary exacerbations. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct 01961661.

TI  == faecal microbiota composition in vegetarians: comparison with omnivores in a cohort of young women in southern india.
AB  == the effect of vegetarian diets on faecal microbiota has been explored largely through culture-based techniques. the present study compared the faecal microbiota of vegetarian and omnivorous young women in southern india. faecal samples were obtained from thirty-two lacto-vegetarian and twenty-four omnivorous young adult women from a similar social and economic background. macronutrient intake and anthropometric data were collected. faecal microbiota of interest was  quantified by real-time pcr with sybr green using primers targeting 16s rrna genes of groups, including: clostridium coccoides group (clostridium cluster xiva), roseburia spp.-eubacterium rectale, bacteroides--prevotella group, bifidobacterium genus, lactobacillus group, clostridium leptum group (clostridium cluster iv), faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus productus--c. coccoides,  butyrivibrio, enterococcus species and enterobacteriaceae. the groups were matched for age, socio-economic score and anthropometric indices. intake of energy, complex carbohydrates and ca were significantly higher in the omnivorous  group. the faecal microbiota of the omnivorous group was enriched with clostridium cluster xiva bacteria, specifically roseburia-e. rectale. the relative proportions of other microbial communities were similar in both groups.  the butyryl-coa coa-transferase gene, associated with microbial butyrate production, was present in greater amounts in the faeces of omnivores, and the levels were highly correlated with clostridium cluster xiva and roseburia-e. rectale abundance and to a lesser extent with clostridium leptum and f. prausnitzii abundance and with crude fibre intake. omnivores had an increased relative abundance of clostridium cluster xiva bacteria and butyryl-coa coa-transferase gene compared with vegetarians, but we were unable to identify the components of the diet responsible for this difference.

TI  == smokers with active crohn's disease have a clinically relevant dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal microbiota.
AB  == background: patients with crohn's disease (cd) have an intestinal dysbiosis with  components of the microbiota exerting differential immune effects. smoking is associated with an increased incidence of cd, more frequent relapse, and greater  burden of surgery. this study aimed to investigate the association between smoking and the intestinal microbiota in patients with active cd. methods: patients with active cd (n = 103) and healthy controls (n = 66) were recruited and demographic and clinical data recorded including current smoking behavior. fecal samples were collected and analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization using probes targeting 16s rrna of bacteria previously shown to be altered in active cd (bifidobacteria, bacteroides, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale, escherichia coli, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii). results: in total,  29/101 (29%) patients with cd and 8/58 (14%) controls were current smokers (p = 0.032). following multivariate analysis, smoking was found to have a significant  and independent effect on the microbiota of patients with cd, with higher bacteroides-prevotella in smokers (38.4%) compared with nonsmokers (28.1%) (f((1,93)) = 12.6, p = 0.001). healthy controls who smoked also had higher bacteroides-prevotella (34.8%) than nonsmokers (24.1%) (f((1,55)) = 4.5, p = 0.038). in the pooled multivariate analysis, patients with cd had higher bifidobacteria (f((1,156)) = 30.5, p < 0.001), higher bacteroides-prevotella (f((1,156)) = 6.5, p = 0.012), and lower f. prausnitzii (f((1,156)) = 3.8, p = 0.052) compared with healthy controls. conclusions: smokers have luminal microbiota that consist of significantly higher bacteroides. investigation of whether this is one mechanism through which the negative effects of smoking on cd are mediated is warranted.

TI  == decreased colonization of fecal clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale species from ulcerative colitis patients in an in vitro dynamic gut model with mucin environment.
AB  == the mucus layer in the colon, acting as a barrier to prevent invasion of pathogens, is thinner and discontinuous in patients with ulcerative colitis (uc). a recent developed in vitro dynamic gut model, the m-shime, was used to compare long-term colonization of the mucin layer by the microbiota from six healthy volunteers (hv) and six uc patients and thus distinguish the mucin adhered from the luminal microbiota. although under the same nutritional conditions, short-chain fatty acid production by the luminal communities from uc patients showed a tendency toward a lower butyrate production. a more in-depth community analysis of those microbial groups known to produce butyrate revealed that the diversity of the clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale and clostridium leptum group, and counts of faecalibacterium prausnitzii were lower in the luminal fractions of the uc samples. counts of roseburia spp. were lower in the mucosal fractions of the uc samples. qpcr analysis for butyryl-coa:acetate coa transferase, responsible for butyrate production, displayed a lower abundance in  both the luminal and mucosal fractions of the uc samples. the m-shime model revealed depletion in butyrate producing microbial communities not restricted to  the luminal but also in the mucosal samples from uc patients compared to hv.

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == highlighting new phylogenetic specificities of crohn's disease microbiota.
AB  == background: recent studies suggest that gastrointestinal (gi) microbes play a part in the pathogenesis of crohn's disease (cd). methods: fecal samples were collected from 16 healthy individuals and 16 cd patients (age- and sex-matched).  the dna extracted from these samples were subjected to two different methods of microbiome analysis. specific bacterial groups were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods using primers designed using a high-throughput in-house bioinformatics pipeline. the same dna extracts were also used to produce fluorescently labeled crna amplicons to interrogate a custom-designed phylogenetic microarray for intestinal bacteria. results: even though the intersubject variability was high, differences in the fecal microbiomes of healthy and cd patients were detected. faecalibacterium prausnitzii and escherichia coli were more represented in healthy and ileal cd patients, respectively. additionally, probes specific for ruminococcus bromii, oscillibacter valericigenes, bifidobacterium bifidum, and eubacterium rectale produced stronger hybridization signals with the dna samples from healthy subjects. conversely, species overrepresented in cd patients were e. coli, enterococcus faecium, and species from the proteobacteria not normally found in the healthy human gi tract. furthermore, we detected "healthy specific" molecular species or operational taxonomic units (otus) that are not closely related to any known species (faecalibacterium, subdoligranulum, and oscillospora species), indicating that the phylogenetic dysbiosis is broader than at strain or species level. conclusions: these two techniques of microbiome analysis provided a statistically robust new picture of the dysbiosis in fecal microbiota from ileal  cd patients. specifically, we identified a set of six species discriminant for cd, which provides a preliminary diagnostic tool.

TI  == prebiotic effect of fruit and vegetable shots containing jerusalem artichoke inulin: a human intervention study.
AB  == the present study aimed to determine the prebiotic effect of fruit and vegetable  shots containing inulin derived from jerusalem artichoke (ja). a three-arm parallel, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was carried out with sixty-six healthy human volunteers (thirty-three men and thirty-three women, age range: 18-50 years). subjects were randomised into three groups (n 22) assigned to consume either the test shots, pear-carrot-sea buckthorn (pcs) or plum-pear-beetroot (ppb), containing ja inulin (5 g/d) or the placebo. fluorescent in situ hybridisation was used to monitor populations of total bacteria, bacteroides, bifidobacteria, clostridium perfringens/histolyticum subgroup, eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group, lactobacillus/enterococcus spp., atopobium spp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii and propionibacteria. bifidobacteria levels were significantly higher on consumption  of both the pcs and ppb shots (10.0 (sd 0.24) and 9.8 (sd 0.22) log10 cells/g faeces, respectively) compared with placebo (9.3 (sd 0.42) log10 cells/g faeces)  (p < 0.0001). a small though significant increase in lactobacillus/enterococcus group was also observed for both the pcs and ppb shots (8.3 (sd 0.49) and 8.3 (sd 0.36) log10 cells/g faeces, respectively) compared with placebo (8.1 (sd 0.37) log10 cells/g faeces) (p = 0.042). other bacterial groups and faecal scfa concentrations remained unaffected. no extremities were seen in the adverse events, medication or bowel habits. a slight significant increase in flatulence was reported in the subjects consuming the pcs and ppb shots compared with placebo, but overall flatulence levels remained mild. a very high level of compliance (>90 %) to the product was observed. the present study confirms the prebiotic efficacy of fruit and vegetable shots containing ja inulin.

TI  == acute appendicitis is characterised by local invasion with fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum.
AB  == background: acute appendicitis is a local intestinal inflammation with unclear origin. the aim was to test whether bacteria in appendicitis differ in composition to bacteria found in caecal biopsies from healthy and disease controls. methods and patients: we investigated sections of 70 appendices using rrna-based fluorescence in situ hybridisation. four hundred caecal biopsies and 400 faecal samples from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and other conditions were used as controls. a set of 73 group-specific bacterial probes was applied for the study. results: the mucosal surface in catarrhal appendicitis showed characteristic lesions of single epithelial cells filled with a mixed bacterial population ('pinned cells') without ulceration of the surroundings. bacteria deeply infiltrated the tissue in suppurative appendicitis. fusobacteria  (mainly fusobacterium nucleatum and necrophorum) were a specific component of these epithelial and submucosal infiltrates in 62% of patients with proven appendicitis. the presence of fusobacteria in mucosal lesions correlated positively with the severity of the appendicitis and was completely absent in caecal biopsies from healthy and disease controls. main faecal microbiota represented by bacteroides, eubacterium rectale (clostridium group xiva), faecalibacterium prausnitzii groups and akkermansia muciniphila were inversely related to the severity of the disease. the occurrence of other bacterial groups  within mucosal lesions of acute appendicitis was not related to the severity of the appendicitis. no fusobacteria were found in rectal swabs of patients with acute appendicitis. conclusions: local infection with fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum is responsible for the majority of cases of acute appendicitis.

TI  == quantitative differences in intestinal faecalibacterium prausnitzii in obese indian children.
AB  == gut bacteria contribute to energy conservation in man through their ability to ferment unabsorbed carbohydrate. the present study examined the composition of predominant faecal microbiota in obese and non-obese children. the participants (n 28) aged 11-14 years provided fresh faecal samples and completed a dietary survey consisting of 24 h diet recall and a ffq of commonly used foods taken over the previous 3 months. faecal bacteria were quantitated by real-time pcr using primers targeted at 16s rdna. of the participants, fifteen (seven female) were obese, with median bmi-for-age at the 99th percentile (range 97 to>99) while thirteen participants (seven female) were normal weight, with median bmi-for age  being at the 50th percentile (range 1-85). consumption of energy, carbohydrates,  fat and protein was not significantly different between the obese and non-obese participants. there was no significant difference between the two groups in faecal levels of bacteroides-prevotella, bifidobacterium species, lactobacillus acidophilus group or eubacterium rectale. levels of faecalibacterium prausnitzii  were significantly higher in obese children than in non-obese participants (p = 0.0253). we concluded that the finding of increased numbers of f. prausnitzii in  the faeces of obese children in south india adds to the growing information on alterations in faecal microbiota in obesity.

TI  == diversity of human colonic butyrate-producing bacteria revealed by analysis of the butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase gene.
AB  == butyrate-producing bacteria play an important role in the human colon, supplying  energy to the gut epithelium and regulating host cell responses. in order to explore the diversity and culturability of this functional group, we designed degenerate primers to amplify butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase sequences from  faecal samples provided by 10 healthy volunteers. eighty-eight per cent of amplified sequences showed >98% dna sequence identity to coa-transferases from cultured butyrate-producing bacteria, and these fell into 12 operational taxonomic units (otus). the four most prevalent otus corresponded to eubacterium  rectale, roseburia faecis, eubacterium hallii and an unnamed cultured species ss2/1. the remaining 12% of sequences, however, belonged to 20 otus that are assumed to come from uncultured butyrate-producing strains. samples taken after ingestion of inulin showed significant (p=0.019) increases in faecalibacterium prausnitzii. because several of the dominant butyrate producers differ in their dna % g+c content, analysis of thermal melt curves obtained for pcr amplicons of  the butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase gene provides a convenient and rapid qualitative assessment of the major butyrate producing groups present in a given  sample. this type of analysis therefore provides an excellent source of information on functionally important groups within the colonic microbial community.

TI  == diversity, metabolism and microbial ecology of butyrate-producing bacteria from the human large intestine.
AB  == butyrate-producing bacteria play a key role in colonic health in humans. this review provides an overview of the current knowledge of the diversity, metabolism and microbial ecology of this functionally important group of bacteria. human colonic butyrate producers are gram-positive firmicutes, but are phylogenetically diverse, with the two most abundant groups related to eubacterium rectale/roseburia spp. and to faecalibacterium prausnitzii. five different arrangements have been identified for the genes of the central pathway involved in butyrate synthesis, while in most cases butyryl-coa : acetate coa-transferase, rather than butyrate kinase, appears to perform the final step in butyrate synthesis. mechanisms have been proposed recently in non-gut clostridium spp. whereby butyrate synthesis can result in energy generation via both substrate-level phosphorylation and proton gradients. here we suggest that these  mechanisms also apply to the majority of butyrate producers from the human colon. the roles of these bacteria in the gut community and their influence on health are now being uncovered, taking advantage of the availability of cultured isolates and molecular methodologies. populations of f. prausnitzii are reported  to be decreased in crohn's disease, for example, while populations of roseburia relatives appear to be particularly sensitive to the diet composition in human volunteer studies.

TI  == bacterial succession in the colon during childhood and adolescence: molecular studies in a southern indian village.
AB  == background: the colonic bacterial flora, largely anaerobic, is believed to establish and stabilize in the first 2 y of life. objective: this study was undertaken to determine whether the bacterial flora of the colon undergoes further changes (succession) during childhood and adolescence. design: this cross-sectional study examined fecal samples from 130 healthy children and adolescents in the age group 2-17 y and from 30 healthy adults (median age: 42 y) residing in a single village in southern india. dna was extracted and subjected to 16s rdna-targeted real-time polymerase chain reaction to determine the relative predominance of bifidobacterium genus, bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, lactobacillus acidophilus group, eubacterium rectale, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii. results: bifidobacterium species and bacteroides-prevotella group were dominant fecal bacteria overall. e. rectale and lactobacillus species were considerably less abundant. clear age-related differences emerged, with a steep decline in bifidobacterium species  in adults (p < 0.0001), a steep decline of lactobacillus species >5 y of age (p < 0.0001), an increase in bacteroides during late adolescence and in adults (p = 0.0040), an increase in e. rectale during childhood and adolescence followed by a steep decline in adults (p < 0.0001), and a late childhood peak of f. prausnitzii with decline in adolescents and adults (p < 0.0001). conclusions: changes in the  bacterial flora occur during childhood and adolescence characterized by reduction in lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species and an increase in bacteroides, e rectale, and f. prausnitzii peaked during late childhood in this population.

TI  == real-time polymerase chain reaction quantification of specific butyrate-producing bacteria, desulfovibrio and enterococcus faecalis in the feces of patients with colorectal cancer.
AB  == background and aim: bacterial metabolites produced in the bowel are potentially related to the genesis of colorectal cancer. butyrate is protective against cancer, whereas hydrogen sulfide and oxygen free radicals can be toxic to the epithelium. the present study was designed to quantitate eubacterium rectale, faecalibacterium prausnitzii (both butyrate-producing bacteria), desulfovibrio (sulfate-reducing bacteria), and enterococcus faecalis (that produces extracellular superoxide) in the feces of patients with colorectal cancer. methods: dna was extracted from feces of 20 patients with colorectal cancer, nine patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer and 17 healthy volunteers. real-time  polymerase chain reaction using primers aimed at 16s rdna was used to quantitate  the above bacterial species or genus, and this was expressed relative to amplification of universal sequences conserved among all bacteria. results: levels of e. rectale and f. prausnitzii were decreased approximately fourfold (p  = 0.0088 and 0.0028, respectively) in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy control volunteers. levels of desulfovibrio were not significantly different between the three groups. e. faecalis populations were significantly higher in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy volunteers (p = 0.0294). conclusions: butyrate producers were decreased and e. faecalis increased in the feces of colon cancer patients. these shifts in the colonic bacterial population  could potentially lead to epithelial cell damage and increased turnover and may be a factor leading to colon cancer.

TI  == biostructure of fecal microbiota in healthy subjects and patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea.
AB  == background & aims: dysbiosis is a key component of intestinal disorders. our aim  was to quantitatively access the biostructure of fecal microbiota in healthy subjects and patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea and evaluate the responses to saccharomyces boulardii treatment. methods: we investigated punched fecal cylinders from 20 patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea and 20 healthy controls using fluorescence in situ hybridization. fluctuations in assembly of 11 bacterial groups were monitored weekly for 3 weeks before, during, and after oral s boulardii supplementation. results: the structural organization of fecal microbiota in healthy subjects was stable and unaffected by s boulardii. the assembly of fecal microbiota in idiopathic diarrhea was markedly different, characterized by mucus depositions within feces; mucus septa and striae; marked reduction in concentrations of habitual eubacterium rectale, bacteroides, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii groups; suppression of bacterial fluorescence in the center of the feces; increased concentrations and spatial shift of mucotrop bacteria to the fecal core; and increased concentrations of occasional bacteria.  except for elevated concentrations of some occasional bacterial groups, all parameters typical for diarrhea improved significantly with s boulardii treatment and most changes persisted after cessation of therapy. the improvement of the fecal microbiota was accompanied by partial (40%) and complete normalization (30%) of the diarrheal symptoms. conclusions: the fecal microbiota is highly structured. fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis allowed us to quantitatively study the dysbiotic changes. s boulardii significantly improved the fecal biostructure in patients with diarrhea but had no influence on the feces in healthy subjects.

TI  == molecular analysis of the digestive microbiota in a gnotobiotic mouse model during antibiotic treatment: influence of saccharomyces boulardii.
AB  == the probiotic saccharomyces boulardii is a non-pathogenic yeast that has been proven efficient in the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea and of clostridium difficile associated colitis. we evaluated the influence of the administration of s. boulardii on the composition of the fecal microbiota in a human microbiota-associated mouse model. this evaluation was run before, during and after a 7-day oral treatment with amoxicillin clavulanic acid. predominant groups of bacteria were quantified with fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with flow cytometry using group-specific 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes designed for the eubacteria, bacteroides-porphyromonas-prevotella, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale,  faecalibacterium prausnitzii, clostridium histolyticum, lactobacillus-enterococcus and enterobacteriaceae groups and bifidobacterium species. s. boulardii did not quantitatively alter the total anaerobic microbiota nor the dominant bacterial groups. during the antibiotic treatment in the two groups of mice receiving the yeast or not, the level of enterobacteriaceae and bacteroides groups increased when the c. coccoides-e. rectale group decreased dramatically. after the antibiotic treatment was discontinued, the return to the  initial level was reached more rapidly in the s. boulardii-treated mice than in the control mice (p<0.05) for the c. coccoides-e. rectale and bacteroides-porphyromonas-prevotella groups. this quicker recovery of normal intestinal microbiota equilibrium after antibiotic therapy could be a mechanism for s. boulardii preventive effect on antibiotic-associated diarrhea in humans.

TI  == imbalance in the composition of the duodenal microbiota of children with coeliac  disease.
AB  == coeliac disease (cd) is the most common immune-mediated enteropathy characterized by chronic inflammation of the small intestinal mucosa. the ingestion of gluten is responsible for the symptoms of cd, but other environmental factors are also thought to play a role in this disorder. in this study, the composition of the duodenal microbiota of coeliac children with active disease, symptom-free cd patients on a gluten-free diet and control children was determined. bacteriological analyses of duodenal biopsy specimens were carried out by fluorescent in situ hybridization coupled with flow cytometry. the proportions of total bacteria and gram-negative bacteria were significantly higher in cd patients with active disease than in symptom-free cd patients and controls. bacteroides and escherichia coli groups were significantly more abundant in cd patients with active disease than in controls, whilst these bacterial deviations  were normalized in symptom-free cd patients. the ratio of lactobacillus--bifidobacterium to bacteroides--e. coli was significantly reduced  in coeliac patients with either active or inactive disease compared with controls. the differences in atopobium, eubacterium rectale--clostridium coccoides, clostridium histolyticum, clostridium lituseburense, sulphate-reducing bacteria and faecalibacterium prausnitzii populations among the three groups of children were less relevant. overall, the higher incidence of gram-negative and potentially pro-inflammatory bacteria in the duodenal microbiota of coeliac children was linked to the symptomatic presentation of the disease and could favour the pathological process of the disorder.

AB  == little is known about bacterial communities that colonize mucosal surfaces in the human gastrointestinal tract, but they are believed to play an important role in  host physiology. the objectives of this study were to investigate the compositions of these populations in the distal small bowel and colon. healthy mucosal tissue from either the terminal ileum (n = 6) or ascending (n = 8), transverse (n = 8), or descending colon (n = 4) of 26 patients (age, 68.5 +/- 1.2 years [mean +/- standard deviation]) undergoing emergency resection of the large  bowel was used to study these communities. mucosa-associated eubacteria were characterized by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), while  real-time pcr was employed for quantitative analysis. mucosal communities were also visualized in situ using confocal laser scanning microscopy. dgge banding profiles from all the gut regions exhibited at least 45% homology, with five descending colon profiles clustering at ca. 75% concordance. real-time pcr showed that mucosal bacterial population densities were highest in the terminal ileum and that there were no significant differences in overall bacterial numbers in different parts of the colon. bifidobacterial numbers were significantly higher in the large bowel than in the terminal ileum (p = 0.006), whereas lactobacilli were more prominent in the distal large intestine (p = 0.019). eubacterium rectale (p = 0.0004) and faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p = 0.001) were dominant in the ascending and descending colon. site-specific colonization in the gastrointestinal tract may be contributory in the etiology of some diseases of the large intestine.

TI  == quantitative analysis of the intestinal bacterial community in one- to three-week-old commercially reared broiler chickens fed conventional or antibiotic-free vegetable-based diets.
AB  == aims: to explore the effect of drug-free poultry production on the intestinal microflora of broiler chickens, the bacterial community of this environment was quantitatively profiled in both conventionally reared birds and birds reared without antibiotic growth promotants (agps) on a vegetable-based diet. methods and results: quantitative, real-time pcr with group-specific 16s rdna primer sets was used to enumerate the abundance of the following chicken gastrointestinal (gi) tract phylogenetic groups: the clostridium leptum-faecalibacterium prausnitzii subgroup (clostridium genus cluster iv), the clostridium coccoides -  eubacterium rectale subgroup (clostridium cluster xiva and xivb), the bacteroides group (including prevotella and porphyromonas), bifidobacterium spp., the enterobacteriaceae, the lactobacillus group (including the genera leuconostoc, pediococcus, aerococcus and weissella), the clostridium perfringens subgroup (clostridium cluster i), enterococcus spp., veillonella spp., atopobium spp., campylobacter spp. and the domain bacteria. a species-specific 5'-nuclease (taqman) assay was also employed to specifically assess cl. perfringens abundance. ten birds were sampled from each of two commercial chicken houses, one in which feed was supplemented with agps and exogenous animal protein, and the other vegetable-based and drug-free, at 7, 14 and 21 days of age. the ileal community was dominated by two large populations, the lactobacilli and the enterobacteriaceae, with those taxa much more numerous in drug-free vegetable-based diet fed birds than those conventionally reared at the 7- and 14-day time periods. the progressive changes in microflora in both the conventional and drug-free caeca were similar to each other, with the enterobacteriaceae sequences dominating at day 7, but being replaced by obligate  anaerobe signature sequences by day 14. of note was the finding that all the day  14 and day 21 replicate caecal samples from the drug-free house were positive for campylobacter spp. averaging >10(8) 16s rdna gene copies per gram wet weight. conclusions: quantitative, real-time pcr indicates that the effects of drug-free  rearing on the chicken gi tract microbial community are most pronounced in the ileal region, but agps may be important in controlling campylobacter colonization of the caecum. significance and impact of the study: a quantitative taxonomic understanding of the shifting microbial ecology of the broiler chicken gut microbiota is important in the light of agp withdrawal. agp withdrawal has occurred in response to concerns over the transfer of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria to humans via the food production chain.

TI  == studies on the effect of system retention time on bacterial populations colonizing a three-stage continuous culture model of the human large gut using fish techniques.
AB  == fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to quantitate bacteria growing in a three-stage continuous culture system inoculated with human faeces, operated at two system retention times (60 and 20 h). twenty-three different 16s rrna gene oligonucleotide probes of varying specificities were used to detect bacteria. organisms belonging to genera bacteroides and bifidobacterium, together with the  eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group, the atopobium, faecalibacterium  prausnitzii and eubacterium cylindroides groups, as well as the segmented filamentous bacteria, the roseburia intestinalis group and lactic acid bacteria,  were all present in high numbers in the continuous culture system. other groups and species such as ruminococci and enterobacteria also persisted in the model, though not always at levels that allowed reliable quantitation. some organisms such as streptococci and corynebacteria, present in the faecal inoculum, did not  colonize the system. other probes specific for eubacterium lentum and for members of the genus desulfovibrio did not detect these organisms at any time. short chain fatty acid production was always highest in vessel i of the continuous culture system, however, a marked increase in acetate formation and a reduction in butyrate production occurred when system retention time was reduced to 20 h, which correlated with reductions in the numbers of butyrate-producing roseburia.

TI  == isoflavones and functional foods alter the dominant intestinal microbiota in postmenopausal women.
AB  == dietary phytoestrogens, such as isoflavones, are used as food additives to prevent menopause-related disorders. in addition to other factors, their bioavailability strongly depends on the activity of intestinal bacteria but the underlying interactions remain poorly understood. a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was undertaken with 39 postmenopausal women to characterize changes in the dominant microbial communities of the intestinal tract after 2 mo of isoflavone supplementation with and without pro- or prebiotic. the diversity and composition of the dominant microbiota were analyzed by temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) and fluorescent in situ hybridization. isoflavones alone stimulated dominant microorganisms of the clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale cluster, lactobacillus-enterococcus group, faecalibacterium prausnitzii subgroup, and bifidobacterium genus. the stimulation of the clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale cluster depended on  the women's equol excretion and was transient, with the exception of a prolonged  bifidogenic effect. lasting changes in the diversity of the dominant species were also observed. the probiotic strain supplied could be detected by ttge during its passage through the intestinal tract, and ingestion of fructooligosaccharides triggered a marked and specific bifidogenic effect. in conclusion, this is the first human study that shows changes in the diversity and composition of dominant bacterial communities in response to dietary supplementation with hormone-related compounds combined with functional foods.

TI  == lactate-utilizing bacteria, isolated from human feces, that produce butyrate as a major fermentation product.
AB  == the microbial community of the human colon contains many bacteria that produce lactic acid, but lactate is normally detected only at low concentrations (<5 mm)  in feces from healthy individuals. it is not clear, however, which bacteria are mainly responsible for lactate utilization in the human colon. here, bacteria able to utilize lactate and produce butyrate were identified among isolates obtained from 10(-8) dilutions of fecal samples from five different subjects. out of nine such strains identified, four were found to be related to eubacterium hallii and two to anaerostipes caccae, while the remaining three represent a new  species within clostridial cluster xiva based on their 16s rrna sequences. significant ability to utilize lactate was not detected in the butyrate-producing species roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, or faecalibacterium prausnitzii. whereas e. hallii and a. caccae strains used both d- and l-lactate,  the remaining strains used only the d form. addition of glucose to batch cultures prevented lactate utilization until the glucose became exhausted. however, when two e. hallii strains and one a. caccae strain were grown in separate cocultures  with a starch-utilizing bifidobacterium adolescentis isolate, with starch as the  carbohydrate energy source, the l-lactate produced by b. adolescentis became undetectable and butyrate was formed. such cross-feeding may help to explain the  reported butyrogenic effect of certain dietary substrates, including resistant starch. the abundance of e. hallii in particular in the colonic ecosystem suggests that these bacteria play important roles in preventing lactate accumulation.

TI  == validation of fluorescent in situ hybridization combined with flow cytometry for  assessing interindividual variation in the composition of human fecal microflora  during long-term storage of samples.
AB  == this work was conducted to assess the accuracy of in situ hybridization to show differences in human microflora composition between volunteers and to optimize the storage of fecal samples to allow delayed analysis of gut microflora composition in humans. fecal samples from 25 healthy subjects (14 women, 11 men aged 24-51) were collected. the samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pfa) solution at 4 degrees c overnight and stored at -70 degrees c. twenty samples were analysed to quantify the variation due to interindividual differences in the composition of fecal microflora. the five remaining samples were stored either after pfa fixation or directly frozen at -70 degrees c and were monitored on a 12-month period. the fecal microflora was analysed by in situ hybridization combined with flow cytometry detection. ribosomal rna-targeted probes were used to assess the relative proportions of four phylogenetic groups: clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale (erec 482), bacteroides (bac 303), faecalibacterium prausnitzii (fprau 645) and bifidobacterium (bif 164). our results demonstrated that the method used is adapted to detect significant differences in fecal microflora composition in humans. moreover, samples stored in pfa solution demonstrated a stable composition even after 8 months of storage. conversely, frozen samples were less stable as the bifidobacterium and c. coccoides-e. rectale groups showed significant differences after 2 months of storage. in conclusion, the fecal microflora composition can be analysed up to 8 months after 4% pfa fixation and storage at -70 degrees c. it represents an extended time compared with the 2-month period currently recommended. this will give more flexibility for applying this technology in epidemiological studies including a large number of samples.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.
