TI  == functional characterization of the sucrose isomerase responsible for trehalulose  production in plant-associated pectobacterium species.
AB  == fifty-three plant-associated microorganisms were investigated for their ability to convert sucrose to its isomers. these microorganisms included one dickeya zeae isolate and 7 enterobacter, 3 pantoea, and 43 pectobacterium species. eleven out  of the 53 strains (21%) showed the ability to transform sucrose to isomaltulose and trehalulose. among those, pectobacterium carotovorum kkh 3-1 showed the highest bioconversion yield (97.4%) from sucrose to its isomers. in this strain,  the addition of up to 14% sucrose in the medium enhanced sucrose isomerase (siase) production. the siase activity at 14% sucrose (47.6 u/mg dcw) was about 3.6-fold higher than that of the negative control (13.3 u/mg dcw at 0% sucrose).  the gene encoding siase, which is comprised a 1776 bp open reading frame (orf) encoding 591 amino acids, was cloned from p. carotovorum kkh 3-1 and expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant siase (pcsi) was shown to have optimum activity at ph 6.0 and 40 degrees c. the reaction temperature significantly affected the ratio of sucrose isomers produced by pcsi. the amount of trehalulose increased from 47.5% to 79.1% as temperature was lowered from 50 degrees c to 30 degrees c, implying that siase activity can be controlled by reaction temperature.

TI  == comparative analysis of two members of the metal ion-containing group iii-alcohol dehydrogenases from dickeya zeae.
AB  == purpose of work: a pair of nad(+)- and nadp(+)-dependent group iii-alcohol dehydrogenases was characterized from the enterobacterium, dickeya zeae, to expand our understanding of the distribution and biochemical properties of this interesting group of enzymes. two putative group iii-alcohol dehydrogenases (adhs) were identified in the genome of dickeya zeae. amino acid alignments and phylogenetic analysis revealed that adh3.1 and adh3.2 are only distantly related  (~25 % identity at the protein level). both proteins were purified to homogeneity after heterologous expression in e. coli. a specific activity of 1.8 u/mg was measured for the nad(+)-dependent enzyme adh3.1 with ethanol used as substrate, while nadph-dependent adh3.2 preferred butanal (29.1 u/mg) as substrate. maximum  activity for adh3.1 was at 50 degrees c and ph 10 and for adh3.2 at 70 degrees c  and ph 6. cell viability assays were used to confirm activity towards butanal and glyoxals. biochemical characterization and phylogenetic analyses led to the hypothesis that adh3.1 and adh3.2 are probably the result of an ancient gene duplication event followed by functional diversification.
