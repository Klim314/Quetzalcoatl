TI  == effect of two probiotic strains of lactobacillus on in vitro adherence of listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == the lactobacilli probiotics maintain a normal vaginal biota and prevent disease recurrence. this microorganisms form a pellicle on the vaginal epithelium that acts as a biologic barrier against colonization by pathogenic bacteria. in this paper were realized assays of exclusion, competition, and displacement. for these test, vaginal epithelial cells, two strains of lactobacilli and pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and listeria monocytogenes) were used. the lactobacilli strains showed a great capacity of adherence, with a mean of 83.5 +/- 26.67 lactobacillus fermentum cells and 56.2 +/- 20.87 lactobacillus rhamnosus cells per vaginal epithelial cells. l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus were able to reduce the adherence of s. aureus, s. agalactiae and l. monocytogenes in a significant level in this assay (p < 0.01).  the lactobacilli used in this study protect the vaginal epithelium through a series of barriers and interference mechanisms. the aim of present study was to assess the ability of vaginal lactobacillus strains, selected for their probiotic properties, to block the adherence of pathogenic microorganisms in vitro by displacement, competition, and exclusion mechanisms.

TI  == synergistic effect between two bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances produced by lactobacilli strains with inhibitory activity for streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) are bacterial species that colonize the vagina in pregnant women and as such may cause serious infections in neonates that passed through the birth channel. the objective of this work was to study the inhibitory activities produced by each bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) of lactobacillus rhamnosus l60 and lactobacillus fermentum l23, and the effects of the combined blis-es of these lactobacilli on gbs. the interactions between the blis-es were assessed by qualitative and quantitative methods on agar plates. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and fractional inhibitory concentrations (fics) were determined by a modification of the broth microdilution and checkerboard methods, respectively. antibiotic susceptibilities of all s. agalactiae strains were assayed and the results of these tests were evaluated for statistical significance. a 7.5% of gbs isolates were recovered from 760 pregnant women and 91% of those strains were susceptible to each blis produced by l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and also to a mixture of them. the comparisons among the blis-es showed statistically significant differences, with a combination of the blis-es from the two lactobacillus species being better than the blis of each one alone (p < 0.05) as gbs growth inhibitors. synergistic activities between the blis-es were found on 100% of susceptible gbs strains, mics ranges of blis of l23 and l60 were 80-160 and 160-320 ua ml(-1), respectively. by the checkerboard method, the blis-es combination showed synergistic effect on all sensitive strains tested, with values of fics ranging from 0.131 to 0.218. the blis-es produced by these lactobacilli of vaginal origin were able to inhibit s. agalactiae isolates. the results indicate that these strains may have probiotic potential for the control of gbs in women and may consequently prevent gbs infections in newborns.

TI  == [inhibitor effect of vaginal lactobacilli on group b streptococci].
AB  == neonatal group b streptococcal (gbs) infections are one of the important health problems because of their high mortality and morbidity rates in certain countries. there are some preventive approaches, including perinatal antibiotic therapy against these infections. recently, vaccination with conjugated gbs polysaccharides has also been practised. in this study, the in vitro inhibitory effects of 51 lactobacilli (of them 50 were purified from vaginal swabs, 1 from a commercial vaginal tablet) on five gbs (4 clinical isolates and 1 standard strain) were investigated by sandwich plate technique and deferred antagonism well technique. ten clinical isolates (20%) and the drug-purified lactobacilli expressed pronounced inhibitory effects on growth of gbs. all of the inhibitory isolates and 10 randomly selected non-inhibitory isolates were identified by api  50chl kit (biomeriex, france). seven (70%) of the inhibitory clinical isolates were lactobacillus rhamnosus. the inhibitory isolates had higher acid production  than the non-inhibitory ones (p < 0.05), and ph-adjustment destroyed their inhibitory effects entirely. if these results could be applied in vivo, it could  be postulated that administration of certain lactobacilli as probiotics via an appropriate regimen may be a safe, physiological and cheaper alternative for prevention of neonatal gbs infections.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.
