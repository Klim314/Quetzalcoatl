TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == in vitro anti-adhesive activity of green tea extract against pathogen adhesion.
AB  == camellia sinensis polysaccharide has been reported to possess anti-adhesive activity against pathogens. the present study was designed to investigate whether hot water extracts obtained from green tea leaves might inhibit pathogen adhesion to human or mouse cell lines. green tea extract-4 (csi-4) with the maximum yield  of 4% (w/v) is composed of a major proportion of carbohydrates containing 40% uronic acids, but lack of catechins. it showed strong inhibitory activities against hemagglutination mediated by pathogens helicobacter pylori, propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus aureus with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.01-0.5 mg/ml. csi-4 further demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the adhesion of these pathogens to host cell lines with the ic(50) values (50% inhibition of adhesion) of 0.14-2.3 mg/ml. it exhibited the highest activity against p. acnes, but no inhibitory effects were observed against lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum, escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. our results suggest that csi-4 may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria with no adverse effects against beneficial or commensal bacteria.

TI  == [antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in salmonella typhimurium].
AB  == it is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of propionibacterium shermanii, p. pentosaceum, p. thoenii, p. coccoides, p. acnes, lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus, str. faecalis, bifidobacterium bifidum,  and escherichia coli ab 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) in salmonella typhimurium ta 100 decreases significantly. the highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. the cells passaged in the medium containing 4-nqo demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. thiol accumulation in culture liquid from p. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. over 24 h thiol content decreased. the maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. it is suggested that desmutagenesis of the  bacteria studied towards 4-nqo is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
