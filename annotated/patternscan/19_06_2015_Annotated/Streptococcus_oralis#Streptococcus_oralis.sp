TI  == removal of dental biofilms with an ultrasonically activated water stream.
AB  == acidogenic bacteria within dental plaque biofilms are the causative agents of caries. consequently, maintenance of a healthy oral environment with efficient biofilm removal strategies is important to limit caries, as well as halt progression to gingivitis and periodontitis. recently, a novel cleaning device has been described using an ultrasonically activated stream (uas) to generate a cavitation cloud of bubbles in a freely flowing water stream that has demonstrated the capacity to be effective at biofilm removal. in this study, uas  was evaluated for its ability to remove biofilms of the cariogenic pathogen streptococcus mutans ua159, as well as actinomyces naeslundii atcc 12104 and streptococcus oralis atcc 9811, grown on machine-etched glass slides to generate  a reproducible complex surface and artificial teeth from a typodont training model. biofilm removal was assessed both visually and microscopically using high-speed videography, confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm), and scanning electron microscopy (sem). analysis by cslm demonstrated a statistically significant 99.9% removal of s. mutans biofilms exposed to the uas for 10 s, relative to both untreated control biofilms and biofilms exposed to the water stream alone without ultrasonic activation (p < 0.05). the water stream alone showed no statistically significant difference in removal compared with the untreated control (p = 0.24). high-speed videography demonstrated a rapid rate (151 mm2 in 1 s) of biofilm removal. the uas was also highly effective at s. mutans, a. naeslundii, and s. oralis biofilm removal from machine-etched glass and s. mutans from typodont surfaces with complex topography. consequently, uas technology represents a potentially effective method for biofilm removal and improved oral hygiene.

TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == transfer of penicillin resistance from streptococcus oralis to streptococcus pneumoniae identifies mure as resistance determinant.
AB  == beta-lactam resistant clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae contain altered penicillin-binding protein (pbp) genes and occasionally an altered murm,  presumably products of interspecies gene transfer. murm and murn are responsible  for the synthesis of branched lipid ii, substrate for the pbp catalyzed transpeptidation reaction. here we used the high-level beta-lactam resistant s. oralis uo5 as donor in transformation experiments with the sensitive laboratory strain s. pneumoniae r6 as recipient. surprisingly, piperacillin resistant transformants contained no alterations in pbp genes but carried mureuo5 encoding  the udp-n-acetylmuramyl tripeptide synthetase. codons 83-183 of mureuo5 were sufficient to confer the resistance phenotype. moreover, the promoter of mureuo5  which drives a twofold higher expression compared to that of s. pneumoniae r6 could also confer increased resistance. multiple independent transformations produced s. pneumoniae r6 derivatives containing mureuo5 , pbp2xuo5 , pbp1auo5 and pbp2buo5 , but not murmuo5 sequences; however, the resistance level of the donor strain could not be reached. s. oralis uo5 harbors an unusual murm, and murn is absent. accordingly, the peptidoglycan of s. oralis uo5 contained interpeptide bridges with one l-ala residue only. the data suggest that resistance in s. oralis uo5 is based on a complex interplay of distinct pbps and  other enzymes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis.

TI  == microbial inhibition of oral epithelial wound recovery: potential role for quorum sensing molecules?
AB  == awareness of the impact of microbiota in both health and disease is growing. using a new in vitro oral mucosa co-culture model, we recently showed a clear inhibition of epithelial wound healing in the presence of an oral microbial community. in this paper, we have used the same model in combination with specific oral microbial species to obtain a better insight into the role of the oral microbiota in wound healing. monocultures of klebsiella oxytoca and lactobacillus salivarius significantly inhibited wound healing with ~20%, whereas streptococcus mitis and s. oralis enhanced the healing process with ~15% in 24 h. yet, neither s. oralis or s. mitis were able to counteract the inhibitory effects from k. oxytoca on wound healing. other tested microbial species had no effect on wound healing. apart from this species-dependency, the inhibitory effect on wound healing depended on a microbial threshold concentration. further mechanistic experiments with k. oxytoca excluded different microbial factors and hypothesized that quorum sensing molecules might play a role in the inter-kingdom signalling during wound healing. these results are important for the development of new strategies for the management of (infected) wounds and ulcerations.

TI  == use of maldi biotyper plus clinprotools mass spectra analysis for correct identification of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis/oralis.
AB  == background: differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae from other viridans group streptococci is well known to be challenging in clinical laboratories. matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof  ms) had been reported to be a good alternative for streptococcus species level identification. however, differentiation of s. pneumoniae from other streptococcus mitis group organisms was found to be problematic using the bruker  maldi biotyper system. methods: this study used the bruker maldi biotyper system  in addition to a mass spectra model analysis generated by 10 reference strains of s. pneumoniae, 8 strains of s. mitis and 2 strains of s. oralis in the clinprotools to identify 28 clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae and 47 isolates of s. mitis/oralis. the results were compared with those generated by the maldi biotyper system alone. results: the percentages of correct species level identification using the maldi biotyper system alone and the direct transfer and  extraction method were 66.7% (50/75) and 70.7% (53/75), respectively. with the additional clinprotools mass spectra analysis, the percentages of correct identification by the direct transfer and extraction method increased to 85.3% (64/75) and 100% (75/75), respectively. this new workflow significantly improved  the accuracy of s. pneumoniae and s. mitis/oralis identification. conclusions: the additional clinprotools mass spectra analysis with extraction method after maldi biotyper identification significantly improved the accuracy of identification among s. pneumoniae, s. oralis and s. mitis. the extra 15 min processing time of spectra analysis should be affordable in most clinical laboratories. we suggest that the same approach could be further explored in handling other bacterial species with high similarities.

TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == colostrum of healthy slovenian mothers: microbiota composition and bacteriocin gene prevalence.
AB  == microbial communities inhabiting the breast milk microenvironment are essential in supporting mammary gland health in lactating women and in providing gut-colonizing bacterial 'inoculum' for their infants' gastro-intestinal development. bacterial dna was extracted from colostrum samples of 45 healthy slovenian mothers. characteristics of the communities in the samples were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) coupled with denaturing gradient gel  electrophoresis (dgge) and by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr). pcr screening for the prevalence of bacteriocin genes was performed on dna of culturable and total colostrum bacteria. dgge profiling revealed the presence of staphylococcus  and gemella in most of the samples and exposed 4 clusters based on the abundance  of 3 bands: staphylococcus epidermidis/gemella, streptococcus oralis/pneumonia and streptococcus salivarius. bacilli represented the largest proportion of the communities. high prevalence in samples at relatively low quantities was confirmed by qpcr for enterobacteria (100%), clostridia (95.6%), bacteroides-prevotella group (62.2%) and bifidobacteria (53.3%). bacterial quantities (genome equivalents ml-1) varied greatly among the samples; staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococci varied in the range of 4 logs, streptococci and all bacteria varied in the range of 2 logs, and other researched groups varied in the range of 1 log. the quantity of most bacterial groups was correlated with the amount of all bacteria. the majority of the genus staphylococcus was represented by the species staphylococcus epidermidis (on average 61%), and their abundances were linearly correlated. determinants of salivaricin a, salivaricin b, streptin and cytolysin were found in single samples. this work provides knowledge on the colostrum microbial community composition of healthy lactating slovenian mothers and reports bacteriocin gene prevalence.

TI  == functional signatures of oral dysbiosis during periodontitis progression revealed by microbial metatranscriptome analysis.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a polymicrobial biofilm-induced inflammatory disease that affects 743 million people worldwide. the current model to explain periodontitis progression proposes that changes in the relative abundance of members of the oral microbiome lead to dysbiosis in the host-microbiome crosstalk and then to inflammation and bone loss. using combined metagenome/metatranscriptome analysis of the subgingival microbiome in progressing and non-progressing sites, we have characterized the distinct molecular signatures of periodontitis progression. methods: metatranscriptome analysis was conducted on samples from subgingival biofilms from progressing and  stable sites from periodontitis patients. community-wide expression profiles were obtained using next generation sequencing (illumina). sequences were aligned using 'bowtie2' against a constructed oral microbiome database. differential expression analysis was performed using the non-parametric algorithm implemented  on the r package 'noiseqbio'. we summarized global functional activities of the oral microbial community by set enrichment analysis based on the gene ontology (go) orthology. results: gene ontology enrichment analysis showed an over-representation in the baseline of active sites of terms related to cell motility, lipid a and peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and transport of iron, potassium, and amino acids. periodontal pathogens (tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis) upregulated different tonb-dependent receptors, peptidases, proteases, aerotolerance genes, iron transport genes, hemolysins, and crispr-associated genes. surprisingly, organisms that have not been usually associated with the disease (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and pseudomonas fluorenscens) were highly active transcribing putative virulence factors. we detected patterns of activities associated with progression of clinical traits. among those we found that the profiles of expression of cobalamin biosynthesis, proteolysis, and potassium transport were associated with the evolution towards disease. conclusions: we identified metabolic changes in the microbial community associated with the initial stages of dysbiosis. regardless of the overall composition of the community, certain metabolic signatures are consistent with disease progression. our results suggest that the  whole community, and not just a handful of oral pathogens, is responsible for an  increase in virulence that leads to progression. trial registration: nct01489839, 6 december 2011.

TI  == synthesis of new carolacton derivatives and their activity against biofilms of oral bacteria.
AB  == carolacton, a secondary metabolite isolated from the extracts of sorangium cellulosum, causes membrane damage and cell death in biofilms of the caries- and  endocarditis-associated bacterium streptococcus mutans. here, we report the total synthesis of several derivatives of carolacton. all new structural modifications  introduced abolished its biological activity, including subtle ones, such as inversion of configuration at c9. however, a bicyclic bislactone derivative as well as the methyl ester of carolacton resulted in compounds with prodrug properties. their inhibitory activity on s. mutans was proven to be based on enzymatic hydrolysis by s. mutans which provided native carolacton resulting in biofilm damage in vivo. moreover, we demonstrate that carolacton acts also on s.  gordonii, s. oralis and the periodontitis pathogen aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, causing elongated cells and growth inhibition.

TI  == development and pyrosequencing analysis of an in-vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  == background: dental caries and periodontal disease are the commonest bacterial diseases of man and can result in tooth loss. the principal method of prevention  is the mechanical removal of dental plaque augmented by active agents incorporated into toothpastes and mouthrinses. in-vitro assays that include complex oral bacterial biofilms are required to accurately predict the efficacy of novel active agents in vivo. the aim of this study was to develop an oral biofilm model using the calgary biofilm device (cbd) seeded with a natural saliva inoculum and analysed by next generation sequencing. the specific objectives were to determine the reproducibility and stability of the model by comparing the composition of the biofilms over time derived from (i) the same volunteers at different time points, and (ii) different panels of volunteers. results: pyrosequencing yielded 280,093 sequences with a mean length of 432 bases after filtering. a mean of 320 and 250 otus were detected in pooled saliva and biofilm  samples, respectively. principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) plots based on community membership and structure showed that replicate biofilm samples were highly similar and clustered together. in addition, there were no significant differences between biofilms derived from the same panel at different times using analysis of molecular variance (amova). there were significant differences between biofilms from different panels (amova, p < 0.002). pcoa revealed that there was a shift in biofilm composition between seven and 14 days (amova, p < 0.001). veillonella parvula, veillonella atypica/dispar/parvula and peptostreptococcus stomatis were the predominant otus detected in seven-day biofilms, whilst prevotella oralis, v. parvula and streptococcus constellatus were predominant in 14-day biofilms. conclusions: diverse oral biofilms were successfully grown and maintained using the cbd. biofilms derived from the same panel of volunteers were highly reproducible. this model could be used to screen  both antimicrobial-containing oral care products and also novel approaches aiming to modify plaque composition, such as pre- or probiotics.

TI  == commensal streptococci serve as a reservoir for beta-lactam resistance genes in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of pneumonia, meningitis, septicemia, and middle ear infections. the incidence of s. pneumoniae isolates that are not susceptible to penicillin has risen worldwide and may be above 20% in some countries. beta-lactam antibiotic resistance in pneumococci is associated with significant sequence polymorphism in penicillin-binding proteins (pbps). commensal streptococci, especially s. mitis and s. oralis, have been identified as putative donors of mutated gene fragments. however, no studies have compared sequences of the involved pbp genes in large collections of commensal streptococci with those of s. pneumoniae. we therefore investigated the sequence  diversity of the transpeptidase region of the three pbp genes, pbp2x, pbp2b, and  pbp1a in 107, 96, and 88 susceptible and nonsusceptible strains of commensal streptococci, respectively, at the nucleotide and amino acid levels to determine  to what extent homologous recombination between commensal streptococci and s. pneumoniae plays a role in the development of beta-lactam resistance in s. pneumoniae. in contrast to pneumococci, extensive sequence variation in the transpeptidase region of pbp2x, pbp2b, and pbp1a was observed in both susceptible and nonsusceptible strains of commensal streptococci, conceivably reflecting the  genetic diversity of the many evolutionary lineages of commensal streptococci combined with the recombination events occurring with intra- and interspecies homologues. our data support the notion that resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in pneumococci is due to sequences acquired from commensal mitis group streptococci, especially s. mitis. however, several amino acid alterations  previously linked to beta-lactam resistance in pneumococci appear to represent species signatures of the donor strain rather than being causal of resistance.

TI  == periodontal therapy effects on nitrite related to oral bacteria: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: nitrite is a biological factor relevant to oral and systemic homeostasis. through an oral bacteria reduction process it was suggested that periodontal therapy and chlorhexidine rinse could impact nitrite levels leading to negative effects such as increase in blood pressure. this 6-month randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of periodontal therapeutic protocols on salivary nitrite and its relation to subgingival bacteria. methods: 90 periodontitis patients were randomly allocated to debridement procedures in 4 weekly sections (quadrant scaling-qs) or within 24 hours (full-mouth scaling-fms) in conjunction with a 60-day chlorhexidine (chx) (qs+chx and fms+chx), placebo (qs+placebo and fms+placebo), or no mouth rinse (qs+none and fms+none) use. real-time pcr determined total bacterial, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, streptococcus oralis, and actinomyces naeslundi levels. salivary nitrite concentration was determined with griess reagent. data were statistically analyzed at baseline, 3, and 6 months by anova (analysis of variance), kruskal-wallis, mann-whitney, and spearman correlation tests (p<0.05). results: nitrite concentrations did not tend to change over time. regarding chx use, there was a negative correlation between nitrite and total bacterial load at 6 months (fms+chx) and one positive correlation between p.gingivalis and nitrite at baseline (qs+chx). independently of rinse type, in the fms group nitrite negatively correlated with several microbial parameters and also with a higher percentage of deep periodontal pockets. conclusions: the relation between nitrite and bacterial levels appear weak. short-term scaling exhibited a greater influence on nitrite concentrations then the long-term chx use.

TI  == bacteria-induced intracellular signalling in platelets.
AB  == multiple studies have now shown that various species of bacteria can stimulate platelets; many in a strain and donor-dependent manner. the signalling pathways underlying this platelet activation has been the subject of scrutiny for the last decade. the best-delineated pathway is that in response to streptococcal species, such as streptococcus sanguinis (s. sanguinis), streptococcus gordonii (s. gordonii) and streptococcus oralis (s. oralis), where a pathway is initiated by the engagement of the low affinity igg receptor, fcgammariia. this leads to and involves the tyrosine kinase syk, the adaptor protein linker of activated t cells (lat) and subsequently both phospholipase cgamma2 (plcgamma2) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pi-3-k). finally, this leads to the expression of  the alphaiibbeta3 integrin, the synthesis and release of thromboxane a2 (t x a2)  and the exocytosis of pf4, each of which plays a crucial role in secondary signalling and full platelet activation. roles for other signalling pathways in streptococcal-induced platelet activation are less clear, although an adp-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, a glycoprotein ib/ix/v-mediated pathway and perhaps a complement-induced pathway have each been proposed. platelet activation by porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) at least partially shares the fcgammariia/syk/plcgamma2/pi-3-k mechanism utilised by streptococcal species. however, it has also been suggested that p. gingivalis activates platelets by two additional methods; stimulation of the protease-activated receptors leading to activation of phospholipase cbeta (plcbeta), and the engagement of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 by released lipopolysaccharide leading to an ill-defined pathway which may involve pi-3-k. consequently, it appears that bacteria can stimulate platelets by eliciting multiple signalling pathways some of which are common, and some unique, to individual species.

TI  == probiotics and their effect on oral bacteria count in children: a pilot study.
AB  == aim: to assess the effect of the daily ingestion of a mixture of probiotics on the amount of streptococcus mutans in the oral cavity of preschool-age patients with a high risk of caries. materials and methods: forty patients, aged between 4 and 6 years, with a high risk of dental caries were included in this pilot study. patients were randomly assigned to two study groups: the experimental group (a) included patients who brushed their teeth and used fluoridated toothpaste in addition to consuming probiotics daily, and the control group (b) inclused patients who brushed their teeth and used fluoridated toothpaste but did not consume probiotics. using the cariscreen, the microorganism count was determined  at different times: baseline, 7, 14, 21 and 30 days. to identify the differences  between both groups, a mann-whitney u test was performed, with a significance level of 0.05. results: it was observed that both groups showed similar microbial counts at the beginning of the trial (p>0.05), and a significant decrease in the  count at the end of the study was found in the experimental group (p<0.05) 15 days after suspending ingestion. conclusion: we found a significant reduction of  rlu values in preschool children who ingested the tested probiotics in relation to the baseline values and 15 days after ceasing consumption.

TI  == candida-streptococcal mucosal biofilms display distinct structural and virulence  characteristics depending on growth conditions and hyphal morphotypes.
AB  == candida albicans and streptococci of the mitis group form communities in multiple oral sites, where moisture and nutrient availability can change spatially or temporally. this study evaluated structural and virulence characteristics of candida-streptococcal biofilms formed on moist or semidry mucosal surfaces, and tested the effects of nutrient availability and hyphal morphotype on dual-species biofilms. three-dimensional models of the oral mucosa formed by immortalized keratinocytes on a fibroblast-embedded collagenous matrix were used. infections were carried out using streptococcus oralis strain 34, in combination with a c. albicans wild-type strain, or pseudohyphal-forming mutant strains. increased moisture promoted a homogeneous surface biofilm by c. albicans. dual biofilms had a stratified structure, with streptococci growing in close contact with the mucosa and fungi growing on the bacterial surface. under semidry conditions, candida formed localized foci of dense growth, which promoted focal growth of streptococci in mixed biofilms. candida biofilm biovolume was greater under moist conditions, albeit with minimal tissue invasion, compared with semidry conditions. supplementing the infection medium with nutrients under semidry conditions intensified growth, biofilm biovolume and tissue invasion/damage, without changing biofilm structure. under these conditions, the pseudohyphal mutants and s. oralis formed defective superficial biofilms, with most bacteria in contact with the epithelial surface, below a pseudohyphal mass, resembling biofilms growing in a moist environment. the presence of s. oralis promoted fungal invasion and tissue damage under all conditions. we conclude that moisture, nutrient availability, hyphal morphotype and the presence of commensal  bacteria influence the architecture and virulence characteristics of mucosal fungal biofilms.

TI  == environment and colonisation sequence are key parameters driving cooperation and  competition between pseudomonas aeruginosa cystic fibrosis strains and oral commensal streptococci.
AB  == cystic fibrosis (cf) patient airways harbour diverse microbial consortia that, in addition to the recognized principal pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa, include other bacteria commonly regarded as commensals. the latter include the oral (viridans) streptococci, which recent evidence indicates play an active role during infection of this environmentally diverse niche. as the interactions between inhabitants of the cf airway can potentially alter disease progression, it is important to identify key cooperators/competitors and environmental influences if therapeutic intervention is to be improved and pulmonary decline arrested. importantly, we recently showed that virulence of the p. aeruginosa liverpool epidemic strain (les) could be potentiated by the anginosus-group of streptococci (ags). in the present study we explored the relationships between other viridans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis) and the les and observed that co-culture outcome was dependent upon inoculation sequence and environment. all four streptococcal species were shown to potentiate les virulence factor production in co-culture biofilms. however, in the case of s. oralis interactions were environmentally determined; in air cooperation within a high cell density co-culture biofilm occurred together with stimulation of les virulence factor production, while in an atmosphere containing added co2 this species became a competitor antagonising les growth through hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) production, significantly altering biofilm population dynamics and appearance. streptococcus  mitis, s. gordonii and s. sanguinis were also capable of h2o2 mediated inhibition of p. aeruginosa growth, but this was only visible when inoculated as a primary coloniser prior to introduction of the les. therefore, these observations, which  are made in conditions relevant to the biology of cf disease pathogenesis, show that the pathogenic and colonisation potential of p. aeruginosa isolates can be modulated positively and negatively by the presence of oral commensal streptococci.

TI  == antibiotic therapies in maxillofacial surgery in the context of prophylaxis.
AB  == objectives: there is no single pattern for preventive action as to the duration and type of antibiotic therapy in maxillofacial surgery. in these circumstances,  it appears reasonable to set relevant standards for prophylactic procedures after such surgeries. methods: retrospective analysis of bacteriological tests has been carried out as well as a susceptibility evaluation of cultured bacterial and fungal strains to antibiotics over a five-year period in subjects treated at the  cranio-maxillo-facial clinic in katowice. a total of 726 bacterial and fungal strains were cultured in 484 patients (200 women and 284 males). the age of the patients was 40.2 on average. results: the most frequent bacteria isolated from the patients were gram-positive 541 (74.5%). gram-negative bacteria were present  in 177 (24.4%) cases. fungi of the candida genus were isolated in eight cases (1.1%). conclusions: the most often isolated bacteria were streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis, whose number has grown over the last two years. empiric therapies should be based on ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. it has been observed that all the gram-positive bacteria are becoming more resistant to all antibiotics. ampicillin and imipenem were antibiotics with the steepest resistance reduction while vancomycin showed the lowest resistance drop.

TI  == isolation of alkaline-tolerant bacteria from primary infected root canals.
AB  == introduction: alkaline-tolerant bacteria in primary infected root canals could have enhanced survival capacity against antimicrobials commonly used in root canal treatment. the aims of this study were to isolate and characterize alkaline-tolerant bacteria before endodontic treatment (s1), after chemomechanical root canal preparation (s2), and after calcium hydroxide dressing (s3). methods: bacteriologic samples were obtained from 43 primary infected root  canals. samples were inoculated into culture media at a ph of 9 and incubated anaerobically. the identities of bacterial isolates were determined by 16s ribosomal rna sequencing. results: all s1 samples were culture positive, with 70% harboring bacteria tolerating a ph of 9. gram-positive bacteria pseudoramibacter  alactolyticus and streptococcus spp were the most frequently isolated strains with a prevalence of 54%. of 13 culture-positive s2 samples, 8 isolates tolerated a ph of 9, namely streptococcus sanguinis, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cancerogenus, streptococcus oralis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. seven of these 8 isolates (88%) were correspondingly isolated at s1. all 3 culture-positive s3 samples tolerated a ph of 9, namely s. sanguinis and e. faecalis, which were also isolated in the corresponding s1 and s2 samples. conclusions: we showed that the  presence of alkaline-tolerant streptococcus and enterococcus spp in primary infected root canals could lead to their persistence during and after root canal  treatment and could pose a challenge to current treatment efficacy.

AB  == phim46.1 - streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(a) and tet(o), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (m phenotype) and tetracycline -  is widespread in s. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among s. pyogenes isolates, but no information  is available about its transferability to other streptococcus species. we thus investigated phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of  different streptococcus species. transductants were obtained from recipients of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus suis. retransfer was always achieved, and from s. suis to s. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. in transductants phim46.1  retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin c, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. the transductants shared the same phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved rna uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. no transfer occurred to recipients of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. a largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in s. suis. the s. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene  atl.

TI  == comparison of species identification of endocarditis associated viridans streptococci using rnpb genotyping and 2 maldi-tof systems.
AB  == streptococcus spp. are important causes of infective endocarditis but challenging in species identification. this study compared identification based on sequence determination of the rnpb gene with 2 systems of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, maldi biotyper (bruker) and vitek ms ivd (biomerieux). blood culture isolates of viridans streptococci from 63 patients with infective endocarditis were tested. the 3 methods showed full agreement for all 36 isolates identified in the anginosus, bovis, and mutans groups or identified as streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, or streptococcus sanguinis. none of the methods could reliably identify the 23 isolates to the species level when designated as streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, or streptococcus tigurinus. in 7 isolates classified to the mitis group, the rnpb sequences deviated strikingly from all reference sequences, and additional analysis of soda and groel genes indicated the occurrence of yet unidentified streptococcus spp.

TI  == antimicrobial photodynamic therapy suppresses dental plaque formation in healthy  adults: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: oral care is important for oral and systemic health, especially for elderly institutionalized individuals and compromised patients. however, conventional mechanical plaque control is often difficult for these patients because of the pain or the risk of aspiration. although antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt), which is considered an alternative or adjunct to mechanical approaches, has potential application as a less stressful method of daily plaque control, no clinical application of this technique has been reported. methods: we investigated the inhibitory effect of a combination of toluidine blue o (tbo), and a red light-emitting diode (led) on dental plaque formation in healthy volunteers. the optimal concentration of tbo was determined  in preliminary in vitro experiments to evaluate the bactericidal effect of apdt on streptococcus oralis and to clarify its safety in fibroblast cells. to survey  the mechanism of tbo-mediated apdt, the quality and quantity of reactive oxygen species (ros) generated during apdt were also examined using electron spin resonance (esr) spectroscopy. subsequently, the inhibitory effect of apdt on dental plaque formation was investigated in eleven subjects as a clinical pilot study. the right or left mandibular premolars were randomly assigned to the treatment (with apdt) or control (without apdt) groups. in total, apdt was applied six times (twice per day) to the teeth in the test group over a period of four days. on the fourth day, the study concluded and the analyses were performed. results: a combination of 500 or 1000 mug/ml tbo and led irradiation for 20 s significantly decreased the number of colony forming units of streptococcus oralis. the cytotoxicity of apdt was comparable to that of standard antiseptics used in the oral cavity. hydroxyl radicals were detected by esr analysis, but singlet oxygen was not. a randomized controlled trial demonstrated  that apdt with 1000 mug/ml tbo and red led irradiation significantly suppressed dental plaque formation without harming teeth or the surrounding tissues. conclusions: apdt has the potential to be a promising novel technical modality for dental plaque control. trial registration: this trial was registered with university hospital medical information network clinical trials registry (number  umin000012504).

TI  == the novel species streptococcus tigurinus and its association with oral infection.
AB  == streptococcus tigurinus is a novel species of viridans streptococci, shown to cause severe invasive infections such as infective endocarditis, spondylodiscitis and meningitis. s. tigurinus belongs to the streptococcus mitis group and is most closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and streptococcus infantis. the presence of s. tigurinus in the human oral cavity has been documented, including  in patients with periodontal disease. this review addresses the available scientific knowledge on s. tigurinus and its association with closely related streptococci, and discusses its putative involvement in common oral infections. while there is as yet no strong evidence on the involvement of s. tigurinus with  oral infections, its presence in the oral cavity and its association with endocarditis warrants special attention for a link between oral and systemic infection.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of different filling pastes for deciduous tooth treatment.
AB  == guedes-pinto paste is the filling material most employed in brazil for endodontic treatment of deciduous teeth; however, the rifocort(r) ointment has been removed. thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of filling pastes, by proposing three new pharmacological associations to replace rifocort(r) ointment with drugs of already established antimicrobial power: nebacetin(r) ointment, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel, and maxitrol(r) ointment.  a paste composed of iodoform, rifocort(r) ointment and camphorated paramonochlorophenol (cpc) was employed as the gold standard (g1). the other associations were: iodoform, nebacetin(r) ointment and cpc (g2); iodoform, 2% chlorhexidine digluconate gel and cpc (g3); iodoform, maxitrol(r) ointment and cpc (g4). the associations were tested for staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus oralis (s. oralis), enterococcus  faecalis (e. faecalis), escherichia coli (e. coli), and bacillus subtilis (b. subtilis), using the methods of dilution on solid medium - orifice agar - and broth dilution. the results were tested using statistical analysis anova and kruskal-wallis. they showed that all the pastes had a bacteriostatic effect on all the microorganisms, without any statistically significant difference, compared with g1. s. aureus was statistically significant (multiple comparison test of tukey), insofar as g2 and g3 presented the worst and the best performance, respectively. all associations were bactericidal for e. coli, s. aureus, s. mutans and s. oralis. only g3 and g4 were bactericidal for e. faecalis, whereas no product was bactericidal for b. subtilis. thus, the tested pastes have antimicrobial potential and have proved acceptable for endodontic treatment of primary teeth.

TI  == identification of proteins in streptococcus pneumoniae by reverse vaccinology and genetic diversity of these proteins in clinical isolates.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. virulence-associated proteins common and conserved among all capsular types now represent the best strategy to combat pneumococcal infections. our aim was to identify conserved targets in pneumococci that showed positive prediction for lipoprotein and extracellular subcellular location using bioinformatics programs  and verify the distribution and the degree of conservation of these targets in pneumococci. these targets can be considered potential vaccine candidate to be evaluated in the future. a set of 13 targets were analyzed and confirmed the presence in all pneumococci tested. these 13 genes were highly conserved showing  around >96 % of amino acid and nucleotide identity, but they were also present and show high identity in the closely related species streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. s. oralis clusters away from s. pneumoniae, while s. pseudopneumoniae and s. mitis cluster closer. the divergence between the selected targets was too small to be observed consistently in phylogenetic groups between the analyzed genomes of s. pneumoniae. the proteins analyzed fulfill two of the initial criteria of a vaccine candidate: targets are present in a variety of different pneumococci strains including different serotypes and are conserved among the samples evaluated.

TI  == a yada-like autotransporter, hag1 in veillonella atypica is a multivalent hemagglutinin involved in adherence to oral streptococci, porphyromonas gingivalis, and human oral buccal cells.
AB  == dental biofilm development is a sequential process, and adherence between microbes and the salivary pellicle (adhesion) as well as among different microbes (co-adhesion or coaggregation) plays a critical role in building a biofilm community. the veillonella species are among the most predominant species in the  oral cavity and coaggregate with many initial, early, middle, and late colonizers. similar to oral fusobacteria, they are also considered bridging species in biofilm development. however, the mechanism of this ability has yet to be reported, due to the previous lack of a genetic transformation system in the entire genus. in this study, we used our recently discovered transformable veillonella strain, veillonella atypica ok5, to probe the mechanism of coaggregation between veillonella species and other oral bacteria. by insertional inactivation of all eight putative hemagglutinin genes, we identified one gene, hag1, which is involved in v. atypica coaggregation with the initial colonizers streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus cristatus, and the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. the hag1 mutant also abolished adherence to human buccal cells. inhibition assays using various chemical or physiological treatments suggest different mechanisms being involved in coaggregation with different partners. the entire hag1 gene was sequenced and shown to be the largest known bacterial hemagglutinin gene.

TI  == infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking: a systematic review of reported cases: management, visual outcome, and treatment proposed.
AB  == abstract aim: to describe the infectious complications and the group of pathogens involved in the infection following corneal crosslinking, the visual outcome, and the treatment proposed. methods: a medline (national library of medicine, bethesda, md, usa) search from october 2000 to october 2013 was performed to identify all articles describing infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking treatment. nineteen articles were selected. ten articles reported infectious complications of corneal crosslinking treatment were included. nine articles were excluded, because seven described sterile keratitis, one article was in german, and one reported general complication without describing the infection complication. results: a total number of infections reported included 10 eyes. the infectious keratitis was associated with bacteria in five eyes (50%): gram-positive bacteria in three eyes (30%) (staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus and streptococcus salivarius plus s. oralis, respectively) and gram-negative bacteria in two eyes (20%) (e. coli; p. aeruginosa); there was herpes virus in two eyes, fungus in two eyes (fusarium and microsporidia) (20%),  and acanthamoeba in one eye (10%). conclusions: only 10 cases of infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking are published. the most virulent pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa and acanthamoeba. less virulent organisms were escherichia coli and s. epidermidis. two cases of herpes keratitis were described, suggesting the possibility of systemic antiviral prophylaxis before corneal crosslinking treatment. the most common risk factor of infections identified was postoperative incorrect patient behavior.

TI  == frosted branch angiitis in an octogenarian with infective endocarditis.
AB  == purpose: to present the difficulties in diagnosing frosted branch angiitis (fba)  in an elderly person, and to present the likely immunogenic association of fba with alpha-hemolytic streptococci. methods: thorough review of the medical records of an 80-year-old white man diagnosed with fba. patient consent was obtained before the writing of this article. results: our patient presented with  1 week of decreasing vision and floaters in his right eye and 3 days of floaters  in his left eye. significant medical history included a prosthetic mitral valve.  notable features on examination were bilateral retinal vascular sheathing, with retinal edema and hemorrhage. preliminary investigations-including a transoesophageal echocardiogram-did not reveal intraocular or systemic infection, autoimmune disease, or underlying malignancy. idiopathic fba was unlikely given that the majority of cases had been documented in middle-aged japanese populations. thus, we chose to treat our patient empirically for common causes of retinal vasculitis such as viral retinitis. interestingly, 2 weeks after the diagnosis of fba, our patient became febrile. he was subsequently diagnosed with  infective endocarditis and commenced on intravenous vancomycin (penicillin allergy). review of his transoesophageal echocardiogram found an oscillating lesion that had been initially missed. therefore, it is likely that our patient had blood culture-negative endocarditis at the time of presentation. this was further supported by the regression of his ocular disease with intravenous vancomycin. conclusion: we hypothesize that our patient developed fba as an immunogenic response to streptococcus viridans and streptococcus oralis infection. previous associations between streptococci and fba have been made. notably, beta-hemolytic streptococcal antigens are known to cross-react with retinal antigens. however, the implicated pathogens in our patient were alpha-hemolytic. alpha-hemolytic streptococcal endophthalmitis has been linked to frosted branch response before, but it has never been associated with fba through an immunogenic pathway. therefore, it is important to note that idiopathic fba can be associated with infective endocarditis and alpha-hemolytic streptococcal infections. furthermore, fba in elderly patients needs thorough evaluation to rule out systemic causes.

TI  == proteomic and transcriptional analysis of interaction between oral microbiota porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus oralis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, a major periodontal pathogen, forms biofilm with other  oral bacteria such as streptococci. here, by using shotgun proteomics, we examined the molecular basis of mixed-biofilm formation by p. gingivalis with streptococcus oralis. we identified a total of 593 bacterial proteins in the biofilm. compared to the expression profile in the p. gingivalis monobiofilm, the expression of three proteins was induced and that of 31 proteins was suppressed in the mixed biofilm. additionally, the expression of two s. oralis proteins was  increased, while that of two proteins was decreased in the mixed biofilm, as compared to its monotypic profile. mrna expression analysis of selected genes using a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed the proteomics data, which included overexpression of p. gingivalis fima and s. oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in association with the biofilm.  the results also indicated that s. oralis regulates the transcriptional activity  of p. gingivalis luxs to influence autoinducer-2-dependent signaling. these findings suggest that several functional molecules are involved in biofilm formation between p. gingivalis and s. oralis.

TI  == subgingival microbiome in smokers and non-smokers in korean chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == smoking is a major environmental factor associated with periodontal diseases. however, we still have a very limited understanding of the relationship between smoking and subgingival microflora in the global population. here, we investigated the composition of subgingival bacterial communities from the pooled plaque samples of smokers and non-smokers, 134 samples in each group, in korean patients with moderate chronic periodontitis using 16s rrna gene-based pyrosequencing. a total of 17,927 reads were analyzed and classified into 12 phyla, 126 genera, and 394 species. differences in bacterial communities between  smokers and non-smokers were examined at all phylogenetic levels. the genera fusobacterium, fretibacterium, streptococcus, veillonella, corynebacterium, tm7,  and filifactor were abundant in smokers. on the other hand, prevotella, campylobacter, aggregatibacter, veillonellaceae gq422718, haemophilus, and prevotellaceae were less abundant in smokers. among species-level taxa occupying  > 1% of whole subgingival microbiome of smokers, higher abundance (>/= 2.0-fold compared to non-smokers) of seven species or operational taxonomic units (otus) was found: fusobacterium nucleatum, neisseria sicca, neisseria oralis, corynebacterium matruchotii, veillonella dispar, filifactor alocis, and fretibacterium ay349371. on the other hand, lower abundance of 11 species or otus was found in smokers: neisseria elongata, six prevotella species or otus, fusobacterium canifelinum, aggregatibacter am420165, selenomonas otu, and veillonellaceae gu470897. species richness and evenness were similar between the  groups whereas diversity was greater in smokers than non-smokers. collectively, the results of the present study indicate that differences exist in the subgingival bacterial community between smoker and non-smoker patients with chronic moderate periodontitis in korea, suggesting that cigarette smoking considerably affects subgingival bacterial ecology.

AB  == introduction: newer disinfection strategies based on antibacterial nanoparticles  and photodynamic therapy (pdt) aim to eliminate residual biofilm bacteria during  root canal treatment. the aim of the current study was to test the newly developed rose bengal-functionalized chitosan nanoparticles (csrbnps) for their interaction/uptake with monospecies bacteria/biofilm and assess their antibiofilm efficacy on a multispecies biofilm model in vitro. methods: the interaction of csrbnps with bacterial cells was conducted using atomic force microscopy. their membrane-damaging effect was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (od260nm) using enterococcus faecalis. the penetration of csrbnps into e. faecalis biofilms was evaluated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm).  multispecies biofilms of streptococcus oralis, prevotella intermedia, and actinomyces naeslundii were grown on dentin sections for 21 days to assess the antibiofilm efficacy. the biofilms were subjected to pdt (60 j/cm(2)) using csrbnps and rose bengal. the treated/untreated biofilms were examined under scanning electron microscopy and clsm. results: the csrbnps synthesized were 60 +/- 20 nm and showed absorption spectra similar to rose bengal. atomic force microscopy showed adherence of csrbnps to bacteria, roughening of cell surface, and cell disruption after pdt. csrbnp treatment resulted in significantly increased bacterial membrane damage (p < .05). csrbnps exhibited deeper penetration into the biofilm structure. scanning electron microscopy and clsm confirmed the complete disruption of multispecies biofilm with a reduction in viable bacteria and biofilm thickness (p < .05). conclusions: these novel photosensitizer functionalized bioactive nanoparticles with increased affinity to bacterial cell membrane, higher penetration into biofilm structure, and enhanced  ability to eliminate clinically relevant multispecies bacterial biofilm present a potential antibiofilm agent for root canal disinfection.

TI  == plasma components and platelet activation are essential for the antimicrobial properties of autologous platelet-rich plasma: an in vitro study.
AB  == autologous platelet concentrates are successfully adopted in a variety of medical fields to stimulate bone and soft tissue regeneration. the rationale for their use consists in the delivery of a wide range of platelet-derived bioactive molecules that promotes wound healing. in addition, antimicrobial properties of platelet concentrates have been pointed out. in this study, the effect of the platelet concentration, of the activation step and of the presence of plasmatic components on the antimicrobial activity of pure platelet-rich plasma was investigated against gram positive bacteria isolated from oral cavity. the antibacterial activity, evaluated as the minimum inhibitory concentration, was determined through the microdilution two-fold serial method. results seem to suggest that the antimicrobial activity of platelet-rich plasma against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus oralis and staphylococcus aureus is sustained by a co-operation between plasma components and platelet-derived factors and that the activation of coagulation is a fundamental step. the findings of this study may have practical implications in the modality of application of platelet concentrates.

AB  == polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. this study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in pcos, compared to systemic health. a total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with pcos and healthy periodontium, 35 women with pcos and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically  healthy women with gingivitis. salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by elisa. in women with pcos, salivary porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis and tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women,  particularly in the case of gingivitis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. the presence of pcos  also enhanced p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and s. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in pcos. the presence of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. in conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, pcos may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. the most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on p. gingivalis.

TI  == experimental amine-epoxide sealer: a physicochemical study in comparison with ah  plus and easyseal.
AB  == aim: to compare selected physicochemical and biological properties of an experimental sealer with those of two commercially available sealers. methodology: ah plus and easyseal were used as model materials for commercially available amine-epoxide sealers. they were mixed as stated by the manufacturer. the two components of experimental sealer evoseal a were mixed 1 : 1 vol%. the setting time was determined in two different ways: first, by setting of sealers in a temperature- and moisture-controlled environment followed by testing with a  gilmore needle and secondly, by oscillating measurements of setting behaviour using a rheometer. differential scanning calorimetry (dsc) of the sealer was performed for comparison of thermal properties. flow and film thickness were determined by applying pressures of 100 g and 15.3 kg, respectively, on the materials between two glass plates and measuring the diameters of the compressed  sealer and the thickness with a micrometer gauge. solubility of set materials was conducted by layering the samples with water, storing in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment and evaporating the solvent. the solved sealer parts were then weighed. the radiopacity was measured in an x-ray experiment comparing radiopacity of a cured sealer to an aluminium step wedge. volume shrinkage was defined by measuring the densities of samples before and after setting. the film thickness, fluidity, curing time, radiopacity and solubility of the test materials were performed as specified in din en iso 6876:2010 draft. the volume shrinkage was determined in a method adapted from standard din 13907:2007-01. antibacterial activity was tested against gram-positive streptococcus oralis cultures in a contact test based on standard iso 22196:2011  (e). statistical analysis was performed using mann-whitney u-test where applicable. significant differences were determined with p < 0.05. results: the experimental sealer, evoseal a, reached standard specifications. in terms of film thickness, the highest value was measured for evoseal a with a film thickness of  27 mum, comparing to 6 mum for easyseal (p </= 0.001) and 8 mum for ah plus (p </= 0.001). comparing the flow, all values corresponded to easyseal with a diameter of 17.3 mm. the only significant difference was determined for ah plus compared to evoseal a (p = 0.0353). volume shrinkage of evoseal a was 48% smaller compared to easyseal and approximately 20% lower compared to ah plus. the shortest curing time was determined for evoseal a (3.0 h) followed by easyseal (4.1 h) and ah plus (24 h). for all groups, significant differences were observed (p </= 0.001). evoseal a had a significantly higher radiopacity than easyseal (p  </= 0.001) but significantly lower values than ah plus (p </= 0.001). the solubility of ah plus and evoseal a was <0.5% (p = 0.2435). compared to easyseal  with a solubility of 2.7%, significant differences were observed (p </= 0.02). three weeks after setting, easyseal and evoseal a still had an antibacterial effect against s. oralis in contrast to ah plus. in this respect, comparing ah plus with evoseal a and easyseal, respectively, significant differences were observed (p </= 0.001). no significant differences between easyseal with evoseal  a (p = 0.540) were determined. conclusions: the physical and chemical properties  of the experimental sealer evoseal a were comparable to the two commercially established sealers easyseal and ah plus.

TI  == an in vitro biofilm model associated to dental implants: structural and quantitative analysis of in vitro biofilm formation on different dental implant surfaces.
AB  == objectives: the impact of implant surfaces in dental biofilm development is presently unknown. the aim of this investigation was to assess in vitro the development of a complex biofilm model on titanium and zirconium implant surfaces, and to compare it with the same biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite surface. methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop an in vitro biofilm over sterile titanium, zirconium and hydroxyapatite discs, coated with saliva within the wells of pre-sterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates. the  selected species used represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the developed biofilms (growth time 1 to 120h) were studied with confocal laser scanning microscopy using a vital fluorescence technique and with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. the number (colony forming units/biofilm) and kinetics of the bacteria within the biofilm were studied with quantitative pcr (qpcr). as outcome variables, the biofilm thickness, the percentage of cell vitality and the number of bacteria were compared using the analysis of variance. results: the bacteria adhered and matured within the biofilm over the three surfaces with similar dynamics. different surfaces, however, demonstrated differences both in the thickness, deposition of the extracellular polysaccharide matrix as well as in the organization of the bacterial cells. significance: while the formation and dynamics of an in vitro biofilm model was similar irrespective of the surface of  inoculation (hydroxyapatite, titanium or zirconium), there were significant differences in regards to the biofilm thickness and three-dimensional structure.

TI  == probing of microbial biofilm communities for coadhesion partners.
AB  == investigations of interbacterial adhesion in dental plaque development are currently limited by the lack of a convenient assay to screen the multitude of species present in oral biofilms. to overcome this limitation, we developed a solid-phase fluorescence-based screening method to detect and identify coadhesive partner organisms in mixed-species biofilms. the applicability of this method was demonstrated using coaggregating strains of type 2 fimbrial adhesin-bearing actinomyces and receptor polysaccharide (rps)-bearing streptococci. specific adhesin/receptor-mediated coadhesion was detected by overlaying bacterial strains immobilized to a nitrocellulose membrane with a suspended, fluorescein-labeled bacterial partner strain. coadhesion was comparable regardless of which cell type was labeled and which was immobilized. formaldehyde treatment of bacteria, either in suspension or immobilized on nitrocellulose, abolished actinomyces type 2 fimbrial adhesin but not streptococcal rps function, thereby providing a simple method for assigning complementary adhesins and glycan receptors to members of a  coadhering pair. the method's broader applicability was shown by overlaying colony lifts of dental plaque biofilm cultures with fluorescein-labeled strains of type 2 fimbriated actinomyces naeslundii or rps-bearing streptococcus oralis.  prominent coadhesion partners included not only streptococci and actinomyces, as  expected, but also other bacteria not identified in previous coaggregation studies, such as adhesin- or receptor-bearing strains of neisseria pharyngitis, rothia dentocariosa, and kingella oralis. the ability to comprehensively screen complex microbial communities for coadhesion partners of specific microorganisms  opens a new approach in studies of dental plaque and other mixed-species biofilms.

AB  == in this work, a new approach is proposed to verify the differentiating characteristics of five bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, and staphylococcus aureus) by using digital images obtained with a simple webcam and variable selection by the  successive projections algorithm associated with linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda). in this sense, color histograms in the red-green-blue (rgb), hue-saturation-value (hsv), and grayscale channels and their combinations were used as input data, and statistically evaluated by using different multivariate classifiers (soft independent modeling by class analogy (simca), principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis (pca-lda), partial least squares  discriminant analysis (pls-da) and successive projections algorithm-linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda)). the bacteria strains were cultivated in a nutritive blood agar base layer for 24 h by following the brazilian pharmacopoeia, maintaining the status of cell growth and the nature of nutrient solutions under the same conditions. the best result in classification was obtained by using rgb and spa-lda, which reached 94 and 100 % of classification accuracy in the training and test sets, respectively. this result is extremely positive from the viewpoint of routine clinical analyses, because it avoids bacterial identification based on phenotypic identification of the causative organism using gram staining, culture, and biochemical proofs. therefore, the proposed method presents inherent advantages, promoting a simpler, faster, and low-cost alternative for bacterial identification.

TI  == streptococcus mitis/oralis endophthalmitis management without phakic intraocular  lens removal in patient with iris-fixated phakic intraocular lens implantation.
AB  == background: to report a case of streptococcus mitis/oralis endophthalmitis management which had developed after complicated iris-fixated phakic intraocular  (piol) lens implantation. case presentation: a 23-year-old-woman received piol implantation followed secondary intraocular intervention to lower intraocular pressure. the patient presented with severe pain and decreased visual acuity and  was managed with intravitreal and intracameral antibiotic injection with topical  applications of fortified antibiotics. culture of aqueous humor was positive for  s. mitis/oralis, which was sensitive to the empiric antibiotic regimen. clinical  features started to improve 5 days after treatment and the piol was left in place. the uncorrected distant visual acuity and endothelial cell count were 20/32 and 3143 cells/mm2 four weeks after treatment, respectively. conclusion: s. mitis/oralis endophthalmitis after piol implantation could be managed with appropriate antibiotic administration without piol removal if accompanied by rapid clinical improvement after the initial intensive management in the absence  of vitreous involvement.

TI  == chemical structures of streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide type 39 (cps39), cps47f, and cps34 characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and their relation to cps10a.
AB  == structural characterization of streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides  (cps) is a prerequisite for unraveling both antigenic and genetic relationships that exist between different serotypes. in the current study, comparative structural studies of s. pneumoniae cps serogroup 10 (cps10) were extended to include genetically related s. pneumoniae cps34, cps39, and cps47f. high-resolution heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy confirmed the published structure of cps34 and, in conjunction with glycosyl composition analyses, revealed the following repeat unit structures of the other  serotypes, which have not been previously characterized: [structure: see text] common and unique structural features of these polysaccharides, including different positions of o-acetylation, were unambiguously associated with specific genes in each corresponding cps locus. the only exception involved the gene designated wcrc, which is associated with the alpha1-2 transfer of gal pyranoside (galp) to ribitol-5-phosphate in the synthesis of cps10a, cps47f, and cps34 but with alpha1-1 transfer of gal to ribitol-5-phosphate in the synthesis of cps39. the corresponding gene in the cps39 locus, although related to wcrc, more closely resembled a previously identified gene (i.e., wefm) of streptococcus oralis that  is associated with alpha1-1 transfer of galp to ribitol-5-phosphate. these and other recent findings identify linkages from alpha-galp to ribitol-5-phosphate and from this residue to adjacent gal furanoside (galf) as important sites of cps structural and genetic diversity.

TI  == neuraminidase-producing oral mitis group streptococci potentially contribute to influenza viral infection and reduction in antiviral efficacy of zanamivir.
AB  == influenza is a serious respiratory disease among immunocompromised individuals, such as the elderly, and its prevention is an urgent social issue. influenza viruses rely on neuraminidase (na) activity to release progeny viruses from infected cells and spreading the infection. na is, therefore, an important target of anti-influenza drugs. a causal relationship between bacteria and influenza virus infection has not yet been established, however, a positive correlation between them has been reported. thus, in this study, we examined the biological effects of oral mitis group streptococci, which are predominant constituents of human oral florae, on the release of influenza viruses. among them, streptococcus oralis atcc 10557 and streptococcus mitis atcc 6249 were found to exhibit na activity and their culture supernatants promoted the release of influenza virus and cell-to-cell spread of the infection. in addition, culture supernatants of these na-producing oral bacteria increased viral m1 protein expression levels and cellular erk activation. these effects were not observed with culture supernatants of streptococcus sanguinis atcc 10556 which lacks the ability to produce na. although the na inhibitor zanamivir suppressed the release of progeny viruses from the infected cells, the viral release was restored upon the addition of culture supernatants of na-producing s. oralis atcc 10557 or s. mitis atcc 6249. these findings suggest that an increase in the number of na-producing oral  bacteria could elevate the risk of and exacerbate the influenza infection, hampering the efficacy of viral na inhibitor drugs.

TI  == the effect of dentifrice abrasion on denture topography and the subsequent retention of microorganisms on abraded surfaces.
AB  == statement of problem: denture surfaces provide hard nonshedding niches for the adhesion and subsequent accumulation of oral microorganisms into denture plaque,  which can harbor various potential pathogens linked with oral mucosal lesions and inhalation pneumonia. the initial adhesion is the prerequisite for subsequent biofilm growth, and surface roughness niches facilitate this process by trapping  cells. retained microorganisms are then able to proliferate when the denture is returned to the oral cavity. purpose: the purpose of this study was to measure the amount and strength of the attachment of microorganisms to a roughened denture acrylic resin surface. an increase in surface roughness increases the retention of microorganisms and a greater amount of cell-surface contact interface may increase the strength of adhesion and, therefore, retention. cleaning denture surfaces with brushes and dentifrices can influence the denture  surface topography and, therefore, may affect retention. material and methods: denture acrylic resin specimens were abraded to provide different surface roughness. the amount of attachment of streptococcus oralis or candida albicans to these surfaces was assessed by measuring the area of a microscopic field covered by stained cells after 1 hour of incubation. the strength of attachment was assessed with atomic force microscopy, whereby an increasing force was applied to the attached cells until they detached from the surface. results: both bacteria and yeast cells were retained in increasing amounts on surfaces of increasing roughness. cells were most strongly attached on surfaces whose linear  features (scratches) were of comparable size with the cells (the streptococci on  the low-abraded surfaces, and the yeast on high-abraded surfaces). conclusion: analysis of findings reveal that even small abrasions may enhance retention on denture surfaces and reduce surface cleanability. the strength of attachment instead of the amount is more important in terms of surface hygiene.

TI  == isolation of streptococcus tigurinus - a novel member of streptococcus mitis group from a case of periodontitis.
AB  == streptococcus tigurinus is a new member of the streptococcus viridians group and  is closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus infantis. the type strain az_3a(t) of s. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. accurate identification of s. tigurinus is facilitated only by newer molecular methods like 16s rrna gene analysis. during the course of study on bacteraemia and infective endocarditis with reference to periodontitis and viridians group of streptococci, a strain of s. tigurinus isolated from subgingival plaque of a patient with periodontitis identified by 16s rrna gene analysis, which was originally identified as streptococcus pluranimalium by vitek 2. confirmation by 16s rrna gene analysis showed 99.39% similarity (1476/1485 bp) with s. tigurinus az_3a(t) (aoru01000002). to the best  of our knowledge, this is the first report of isolation of s. tigurinus from the  oral cavity of a periodontitis patient.

TI  == adherence of human oral keratinocytes and gingival fibroblasts to nano-structured titanium surfaces.
AB  == background: a key element for long-term success of dental implants is integration of the implant surface with the surrounding host tissues. modification of titanium implant surfaces can enhance osteoblast activity but their effects on soft-tissue cells are unclear. adherence of human keratinocytes and gingival fibroblasts to control commercially pure titanium (cpti) and two surfaces prepared by anodic oxidation was therefore investigated. since implant abutments  are exposed to a bacteria-rich environment in vivo, the effect of oral bacteria on keratinocyte adhesion was also evaluated. methods: the surfaces were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (sem). the number of adhered cells and binding strength, as well as vitality of fibroblasts and keratinocytes  were evaluated using confocal scanning laser microscopy after staining with live/dead baclight. to evaluate the effect of bacteria on adherence and vitality, keratinocytes were co-cultured with a four-species streptococcal consortium. results: sem analysis showed the two anodically oxidized surfaces to be nano-structured with differing degrees of pore-density. over 24 hours, both fibroblasts and keratinocytes adhered well to the nano-structured surfaces, although to a somewhat lesser degree than to cpti (range 42-89% of the levels on  cpti). the strength of keratinocyte adhesion was greater than that of the fibroblasts but no differences in adhesion strength could be observed between the two nano-structured surfaces and the cpti. the consortium of commensal streptococci markedly reduced keratinocyte adherence on all the surfaces as well  as compromising membrane integrity of the adhered cells. conclusion: both the vitality and level of adherence of soft-tissue cells to the nano-structured surfaces was similar to that on cpti. co-culture with streptococci reduced the number of keratinocytes on all the surfaces to approximately the same level and caused cell damage, suggesting that commensal bacteria could affect adherence of  soft-tissue cells to abutment surfaces in vivo.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == a comparative study of the effect of probiotics on cariogenic biofilm model for preventing dental caries.
AB  == dental caries is induced by oral biofilm containing streptococcus mutans. probiotic bacteria were mainly studied for effect on the gastrointestinal tract and have been known to promote human health. however, the information of probiotics for oral health has been lack yet. in this study, we investigated influence of various probiotics on oral bacteria or cariogenic biofilm and evaluated candidate probiotics for dental caries among them. the antimicrobial activity of the spent culture medium of probiotics for oral streptococci was performed. probiotics were added during the biofilm formation with salivary bacteria including s. mutans. the oral biofilms were stained with a fluorescent dye and observed using the confocal laser scanning microscope. to count bacteria  in the biofilm, the bacteria were plated on msb and bhi agar plates after disrupting the biofilm and cultivated. glucosyltransferases (gtfs) expression of  s. mutans and integration of lactobacilli into the biofilm were evaluated by real-time rt-pcr. among probiotics, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited growth of oral streptococci. moreover, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited formation of cariogenic biofilm model. the expression of gtfs was significantly reduced by lactobacillus rhamnosus. the integration of l. rhamnosus into the biofilm model did not exhibit. however, l. acidophilus and l casei integrated into the biofilm model. these results suggest that l. rhamnosus may inhibit oral  biofilm formation by decreasing glucan production of s. mutans and antibacterial  activity and did not integrate into oral biofilm, which can be a candidate for caries prevention strategy.

TI  == gyrb polymorphisms accurately assign invasive viridans group streptococcal species.
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are a heterogeneous group of medically important bacteria that cannot be accurately assigned to a particular species using conventional phenotypic methods. although multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) is considered the gold standard for vgs species-level identification, mlsa is not yet feasible in the clinical setting. conversely, molecular methods, such  as soda and 16s rrna gene sequencing, are clinically practical but not sufficiently accurate for vgs species-level identification. here, we present data regarding the use of an approximately 400-nucleotide internal fragment of the gene encoding dna gyrase subunit b (gyrb) for vgs species-level identification. mlsa, internal gyrb, soda, full-length, and 5' 16s gene sequences were used to characterize 102 unique vgs blood isolates collected from 2011 to 2012. when using the mlsa species assignment as a reference, full-length and 5' partial 16s  gene and soda sequence analyses failed to correctly assign all strains to a species. precise species determination was particularly problematic for streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis isolates. however, the internal gyrb fragment allowed for accurate species designations for all 102 strains. we validated these findings using 54 vgs strains for which mlsa, 16s gene, soda, and gyrb data are available at the ncbi, showing that gyrb is superior to 16s gene and soda sequence analyses for vgs species identification. we also observed that  specific polymorphisms in the 133-amino acid sequence of the internal gyrb fragment can be used to identify invasive vgs species. thus, the gyrb amino acid  sequence may offer a more practical and accurate method for classifying invasive  vgs strains to the species level.

TI  == crystalline anatase-rich titanium can reduce adherence of oral streptococci.
AB  == dental implant abutments that emerge through the mucosa are rapidly covered with  a salivary protein pellicle to which bacteria bind, initiating biofilm formation. in this study, adherence of early colonizing streptococci, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguinis to two saliva-coated anodically oxidized surfaces was compared with that on commercially pure titanium (cpti). near edge x-ray absorption (nexafs) showed crystalline anatase was more pronounced on the anodically oxidized surfaces than  on the cpti. as revealed by fluorescence microscopy, a four-species mixture, as well as individual bacterial species, exhibited lower adherence after 2 h to the  saliva-coated, anatase-rich surfaces than to cpti. since wettability did not differ between the saliva-coated surfaces, differences in the concentration and/or configuration of salivary proteins on the anatase-rich surfaces may explain the reduced bacterial binding effect. anatase-rich surfaces could thus contribute to reduced overall biofilm formation on dental implant abutments through diminished adherence of early colonizers.

TI  == red wine and oenological extracts display antimicrobial effects in an oral bacteria biofilm model.
AB  == the antimicrobial effects of red wine and its inherent components on oral microbiota were studied by using a 5-species biofilm model of the supragingival plaque that includes actinomyces oris, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar. microbiological analysis (cfu counting and confocal laser scanning microscopy) of the biofilms after the application of red wine, dealcoholized red wine, and red wine extract solutions spiked or not with grape seed and inactive dry yeast extracts showed that the solutions spiked with seed extract were effective against f. nucleatum, s. oralis and a. oris. also, red wine and dealcoholized wine had an antimicrobial effect against f. nucleatum and s. oralis. additional experiments showed almost complete and early degradation of flavan-3-ol precursors [(+)-catechin and procyanidin b2] when incubating biofilms with the red wine extract. to our knowledge, this is the first study of antimicrobial properties of wine in an oral biofilm model.

TI  == salivary pellicle composition and multispecies biofilm developed on titanium nitrided by cold plasma.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the salivary  pellicle (sp) and multispecies biofilm developed on titanium nitrided by cold plasma. methods: titanium discs were allocated into a control group (ti) and an experimental group (tin - titanium-nitrided by cold plasma). the disc surface topography was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (sem) and atomic force microscopy (afm). the chemical composition of the disc surface was determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps). stimulated, clarified, and  filtered saliva was used to form pellicles on the discs. proteome analysis of the adsorbed sp proteins was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms). the surface free energy (sfe) was evaluated before and after sp formation. a multispecies biofilm composed of actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella  dispar, and candida albicans was developed on the sp-coated discs. viable microorganism counts were determined. the biomass and average thickness of biofilms were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (clsm) with comstat  software. the biofilm organization was visualized by sem. results: the surface topography was similar in both groups. the sfe of the tin group did not differ from that of the ti group (p>0.05), although the adsorption of pellicle proteins  increased the sfe in both pellicle-coated groups (p<0.001). different proteins were identified on the ti and tin surfaces. the amount of biofilm was similar for both groups (p=0.416), but the counts of f. nucleatum and s. oralis were higher in the tin group (p<0.001). similar biofilms were characterized by the comstat data, clsm images, and sem images. conclusion: the titanium nitrided by cold plasma exhibited differences in sp composition and multispecies microbial biofilm population compared to the control titanium surface.

TI  == streptococcus mitis strains causing severe clinical disease in cancer patients.
AB  == the genetically diverse viridans group streptococci (vgs) are increasingly recognized as the cause of a variety of human diseases. we used a recently developed multilocus sequence analysis scheme to define the species of 118 unique vgs strains causing bacteremia in patients with cancer; streptococcus mitis (68 patients) and s. oralis (22 patients) were the most frequently identified strains. compared with patients infected with non-s. mitis strains, patients infected with s. mitis strains were more likely to have moderate or severe clinical disease (e.g., vgs shock syndrome). combined with the sequence data, whole-genome analyses showed that s. mitis strains may more precisely be considered as >2 species. furthermore, we found that multiple s. mitis strains induced disease in neutropenic mice in a dose-dependent fashion. our data define  the prominent clinical effect of the group of organisms currently classified as s. mitis and lay the groundwork for increased understanding of this understudied  pathogen.

AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are a major cause of bacteraemia in neutropenic cancer patients, particularly those receiving fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. in this study, we sought to understand the molecular basis for fluoroquinolone resistance in vgs causing bacteraemia in cancer patients by assigning 115 vgs bloodstream isolates to specific species using multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa), by sequencing the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare, and by testing strain susceptibility to various fluoroquinolones. non-susceptibility to one or more fluoroquinolones was observed for 78% of isolates, however only 68.7% of patients were receiving fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. all but one of the determinative qrdr polymorphisms  occurred in gyra or parc, yet the pattern of determinative qrdr polymorphisms was significantly associated with the fluoroquinolone prophylaxis received. by combining mlsa and qrdr data, multiple patients infected with genetically indistinguishable fluoroquinolone-resistant streptococcus mitis or streptococcus  oralis strains were discovered. together these data delineate the molecular mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in vgs isolates causing bacteraemia and  suggest possible transmission of fluoroquinolone-resistant s. mitis and s. oralis isolates among cancer patients.

TI  == amplification of bacteria-induced platelet activation is triggered by fcgammariia, integrin alphaiibbeta3, and platelet factor 4.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to platelets is mediated via a range of strain-specific bacterial surface proteins that bind to a variety of platelet receptors. it is unclear how these interactions lead to platelet activation. we demonstrate a critical role for the immune receptor fcgammariia, alphaiibbeta3, and src and syk tyrosine kinases in platelet activation by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. fcgammariia activation is dependent on immunoglobulin g (igg) and alphaiibbeta3 engagement. moreover, feedback agonists adenosine 5'-diphosphate and thromboxane a2 are mandatory for platelet aggregation. additionally, platelet factor 4 (pf4) binds to bacteria and reduces the lag time for aggregation, and gray platelet syndrome alpha-granule-deficient platelets do not aggregate to 4 of 5 bacterial strains. we propose that fcgammariia-mediated activation is a common  response mechanism used against a wide range of bacteria, and that release of secondary mediators and pf4 serve as a positive feedback mechanism for activation through an igg-dependent pathway.

TI  == the influence of a glucosyltransferase, encoded by gtfp, on biofilm formation by  streptococcus sanguinis in a dual-species model.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is an early colonizer of tooth surfaces and forms biofilms with other species of microorganisms. in vitro, s. sanguinis produces water-soluble glucans from sucrose and releases them into the culture supernatant; however, the role played by these glucans in biofilm formation is unclear. the present study examined both the effect of glucans on biofilm formation by s. sanguinis and the proportion of this bacterial species within the biofilms. inactivation of the gtfp gene, annotated as glucosyltransferase in the  s. sanguinis genome database, caused a marked reduction in the amount of water-soluble glucans in the culture supernatant, but not in the amount of water-insoluble glucans expressed on the bacterial cell surface. scanning electron microscopy revealed that wild-type s. sanguinis, but not the gtfp-deficient mutant, produced large amounts of sticky material in the presence  of 1% (w/v) sucrose. in addition, biofilm production by wild-type bacteria was greater than that by the mutant strain. by contrast, co-culture of mutant bacteria with streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. anginosus, or s. salivarius showed that inactivating the gtfp gene had little effect on the amount of biofilm produced. furthermore, inactivating the gtfp gene did not greatly alter the proportion of s. sanguinis in the biofilms formed by the co-cultures. thus, despite the role of s. sanguinis glucosyltransferase in formation of water-soluble glucans and biofilms in monoculture, the functional gene contributed little to biofilms in co-culture experiments.

AB  == the formation of dental plaque, a highly complex biofilm that causes gingivitis and periodontitis, requires specific adherence among many oral microbes, including the coaggregation of actinomyces oris with streptococcus oralis that helps to seed biofilm development. here, we report the discovery of a key coaggregation factor for this process. this protein, which we named coaggregation factor a (cafa), is one of 14 cell surface proteins with the lpxtg motif predicted in a. oris mg1, whose function was hitherto unknown. by systematic mutagenesis of each of these genes and phenotypic characterization, we found that the actinomyces/streptococcus coaggregation is only abolished by deletion of cafa. subsequent biochemical and cytological experiments revealed that cafa constitutes the tip of a unique form of the type 2 fimbria long known for its role in coaggregation. the direct and predominant role of cafa in adherence is evident from the fact that cafa or an antibody against cafa inhibits coaggregation, whereas the shaft protein fima or a polyclonal antibody against fima has no effect. remarkably, fima polymerization was blocked by deletion of genes for both cafa and fimb, the previously described tip protein of the type 2  fimbria. together, these results indicate that some surface proteins not linked to a pilus gene cluster in gram-positive bacteria may hijack the pilus. these unique tip proteins displayed on a common pilus shaft may serve distinct physiological functions. furthermore, the pilus shaft assembly in gram-positive bacteria may require a tip, as is true for certain gram-negative bacterial pili.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == evaluation of the stability and antimicrobial activity of an ethanolic extract of libidibia ferrea.
AB  == biofilm is a dense, whitish, noncalcified aggregate of bacteria, with desquamated epithelial cells and food debris creating conditions for an imbalance of resident oral microflora and favoring the destruction of hard and soft tissues by development of caries and gingivitis. the aim of this study was to obtain and characterize an extract of libidibia ferrea, ex caesalpinia ferrea l. and to evaluate its feasibility for formulation as a mouthwash, according to current legislation. for this purpose, ph, sedimentation, density, and stability were evaluated, along with microbiological testing of the extract. the microbiological test was used to verify the presence of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, fungi, yeasts, coliforms, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus oralis strains. characterization, microbiological evaluation, and minimum inhibitory concentration results were tabulated and described using descriptive statistics. the l. ferrea extract showed stable characteristics, product quality, and antibacterial activity against the microorganisms tested irrespective of experimental time intervals. according to these results, it can be concluded that formulation of a mouthwash containing l. ferrea extract to control biofilm is feasible, but further studies  are needed.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide contributes to the epithelial cell death induced by the oral mitis group of streptococci.
AB  == members of the mitis group of streptococci are normal inhabitants of the commensal flora of the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract of humans. some mitis group species, such as streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguinis, are primary colonizers of the human oral cavity. recently, we found that hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) produced by s. oralis is cytotoxic to human macrophages, suggesting that streptococcus-derived h2o2 may act as a cytotoxin. since epithelial cells provide a physical barrier against pathogenic microbes, we investigated their susceptibility to infection by h2o2-producing streptococci in  this study. infection by s. oralis and s. sanguinis was found to stimulate cell death of detroit 562, calu-3 and hela epithelial cell lines at a multiplicity of  infection greater than 100. catalase, an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition  of h2o2, inhibited s. oralis cytotoxicity, and h2o2 alone was capable of eliciting epithelial cell death. moreover, s. oralis mutants lacking the spxb gene encoding pyruvate oxidase, which are deficient in h2o2 production, exhibited reduced cytotoxicity toward detroit 562 epithelial cells. in addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed that both s. oralis and h2o2 induced  interleukin-6 production in detroit 562 epithelial cells. these results suggest that streptococcal h2o2 is cytotoxic to epithelial cells, and promotes bacterial  evasion of the host defense systems in the oral cavity and upper respiratory tracts.

TI  == radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB  == objective: to develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria  at small or large radiographical lesions. materials and methods: the patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). a risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. results: fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). an increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at  large abscess lesions was observed for prevotella (p.) oralis, p. buccae, p. oris, p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus (strep.) anginosus group. an increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for strep. salivarius, strep. parasanguis, strep. anginosus group, capnocytophaga spp., neisseria (n.) sicca, neisseria spp., staphylococcus (staph.) aureus, p. intermedia, p. buccae, prevotella spp. and p. melaninogenica. conclusions: the radiography-based score suggests that certain prevotella spp., f. nucleatum and strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, neisseria spp., capnocytophaga spp., staph. aureus and prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.

TI  == histopathology of streptococcus mitis/oralis endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection with bevacizumab: a report of 7 patients.
AB  == purpose: to report the histopathologic findings of a series of patients from an outbreak of streptococcal endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab prepared by a single compounding pharmacy. design: case series. participants: seven surgical specimens (5 enucleated globes and 2 evisceration specimens) from 7 patients with endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab. methods: retrospective case series, including clinical data and histopathologic specimens examined by light microscopy. main outcome measures: review of clinical data included baseline visual acuity, clinical intervention, and time elapsed from injection to loss of globe. histopathologic specimens were  reviewed for pathologic changes at all tissue levels. results: seven of 12 total  patients (4 women, 3 men; mean age, 77.7 years) from an outbreak of streptococcus mitis/oralis endophthalmitis after bevacizumab injection ultimately sustained loss of the affected globe, with an average of 139.1 days elapsed between injection and globe loss. mean time from injection to presentation was 2.86 days  (range, 1-6), and all patients were initially treated with vitreous tap and injection. although histologic review of surgical specimens disclosed a wide range of pathologic tissue changes, recurring patterns of tissue damage were evident. all 5 enucleated globes displayed retinal detachment, fibrous proliferation with cyclitic membrane formation, rubeosis iridis, and secondary angle closure. all 7 specimens displayed persistent choroidal inflammation, in 1  case 208 days after injection. six of 7 specimens had foci of retinal necrosis. although vitreous cultures were positive in all cases, no organisms were identified by light microscopy in any of the 7 specimens. conclusions: s. mitis/oralis endophthalmitis is a devastating complication of intravitreal injection with bevacizumab with a high rate of globe loss (7 of 12 patients, 58.3%) and a wide variety of severe pathologic tissue changes. although no organisms were identified in the examined tissues, persistent inflammation was present in all cases, and fibrous proliferation resulted in cyclitic membrane formation and retinal detachment in all enucleated globes. these findings suggest that potential globe-salvaging interventions must address a pattern of changes involving persistent, chronic inflammation and fibrovascular proliferation as key components.

TI  == genetic basis of coaggregation receptor polysaccharide biosynthesis in streptococcus sanguinis and related species.
AB  == interbacterial adhesion between streptococci and actinomyces promotes early dental plaque biofilm development. recognition of coaggregation receptor polysaccharides (rps) on strains of streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis by actinomyces spp. type 2 fimbriae is the principal mechanism of these interactions. previous studies of genetic loci for synthesis of rps (rps) and rps precursors (rml, gale1 and gale2) in s. gordonii 38 and s. oralis 34 revealed differences between these strains. to determine whether these differences are strain-specific or species-specific, we identified  and compared loci for polysaccharide biosynthesis in additional strains of these  species and in several strains of the previously unstudied species, s. sanguinis. genes for synthesis of rps precursors distinguished the rps loci of different streptococci. hence, rml genes for synthesis of tdp-l-rha were in rps loci of s.  oralis strains but at other loci in s. gordonii and s. sanguinis. genes for two distinct galactose epimerases were also distributed differently. hence, gale1 for epimerization of udp-glc and udp-gal was in galactose operons of s. gordonii and  s. sanguinis strains but surprisingly, this gene was not present in s. oralis. moreover, gale2 for epimerization of both udp-glc and udp-gal and udp-glcnac and  udp-galnac was at a different locus in each species, including rps operons of s.  sanguinis. the findings provide insight into cell surface properties that distinguish different rps-producing streptococci and open an approach for identifying these bacteria based on the arrangement of genes for synthesis of polysaccharide precursors.

TI  == streptococcal taxonomy based on genome sequence analyses.
AB  == the identification of the clinically relevant viridans streptococci group, at species level, is still problematic. the aim of this study was to extract taxonomic information from the complete genome sequences of 67 streptococci, comprising 19 species, by means of genomic analyses, multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa), average amino acid identity (aai), genomic signatures, genome-to-genome distances (ggd) and codon usage bias. we then attempted to determine the usefulness of these genomic tools for species identification in streptococci. our results showed that mlsa, aai and ggd analyses are robust markers to identify streptococci at the species level, for instance, s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s.  oralis. a streptococcus species can be defined as a group of strains that share >/= 95% dna similarity in mlsa and aai, and > 70% dna identity in ggd. this approach allows an advanced understanding of bacterial diversity.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == comparative genomic analysis shows that streptococcus suis meningitis isolate sc070731 contains a unique 105k genomic island.
AB  == streptococcus suis (ss) is an important swine pathogen worldwide that occasionally causes serious infections in humans. ss infection may result in meningitis in pigs and humans. the pathogenic mechanisms of ss are poorly understood. here, we provide the complete genome sequence of s. suis serotype 2 (ss2) strain sc070731 isolated from a pig with meningitis. the chromosome is 2,138,568bp in length. there are 1933 predicted protein coding sequences and 96.7% (57/59) of the known virulence-associated genes are present in the genome.  strain sc070731 showed similar virulence with ss2 virulent strains ha9801 and zy05719, but was more virulent than ss2 virulent strain p1/7 in the zebrafish infection model. comparative genomic analysis revealed a unique 105k genomic island in strain sc070731 that is absent in seven other sequenced ss2 strains. further analysis of the 105k genomic island indicated that it contained a complete nisin locus similar to the nisin u locus in s. uberis strain 42, a prophage similar to s. oralis phage ph10 and several antibiotic resistance genes. several proteins in the 105k genomic island, including nisin and relbe toxin-antitoxin system, contribute to the bacterial fitness and virulence in other pathogenic bacteria. further investigation of newly identified gene products, including four putative new virulence-associated surface proteins, will improve our understanding of ss pathogenesis.

TI  == adhesion forces and composition of planktonic and adhering oral microbiomes.
AB  == the oral microbiome consists of a planktonic microbiome residing in saliva and an adhering microbiome (the biofilm adhering to oral hard and soft tissues). here we hypothesized that possible differences in microbial composition of the planktonic and adhering oral microbiome on teeth can be related to the forces by which different bacterial species are attracted to the tooth surface. the relative presence of 7 oral bacterial species in saliva and biofilm collected from 10 healthy human volunteers was determined twice in each volunteer by denaturing-gradient-gel electrophoresis. analysis of both microbiomes showed complete separation of the planktonic from the adhering oral microbiome. next, adhesion forces of corresponding bacterial strains with saliva-coated enamel surfaces were measured by atomic force microscopy. species that were found predominantly in the adhering microbiome had significantly higher adhesion forces to saliva-coated enamel (-0.60 to -1.05 nn) than did species mostly present in the planktonic microbiome (-0.40 to -0.55 nn). it is concluded that differences in composition of the planktonic and the adhering oral microbiome are due to small differences in the forces by which strains adhere to saliva-coated enamel,  providing an important step in understanding site- and material-specific differences in the composition of biofilms in the oral cavity.

TI  == differential effect of autoinducer 2 of fusobacterium nucleatum on oral streptococci.
AB  == autoinducer 2 (ai-2) is a quorum sensing molecule and plays an important role in  dental biofilm formation, mediating interspecies communication and virulence expression of oral bacteria. fusobacterium nucleatum connects early colonizing commensals and late colonizing periodontopathogens. f. nucleatum ai-2 and quorum  sensing inhibitors (qsis) can manipulate dental biofilm formation. in this study, we evaluated the effect of f. nucleatum ai-2 and qsis on biofilm formation of streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis, which are initial colonizers in  dental biofilm. f. nucleatum ai-2 significantly enhanced biofilm growth of s. gordonii and attachment of f. nucleatum to preformed s. gordonii biofilms. by contrast, f. nucleatum ai-2 reduced biofilm growth of s. oralis and attachment of f. nucleatum to preformed s. oralis biofilms. the qsis, (5z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5h)-furanone and d-ribose, reversed the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of ai-2 on s. gordonii and s. oralis, respectively. in addition, co-culture using a two-compartment system showed that  secreted molecules of f. nucleatum had the same effect on biofilm growth of the streptococci as ai-2. our results demonstrate that early colonizing bacteria can  influence the accretion of f. nucleatum, a secondary colonizer, which ultimately  influences the binding of periodontopathogens.

TI  == morphological plasticity of streptococcus oralis isolates for biofilm production, invasiveness, and architectural patterns.
AB  == objective: streptococcus oralis is an early coloniser of the oral cavity that contributes to dental plaque formation. many different genotypes can coexist in the same individual and cause opportunistic infections such as bacterial endocarditis. however, little is known about virulence factors involved in those  processes. the aim was to analyze the evolving growth of s. oralis colony/biofilm to find out potentially pathogenic features. design: thirty-three s. oralis isolates were analyzed for: (1) biofilm production, by spectrophotometric microtiter plate assay; (2) colonial internal architecture, by histological methods and light and electron microscopy; (3) agar invasion, by a new colony-biofilm assay. results: s. oralis colonies showed two different growth patterns: (1) fast growth rate without invasion or minimally invasive; (2) slow growth rate, but high invasion ability. 12.1% of strains were biofilm non-producers and 24.2% not invasive, compared to 51.5% biofilm high-producers and 39.4% very invasive. both phenotypic characteristics tended to be mutually exclusive. however, a limited number of strains (15%) co-expressed these features at the highest level. conclusions: morphological plasticity of s. oralis highlighted in this study may have important ecological and clinical implications. coexistence of strains with different growth patterns could produce a synergic effect in the formation and development of subgingival dental plaque.  moreover, invasiveness might regulate dissemination and colonisation mechanisms.  simultaneous co-expression of high-invasive and high-biofilm phenotypes gives a fitness advantage during colonisation and may confer higher pathogenic potential.

TI  == phenotypic diversity of multicellular filamentation in oral streptococci.
AB  == filamentous multicellular bacteria are among the most ancient multicellular organisms. they inhabit a great variety of environments and are present in the human body, including the oral cavity. beside the selective advantages related to the larger size achieved through filamentation, the development of multicellular  bacteria can be also driven by simple ecological factors such as birth and death  rates at the cellular level. in order to extend earlier results obtained in aquatic species, we investigate the filamentation process of four different strains of oral streptococci, namely s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. oralis and s. anginosus. the results indicate differences in the capacities of different streptococcus species to form filaments, manifested in terms of length and the time-scale of filament elongation. the filamentation pattern of these oral streptococci resembles that of aquatic bacteria, whereby filaments reach a peak length during exponential growth and become short when the population reaches a steady state. hence, this study validates that multicellularity can be an emergent property of filamentous bacteria of different ecological niches, and that phenotypic differences in filamentation can occur within species of the same genus, in this case oral streptococci. moreover, given the role that specific oral streptococci can play in the etiology of oral diseases, these results can possibly open new perspectives in the study of the virulence properties of these  species.

TI  == streptococcal co-infection augments candida pathogenicity by amplifying the mucosal inflammatory response.
AB  == mitis-group streptococci are ubiquitous oral commensals that can promote polybacterial biofilm virulence. using a novel murine oral mucosal co-infection model we sought to determine for the first time whether these organisms promote the virulence of c. albicans mucosal biofilms in oropharyngeal infection and explored mechanisms of pathogenic synergy. we found that streptococcus oralis colonization of the oral and gastrointestinal tract was augmented in the presence of c. albicans. s. oralis and c. albicans co-infection significantly augmented the frequency and size of oral thrush lesions. importantly, s. oralis promoted deep organ dissemination of c. albicans. whole mouse genome tongue microarray analysis showed that when compared with animals infected with one organism, the doubly infected animals had genes in the major categories of neutrophilic response/chemotaxis/inflammation significantly upregulated, indicative of an exaggerated inflammatory response. this response was dependent on tlr2 signalling since oral lesions, transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and neutrophil infiltration, were attenuated in tlr2(-/-) animals. furthermore, s. oralis activated neutrophils in a tlr2-dependent manner in vitro. in summary, this study identifies a previously unrecognized pathogenic synergy between oral commensal bacteriaand c. albicans. this is the first report of the ability of mucosal commensal bacteria to modify the virulence of an opportunistic fungal pathogen.

AB  == background: titanium implants in the oral cavity are covered with a saliva-derived pellicle to which early colonizing microorganisms such as streptococcus oralis can bind. the protein profiles of salivary pellicles on titanium have not been well characterized and the proteins of importance for binding are thus unknown. biofilm bacteria exhibit different phenotypes from their planktonic counterparts and contact with salivary proteins may be one factor contributing to the induction of changes in physiology. we have characterized salivary pellicles from titanium surfaces and investigated how contact with uncoated and saliva-coated titanium surfaces affects metabolic activity in adherent cells of s. oralis. methods: salivary pellicles on smooth titanium surfaces were desorbed and these, as well as purified human saliva, were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy. a parallel plate flow-cell model was used to study binding of a fresh isolate of s. oralis to uncoated and saliva-coated titanium surfaces. metabolic activity was assessed using the baclight ctc vitality kit and confocal scanning laser microscopy. experiments were carried out in triplicate and the results analyzed using student's t-test or anova. results: secretory iga, alpha-amylase and cystatins were identified as dominant proteins in the salivary pellicles. selective adsorption of proteins was demonstrated by the enrichment of prolactin-inducible protein and absence of zinc-alpha(2)-glycoprotein relative to saliva. adherence of s. oralis to titanium led to an up-regulation of metabolic activity in the population after 2 hours. in the presence of a salivary pellicle, this effect was enhanced and sustained over the following 22 hour period. conclusions: we have shown that adherence to smooth titanium surfaces under flow  causes an up-regulation of metabolic activity in the early oral colonizer s. oralis, most likely as part of an adaptation to the biofilm mode of life. the effect was enhanced by a salivary pellicle containing siga, alpha-amylase, cystatins and prolactin-inducible protein which was, for the first time, identified as an abundant component of salivary pellicles on titanium. further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the effect of surface contact on metabolic activity as well as to identify the salivary proteins responsible for enhancing the effect.

TI  == characterization and application of a flow system for in vitro multispecies oral  biofilm formation.
AB  == background and objective: bacteria in the oral cavity grow in the form of biofilms; these structures are subject to constant saliva or gingival crevicular  fluid flow conditions. the aims of this study were: (i) to develop and to characterize an in-vitro biofilm model with oral bacteria growing under flow and  shear conditions; and (ii) to demonstrate the usefulness of the model for evaluating the activity of three antiplaque agents. material and methods: we used a bioreactor to grow the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis under planktonic conditions. biofilms were established using a modified robbins device on hydroxyapatite (hap) discs. three- to 7-d-old biofilms were analysed using culture methods, scanning electron microscopy, live/dead staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (confocal laser scanning microscopy). finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of three mouthrinses [0.12% chlorhexidine (chx), 0.12% chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride (chx+naf) and 0.12% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (chx+cpc)] using a planktonic test (short interval-killing test) and in  our 4-d biofilm model. results: the viable cell counts showed that each species was consistently found in the biofilms throughout the study. the architecture and cell distribution were similar to those described for biofilms in situ, with the  exception of a thin layer of living cells that was found close to the hap. the effectiveness test of the mouthwashes demonstrated that cells in biofilms showed  more tolerance compared with planktonic cells. moreover, it was observed that in  4-d biofilm formed in vitro, chx+cpc caused significantly higher mortality compared with chx (p = 0.003) and chx+naf (p < 0.001). conclusion: our results suggest that we have a highly reproducible system for multispecies oral biofilm formation and that it is a useful tool for assessing antibacterial molecules before their clinical evaluation. it also has great potential to be used in basic research on supragingival and subgingival biofilms.

TI  == the effect of a silver nanoparticle polysaccharide system on streptococcal and saliva-derived biofilms.
AB  == in this work, we studied the antimicrobial properties of a nanocomposite system based on a lactose-substituted chitosan and silver nanoparticles: chitlac-nag. twofold serial dilutions of the colloidal chitlac-nag solution were both tested on streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus oralis planktonic phase and biofilm growth mode as well as on saliva samples. the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of chitlac-nag were evaluated together with its effect on sessile cell viability, as well as both on biofilm formation and on preformed biofilm. in respect to the planktonic bacteria, chitlac-nag showed an inhibitory/bactericidal effect against all streptococcal strains at 0.1% (v/v), except for s. mitis atcc 6249 that was inhibited at one step less. on preformed biofilm, chitlac-nag at a value of 0.2%, was able to inhibit the bacterial growth on the supernatant phase as well as on the mature biofilm. for s. mitis atcc 6249, the biofilm inhibitory concentration of chitlac-nag was 0.1%. at sub-inhibitory concentrations, the streptococcal strains adhesion capability on a polystyrene surface showed a general reduction following a concentration-dependent-way; a similar effect was obtained for the metabolic biofilm activity. from these results, chitlac-nag seems to be a promising antibacterial and antibiofilm agent able to hinder plaque formation.

TI  == pontic morphology as local risk factor in root decay and periodontal disease.
AB  == introduction: in absence of treatment, old single edentulous spaces are subjected to progressively decrease in length due to tilting and rotation of the teeth situated mesial and distal. lately when these spaces are prosthetically restored  with a bridge and these teeth are becoming abutments, sanitizing of the prosthetic restoration is achieved with difficulty, the space between the pontic  and the gingival surface becoming an area rich in pathogens that can cause various complications on the abutments. aim: considering these aspects, in this study we wanted to highlight the presence and the types of the microorganisms that can be found under the pontic even in an ideal situation, selecting only young adult patients with a good oral hygiene and only with metal-ceramic bridges. materials and methods: determination of microorganisms was achieved by growing on bd columbia agar with 5% sheep blood. incubation was done in anaerobe  condition using genbag system produced by biomerieux company. results: the microorganisms that we determined were streptococcus mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, gram-negative bacilli (bacteroides ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron) and gram-positive bacilli (bifidobacterium spp., actinomyces israelii, clostridium butyricum / beijerinckii) with relevance in the carious and periodontal disease. conclusions: in cases of single unit bridges with very narrow pontics, even in patients with a very good oral hygiene and metal-ceramic restorations, we can still find micro-organisms that can potentially generate decay or periodontal disease on the abutments, located in the gingival area underneath these pontics. these bacteria  can have negative implications on the long-term prognosis of prosthetic restorations.

TI  == adhesion and biofilm formation by oral streptococci on different commercial brackets.
AB  == aim: to compare early bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation in vitro by different oral streptococci on a variety of commercial brackets. methods: adhesion and biofilm formation in vitro of 6 streptococcus spp. on 15 different commercial brackets, in standard culture medium and in human saliva were evaluated by the mtt reduction assay. results: significant differences were evidenced in both early adhesion and biofilm formation among the studied brackets and between the two conditions of growth. gold brackets resulted less prone to colonisation compared to composite brackets. the growth rates of the tested species on the different tested materials were significantly different. conclusion: the adopted experimental plan, dissecting the two phases of plaque formation on different brackets in different conditions, showed that composite brackets are more susceptible to adhesion and colonisation by streptococci, while the remaining tested brackets did not show differences that could be clinically relevant. data suggest that different personal behaviours affecting the oral environment could significantly affect colonisation of brackets by oral streptococci.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide produced by oral streptococci induces macrophage cell death.
AB  == hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) produced by members of the mitis group of oral streptococci plays important roles in microbial communities such as oral biofilms. although the cytotoxicity of h2o2 has been widely recognized, the effects of h2o2 produced by oral streptococci on host defense systems remain unknown. in the present study, we investigated the effect of h2o2 produced by streptococcus oralis on human macrophage cell death. infection by s. oralis was found to stimulate cell death of a thp-1 human macrophage cell line at multiplicities of infection greater than 100. catalase, an enzyme that catalyzes  the decomposition of h2o2, inhibited the cytotoxic effect of s. oralis. s. oralis deletion mutants lacking the spxb gene, which encodes pyruvate oxidase, and are therefore deficient in h2o2 production, showed reduced cytotoxicity toward thp-1  macrophages. furthermore, h2o2 alone was capable of inducing cell death. the cytotoxic effect seemed to be independent of inflammatory responses, because h2o2 was not a potent stimulator of tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in macrophages. these results indicate that streptococcal h2o2 plays a role as a cytotoxin, and is implicated in the cell death of infected human macrophages.

TI  == multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing excessive acetaldehyde production from ethanol by oral streptococci.
AB  == ethanol consumption and poor oral hygiene are risk factors for oral and oesophageal cancers. although oral streptococci have been found to produce excessive acetaldehyde from ethanol, little is known about the mechanism by which this carcinogen is produced. by screening 52 strains of diverse oral streptococcal species, we identified streptococcus gordonii v2016 that produced the most acetaldehyde from ethanol. we then constructed gene deletion mutants in  this strain and analysed them for alcohol and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases by zymograms. the results showed that s. gordonii v2016 expressed three primary alcohol dehydrogenases, adha, adhb and adhe, which all oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde, but their preferred substrates were 1-propanol, 1-butanol and ethanol, respectively. two additional dehydrogenases, s-adha and tdha, were identified with specificities to the secondary alcohol 2-propanol and threonine,  respectively, but not to ethanol. s. gordonii v2016 did not show a detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase even though its adhe gene encodes a putative bifunctional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase. mutants with adhe deletion showed greater tolerance to ethanol in comparison with the wild-type and mutant with adha or adhb deletion, indicating that adhe is the major alcohol dehydrogenase in s. gordonii. analysis of 19 additional strains of s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis showed expressions of up to three alcohol dehydrogenases, but none showed detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, except one strain that showed a novel aldh. therefore, expression  of multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase may contribute to excessive production of acetaldehyde from ethanol by certain oral streptococci.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr combined with propidium monoazide for the selective quantification of viable periodontal pathogens in an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objectives: differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. this is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. the objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) combined with propidium monoazide (pma), developed for the selective quantification of viable p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. material and methods: pma-qpcr method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. biofilms were disrupted and pma added (final concentration of 100 mum). after dna isolation, qpcr was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. the differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. results: when pma was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qpcr amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, pma resulted in a significant total reduction of qpcr amplification of about 4 log10 . p. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. conclusion: these results demonstrate the efficiency of pma for  differentiating viable and dead p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. hence, this pma-qpcr method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.

TI  == identification of clinical streptococcus pneumoniae isolates among other alpha and nonhemolytic streptococci by use of the vitek ms matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry system.
AB  == discrimination between streptococcus pneumoniae and its close relatives of the viridans group is a common difficulty in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry-based identification. in  the present study, the performances of the vitek ms maldi-tof mass spectrometry system were assessed using 334 pneumococci, 166 other s. mitis group streptococci, 184 non-s. mitis group streptococci, and 19 related alpha- and nonhemolytic aerobic gram-positive catalase-negative coccal isolates. pneumococci had been identified by means of optochin susceptibility and bile solubility or serotyping, and other isolates mainly by use of rapidid32 strep strips. in case of discordant or low-discrimination results, genotypic methods were used. the sensitivity of the vitek ms for the identification of s. pneumoniae was 99.1%, since only three bile-insoluble isolates were misidentified as streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis. conversely, two optochin-resistant pneumococci were correctly identified (specificity, 100%). three streptococcus pseudopneumoniae isolates were also correctly identified. among nonpneumococcal isolates, 90.8% (n = 335) were correctly identified to the species or subspecies level and 2.4% (n = 9) at the group level. for the remaining 25 isolates, the vitek ms proposed a bacterial species included in the list of possible species suggested by genotypic methods, except for 4 isolates which were not identified due to the absence of the species in the database. according to our study, the vitek ms displays performance similar to that of the optochin susceptibility test for routine identification of pneumococcal isolates. moreover, the vitek ms is efficient for  the identification of other viridans group streptococci and related isolates, provided that the species are included in the database.

TI  == reduced adhesion of oral bacteria on hydroxyapatite by fluoride treatment.
AB  == the mechanisms of action of fluoride have been discussed controversially for decades. the cavity-preventive effect for teeth is often traced back to effects on demineralization. however, an effect on bacterial adhesion was indicated by indirect macroscopic studies. to characterize adhesion on fluoridated samples on  a single bacterial level, we used force spectroscopy with bacterial probes to measure adhesion forces directly. we tested the adhesion of streptococcus mutans  , streptococcus oralis , and staphylococcus carnosus on smooth, high-density hydroxyapatite surfaces, pristine and after treatment with fluoride solution. all bacteria species exhibit lower adhesion forces after fluoride treatment of the surfaces. these findings suggest that the decrease of adhesion properties is a further key factor for the cariostatic effect of fluoride besides the decrease of demineralization.

TI  == early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  == the development of high-level daptomycin resistance (hldr; mic of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (vgs) isolates. our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of hldr after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of vgs and streptococcus bovis; to determine whether hldr also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain s. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of hldr in vitro and in vivo. in vitro  studies were performed with 114 vgs strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 streptococcus bovis strains  isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. hldr was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of s. mitis isolates, 47% of  s. oralis isolates, and 13% of s. sanguis isolates. in our experimental model, hldr was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h  and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. in vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against s. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the mic and prevented the development of hldr.  in vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented hldr in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. in conclusion, hldr develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of hldr in most cases.

TI  == streptococcus endophthalmitis outbreak after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab: one-year outcomes and investigative results.
AB  == purpose: to report the 1-year clinical outcomes of an outbreak of streptococcus endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab, including visual acuity outcomes, microbiological testing, and compound pharmacy investigations by the food and drug administration (fda). design: retrospective consecutive case series. participants: twelve eyes of 12 patients who developed endophthalmitis after receiving intravitreal bevacizumab prepared by a single compounding pharmacy. methods: medical records of patients were reviewed; phenotypic and dna  analyses were performed on microbes cultured from patients and from unused syringes. an inspection report by the fda based on site visits to the pharmacy that prepared the bevacizumab syringes was summarized. main outcome measures: visual acuity, interventions received, time to intervention, microbiological consistency, and fda inspection findings. results: between july 5 and 8, 2011, 12 patients developed endophthalmitis after intravitreal bevacizumab from syringes prepared by a single compounding pharmacy. all patients received initial vitreous tap and injection, and 8 patients (67%) subsequently underwent pars plana vitrectomy (ppv). after 12 months follow-up, outcomes have been poor. seven patients (58%) required evisceration or enucleation, and only 1 patient regained  pre-injection visual acuity. molecular testing using real-time polymerase chain reaction, partial sequencing of the groel gene, and multilocus sequencing of 7 housekeeping genes confirmed the presence of a common strain of streptococcus mitis/oralis in vitreous specimens and 7 unused syringes prepared by the compounding pharmacy at the same time. an fda investigation of the compounding pharmacy noted deviations from standard sterile technique, inconsistent documentation, and inadequate testing of equipment required for safe preparation  of medications. conclusions: in this outbreak of endophthalmitis, outcomes have been generally poor, and ppv did not improve visual results at 1-year follow-up.  molecular testing confirmed a common strain of s. mitis/oralis. contamination seems to have occurred at the compounding pharmacy, where numerous problems in sterile technique were noted by public health investigators.

TI  == incidence of bacteriocins produced by food-related lactic acid bacteria active towards oral pathogens.
AB  == in the present study we investigated the incidence of bacteriocins produced by 236 lactic acid bacteria (lab) food isolates against pathogenic or opportunistic  pathogenic oral bacteria. this set of lab contained several strains (>/=17%) producing bacteriocins active against food-related bacteria. interestingly only streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 was able to inhibit the growth of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii, while lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc 179 and lactobacillus plantarun aca-dc 269 produced bacteriocins solely against streptococcus oralis. thus, the percentage of strains that were found to produce bacteriocins against oral bacteria was ~1.3%. the rarity of bacteriocins active against oral lab pathogens produced by food-related lab was unexpected given their close phylogenetic relationship. nevertheless, when tested in inhibition assays, the potency of the bacteriocin(s) of s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 against the three oral streptococci was high. fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy combined with principal component analysis revealed that exposure of the target cells to the antimicrobial compounds caused major alterations of key cellular constituents. our findings indicate that bacteriocins produced by food-related lab against oral lab may be rare, but deserve further investigation since, when discovered, they can be effective antimicrobials.

TI  == glycoprotein ibalpha and fcgammariia play key roles in platelet activation by the colonizing bacterium, streptococcus oralis.
AB  == background: infective endocarditis (ie) is characterized by thrombus formation on a cardiac valve. the oral bacterium, streptococcus oralis, is recognized for its  ability to colonize damaged heart valves and is frequently isolated from patients with ie. platelet interaction with s. oralis leads to the development of a thrombotic vegetation on heart valves, which results in valvular incompetence and congestive heart failure. objective: to investigate the mechanism through which platelets become activated upon binding s. oralis. patients and methods: platelet interactions with immobilized bacteria under shear conditions were assessed using a parallel flow chamber. s. oralis-inducible platelet reactivity was determined using light transmission aggregometry. dense granule secretion was measured by luminometry using a luciferin/luciferase assay. results: using shear rates that mimic physiological conditions, we demonstrated that s. oralis was able to support platelet adhesion under venous (50-200 s(-1) ) and arterial shear conditions (800 s(-1) ). platelets rolled along immobilized s. oralis through an  interaction with gpibalpha. following rolling, platelet microaggregate formation  was observed on immobilized s. oralis. aggregate formation was dependent on s. oralis binding igg, which cross-links to platelet fcgammariia. this interaction led to phosphorylation of the itam domain on fcgammariia, resulting in dense granule secretion, amplification through the adp receptor and activation of rap1, culminating in platelet microaggregate formation. conclusions: these results suggest a model of interaction between s. oralis and platelets that leads to the  formation of a stable septic vegetation on damaged heart valves.

TI  == discrimination between streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis based on  sorting of their maldi mass spectra.
AB  == accurate species-level identification of alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococci  (vgs) is very important for understanding their pathogenicity and virulence. however, an extremely high level of similarity between vgs within the mitis group (s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, s. oralis and s. pseudopneumoniae) often results in misidentification of these organisms. earlier, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) has been suggested as  a tool for the rapid identification of s. pneumoniae. however, by using biotyper  3.0 (bruker) or vitek ms (biomerieux) databases, streptococcus mitis/oralis species can be erroneously identified as s. pneumoniae. clinprotools 2.1 software was used for the discrimination of maldi-tof mass spectra of 25 s. pneumoniae isolates, 34 s. mitis and three s. oralis. phenotypical tests and multilocus gene typing schemes for the s. pneumoniae (http://spneumoniae.mlst.net/) and viridans  streptococci (http://viridans.emlsa.net/) were used for the identification of isolates included in the study. the classifying model was generated based on different algorithms (genetic algorithm, supervised neural network and quickclassifier). in all cases, values of sensitivity and specificity were found  to be equal or close to 100%, allowing discrimination of mass spectra of different species. three peaks (6949, 9876 and 9975 m/z) were determined conferring the maximal statistical weight onto each model built. we find this approach to be promising for viridans streptococci discrimination.

TI  == method to quantify live and dead cells in multi-species oral biofilm by real-time pcr with propidium monoazide.
AB  == real-time pcr (qpcr) is a widely used technique in analysing environmental and clinical microbiological samples. however, its main limitation was its inability  to discriminate between live and dead cells.recently, propidium monoazide (pma) together with qpcr has been used to overcome this problem, with good results for  different bacterial species in different types of samples.our objective was to implement this technique for analysing mortality in multi-species oral biofilms formed in vitro with five oral bacteria: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia. we also tested its effectiveness on biofilms treated with an antiseptic solution  containing 0.07% w/w cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc).standardisation of the qpcr-pma method was performed on pure, heat-killed planktonic cultures of each species, detecting mortality higher than 4 log in s. oralis, s. gordonii and f. nucleatum and higher than 2 for v. parvula and p. intermedia. we obtained similar results for all species when using cpc.when we analysed biofilms with qpcr-pma, we found that the mortality in the non-cpc treated multi-species biofilms was lower than 1 log for all species. after treatment with cpc, the viability reduction was higher than 4 log in s. oralis and s. gordonii, higher than 3 log in f. nucleatum and p. intermedia and approximately 2 in v. parvula.in short, we  standardised the conditions for using qpcr-pma in 5 oral bacterial species and proved its usefulness for quantification of live and dead cells in multi-species  oral biofilms formed in vitro, after use of an antiseptic.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == simultaneous detection of streptococcus pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis by a  novel multiplex pcr assay targeting the gyrb gene.
AB  == a multiplex pcr (mpcr) protocol was developed for simultaneous detection of the gyrb gene in streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis, and the specificity was evaluated using 141 coccus strains. genomic dnas  purified from s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis strains were efficiently detected with size differences, whereas no pcr products were amplified from any of the reference strains tested. a pilot study of 47 human oral swab specimens was conducted in parallel, and the mpcr assay identified s. pneumoniae in 1 sample, s. mitis in 8 samples, and s. oralis in 2 samples, providing a powerful means for characterization at the level of species compared with traditional culture analysis. our results suggest that the mpcr protocol presented here is a  sensitive and promising tool for the rapid detection and discrimination of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis from clinical specimens.

TI  == identification and characterization of porphyromonas gingivalis client proteins that bind to streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
AB  == coaggregation of porphyromonas gingivalis and oral streptococci is thought to play an important role in p. gingivalis colonization. previously, we reported that p. gingivalis major fimbriae interacted with streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), and that amino acid residues 166 to 183 of gapdh exhibited strong binding activity toward p. gingivalis fimbriae (h. nagata, m. iwasaki, k. maeda, m. kuboniwa, e. hashino, m. toe, n. minamino, h. kuwahara, and s. shizukuishi, infect. immun. 77:5130-5138, 2009). the present study aimed to identify and characterize p. gingivalis components other than fimbriae that interact with s. oralis gapdh. a pulldown assay was performed to detect potential interactions between p. gingivalis client proteins  and s. oralis recombinant gapdh with amino acid residues 166 to 183 deleted by site-directed mutagenesis. seven proteins, namely, tonb-dependent receptor protein (raga4), arginine-specific proteinase b, 4-hydroxybutyryl-coenzyme a dehydratase (abfd), lysine-specific proteinase, gapdh, nad-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), and malate dehydrogenase (mdh), were identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by proteomic analysis using tandem mass spectrometry. interactions between these client proteins and s. oralis gapdh were analyzed with a biomolecular interaction analysis system. s. oralis gapdh showed high affinity for five of the seven client proteins (raga4, abfd, gapdh, gdh, and mdh). interactions between p. gingivalis and s. oralis were measured by  a turbidimetric method and fluorescence microscopy. raga4, abfd, and gdh enhanced coaggregation, whereas gapdh and mdh inhibited coaggregation. furthermore, the expression of luxs in p. gingivalis was upregulated by raga4, abfd, and gdh but was downregulated by mdh. these results indicate that the five p. gingivalis client proteins function as regulators in p. gingivalis biofilm formation with oral streptococci.

TI  == protective mechanisms of respiratory tract streptococci against streptococcus pyogenes biofilm formation and epithelial cell infection.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci [gas]) encounter many streptococcal  species of the physiological microbial biome when entering the upper respiratory  tract of humans, leading to the question how gas interact with these bacteria in  order to establish themselves at this anatomic site and initiate infection. here  we show that s. oralis and s. salivarius in direct contact assays inhibit growth  of gas in a strain-specific manner and that s. salivarius, most likely via bacteriocin secretion, also exerts this effect in transwell experiments. utilizing scanning electron microscopy documentation, we identified the tested strains as potent biofilm producers except for gas m49. in mixed-species biofilms, s. salivarius dominated the gas strains, while s. oralis acted as initial colonizer, building the bottom layer in mixed biofilms and thereby allowing even gas m49 to form substantial biofilms on top. with the exception of  s. oralis, artificial saliva reduced single-species biofilms and allowed gas to dominate in mixed biofilms, although the overall two-layer structure was unchanged. when covered by s. oralis and s. salivarius biofilms, epithelial cells were protected from gas adherence, internalization, and cytotoxic effects. apparently, these species can have probiotic effects. the use of affymetrix array technology to assess hep-2 cell transcription levels revealed modest changes after exposure to s. oralis and s. salivarius biofilms which could explain some of the protective effects against gas attack. in summary, our study revealed a protection effect of respiratory tract bacteria against an important airway pathogen and allowed a first in vitro insight into local environmental processes  after gas enter the respiratory tract.

TI  == left atrial endocarditis as a rare complication of mitral valve endocarditis: a clinical case.
AB  == background: infective endocarditis (ie) is considered as a multifaceted problem in every aspect from etiology and presentation to diagnosis and management. early recognition of this disease and especially its complications, remain a critical task for the cardiologist. atrial endocarditis is a rare and sometimes unrecognized complication of mitral valve endocarditis. case presentation: we present a 48 year-old male patient who was admitted to our clinic because of recent onset of malaise, fever, jaundice and peripheral edema. important physical findings were peripheral stigmata of ie in addition to holosystolic murmur over the left sternal border. transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiophy revealed a severe eccentric mr due to a flailed posterior mitral valve caused by ie. the presence of atrial septal endocarditis caused by jet streaming was also observed. blood culture was positive for streptococcus oralis and antibiotic therapy was immediately initiated. considering the large burden of infective tissue, the patient was planned for an early surgical intervention. a minimally invasive resection of the atrial mass, direct closure of the defect, resection of the diseased portions of mitral leaflets and implantation of a biological mitral valve prosthesis was performed. intra-operative and histological findings confirmed provisional diagnosis by echocardiography. conclusions: together with comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation, attention should be placed on mural vegetations and excluded among all cases of mitral valve endocarditis, particularly those with severe eccentric regurgitant jets.

TI  == characterization of recombinant fluoroquinolone-resistant pneumococcus-like isolates.
AB  == fourteen fluoroquinolone-resistant streptococcal isolates with recombinant dna topoisomerase genes, preliminarily identified as pneumococci, were further characterized using phenotypic and genotypic approaches. phenotypic tests classified them as atypical pneumococci. phylogenetic relationships were analyzed by using the sequences of seven housekeeping alleles from these isolates and from isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis,  and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. four isolates grouped with s. pneumoniae, seven grouped with s. pseudopneumoniae, and three grouped with s. mitis. these results generally agreed with those obtained with an optochin susceptibility test and with the organization of the atp operon chromosomal region, encoding the f(o)f(1) h(+)-atpase (the target of optochin). all seven isolates grouping with s. pseudopneumoniae share the same spr1368-atpc-atpa gene order; all four grouping with s. pneumoniae share the spr1368-is1239-atpc-atpa order, and two out of the three grouping with s. mitis share the spr1284-atpc-atpa order. in addition, evidence for recombination within the seven housekeeping alleles of the s. pseudopneumoniae population was provided by several methods: the index of association (0.4598, p < 0.001), the pairwise homoplasy index, and the split-decomposition method. this study confirms the existence of pneumococci among the alpha-hemolytic streptococci with dna topoisomerase genes showing a mosaic structure and reveals a close relationship between atypical pneumococci and s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == daptomycin concentrations in valve tissue and vegetation in patients with bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == in a patient with mitral-aortic native-valve streptococcus oralis endocarditis, daptomycin concentrations in aortic and mitral valves were 8.6 and 30.8 mug/g, respectively, and 26 mug/g in the mitral vegetation. in the case of porcine-aortic-valve staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis, the daptomycin concentrations were 53.1 mug/g in the valve and 18.1 mug/g in perivalvular tissues. daptomycin achieved apparently adequate tissue concentrations. s. epidermidis was eradicated, whereas streptococcus oralis persisted, and its daptomycin mic displayed a 4-fold increase.

TI  == initial in vitro bacterial adhesion on dental restorative materials.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to evaluate initial bacterial adhesion  on several restorative materials with similar roughness. materials and methods: sixty cylindrical slabs were prepared from four restorative materials: zirconia (zr), alumina-toughened zirconia (al-zr), type iii gold alloy (au), and cp-titanium (ti). all the materials were polished until a mirror-like shine was achieved. the average surface roughness and topography were determined by atomic  force microscopy. contact angles were measured to calculate surface free energy by the sessile drop technique. after the formation of a salivary pellicle, s. sanguinis, s. gordonii, and s. oralis were inoculated onto the specimens and incubated for 4 h. quantification of the adherent bacteria was performed by crystal violet staining technique and resazurin reduction assay. one-way anova and tukey's post hoc test were adopted for statistical analysis. the level of significance was 0.05. results: the ra values determined with atomic force microscopy for all specimens were lower than 5 nm. surface free energy increased  in the order of al-zr, zr, ti, and au. differences were significant between the investigated materials in both crystal violet absorbance and fluorescence intensities. gold alloy showed the highest values for all bacterial strains (p<0.05). conclusions: zirconia, alumina-toughened zirconia, and titanium may be  more suitable than gold alloy as an abutment material with respect to the initial bacterial adhesion and subsequent advance of peri-implantitis.

TI  == streptococcus mutans protein synthesis during mixed-species biofilm development by high-throughput quantitative proteomics.
AB  == biofilms formed on tooth surfaces are comprised of mixed microbiota enmeshed in an extracellular matrix. oral biofilms are constantly exposed to environmental changes, which influence the microbial composition, matrix formation and expression of virulence. streptococcus mutans and sucrose are key modulators associated with the evolution of virulent-cariogenic biofilms. in this study, we  used a high-throughput quantitative proteomics approach to examine how s. mutans  produces relevant proteins that facilitate its establishment and optimal survival during mixed-species biofilms development induced by sucrose. biofilms of s. mutans, alone or mixed with actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis, were initially formed onto saliva-coated hydroxyapatite surface under carbohydrate-limiting condition. sucrose (1%, w/v) was then introduced to cause environmental changes, and to induce biofilm accumulation. multidimensional protein identification technology (mudpit) approach detected up to 60% of proteins encoded by s. mutans within biofilms. specific proteins associated with  exopolysaccharide matrix assembly, metabolic and stress adaptation processes were highly abundant as the biofilm transit from earlier to later developmental stages following sucrose introduction. our results indicate that s. mutans within a mixed-species biofilm community increases the expression of specific genes associated with glucan synthesis and remodeling (gtfbc, dexa) and glucan-binding  (gbpb) during this transition (p<0.05). furthermore, s. mutans up-regulates specific adaptation mechanisms to cope with acidic environments (f1f0-atpase system, fatty acid biosynthesis, branched chain amino acids metabolism), and molecular chaperones (groel). interestingly, the protein levels and gene expression are in general augmented when s. mutans form mixed-species biofilms (vs. single-species biofilms) demonstrating fundamental differences in the matrix assembly, survival and biofilm maintenance in the presence of other organisms. our data provide insights about how s. mutans optimizes its metabolism and adapts/survives within the mixed-species community in response to a dynamically changing environment. this reflects the intricate physiological processes linked  to expression of virulence by this bacterium within complex biofilms.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == regulation of neuraminidase expression in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic acid; neunac) is one of the most important carbohydrates for streptococcus pneumoniae due of its role as a carbon  and energy source, receptor for adhesion and invasion and molecular signal for promotion of biofilm formation, nasopharyngeal carriage and invasion of the lung. results: in this work, neunac and its metabolic derivative n-acetyl mannosamine (mannac) were used to analyze regulatory mechanisms of the neuraminidase locus expression. genomic and metabolic comparison to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis elucidates the metabolic association of the two amino sugars to different parts of the locus coding for the two main pneumococcal neuraminidases and confirms the substrate specificity of the respective abc transporters. quantitative gene expression analysis shows repression of the locus by glucose and induction of all predicted transcriptional units by mannac and neunac, each inducing with higher efficiency the operon encoding for the transporter with higher specificity for the respective amino sugar. cytofluorimetric analysis demonstrated enhanced surface exposure of nana on pneumococci grown in neunac and mannac and an activity assay allowed to quantify approximately twelve times as much neuraminidase activity on induced cells as opposed to glucose grown cells. conclusions: the present data increase the understanding of metabolic regulation  of the nanab locus and indicate that experiments aimed at the elucidation of the  relevance of neuraminidases in pneumococcal virulence should possibly not be carried out on bacteria grown in glucose containing media.

TI  == the enhanced pneumococcal lamp assay: a clinical tool for the diagnosis of meningitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive bacterial disease in developed and developing countries. we studied the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) technique to assess its suitability for detecting s. pneumoniae nucleic acid in cerebrospinal fluid (csf). methodology/principal findings: we established an improved lamp assay targeting the lyta gene (streptococcus pneumoniae [sp] lamp). the analytical specificity of the primers was validated by using 32 reference strains (10 streptococcus and seven non-streptococcus species) plus 25 clinical alpha-hemolytic streptococcal strains, including four s. pneumoniae strains and 21 other strains (3 s. oralis,  17 s. mitis, and one streptococcus species) harboring virulence factor-encoding genes (lyta or ply). within 30 minutes, the assay could detect as few as 10 copies of both purified dna and spiked csf specimens with greater sensitivity than conventional polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the linear determination range for this assay is 10 to 1,000,000 microorganisms per reaction mixture using real-time turbidimetry. we evaluated the clinical sensitivity and specificity of  the sp lamp assay using 106 randomly selected csf specimens from children with suspected meningitis in korea, china and vietnam. for comparison, csf specimens were also tested against conventional pcr and culture tests. the detection rate of the lamp method was substantially higher than the rates of pcr and culture tests. in this small sample, relative to the lamp assay, the clinical sensitivity of pcr and culture tests was 54.5% and 33.3%, respectively, while clinical specificity of the two tests was 100%. conclusions/significance: compared to pcr, sp lamp detected s. pneumoniae with higher analytical and clinical sensitivity. this specific and sensitive lamp method offers significant advantages for screening patients on a population basis and for diagnosis in clinical settings.

TI  == uv-c-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

TI  == inhibitory effect on in vitro streptococcus oralis biofilm of a soda-lime glass containing silver nanoparticles coating on titanium alloy.
AB  == this paper reports the effect of soda-lime-glass-nag coating on the viability of  an in vitro biofilm of streptococcus oralis. three strains (atcc 35037 and two clinical isolates from periodontitis patients) were grown on coated with glass, glass containing silver nanoparticles, and uncoated titanium alloy disks. two different methods were used to quantify biofilm formation abilities: crystal violet staining and determination of viable counts. the influence of the surface  morphology on the cell attachment was studied. the surface morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (sem) and using a profilometer. sem was also used to study the formation and the development of biofilm on the coated and uncoated disks. at least a >99.7% inocula reduction of biofilm respect to titanium disks and also to glass coated disks was observed in the glass-nag coated disks for all the studied strains. a quantitative evaluation of the release of silver was conducted in vitro to test whether and to what extend the biocidal agent (silver) could leach from the coating. these findings suggest that the biofilm formation of s. oralis strains is highly inhibited by the glass-nag and may be useful for materials which require durable antibacterial effect on their surfaces, as it is the case of dental implants.

TI  == osteopontin reduces biofilm formation in a multi-species model of dental biofilm.
AB  == background: combating dental biofilm formation is the most effective means for the prevention of caries, one of the most widespread human diseases. among the chemical supplements to mechanical tooth cleaning procedures, non-bactericidal adjuncts that target the mechanisms of bacterial biofilm formation have gained increasing interest in recent years. milk proteins, such as lactoferrin, have been shown to interfere with bacterial colonization of saliva-coated surfaces. we here study the effect of bovine milk osteopontin (opn), a highly phosphorylated whey glycoprotein, on a multispecies in vitro model of dental biofilm. while considerable research effort focuses on the interaction of opn with mammalian cells, there are no data investigating the influence of opn on bacterial biofilms. methodology/principal findings: biofilms consisting of streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus downei and streptococcus sanguinis were grown in a flow cell system that permitted in situ microscopic analysis. crystal violet staining showed significantly less biofilm formation in the presence of opn, as compared to biofilms grown without opn or biofilms grown in the presence of caseinoglycomacropeptide, another phosphorylated milk protein. confocal microscopy revealed that opn bound to the surface of bacterial cells and reduced mechanical stability of the biofilms without affecting cell viability. the bacterial composition of the biofilms, determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, changed considerably in the presence of opn. in particular, colonization of s. mitis, the best biofilm former in the model, was reduced dramatically. conclusions/significance: opn strongly reduces the amount of biofilm formed in a well-defined laboratory model of acidogenic dental biofilm. if a similar effect can be observed in vivo, opn might serve as a valuable adjunct to mechanical tooth cleaning procedures.

TI  == overcoming drug resistance with alginate oligosaccharides able to potentiate the  action of selected antibiotics.
AB  == the uncontrolled, often inappropriate use of antibiotics has resulted in the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, with major cost implications for both united states and european health care systems. we describe the utilization of a low-molecular-weight oligosaccharide nanomedicine (oligog),  based on the biopolymer alginate, which is able to perturb multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria by modulating biofilm formation and persistence and reducing resistance to antibiotic treatment, as evident using conventional and robotic mic screening and microscopic analyses of biofilm structure. oligog increased (up to  512-fold) the efficacy of conventional antibiotics against important mdr pathogens, including pseudomonas, acinetobacter, and burkholderia spp., appearing to be effective with several classes of antibiotic (i.e., macrolides, beta-lactams, and tetracyclines). using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and scanning electron microscopy (sem), increasing concentrations (2%, 6%, and 10%) of alginate oligomer were shown to have a direct effect on the quality of the biofilms produced and on the health of the cells within that biofilm. biofilm growth was visibly weakened in the presence of 10% oligog, as seen by decreased biomass and increased intercellular spaces, with the bacterial cells themselves becoming distorted and uneven due to apparently damaged cell membranes. this report demonstrates the feasibility of reducing the tolerance of wound biofilms to antibiotics with the use of specific alginate preparations.

TI  == antibacterial effects of blackberry extract target periodontopathogens.
AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (bbe) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. material and methods: the effects of whole and fractionated bbe on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. the bactericidal effects of whole bbe against fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (cfus). cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (okf6) cells. results: bbe at 350-1400 mug/ml reduced the metabolic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, f. nucleatum and streptococcus mutans. the reduced metabolic activity observed for f. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of cfus following exposure to bbe for  as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. an anthocyanin-enriched fraction of bbe reduced the metabolic activity of f. nucleatum, but not of p. gingivalis or s. mutans, suggesting the contribution of  species-specific agents in the whole bbe. oral epithelial cell viability was not  reduced following exposure to whole bbe (2.24-1400 mug/ml) for </= 6 h. conclusion: bbe alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. the specific antibacterial properties of bbe shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.

AB  == we recently described the novel species streptococcus tigurinus sp. nov. belonging to the streptococcus mitis group. the type strain az_3a(t) of s. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. according to its phenotypic and molecular characteristics, s. tigurinus is most closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus infantis. accurate identification of s. tigurinus is facilitated by 16s rrna gene analysis. we retrospectively analyzed our 16s rrna gene molecular database, which contains sequences of all clinical samples obtained in our institute since 2003. we detected 17 16s rrna gene sequences which were assigned to s. tigurinus, including sequences from the 3 s. tigurinus strains described previously. s. tigurinus originated from normally sterile body sites, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or heart valves, of 14 patients and was initially detected by culture or broad-range 16s rrna gene pcr, followed by sequencing. the 14 patients had serious invasive infections, i.e., infective endocarditis (n = 6), spondylodiscitis (n = 3), bacteremia (n = 2), meningitis (n = 1), prosthetic joint infection (n = 1), and thoracic empyema (n = 1). to evaluate the presence of streptococcus tigurinus in the endogenous oral microbial flora, we screened saliva specimens of 31 volunteers. after selective growth, alpha-hemolytic growing colonies were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and subsequent molecular methods. s. tigurinus was not identified among 608 strains analyzed. these data indicate that s. tigurinus is not widely distributed in the oral cavity. in conclusion, s. tigurinus is a novel agent of invasive infections, particularly infective endocarditis.

TI  == streptococcus oralis coaggregation receptor polysaccharides induce inflammatory responses in human aortic endothelial cells.
AB  == streptococcus oralis, belonging to the oral viridans group streptococci, has been detected in human cardiovascular lesions including infective endocarditis and atheromatous plaques. the organism has coaggregation receptor polysaccharides (rps) on the cell wall, which function as receptors for surface adhesins on other members of the oral biofilm community. the present study examined the capacity of s. oralis rps to induce inflammatory responses in human aortic endothelial cells  (haecs). purified rps was used to stimulate haecs, and the induction of cytokines, adhesion molecules and toll-like receptors (tlrs) was examined. involvement of rps in haec invasion by s. oralis was also examined. rps-stimulated haecs produced more cytokines (interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 than non-stimulated haecs. the messenger rna (mrna) expression of cytokines and adhesion molecules in rps-stimulated haecs increased markedly compared with that  in non-stimulated haecs. upregulation of tlr-2 mrna expression was demonstrated in rps-stimulated haecs. moreover, tlr-2 mrna expression and cytokine production  were reduced by the incubation of haecs with inhibitors against p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappab. an rps-defective mutant of s. oralis showed greater invasion into haecs than an rps-possessing strain. however, haecs invaded by the rps-defective mutant produced less cytokines than haecs invaded by the rps-possessing strain, indicating that rps can stimulate haecs intracellularly. these results suggest that s. oralis rps may be an important contributor to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases such as infective endocarditis and atherosclerosis.

TI  == immune reactivity of four monoclonal and two polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant pneumococcal surface adhesin a.
AB  == in this study four monoclonal antibodies (mabs) and two polyclonal antisera were  raised against pneumococcal surface adhesion a (psaa), a 37 kda cell wall protein, and were characterized. the mabs were purified, isotyped, and epitope mapped with peptide microarrays. all monoclonals and polyclonals underwent testing in immunodot blot, western blot, and elisa assays to assess their specificity. all monoclonal antibodies belonged to isotype igg1 kappa. peptide microarray mapping identified two likely epitopes, which could not be confirmed using synthetic peptides of the identified amino acid sequence. all four mabs detected the 53 pneumococcal serotypes tested in the immunodot blot and only reacted with streptococcus pseudopneumoniae in cross-reactivity studies by western blot. the polyclonal antisera also recognized all tested pneumococcal serotypes and cross-reacted with s. pseudopneumoniae and streptococcus oralis by  western blot. the mabs cross-reacted with s. pseudopneumoniae in the elisa. both  polyclonal antisera cross-reacted with all isolates tested in the elisa. these antisera should be suitable to establish a diagnostic elisa platform for pneumococcal antigen detection with polyclonal antisera as the capture antibody.  the specificity of the four mabs appears to be high as they only recognized s. pneumoniae and s. pseudopneumoniae. however, further testing of closely related streptococcal species is necessary to confirm this finding.

AB  == inclusion complex between water-soluble betacd-grafted chitosan derivatives (qcd-g-cs) and eugenol (eg) was investigated as a new type of mucoadhesive drug carrier. the qcd-g-css were synthesized with various betacd moieties ranging from 5 to 23%. spontaneous inclusion complex of these derivatives and eg were found and confirmed by ftir and simulation study. self-aggregated formations of qcd-g-cs were found, according to fluorescence and tem studies, where the formations were preferable for qcd11g-cs and qcd5-g-cs. eg can be included in both betacd hydrophobic cavity and hydrophobic core of qcd-g-cs self-aggregates,  resulting in varying entrapment efficiencies. degree of qcd substitution on qcd-g-cs plays an important role on their physical properties, due to steric hindrance. the qcd11-g-cs showed excellent mucoadhesion, compared to the qcd5-g-cs and qcd23-g-cs. moreover, the inclusion complex between qcd-g-cs and eg tend to express higher antimicrobial activities against candida albicans, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mutans, than the native qcd-g-cs.

TI  == bacterial viability on surface-modified resin-based dental restorative materials.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to investigate the viability of early colonizers on the surfaces of resin-based dental restorative materials modified with low-surface tension active agents in comparison with the unmodified material. a novel polymeric sorption material, loaded with two low-surface tension gamma(l) active agents (hydroxyfunctional polydimethylsiloxane and polydimethylsiloxane) or a polymerizable active agent (silicone polyether acrylate), was used to modify commonly formulated experimental dental resin composites. the non-modified resin was used as the standard (st). the viability of actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguinis on water-stored, polished, and  human saliva pellicle-coated specimens was determined using a fluorescence microscope after 8 and 24h. total, vital, and non-vital cells were calculated from the microscopic images by counting pixels per colour. means, standard deviations, univariate anova and multiple comparisons with post hoc scheffe's tests were calculated. t-test was done to compare 8-h and 24-h bacteria counts. for all tests p<0.05 was chosen. null hypothesis: the test materials and the standard did not differ either in the total bacterial counts or in the respective bacterium's viability after 8 or 24h. the test materials modified with the silicone polyether acrylate showed lower total bacteria count after 8 or 24h than st. but all test materials had significantly fewer vital cells after 8 or 24h compared to st. the contact angle did not influence bacterial adhesion, but low total sfe and a low polar term of sfe resulted in fewer bacteria. the material's  chemistry also affected the total and vital cell counts. different bacteria viabilities needed to be explored to obtain relevant information regarding bacterial adhesion on dental composite resins. the novel sorption material loaded with low gamma(l) active agents or with a low gamma(l) polymerizable silicone polyether acrylate used to modify the chemistry of the test materials was appropriate to reduce bacterial adhesion or cell viability, respectively.

TI  == influence of orthodontic treatment on oral streptococci.
AB  == objective of this study is to evaluate the changes of the oral microbial flora, concentrating on the oral streptococci, after the first 3 and 6 months of orthodontic treatment. materials and methods: 40 patients, aged 7-17, that presented for orthodontic treatment between april and september 2010 in the department of orthodontics and dento-facial orthopedics of "carol davila" university of medicine and pharmacy, bucharest have been selected. according to the protocol, coronary and subgingival plaque was collected from the dental surface before starting any orthodontic treatment (t0), 3 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t1) and 6 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t2). the samples were studied in cantacuzino national institute of research-development for microbiology and immunology [isolation on columbia agar  with 5% sheep blood, identification on morphotinctorial, growth and biochemical characteristics using api 20 strep (biomerieux)]. bacterial concentration (colony-forming units/sample = cfu/sample) for the aerobic and anaerobic flora was calculated by the serial dilution method of counting bacteria. results: 106 strains of oral streptococci were isolated from dental plaque, belonging to 6 species (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus acidominimus),  37 strains of oral streptococci in patients from group i (t0), 40 strains from group ii (t1) and 29 strains of oral streptococci from group iii (t2). after 3 months (t1) the aerobic bacteria percentage, detected at a concentration between  10(5) and 10(6), increased from 30 to 38.2%. the percentage of patients with a bacterial concentration higher than 10(6) cfu/sample increased from 5% to 8.8%. the samples colected at t2 (patients examined after 6 months of orthodonic treatment) presented a lower bacterial concentration, as compared to group ii (t1). the most common isolated species of streptococci were s. salivarius, s. oralis and s. mutans (37.5%, 22.5% and 10%), whose frequency increased after 3 months of treatment to 41.14%, 32.3% and respectively 14.4%, returning after 6 months of treatment at values similar to those recorded before beginning the orthodontic treatment. conclusions: presence of orthodontic appliances may produce a transitory increase of bacterial concentration (cfu/sample) and isolation rate of oral streptococci, returning to the level prior to the application of these devices after a time interval of several months.

TI  == sequetyping: serotyping streptococcus pneumoniae by a single pcr sequencing strategy.
AB  == the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines necessitates continued monitoring of circulating strains to assess vaccine efficacy and replacement serotypes. conventional serological methods are costly, labor-intensive, and prone to misidentification, while current dna-based methods have limited serotype coverage requiring multiple pcr primers. in this study, a computer algorithm was  developed to interrogate the capsulation locus (cps) of vaccine serotypes to locate primer pairs in conserved regions that border variable regions and could differentiate between serotypes. in silico analysis of cps from 92 serotypes indicated that a primer pair spanning the regulatory gene cpsb could putatively amplify 84 serotypes and differentiate 46. this primer set was specific to streptococcus pneumoniae, with no amplification observed for other species, including s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. pseudopneumoniae. one hundred thirty-eight  pneumococcal strains covering 48 serotypes were tested. of 23 vaccine serotypes included in the study, most (19/22, 86%) were identified correctly at least to the serogroup level, including all of the 13-valent conjugate vaccine and other replacement serotypes. reproducibility was demonstrated by the correct sequetyping of different strains of a serotype. this novel sequence-based method  employing a single pcr primer pair is cost-effective and simple. furthermore, it  has the potential to identify new serotypes that may evolve in the future.

AB  == background: benzathine penicillin g every 3 weeks is the standard protocol for secondary prophylaxis for recurrent rheumatic fever. objective: assess the effect of benzathine penicillin g on streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus oralis in patients with cardiac valvular disease due to rheumatic fever receiving secondary prophylaxis. methods: oral streptococci were evaluated before (baseline) and after 7 days (day 7) with benzathine penicillin g in 100 patients receiving routine secondary rheumatic fever prophylaxis. saliva samples were evaluated for  colony count and presence of s. sanguinis and s. oralis. chewing-stimulated saliva samples were serially diluted and plated onto both nonselective and selective 5% sheep blood agar containing penicillin g. the species were identified using conventional biochemical tests. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined with the etest. results: no statistical differences were found in the presence of s. sanguinis comparing baseline and day 7 (p = 0.62). however, the existing number of positive cultures of s. oralis on day 7 after benzathine penicillin g presented a significant increase compared to  baseline (p = 0.04). no statistical difference was found between baseline and day 7 concerning the number of s. sanguinis or s. oralis cfu/ml and median minimal inhibitory concentrations. conclusion: this study showed that benzathine penicillin g every 3 weeks did not change the colonization by s. sanguinis, but increased colonization of s. oralis on day 7 of administration. therefore, susceptibility of streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus oralis to penicillin  g was not modified during the penicillin g routine secondary rheumatic fever prophylaxis.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == zoocin a and lauricidin in combination reduce streptococcus mutans growth in a multispecies biofilm.
AB  == dental caries is the most prevalent human infection. it is a multifactorial disease in which the microbial composition of dental plaque plays a major role in the development of clinical symptoms. the bacteria most often implicated in the development of caries are that group of streptococci referred to as the mutans streptococci, in particular streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus. one  approach to the prevention of caries is to reduce the numbers of mutans streptococci in plaque to a level insufficient to support demineralization of the tooth. in this study, zoocin a, a peptidoglycan hydrolase, combined with lauricidin, a cell membrane active lipid, was shown over a 72 h period to selectively suppress the growth of s. mutans in a triple species biofilm. growth  of the non-target species streptococcus oralis and actinomyces viscosus was not inhibited. in treated systems the amount of extracellular polysaccharide matrix produced was much reduced as determined by use of fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated wheat germ agglutinin. the ph of treated biofilms remained above neutral as opposed to a value of 4.3 in untreated controls. we conclude that use  of antimicrobial compounds that specifically target cariogenic bacteria should be further explored.

TI  == the exopolysaccharide matrix modulates the interaction between 3d architecture and virulence of a mixed-species oral biofilm.
AB  == virulent biofilms are responsible for a range of infections, including oral diseases. all biofilms harbor a microbial-derived extracellular-matrix. the exopolysaccharides (eps) formed on tooth-pellicle and bacterial surfaces provide  binding sites for microorganisms; eventually the accumulated eps enmeshes microbial cells. the metabolic activity of the bacteria within this matrix leads  to acidification of the milieu. we explored the mechanisms through which the streptococcus mutans-produced eps-matrix modulates the three-dimensional (3d) architecture and the population shifts during morphogenesis of biofilms on a saliva-coated-apatitic surface using a mixed-bacterial species system. concomitantly, we examined whether the matrix influences the development of ph-microenvironments within intact-biofilms using a novel 3d in situ ph-mapping technique. data reveal that the production of the eps-matrix helps to create spatial heterogeneities by forming an intricate network of exopolysaccharide-enmeshed bacterial-islets (microcolonies) through localized cell-to-matrix interactions. this complex 3d architecture creates compartmentalized acidic and eps-rich microenvironments throughout the biofilm, which triggers the dominance of pathogenic s. mutans within a mixed-species system. the establishment of a 3d-matrix and eps-enmeshed microcolonies were largely mediated by the s. mutans gtfb/gtfc genes, expression of which was enhanced in the presence of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis. acidic pockets were found only in the interiors of bacterial-islets that are protected by eps, which impedes rapid neutralization by buffer (ph 7.0). as a result, regions of low ph (<5.5) were detected at specific locations along the surface of attachment. resistance to chlorhexidine was enhanced in cells within eps-microcolony complexes compared to those outside such structures within the biofilm. our results illustrate the critical interaction between matrix architecture and ph heterogeneity in the 3d environment. the formation of structured acidic-microenvironments in close proximity to the apatite-surface is  an essential factor associated with virulence in cariogenic-biofilms. these observations may have relevance beyond the mouth, as matrix is inherent to all biofilms.

TI  == autoinducer-2 influences interactions amongst pioneer colonizing streptococci in  oral biofilms.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis are among the first bacterial species to colonize clean tooth surfaces. both produce autoinducer-2 (ai-2): a family of inter-convertible cell-cell signal molecules synthesized by the luxs enzyme. the overall aim of this work was to determine whether ai-2 alters interspecies interactions between s. gordonii dl1 and s. oralis 34 within dual-species biofilms in flowing human saliva. based upon ai-2 bioluminescence assays, s. gordonii dl1 produced more ai-2 activity than s. oralis 34 in batch culture, and both were able to remove ai-2 activity from solution. in single-species, saliva-fed flowcell systems, s. oralis 34 formed scant biofilms that were similar to the luxs mutant. conversely, s. gordonii dl1 formed confluent biofilms while the luxs mutant formed architecturally distinct biofilms that possessed twofold greater biovolume than the wild-type. supplementing saliva with 0.1-10 nm chemically synthesized ai-2 (csai-2) restored the s. gordonii dl1  luxs biofilm phenotype to that which was similar to the wild-type; above or below this concentration range, biofilms were architecturally similar to that formed by the luxs mutant. in dual-species biofilms, s. gordonii dl1 was always more abundant than s. oralis 34. compared with dual-species, wild-type biofilms, the biovolume occupied by s. oralis 34 was reduced by greater than sevenfold when neither species produced ai-2. the addition of 1 nm csai-2 to the dual-species luxs-luxs mutant biofilms re-established the biofilm phenotype to resemble that of the wild-type pair. thus, this work demonstrates that ai-2 can alter the biofilm structure and composition of pioneering oral streptococcal biofilms. this may influence the subsequent succession of other species into oral biofilms and the ecology of dental plaque.

AB  == mycotic aneurysms located in the tibioperoneal trunk are extremely rare, with only a few cases reported in the literature. because of their infrequency and clinical presentations mimicking other etiologies, clinicians generally do not arrive at the diagnosis until the diameter becomes large enough to detect pulsation. we herein report a case of a 52-year-old male with an aneurysm of the  tibioperoneal trunk resulting from infective endocarditis. his early clinical presentation was acute compartment syndrome of unknown cause, and a fasciotomy was performed by orthopedists who did not recognize the underlying aneurysm. later, enhanced computed tomography revealed that an irregularly shaped aneurysm  existed in his right tibioperoneal trunk. after the sepsis was controlled with the use of systemic antibiotics, resection of the aneurysm was performed in advance of cardiac surgery. no clinical symptoms due to ischemia were observed without any revascularization. postoperative computed tomography demonstrated fine enhancement of the peroneal and post-tibial arteries via collaterals.

TI  == structural determinants of actinomyces sortase srtc2 required for membrane localization and assembly of type 2 fimbriae for interbacterial coaggregation and oral biofilm formation.
AB  == as a pioneer colonizer of the oral cavity, actinomyces oris expresses proteinaceous pili (also called fimbriae) to mediate the following two key events in biofilm formation: adherence to saliva deposits on enamel and interbacterial associations. assembly of type 2 fimbriae that directly facilitate coaggregation  with oral streptococci and actinomyces biofilm development requires the class c sortase srtc2. although the general sortase-associated mechanisms have been elucidated, several structural attributes unique to the class c sortases require  functional investigation. mutational studies reported here suggest that the n-terminal transmembrane (tm) region of srtc2, predicted to contain a signal peptide sequence, is cleaved off the mature protein and that this processing is critical for the proper integration of the enzyme at the cytoplasmic membrane, which is mediated by the extended hydrophobic c terminus containing a tm domain and a cytoplasmic tail. deletion of this putative tm or the entire cytoplasmic domain abolished the enzyme localization and functionality. alanine substitution  of the conserved catalytic cys-his dyad abrogated the srtc2 enzymatic activity. in contrast, mutations designed to alter a "lid" domain that covers the catalytic pocket of a class c sortase showed no effect on enzyme activity. finally, each of the deleterious mutations that affected srtc2 activity or membrane localization also eliminated actinomyces species biofilm development and bacterial coaggregation with streptococci. we conclude that the n terminus of srtc2, which  contains the signal sequence, is required for proper protein translocation and maturation, while the extended c-terminal hydrophobic region serves as a stable membrane anchor for proper enzyme functionality.

AB  == background: surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. the aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and  the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the mann-whitney u test. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. results: mean  total dna probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (p <0.01). precleaning edentate biofilms  had higher counts and proportions of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of tannerella forsythia, selenomonas noxia, and neisseria mucosa. by day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day  7 (p <0.01). succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. both groups demonstrated increased proportions of s. mitis and s. oralis by day 1. n.  mucosa, veillonella parvula, and eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. conclusions: "mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.

AB  == bacterial infection associated with the use of medical or dental devices is a serious concern. although devices made of ethylene vinyl acetate (eva) are often  used in the oral cavity, there are no established standards for their storage. we investigated bacterial survival on eva sheets under various storage conditions to establish a standard for hygienic storage of such dental devices. bacterial counts were evaluated, which showed a significant decrease after washing with sterilized water, mechanical brushing and rinsing, and using mouthguard cleaner as compared to untreated samples. in addition, no bacteria were detected on samples stored 2 days or longer in a ventilated environment, whereas they were detected for up to 14 days on samples without any cleaning stored in a closed environment. bacterial counts for the untreated samples gradually declined, while surviving bacteria on samples treated with sterilized water and mechanical brushing showed a rapid decrease. additionally, bacterial identification using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) revealed that streptococcus oralis was dominantly detected on salivary samples after 14 days of storage among both two subjects. for effective hygienic storage of dental devices made of eva, washing with sterilized water is important to remove absorbed salivary compounds along with storage in a ventilated environment.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dentine and pulp extracellular matrix extracts.
AB  == aim: to determine whether extracellular matrix (ecm) preparations from pulp (pecm) and dentine (decm) possess antimicrobial activity. methodology: dentine and pulp ecm preparations were isolated with 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  (edta), ph 7.2 and sequential use of 0.5mol l(-1) nacl, ph 11.7 and 0.1mol l(-1)  tartaric acid, ph 2.0, respectively, with protease inhibitor inclusion throughout. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis and enterococcus faecalis was assessed using turbidity as a measure of bacteria growth. the cytotoxicity of the extracts on primary pulp cells was also  determined by lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) release. statistical analysis of data was performed using paired student's t-tests. results: extracellular matrix extracts from the pulp and dentine showed antibacterial activity against three types of anaerobic bacteria associated with dental disease (p< 0.05). the ecm extracts demonstrated no significant cytotoxic effect on pulpal cells at the concentrations used for antibacterial activity. conclusions: the bacteriostatic antibacterial activity of pecm and decm indicates that the release of these matrix molecules from pulp and dentine may contribute to defence responses during dental disease, treatment and repair.

TI  == streptococcus pseudopneumoniae identification by pherotype: a method to assist understanding of a potentially emerging or overlooked pathogen.
AB  == the recent identification of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae (pseudopneumococcus)  has complicated classification schemes within members of the "mitis" streptococcal group. accurate differentiation of this species is necessary for understanding its disease potential and identification in clinical settings. this work described the use of the competence-stimulatory peptide comc sequence for identification of s. pseudopneumoniae. comc sequences from clinical sources were  determined for 17 strains of s. pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus oralis. an additional 58 comc sequences from a range of sources were included to understand the diversity and suitability of this protein as a diagnostic marker for species identification. we identified three pherotypes for  this species, delineated csp6.1 (10/14, 79%), csp6.3 (3/14, 21%), and sk674 (1/14, 7%). pseudopneumococcal comc sequences formed a discrete cluster within those of other oral streptococci. this suggests that the comc sequence could be used to identify s. pseudopneumoniae, thus simplifying the study of the pathogenic potential of this organism. to avoid confusion between pneumococcal and pseudopneumococcal pherotypes, we have renamed the competence pherotype csp6.1, formerly reported as an "atypical" pneumococcus, cspps1 to reflect its occurrence in s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == cell surface proteins in s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis.
AB  == background and objectives: streptococcus pneumoniae, a major human pathogen, is closely related to the commensal species s. mitis and s. oralis. s. pneumoniae surface proteins are implicated in virulence and host interaction of this species, but many of them have recently been detected in s. mitis b6 in silico. we tested for the presence of such genes usinga set of eight s. mitis and eleven  s. oralis strains from different geographic locations. materials and methods: an  oligonucleotide microarray was designed based on the genomes of s. pneumoniae r6  and tigr4 as well as s. mitis b6 to include 63 cell surface proteins. the s. pneumoniae genes encoding neuraminidases, hyaluronidase and pneumolysin were also included. in addition to comparative genomic hybridization experiments, homologues were identified in silico in the genome of s. oralis uo5. results and  conclusions: the results document that many s. pneumoniae related surface proteins are ubiquitously present among the mitis group of streptococci. all 19 samples hybridized with the pava probe representing a gene important for adherence and invasion of s. pneumoniae. only eight genes were not recognized in  any strain, including the s. pneumoniae pcpc gene as the only virulence gene of the s. pneumoniae core genome.the fact that only 12 out of 26 genes present in the s. oralis uo5 genome could be detected by microarray analysis confirms the sequence variation of surface components.

TI  == amoxicillin-resistant oral streptococci identified in dental plaque specimens from healthy japanese adults.
AB  == background: infective endocarditis (ie) is known to be a life-threatening disease and invasive dental procedures are considered to be important factors. oral amoxicillin (ampc) is widely used for prophylaxis in patients with heart disorders who are at risk for ie. however, there is only limited information regarding the inhibition of oral bacteria by ampc. methods and results: dental plaque specimens were obtained from 120 healthy japanese adult subjects, then diluted and streaked onto selective medium for oral streptococci. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of ampc was evaluated using a macro-dilution method by clinical laboratory standard institute (2006). seven strains with an mic of ampc of 16mug/ml or more were isolated from 5 subjects. the bacterial species were confirmed by sequence analysis of 16s rrna from each strain, which demonstrated that most were streptococcus sanguinis, followed by streptococcus oralis. dental plaque specimens collected from these 5 subjects again after an interval of 2-3 months possessed no strains with an mic of ampc of 16mug/ml or more. conclusions: these findings suggest that strains with a high mic of ampc are present in the oral cavities of japanese adults, though they may be transient rather than inhabitants.

TI  == molecular analysis of 16s rrna genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  == purpose: small subunit rrna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque  of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. materials and  methods: template dna prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16s rrna bacterial and archaeal genes. amplicons were cloned, sequenced,  and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the  microorganisms present. results: two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11  phyla, including members of the uncultivable tm7, sr1, and chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate synergistetes and spirochaetes. dialister invisus, filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. dialister invisus and f nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms.  the archaeal species, methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. conclusions: these findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == oral microbial biofilm stimulation of epithelial cell responses.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. however, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. this report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. monoinfection biofilms were developed with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii,  fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial  species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, okf4, for up to 24h. gro-1alpha, il1alpha, il-6, il-8, tgfalpha, fractalkine, mip-1alpha, and ip-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. p. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines,  except mip-1alpha. generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited gro-1alpha, tgfalpha, and fractalkine production, while f. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in il-1alpha, il-6, il-8, and ip-10. a. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of il-6, il-8 and ip-10. the oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. the results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.

AB  == purpose: to evaluate the effect of beryllium (be(2+)) on chemical elements of cell membrane and h2o2 production of streptococcus oralis (s.oralis), thus to explore the microbiologic mechanisms of periodontal diseases which may occur after prosthodontic treatment. methods: s.oralis was put into artificial saliva with different be(2+) concentration (5mg/l, 10mg/l, 20mg/l and 40mg/l) and anaerobic cultured for 24 hours. the amount of chemical elements in the membrane  of s.oralis were tested with x-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy, and the h(2)o(2) produced by s.oralis was detected with abts-hrp. the data were analyzed  with one-way anova using spss 11.0 software package. results: the amount of calcium in the cell membrane of beryllium treated s. oralis decreased, while the  amount of phosphorus increased. natrium increased with the increase of be(2+) in  the culture, but changed contrarily when s. oralis was treated with 20mg/l be(2+). h(2)o(2) produced by s. oralis reduced when the concentration of be(2+) was at 40mg/l(p<0.05). conclusions: beryllium affects the amount of chemical elements in cell membrane and h(2)o(2) production of s. oralis, which may result  in a disturbance in the microecologic balance of subgingival microbes after proshodontic treatments and eventually contribute to periodontal diseases.

TI  == in vitro interaction of chronic wound bacteria in biofilms.
AB  == objective: to use in vitro biofilm models of wound bacterial isolates and compare the biofilms produced for different combinations of wound bacterial species. method: in vitro biofilms, generated by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus oralis and micrococcus luteus in microtitre plates and a constant depth film fermentor (cdff), were studied. the tested isolates all originated from chronic venous leg ulcers. biofilms of individual and dual combinations of these species were generated in microtitre plate wells at 37 degrees c for 24-96 hours and also in the cdff for 7 days. the extent of biofilm  formation from these systems was then measured using crystal violet staining and/or total viable counts. results: all the chronic wound bacteria formed biofilms (both individually and in mixed culture) in these models. in mixed species microtitre plate biofilms, both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus appeared to antagonise biofilm formation by s. oralis and m. luteus, with p. aeruginosa completely inhibiting the growth of these organisms. similar effects were evident in the cdff model, when all four bacterial species were added simultaneously, with m. luteus being 'out-competed' by the other organisms present and occurring  at numbers at the limits of detection; however, there was an apparent increase in the numbers of s. oralis compared with its single culture equivalent. conclusion: the study highlighted differences in biofilm formation ability for the tested species in both closed and open model systems. using dual species biofilms, distinct species antagonism was observed with apparent antagonism of pathogenic species over 'commensal' ones. such a finding provides insight into possible bacterial interactions during development of 'non-healing' wound biofilms.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in adult down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the subgingival microbiota in down syndrome and non-down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. material and methods: a total of 44 down syndrome, 66 non-down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. this involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the kruskal-wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within down syndrome and non-down syndrome subject groups were quantified using pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. results: down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than  non-down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). most microbial species were present in down  syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of selenomonas noxia, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis in down syndrome subjects  compared with non-down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of treponema socranskii in down syndrome subjects compared with non-down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of streptococcus constellatus in down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of t. socranskii than down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). higher subgingival proportions of s. constellatus, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, s. noxia  and prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42)  and higher proportions of actinomyces naeslundii ii and actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in down syndrome adults. conclusion: individuals with down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. these findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in down syndrome.

TI  == the cariogenic characters of xylitol-resistant and xylitol-sensitive streptococcus mutans in biofilm formation with salivary bacteria.
AB  == streptococcus mutans metabolize carbohydrates, such as glucose and sucrose, to produce acid and enhance biofilm formation with the early colonizing bacteria to  induce dental caries. xylitol has been used as a reliable substitute for carbohydrate to inhibit the acid production of s. mutans. however, long-term xylitol consumption leads to the emergence of xylitol-resistance in s. mutans. the aim of this study was to investigate the cariogenic trait of xylitol-resistant (x(r)) s. mutans using biofilm formation and coaggregation of xylitol-sensitive (x(s)) and x(r) s. mutans with salivary bacteria and their glucosyltransferases expression. when x(s) or x(r) s. mutans were incubated in brain heart infusion broth with bacteria from human saliva, x(r)s. mutans exhibited reduction in biofilm formation in comparison to x(s) s. mutans. the coaggregation between x(r) s. mutans and s, gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis or s. sanguinis was less pronounced than that of x(s) s. mutans in the presence of sucrose. however, there was no difference in the coaggregation between x(r) and x(s) s. mutans in the sucrose-free condition. the level of gtfb and gtfc mrna expression of x(r) s. mutans was lower than that of x(s) s. mutans, whilst the level of gtfd mrna expression did not differ between the two strains. the reduction of biofilm formation in x(s) s. mutans due to decrease in glucosyltransferases expression suggests that x(r) s. mutans may be less cariogenic than x(s) s. mutans.

TI  == synergistic interaction between candida albicans and commensal oral streptococci  in a novel in vitro mucosal model.
AB  == candida albicans is a commensal colonizer of the gastrointestinal tract of humans, where it coexists with highly diverse bacterial communities. it is not clear whether this interaction limits or promotes the potential of c. albicans to become an opportunistic pathogen. here we investigate the interaction between c.  albicans and three species of streptococci from the viridans group, which are ubiquitous and abundant oral commensal bacteria. the ability of c. albicans to form biofilms with streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, or streptococcus gordonii was investigated using flow cell devices that allow abiotic biofilm formation under salivary flow. in addition, we designed a novel flow cell system that allows mucosal biofilm formation under conditions that mimic the environment in the oral and esophageal mucosae. it was observed that c. albicans and streptococci formed a synergistic partnership where c. albicans promoted the ability of streptococci to form biofilms on abiotic surfaces or on the surface of an oral mucosa analogue. the increased ability of streptococci to  form biofilms in the presence of c. albicans could not be explained by a growth-stimulatory effect since the streptococci were unaffected in their growth  in planktonic coculture with c. albicans. conversely, the presence of streptococci increased the ability of c. albicans to invade organotypic models of the oral and esophageal mucosae under conditions of salivary flow. moreover, characterization of mucosal invasion by the biofilm microorganisms suggested that the esophageal mucosa is more permissive to invasion than the oral mucosa. in summary, c. albicans and commensal oral streptococci display a synergistic interaction with implications for the pathogenic potential of c. albicans in the  upper gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

'smooth' implants showing high long-term success rates have successively been replaced by implants with rougher surfaces, designed to stimulate rapid osseointegration and promote tissue healing. if exposed in the oral cavity, rougher surfaces may promote bacterial adhesion leading to formation of microbial biofilms which can induce peri-implant inflammation. streptococcus oralis is an early colonizer of oral surfaces and has been recovered from titanium surfaces in vivo. the purpose of this study was to examine the adherence of clinical strains  of s. oralis to titanium with smooth or moderately rough surface topography and to determine the effect of a saliva- or serum-derived coating on this process. adherence was studied using a flow-cell system with confocal laser scanning microscopy, while putative adhesins were analysed using proteomics of bacterial cell wall proteins. this showed that adherence to moderately rough surfaces was greater than to smooth surfaces. serum did not promote binding of any of the studied s. oralis strains to titanium, whereas a saliva coating increased adherence in two of three strains tested. the higher level of adherence to the moderately rough surfaces was maintained even in the presence of a saliva coating. the s. oralis strains that bound to saliva expressed an lpxtg-linked protein which was not present in the non-adherent strain. thus strains of s. oralis differ in their capacity to bind to saliva-coated titanium and we propose  that this is due to differential expression of a novel adhesin.

TI  == surgical treatment of infective valve endocarditis in children with congenital heart disease.
AB  == objective: this study assesses surgical procedures, operative outcome, and early  and intermediate-term results of infective valve endocarditis in children with congenital heart disease. methods: seven consecutive children (five females, two  males; mean age, 10.8 years) who underwent surgery for infective valve endocarditis between 2006 and 2010 were included in the study. the aortic and mitral valves were affected in two and tricuspid in five patients. indications for operation included cardiac failure due to atrioventricular septal rupture, severe tricuspid valve insufficiency, and septic embolization in one, moderate valvular dysfunction with vegetations in three (two tricuspid, one mitral), and severe valvular dysfunction with vegetations in the other three patients (two tricuspid, one mitral). the pathological microorganism was identified in five patients. tricuspid valve repair was performed with ventricular septal defect (vsd) closure in five patients. two patients required mitral valve repair including one with additional aortic valve replacement. results: there were no operative deaths. actuarial freedom from recurrent infection at one and three years was 100%. early echocardiographic follow-up showed four patients to have mild atrioventricular valve regurgitation (three tricuspid and one mitral) and three had no valvular regurgitation. no leakage from the vsd closure or any valvular stenosis was detected postoperatively. conclusions: mitral and tricuspid valve repairs can be performed with low morbidity/mortality rates and satisfactory intermediate-term results in children with infective valve endocarditis.

TI  == antibiotic modulation of the plasminogen binding ability of viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the ability of viridans group streptococci to bind human plasminogen and its subsequent activation into plasmin may contribute to the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis (ie) by leading to a decreased stability of the streptococcal vegetation and facilitating dehiscence of emboli. at levels greater than or equal to their mics, penicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid are efficacious in the treatment of streptococcal endocarditis. however, at sub-mics, antibiotics can modulate the expression of bacterial genes, including virulence-associated genes, which can have counterproductive effects on the treatment of endocarditis. the effects of 1/8x and 1/4x mics of penicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid on the plasminogen binding ability of ie isolates streptococcus mitis 881/956, streptococcus oralis 12601, and streptococcus sanguinis 12403 were assessed phenotypically and the expression of plasminogen receptors alpha-enolase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase of s. oralis 12601 when exposed to 1/4x mic of penicillin, was analyzed through quantitative reverse transcription (qrt)-pcr. the plasminogen binding ability of s. mitis 881/956 and s. sanguinis 12403 remained unaffected by exposure to sub-mics of all of the antibiotics tested, while that of s. oralis 12601 was significantly enhanced by all of the antibiotics tested at sub-mics. qrt-pcr analysis of s. oralis 12601 demonstrated an upregulation of the eno and gapdh genes, indicating  an overexpression of plasminogen receptors. these findings suggest that for some  endocarditis isolates, the effect of antibiotic sub-mics, in addition to a reduced antibacterial effect, may influence the clinical response to nonsurgical  therapy. it remains difficult to accurately predict isolate responses to sub-mic  antimicrobials since there appears to be interspecies variation.

TI  == development of a real-time pcr assay for the specific detection and identification of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae using the reca gene.
AB  == we sequenced the evolutionarily conserved genes 16s rrna, atpd, tuf, and reca from streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis. phylogenetic analysis revealed that reca provided good resolution between these species, including discrimination of the novel species s. pseudopneumoniae. by contrast, the more conserved 16s rrna, tuf  and atpd are not sufficiently discriminatory. therefore, reca sequences were used to develop a real-time pcr assay with a locked nucleic acid-mediated taqman probe for the specific detection and identification of s. pseudopneumoniae. the pcr assay showed excellent specificity and a detection limit of <10 genome copies for the detection and identification of s. pseudopneumoniae strains, which makes it a promising tool for molecular identification and epidemiological studies. in conclusion, this article describes for the first time a pcr assay for the specific identification of s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == identification of interspecies interactions affecting porphyromonas gingivalis virulence phenotypes.
AB  == background: periodontitis is recognized as a complex polymicrobial disease, however, the impact of the bacterial interactions among the 700-1,000 different species of the oral microbiota remains poorly understood. we conducted an in vitro screen for oral bacteria that mitigate selected virulence phenotypes of the important periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis. method: we isolated and identified oral anaerobic bacteria from subgingival plaque of dental patients. when cocultured with p. gingivalis w83, specific isolates reduced the cytopathogenic effects of p. gingivalis on oral epithelial cells. result: in an initial screen of 103 subgingival isolates, we identified 19 distinct strains from nine species of bacteria (including actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and veilonella dispar) that protect oral epithelial  cells from p. gingivalis-induced cytotoxicity. we found that some of these strains inhibited p. gingivalis growth in plate assays through the production of  organic acids, whereas some decreased the gingipain activity of p. gingivalis in  coculture or mixing experiments. conclusion: in summary, we identified 19 strains isolated from human subgingival plaque that interacted with p. gingivalis, resulting in mitigation of its cytotoxicity to oral epithelial cells, inhibition  of growth, and/or reduction of gingipain activity. understanding the mechanisms of interaction between bacteria in the oral microbial community may lead to the development of new probiotic agents and new strategies for interrupting the development of periodontal disease.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of dentifrices containing the hydroalcoholic extract of the ripe fruit of eugenia uniflora l. (surinam cherry) on streptococcus oralis (atcc 10557) and lactobacillus casei (atcc 7469). five dentifrices were used: d1: containing hydroalcoholic extract of eugenia uniflora l.; d2: containing fluoride and hydroalcoholic extract of eugenia uniflora l.; d3: containing triclosan and hydroalcoholic extract of eugenia uniflora l; d4: containing triclosan, fluoride and hydroalcoholic extract of eugenia uniflora l.; d5: positive control (colgate total 12). to determine the antibacterial activity, the technique used was the minimum inhibitory concentration by the diffusion method in solid culture medium. at the concentration 0.05 g/ml, the best results were achieved with d1 (18 mm) and d4 (24 mm) on l.casei, and with d3 (19 mm) on s. oralis. the dentifrices d3 and d4 were found to have greater activity on the streptococcus oralis, while d4 and d1  were found to have greater activity on lactobaccilus casei. it is concluded that  dentifrices with eugenia uniflora l. have antimicrobial activity, suggesting that clinical trials should be conducted.

TI  == ph landscapes in a novel five-species model of early dental biofilm.
AB  == background: despite continued preventive efforts, dental caries remains the most  common disease of man. organic acids produced by microorganisms in dental plaque  play a crucial role for the development of carious lesions. during early stages of the pathogenetic process, repeated ph drops induce changes in microbial composition and favour the establishment of an increasingly acidogenic and aciduric microflora. the complex structure of dental biofilms, allowing for a multitude of different ecological environments in close proximity, remains largely unexplored. in this study, we designed a laboratory biofilm model that mimics the bacterial community present during early acidogenic stages of the caries process. we then performed a time-resolved microscopic analysis of the extracellular ph landscape at the interface between bacterial biofilm and underlying substrate. methodology/principal findings: strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus downei and actinomyces naeslundii were employed in the model. biofilms were grown in flow channels that allowed for direct microscopic analysis of the biofilms in situ. the architecture and composition of the biofilms were analysed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy. both biofilm structure and composition were highly reproducible and showed similarity to in-vivo-grown dental plaque. we employed the ph-sensitive ratiometric probe c-snarf-4 to perform real-time microscopic analyses of the biofilm ph in response to salivary solutions containing glucose. anaerobic glycolysis in the model biofilms created a mildly acidic environment. decrease in ph in different areas of the biofilms varied, and distinct extracellular ph-microenvironments were conserved over several hours. conclusions/significance: the designed biofilm model represents a promising tool to determine the effect of potential therapeutic agents on biofilm growth, composition and extracellular ph. ratiometric ph analysis using c-snarf-4 gives detailed insight into the ph landscape of living biofilms and contributes to our general understanding of metabolic processes in in-vivo-grown bacterial biofilms.

TI  == mitis group streptococci express variable pilus islet 2 pili.
AB  == background: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguinis are members of the mitis group of streptococci and agents of oral biofilm, dental plaque and infective endocarditis, disease processes that involve bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host interactions. their close relative, the human pathogen s. pneumoniae uses pilus-islet 2 (pi-2)-encoded pili to facilitate adhesion to eukaryotic cells. methodology/principal findings: pi-2 pilus-encoding genetic islets were identified in s. oralis, s. mitis, and s. sanguinis, but were absent from other isolates of these species. the pi-2 islets resembled the genetic organization of the pi-2 islet of s. pneumoniae, but differed in the genes encoding the structural pilus proteins pita and pitb. two and three variants of pita (a pseudogene in s. pneumoniae) and pitb, respectively, were identified that showed approximately 20% difference in nucleotide as well as corresponding protein sequence. species-independent combinations of pita and pitb variants indicated prior intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer events. polyclonal antisera developed against pita and pitb of s. oralis type strain atcc35037 revealed that pi-2 pili in oral streptococci were composed of pita and  pitb. electronmicrographs showed pilus structures radiating >700 nm from the bacterial surface in the wild type strain, but not in an isogenic pi-2 deletion mutant. anti-pitb-antiserum only reacted with pili containing the same pitb variant, whereas anti-pita antiserum was cross-reactive with the other pita variant. electronic multilocus sequence analysis revealed that all pi-2-encoding  oral streptococci were closely-related and cluster with non-pi-2-encoding s. oralis strains. conclusions/significance: this is the first identification of pi-2 pili in mitis group oral streptococci. the findings provide a striking example of intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer. the pi-2 pilus diversity provides a possible key to link strain-specific bacterial interactions  and/or tissue tropisms with pathogenic traits in the mitis group streptococci.

TI  == thermal treatments modulate bacterial adhesion to dental enamel.
AB  == numerous studies have demonstrated the effects of laser-induced heat on demineralization of enamel; however, no studies have investigated the link between heat/laser-induced changes in physicochemical properties and bacterial adhesion. in this study, we investigated the effects of thermal treatment on surface properties of enamel such as hydrophobicity and zeta potential. bacterial adhesion to treated surfaces was characterized by confocal laser scanning microscopy, and adhesion force was quantified by atomic force microscopy. the hydrophobicity of enamel increased after heating (p < 0.05), and the zeta potential of heated enamel became more negative than that of the control (p < 0.01). streptococcus oralis and s. mitis were more hydrophilic than s. sanguis, with more negative zeta potential (all p < 0.01). s. mitis and s. oralis occupied significantly less area on enamel after being heated (p < 0.05). heating reduced  the adhesion force of both s. mitis and s. oralis to enamel with or without saliva coating. reduction of adhesion force was statistically significant for s.  mitis (p < 0.01), whereas that of s. oralis was not statistically significant (p  > 0.05). heating did not affect the adhesion of s. sanguis with or without saliva coating. in conclusion, thermal treatment and photothermal/laser treatments may modulate the physicochemical properties of enamel, preventing the adhesion of some bacterial species.

TI  == molecular characterisation of the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr)  of the parc gene locus in viridans-group streptococci.
AB  == forty-eight isolates of viridans-group streptococci (vgs) from adults and children in the community are examined for their resistance to ciprofloxacin phenotypically by determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). in addition, the parc gene locus is amplified and sequenced in all isolates and mutations noted. overall, 44 vgs organisms were found to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin by the broth microdilution method, and the remaining four strains had intermediate susceptibility. reduced mics were observed with intermediate strains when reserpine was added to the broth, inhibiting any efflux activity. overall, the effect of adding reserpine to the broth medium was to add one doubling dilution to the mic in the case of streptococcus mitis, s. oralis and s. salivarius, as well as to increase the mic by two doubling dilutions in two of the three s. parasanguinis isolates. amino acid sequence analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr) of the parc gene locus showed good correlation to the phenotypic resistance to ciprofloxacin, where no confirmed mutation conferring quinolone resistance was found. eleven amino acid positions showed discordance with s. pneumoniae r6 and eight (s52, f55, s58, n91, e135, k137, f141 and s167) were common in the vgs species examined. in addition, minor  substitutions were found at three positions (d51, t54 and v86). in conclusion, this study demonstrates the low occurrence of ciprofloxacin resistance in a population of vgs isolated from the community. in addition, several silent mutations were noted in vgs organisms without any increase in mic against ciprofloxacin.

AB  == objective: to detect and analyze two important genes, come and luxs, in quorum sensing signal pathway from streptococcus oralis (s. oralis). methods: the total  genomic dna of s. oralis nh521 (a clinically isolated strain) was firstly extracted. the come and luxs genes were then amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and further sequenced. the obtained sequences were compared with related sequences in genbank. results: target bands of both come and luxs genes were detected by electrophoresis. the obtained gene sequences were similar to the corresponding sequences from another s. oralis strain (luxs, 95.0%; come, 99.6%); however, comparing to gene sequences of another species streptococcus mutans, come was more divergent (12.7%) than luxs gene (74.1%). conclusion: this study successfully amplified and sequenced come and luxs genes from s. oralis nh521 strain. the luxs gene accumulated more mutations than come gene did between two s. oralis strains, but come gene is more divergent than luxs gene between two streptococcus species.

TI  == clonal structure of streptococcus sanguinis strains isolated from endocarditis cases and the oral cavity.
AB  == a collection of streptococcus sanguinis strains from patients with endocarditis (n = 21) and from the oral cavity (n = 34) was subjected to a multi-locus sequence typing analysis using seven housekeeping genes, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (carb), co/zn/cd efflux system component (czcd), d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase (ddl), dna polymerase iii (dnax), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (gdh), dna-directed rna polymerase, beta subunit (rpob) and superoxide dismutase (soda). the scheme was expanded by the inclusion of two the putative virulence genes, bacitracin-resistance protein (baca) and saliva-binding protein (ssab), to increase strain discrimination. extensive intra-species recombination was apparent in all genes but inter-species recombination was also apparent with strains apparently harbouring gdh and ddl from unidentified sources and one isolate harboured a soda allele apparently derived from streptococcus oralis. the recombination/mutation ratio for the concatenated housekeeping gene sequences was 1.67 (95% confidence limits 1.25-2.72) and for the two virulence genes the r/m ratio was 3.99 (95% confidence limits 1.61-8.72); recombination was the major driver for genetic variation. all isolates were distinct and the endocarditis strains did not form distinct sub-clusters when the data were analysed using clonalframe. these data support the widely held opinion that infecting s. sanguinis strains are opportunistic human pathogens.

TI  == early microbial succession in redeveloping dental biofilms in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  == background and objective: the development of dental biofilms after professional plaque removal is very rapid. however, it is not clear whether most bacterial species return at similar rates in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects or if there are differences in bacterial recolonization between supragingival and subgingival biofilms in periodontal health and disease. material and methods: supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects immediately  after professional cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d of no oral hygiene and analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage of dna probe counts were averaged within subjects at each time-point. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving-window analysis. results: succession in supragingival biofilms from subjects with periodontitis and from healthy individuals was similar. at 1 d, streptococcus mitis and neisseria mucosa showed increased proportions, followed by capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, veillonella parvula and streptococcus oralis at 1-4 d. at 4-7 d, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella nigrescens became elevated. subgingival plaque redevelopment was slower and very different from supragingival plaque redevelopment. increased proportions were first observed for s. mitis, followed by v. parvula and c. gingivalis and, at 7 d, by capnocytophaga sputigena and p. nigrescens. no significant increase in the proportions of periodontal pathogens was observed in any of the clinical groups or locations. conclusion: there is a defined order in bacterial species succession in early supragingival and subgingival biofilm redevelopment after professional cleaning.

AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) is a novel method for the direct identification of bacteria from blood culture broths. we evaluate for the first time, the performance of the maldi sepsityper kit and ms for the identification of bacteria compared to standard phenotypic methods using the manufacturer's specified bacterial identification criteria (spectral scores >/=1.700-1.999 and >/=2.000 indicated identification to genus and species level, respectively). five hundred and seven  positive blood culture broths were prospectively examined, of which 379 (74.8%; 358 monomicrobial, 21 polymicrobial) were identified by maldi-tof ms; 195 (100%)  and 132 (67.7%) of 195 gram-positive; and 163 (100%) and 149 (91.4%) of 163 gram-negative organisms from monomicrobial blood cultures were correctly identified to genus and species level, respectively. spectral scores <1.700 (no identification) were obtained in 128/507 (25.2%) positive blood culture broths, including 31.6% and 32.3% of gram-positive and polymicrobial blood cultures, respectively. significantly more gram-negative organisms were identified compared to gram-positive organisms at species level (p<0.0001). five blood cultures were  misidentified, but at species level only; including four monomicrobial blood cultures with streptococcus oralis/mitis that were misidentified as streptococcus pneumoniae. positive predictive values for the direct identification of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from monomicrobial blood culture broths  to genus level were 100%. a diagnostic algorithm for positive blood culture broths that incorporates gram staining and maldi-tof ms should identify the majority of pathogens, particularly to genus level.

AB  == objectives: tn916-like elements are one of the most common types of integrative and conjugative element (ice). in this study we aimed to determine whether novel  accessory genes, i.e. genes whose products are not involved in mobility or regulation, were present on a tn916-like element (tn6087) isolated from streptococcus oralis from the human oral cavity. methods: a minocycline-resistant isolate was analysed using restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis on amplicons derived from tn916 and dna sequencing to determine whether  there were genetic differences in tn6087 compared with tn916. mutational analysis was used to determine whether the novel accessory gene found was responsible for  an observed extra phenotype. results: a novel tn916-like element, tn6087, is described that encodes both antibiotic and antiseptic resistance. the antiseptic  resistance protein is encoded by a novel small multidrug resistance gene, designated qrg, that was shown to encode resistance to cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (ctab), also known as cetrimide bromide. conclusions: this is the first tn916-like element described that confers both antibiotic and antiseptic resistance, suggesting that selection of either antibiotic or antiseptic resistance will also select for the other and further highlights the need for prudent use of both types of compound.

AB  == aims: to report the incidence of infectious and noninfectious endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) from a multicenter clinical trial in japan. methods: a retrospective multicenter  review of the data of patients who received intravitreal anti-vegf injections between january 2007 and march 2011 was undertaken. cases with the clinical diagnosis of endophthalmitis resulting from intravitreal injection were identified and reviewed. results: a total of 5,236 intravitreal anti-vegf injections (1,209 intravitreal injections of bevacizumab, 3,827 injections of ranibizumab, and 200 injections of pegaptanib sodium) had been administered. five patients (0.095%), all of whom had received bevacizumab, were diagnosed as having endophthalmitis after the intravitreal injection. all patients visited the institutes for re-examination within 1-2 days after the injection. among the 5 patients, 2 (0.038%) were culture positive for streptococcus oralis and enterococcus faecalis, respectively. the remaining 3 eyes (0.057%) developed presumed noninfectious endophthalmitis. conclusion: although endophthalmitis is a rare complication associated with intravitreal injection, in this series intravitreal anti-vegf injection caused infectious or noninfectious endophthalmitis at a relatively high frequency. further investigations are needed to consider an appropriate injection protocol for minimizing the incidence rates  of endophthalmitis, and to assess the optimal treatment protocol for intravitreal injection-related endophthalmitis although it was difficult to differentiate these two entities.

TI  == distribution of oral streptococci highly resistant to amoxicillin in dental plaque specimens from japanese children and adolescents.
AB  == oral streptococci are major pathogens of infective endocarditis. prophylactic antibiotics are commonly given to subjects with certain kinds of heart disorders  when invasive dental treatments are performed, with amoxicillin (ampc) being widely used for this purpose. however, there is little information regarding ampc-resistant oral streptococci. here, a total of 344 dental plaque specimens collected from 253 healthy japanese children, adolescents and young adults (aged  2-22 years) were diluted and streaked onto culture medium containing high-dose ampc. the mics for the isolated strains were evaluated using a macrodilution broth method described by the clinical and laboratory standards institute. bacterial dna was extracted from each strain and the entire sequences of the 16s  rrna gene were compared with those in genbank to identify the species. the results showed that strains with ampc mics >16 microg ml(-1) were isolated from 18 specimens from 14 patients. analyses of the 16s rrna gene sequences of these strains identified them as major oral streptococcal species, including streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis. these findings indicate that oral streptococci with elevated mics for ampc exist in certain small populations of healthy children, and highlight the need for further studies to determine risk factors that lead to the appearance of such strains.

TI  == misidentification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by routine tests in clinical practice.
AB  == accurate species-level identification of viridans group streptococci (vgs) is very important for understanding of their pathogenicity and virulence. however, an extremely high level of the similarity between vgs, especially streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, often results in misidentification of these organisms, so there is an urgent need of novel approaches to species identification. a set of 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of alpha-hemolytic streptococci from upper respiratory tract were characterized by the routine phenotypic methods (alpha-hemolysis, colony morphology, gram stain and optochin susceptibility). modern proteomic and genetic approaches - the direct bacterial profiling (dbp) by means of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) technique and multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) scheme (http://viridans.emlsa.net/) - were applied for the accurate species identification. after that all isolates were stored at -70 degrees c. later they  were re-inoculated, and a number of additional tests (bile solubility, latex agglutination by commercial "slidex(r) pneumo-kit" and repeated optochin test) were performed. a considerable discrepancy was discovered in the results of the different approaches. looking in the future, one could say that mlsa-like schemes based on the analysis of the nucleotide sequences of seven or more loci of the bacterial genome, appeared to be the most useful instrument in the vgs discrimination, in contrast to the numerous one-target identification schemes, which have been introduced into practice by now.

AB  == host- and phage-coded cell wall hydrolases have been used to fight streptococcus  pneumoniae growing as planktonic cells in vitro as well as in animal models. until now, however, the usefulness of these enzymes in biofilm-grown pneumococci  has gone untested. the antipneumococcal activity of different cell wall hydrolases produced by s. pneumoniae and a number of its phages was examined in an in vitro biofilm model. the major pneumococcal autolysin lyta, an n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, showed the greatest efficiency in disintegrating s. pneumoniae biofilms. the phage-encoded lysozymes cpl-1 and cpl-7 were also very efficient. biofilms formed by the close pneumococcal relatives streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and streptococcus oralis were also destroyed by the phage endolysins but not by the s. pneumoniae autolysin lyta. a  cooperative effect of lyta and cpl-1 in the disintegration of s. pneumoniae biofilms was recorded.

TI  == two autonomous structural modules in the fimbrial shaft adhesin fima mediate actinomyces interactions with streptococci and host cells during oral biofilm development.
AB  == by combining x-ray crystallography and modelling, we describe here the atomic structure of distinct adhesive moieties of fima, the shaft fimbrillin of actinomyces type 2 fimbriae, which uniquely mediates the receptor-dependent intercellular interactions between actinomyces and oral streptococci as well as host cells during the development of oral biofilms. the fima adhesin is built with three igg-like domains, each of which harbours an intramolecular isopeptide  bond, previously described in several gram-positive pilins. genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate that although these isopeptide bonds are dispensable for fimbrial assembly, cell-cell interactions and biofilm formation,  they contribute significantly to the proteolytic stability of fima. remarkably, fima harbours two autonomous adhesive modules, which structurally resemble the staphylococcus aureus cna b domain. each isolated module can bind the plasma glycoprotein asialofetuin as well as the polysaccharide receptors present on the  surface of oral streptococci and epithelial cells. thus, fima should serve as an  excellent paradigm for the development of therapeutic strategies and elucidating  the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between cellular receptors and gram-positive fimbriae.

AB  == the penetration and overall efficacy of six mouthrinse actives was evaluated by using an in vitro flow cell oral biofilm model. the technique involved preloading biofilm cells with a green fluorescent dye that leaked out as the cells were permeabilized by a treatment. the loss of green color, and of biomass, was observed by time-lapse microscopy during 60 min of treatment under continuous flow conditions. the six actives analyzed were ethanol, sodium lauryl sulfate, triclosan, chlorhexidine digluconate (chx), cetylpyridinium chloride, and nisin.  each of these agents effected loss of green fluorescence throughout biofilm cell  clusters, with faster action at the edge of a cell cluster and slower action in the cluster center. the time to reach half of the initial fluorescent intensity at the center of a cell cluster, which can be viewed as a combined penetration and biological action time, ranged from 0.6 to 19 min for the various agents. these times are much longer than the predicted penetration time based on diffusion alone, suggesting that anti-biofilm action was controlled more by the biological action time than by the penetration time of the active. none of the agents tested caused any removal of the biofilm. the extent of fluorescence loss  after 1 h of exposure to an active ranged from 87 to 99.5%, with chx being the most effective. the extent of fluorescence loss in vitro, but not penetration and action time, correlated well with the relative efficacy data from published clinical trials.

TI  == effect of lectins from diocleinae subtribe against oral streptococci.
AB  == surface colonization is an essential step in biofilm development. the ability of  oral pathogens to adhere to tooth surfaces is directly linked with the presence of specific molecules at the bacterial surface that can interact with enamel acquired pellicle ligands. in light of this, the aim of this study was to verify  inhibitory and antibiofilm action of lectins from the diocleinaesubtribe against  streptococcus mutans and streptococcus oralis. the inhibitory action against planctonic cells was assessed using lectins from canavaliaensi formis (cona), canavalia brasiliensis (conbr), canavalia maritima (conm), canavalia gladiata (cgl) and canavalia boliviana (conbol). conbol, conbr and conm showed inhibitory  activity on s. mutans growth. all lectins, except cona, stimulated significantly  the growth of s. oralis. to evaluate the effect on biofilm formation, clarified saliva was added to 96-well, flat-bottomed polystyrene plates, followed by the addition of solutions containing 100 or 200 microg/ml of the selected lectins. conbol, conm and cona inhibited the s. mutans biofilms. no effects were found on  s. oralis biofilms. structure/function analysis were carried out using bioinformatics tools. the aperture and deepness of the crd (carbohydrate recognition domain) permit us to distinguish the two groups of canavalia lectins  in accordance to their actions against s. mutans and s. oralis. the results found provide a basis for encouraging the use of plant lectins as biotechnological tools in ecological control and prevention of caries disease.

TI  == influences of trans-trans farnesol, a membrane-targeting sesquiterpenoid, on streptococcus mutans physiology and survival within mixed-species oral biofilms.
AB  == trans-trans farnesol (tt-farnesol) is a bioactive sesquiterpene alcohol commonly  found in propolis (a beehive product) and citrus fruits, which disrupts the ability of streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) to form virulent biofilms. in this study, we investigated whether tt-farnesol affects cell-membrane function, acid production and/or acid tolerance by planktonic cells and biofilms of s. mutans ua159. furthermore, the influence of the agent on s. mutans gene expression and ability to form biofilms in the presence of other oral bacteria (streptococcus oralis (s. oralis) 35037 and actinomyces naeslundii (a. naeslundii) 12104) was also examined. in general, tt-farnesol (1 mmol x l(-1)) significantly increased the membrane proton permeability and reduced glycolytic activity of s. mutans in  the planktonic state and in biofilms (p < 0.05). moreover, topical applications of 1 mmol x l(-1) tt-farnesol twice daily (1 min exposure/treatment) reduced biomass accumulation and prevented ecological shifts towards s. mutans dominance  within mixed-species biofilms after introduction of 1% sucrose. s. oralis (a non-cariogenic organism) became the major species after treatments with tt-farnesol, whereas vehicle-treated biofilms contained mostly s. mutans (>90% of total bacterial population). however, the agent did not affect significantly the  expression of s. mutans genes involved in acidogenicity, acid tolerance or polysaccharide synthesis in the treated biofilms. our data indicate that tt-farnesol may affect the competitiveness of s. mutans in a mixed-species environment by primarily disrupting the membrane function and physiology of this  bacterium. this naturally occurring terpenoid could be a potentially useful adjunctive agent to the current anti-biofilm/anti-caries chemotherapeutic strategies.

TI  == multispecies communities: interspecies interactions influence growth on saliva as sole nutritional source.
AB  == human oral bacteria live in multispecies communities in the biofilm called dental plaque. this review focuses on the interactions of seven species and the ability  of each species individually and together with other species to grow on saliva as the sole source of nutrient. community formation in biofilms in flow cells is monitored using species-specific fluorophore-conjugated immunoglobulin g, and images are captured by confocal microscopy. early colonizing veillonellae emerge  from this review of interspecies interactions in saliva as a critical genus that  guides the development of multispecies communities. highly selective interspecies recognition is evident as initial colonizers pair with early and middle colonizers to form multispecies communities that grow on saliva.

TI  == novel model for multispecies biofilms that uses rigid gas-permeable lenses.
AB  == oral biofilms comprise complex multispecies consortia aided by specific inter- and intraspecies interactions occurring among commensals and pathogenic bacterial species. oral biofilms are primary initiating factors of periodontal disease, although complex multifactorial biological influences, including host cell responses, contribute to the individual outcome of the disease. to provide a system to study initial stages of interaction between oral biofilms and the host  cells that contribute to the disease process, we developed a novel in vitro model system to grow biofilms on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses (rgpls), which enable oxygen to permeate through the lens material. bacterial species belonging  to early- and late-colonizing groups were successfully established as single- or  three-species biofilms, with each group comprising streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguinis; s. gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii, and fusobacterium nucleatum; or s. gordonii, f. nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. quantification of biofilm numbers by quantitative pcr (qpcr) revealed substantial differences in the magnitude of bacterial numbers in  single-species and multispecies biofilms. we evaluated cell-permeable conventional nucleic acid stains acridine orange, hexidium iodide, and hoechst 33258 and novel syto red, blue, and green fluorochromes for their effect on bacterial viability and fluorescence yield to allow visualization of the aggregates of individual bacterial species by confocal laser scanning microscopy  (clsm). substantial differences in the quantity and distribution of the species in the multispecies biofilms were identified. the specific features of these biofilms may help us better understand the role of various bacteria in local challenge of oral tissues.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == evaluation antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of the biosurfactant lunasan produced by candida sphaerica ucp 0995.
AB  == different groups of biosurfactants exhibit diverse properties and display a variety of physiological functions in producer microorganisms; these include enhancing the solubility of hydrophobic/water-insoluble compound, heave metal binding, bacterial pathogenesis, cell adhesion and aggregation, quorum sensing and biofilm formation. candida sphaerica was grown in a low cost medium, consisting of distilled water supplemented with 9% refinery residue of soybean oil and 9% corn steep liquor, for 144 h at 28 degrees c and 150 rpm. the cell-free supernatant obtained at the end of the experiments was submitted to extraction, and afterward the biosurfactant was isolated using methanol with a yield of 9 g l(-1). the critical micelle concentration of the biosurfactant was found to be 0.25 mg ml(-1) with a surface tension of 25 mn m(-1). several concentrations of the biosurfactant (0.625-10 mg ml(-1)) were used to evaluate its antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities against a variety of microorganisms. the biosurfactant showed antimicrobial activity against streptococcus oralis (68%), candida albicans (57%), and staphylococcus epidermidis(57.6%) for the highest concentration tested. furthermore, the biosurfactant at a concentration of 10 mg ml(-1) inhibited the adhesion between 80 and 92% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus sanguis12. inhibition of adhesion with percentages near 100% occurred for the higher concentrations of biosurfactant used. results gathered in this study point to a potential use of the biosurfactant in biomedical applications.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == structure, viability and bacterial kinetics of an in vitro biofilm model using six bacteria from the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background and objective: there are few in vitro models available in the scientific literature for study of the structure, formation and development of the subgingival biofilm. the purpose of this study was to develop and validate an in vitro biofilm model, using representative selected bacteria from the subgingival microbiota. material and methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop biofilms over sterile ceramic calcium hydroxyapatite discs coated with saliva within the wells of presterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates.  the selected species represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the structure of the biofilm obtained was studied using a vital fluorescence technique in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. the biofilm bacterial kinetics were studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. results: after 12 h, initial and early colonizers were the first microorganisms detected adhering to the calcium hydroxyapatite discs. the intermediate colonizer f. nucleatum was not detected in the model until 24 h of incubation. late colonizers a. actinomycetemcomitans and  p. gingivalis could be measured inside the biofilm after 48 h. the biofilm reached its steady state between 72 and 96 h after inoculation, with bacterial vitality increasing from the hydroxyapatite surface to the central part of the biofilm. conclusion: an in vitro biofilm model was developed and validated, demonstrating a pattern of bacterial colonization and maturation similar to the in vivo development of the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular methods used for identification of oral streptococci and related microorganisms.
AB  == the oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. the oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. the 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by vitek system using gram-positive identification cards. species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for pcr identification of isolates. sequencing of 16s rrna was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. vitek system identified a number of 11 strains as s. mitis/oralis,  12 strains as s. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as s. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3  strains as s. salivarius, 3 strains as s. plurianimalium, 1 strain as s. cristatus and 1 strain as s. alactolyticus, respectively. the pcr system targeting gtf genes was able to identify s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. gordonii strains. sequence of 16s rrna discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides. many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.

AB  == aims: the effect of different concentrations of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (hema) was evaluated on biofilm formation and preformed biofilm of streptococcus  mitis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus oralis, alone or combined to each other. methods and results: twofold serial dilution of hema ranged from 12 to 0.75 mmol l(-1) was added to streptococcal broth cultures and mature biofilms in  96-well-microtitre plates to evaluate bacterial biomass and cell viability. hema  affected the streptococcal population in a strain-specific way producing few significant effects. a reduction on biofilm formation and a detachment of preformed biofilm was recorded in strep. mitis atcc 6249, whereas in mixed cultures, the monomer expressed a general aggregative effect on mature biofilms.  a reduction in cell viability was also recorded in an hema-concentration-dependent way in each experimental condition studied. conclusions: these results suggest that the hema prevalent effects are both the reduction of bacterial adhesion to a polystyrene surface and the increase in dead cells also characterized by an aggregative status. significance and impact of the study: understanding the potential effect of hema, released from resin-based materials, on oral bacteria may furnish information for surveillance of the risk  reduction in secondary caries via hindering biofilm generation.

TI  == invasion of human aortic endothelial cells by oral viridans group streptococci and induction of inflammatory cytokine production.
AB  == oral viridans group streptococci are the major commensal bacteria of the supragingival oral biofilm and have been detected in human atheromatous plaque. atherosclerosis involves an ongoing inflammatory response, reportedly involving chronic infection caused by multiple pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the invasion of human aortic endothelial cells (haecs) by oral viridans group streptococci and the subsequent cytokine production by viable invaded haecs. the invasion of haecs by bacteria was examined using antibiotic protection assays and was visualized by confocal scanning laser microscopy. the inhibitory effects of catalase and cytochalasin d on the invasion of haecs were also examined. the production of cytokines by invaded or infected haecs was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and a real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used to evaluate the expression of cytokine messenger rna. the oral streptococci tested were capable of invading haecs. the number of invasive bacteria increased with the length of the co-culture period. after a certain co-culture period, some organisms were cytotoxic to the haecs. catalase and cytochalasin d inhibited the invasion of haecs by the organism. haecs invaded by streptococcus mutans xc, streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis), streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558 and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419 produced more cytokine(s) (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) than non-invaded haecs. the haecs invaded by s. mutans xc produced the largest amounts of cytokines, and the messenger rna expression of cytokines by invaded haecs increased markedly compared with that by non-invaded haecs. these results suggest that oral streptococci may participate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

TI  == effects of xylitol on survival of mutans streptococci in mixed-six-species in vitro biofilms modelling supragingival plaque.
AB  == xylitol has been claimed to reduce mutans streptococci (ms) in dental plaque by energy-consuming futile metabolic cycles. this study aimed to investigate the effects of xylitol on ms in an in vitro 6-species oral biofilm model. each multispecies biofilm contained either a laboratory reference strain, a fresh isolate, a xylitol-sensitive or a xylitol-resistant strain of streptococcus mutans or streptococcus sobrinus. biofilms, grown on pellicle-coated hydroxyapatite discs, were fed with a glucose/sucrose-supplemented medium 3 times daily for 45 min and incubated in saliva between feedings. before or after feeding, biofilms were exposed to either 7.5% xylitol, 7.5% sorbitol or to saliva (control) for 20 min. after 64.5 h, biofilms were harvested and the microbial composition was analysed by non-selective and selective culturing. strain variability in the ability to colonize biofilms was observed. however, the response patterns in the biofilms to the 4 polyol treatments were similar. none of the ms were inhibited by xylitol provided either before or after feeding. sorbitol given before feeding did not affect microbial growth whereas sorbitol provided after feeding showed a slight, albeit statistically significant increase in ms counts for some of the tested strains. it did so at the expense of streptococcus oralis, which decreased in numbers. the present findings do not support the contention that xylitol reduces ms in plaque by futile metabolic cycles.

AB  == objectives: to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacies of two toothpaste formulations containing natural antimicrobials (herbal extracts and chitosan) against oral biofilms of different composition and maturational status. methods:  bacteria from a buffer suspension or fresh saliva were adhered for 2h to a salivary conditioning film and subsequently grown for 16h. dual-species biofilms  were prepared from actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1 and streptococcus oralis j22, whilst multi-species biofilms were grown from freshly collected human saliva. biofilms were exposed to 25wt% toothpaste supernatants. a chlorhexidine-containing mouthrinse and a buffer were used as positive- and negative-controls, respectively. antibacterial efficacy was concluded from acute  killing, bacterial removal, prevention of bacterial re-deposition and continued killing during re-deposition. results: the herbal- and chitosan-based supernatants showed immediate killing of oral biofilm bacteria, comparable with chlorhexidine. moreover, exposure of a biofilm to these supernatants or chlorhexidine, yielded ongoing killing of biofilm bacteria after exposure during  re-deposition of bacteria to a matured 16h biofilm, but not to a much thinner initial biofilm formed by 2h adhesion only. this suggests that thicker, more matured biofilms can absorb and release oral antimicrobials. conclusions: supernatants based on herbal- and chitosan-based toothpastes have comparable immediate and ongoing antibacterial efficacies as chlorhexidine. natural antimicrobials and chlorhexidine absorb in oral biofilms which contributes to their substantive action.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == reca-based pcr assay for accurate differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae from other viridans streptococci.
AB  == proper identification of streptococcus pneumoniae by conventional methods remains problematic. the discriminatory power of the 16s rrna gene, which can be considered the "gold standard" for molecular identification, is too low to differentiate s. pneumoniae from closely related species such as streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis in the routine clinical laboratory. a 313-bp part of reca was selected on the basis of variability within the s. mitis group, showing <95.8% interspecies homology. in addition, 6 signature nucleotides specific for s. pneumoniae were identified within the 313-bp reca fragment. we show that reca analysis is a useful tool for  proper identification to species level within the s. mitis group, in particular,  for pneumococci.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) including streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult cf patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates  of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these  isolates to belong to 12 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis,  s. cristatus, s. gordonii, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis. the most frequently vgs organism isolated was s. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by s. mitis (36/190; 19%), s. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), s. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), s. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), s. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), s. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), s. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), s. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), s. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), s. australis (1/190; 0.5%), s. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and s. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). all, but four, patients harboured at least one vgs species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. there was no clonality at the subspecies level employing eric rapd pcr. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. overall, resistance to penicillin with all vgs was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. with regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which  equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. in addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-cf population comprising 12 individuals (50 vgs isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. in comparison, 8% and 38% of vgs isolates from non-cf individuals were resistant by  disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. none of the non-cf vgs organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.

TI  == identification of genes for small non-coding rnas that belong to the regulon of the two-component regulatory system ciarh in streptococcus.
AB  == background: post-transcriptional regulation by small rnas (srnas) in bacteria is  now recognized as a wide-spread regulatory mechanism modulating a variety of physiological responses including virulence. in streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, the first srnas to be described were found in the regulon of the ciarh two-component regulatory system. five of these srnas were detected and designated csrnas for cia-dependent small rnas. ciarh pleiotropically affects beta-lactam resistance, autolysis, virulence, and competence development by yet to be defined molecular mechanisms. since ciarh is  highly conserved among streptococci, it is of interest to determine if csrnas are also included in the ciarh regulon in this group of organisms consisting of commensal as well as pathogenic species. knowledge on the participation of csrnas in ciarh-dependent regulatory events will be the key to define the physiological  role of this important control system. results: genes for csrnas were predicted in streptococcal genomes and data base entries other than s. pneumoniae by searching for ciar-activated promoters located in intergenic regions that are followed by a transcriptional terminator. 61 different candidate genes were obtained specifying csrnas ranging in size from 51 to 202 nt. comparing these genes among each other revealed 40 different csrna types. all streptococcal genomes harbored csrna genes, their numbers varying between two and six. to validate these predictions, s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis were subjected  to csrna-specific northern blot analysis. in addition, a csrna gene from s. thermophilus plasmid pst0 introduced into s. pneumoniae was also tested. each of  the csrnas was detected on these blots and showed the anticipated sizes. thus, the method applied here is able to predict csrnas with high precision. conclusions: the results of this study strongly suggest that genes for small non-coding rnas, csrnas, are part of the regulon of the two-component regulatory  system ciarh in all streptococci.

TI  == proteases of an early colonizer can hinder streptococcus mutans colonization in vitro.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is the primary cariogen that produces several virulence factors that are modulated by a competence-stimulating peptide (csp) signaling system. in this study, we sought to determine if proteases produced by early dental plaque colonizers such as streptococcus gordonii interfere with the subsequent colonization of s. mutans bm71 on the existing streptococcal biofilms. we demonstrated that s. mutans bm71 colonized much less efficiently in vitro on streptococcal biofilms than on actinomyces naeslundii biofilms. several oral streptococci, relative to a. naeslundii, produced proteases that inactivated the  s. mutans csp. we further demonstrated that cell protein extracts from s. gordonii, but not from a. naeslundii, interfered with s. mutans bm71 colonization. in addition, s. mutans bm71 colonized more efficiently on the sgc protease knockout mutant of s. gordonii than on the parent biofilms. in conclusion, proteases of early colonizers can interfere with subsequent colonization by s. mutans in vitro.

TI  == contribution of plasminogen activation towards the pathogenic potential of oral streptococci.
AB  == oral streptococci are a heterogeneous group of human commensals, with a potential to cause serious infections. activation of plasminogen has been shown to increase the virulence of typical human pathogenic streptococci such as s. pneumoniae. one important factor for plasminogen activation is the streptococcal alpha-enolase. here we report that plasminogen activation is also common in oral streptococci species involved in clinical infection and that it depends on the action of human plasminogen activators. the ability to activate plasminogen did not require full  conservation of the internal plasminogen binding sequence motif fydkerkvy of alpha-enolase that was previously described as crucial for increased plasminogen  binding, activation and virulence. instead, experiments with recombinant alpha-enolase variants indicate that the naturally occurring variations do not impair plasminogen binding. in spite of these variations in the internal plasminogen binding motif oral streptococci showed similar activation of plasminogen. we conclude that the pathomechanism of plasminogen activation is conserved in oral streptococci that cause infections in human. this may contribute to their opportunistic pathogenic character that is unfurled in certain niches.

TI  == [classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. they reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. they can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. the diagnosis of vgs are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (sanguinis, mitis, mutans, salivarius, anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16s rrna sequencing. since streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. genetic exchange between streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and s.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. these mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. the cultivation of vgs usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. vgs are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. the last step in the laboratory diagnosis of vgs is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. in this review article, classification of vgs, similarities between s.pneumoniae and mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of vgs have been discussed.

TI  == structure and dynamics of the pan-genome of streptococcus pneumoniae and closely  related species.
AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most important causes of microbial diseases in humans. the genomes of 44 diverse strains of s. pneumoniae  were analyzed and compared with strains of non-pathogenic streptococci of the mitis group. results: despite evidence of extensive recombination, the s. pneumoniae phylogenetic tree revealed six major lineages. with the exception of serotype 1, the tree correlated poorly with capsular serotype, geographical site  of isolation and disease outcome. the distribution of dispensable genes--genes present in more than one strain but not in all strains--was consistent with phylogeny, although horizontal gene transfer events attenuated this correlation in the case of ancient lineages. homologous recombination, involving short stretches of dna, was the dominant evolutionary process of the core genome of s.  pneumoniae. genetic exchange occurred both within and across the borders of the species, and s. mitis was the main reservoir of genetic diversity of s. pneumoniae. the pan-genome size of s. pneumoniae increased logarithmically with the number of strains and linearly with the number of polymorphic sites of the sampled genomes, suggesting that acquired genes accumulate proportionately to the age of clones. most genes associated with pathogenicity were shared by all s. pneumoniae strains, but were also present in s. mitis, s. oralis and s. infantis, indicating that these genes are not sufficient to determine virulence. conclusions: genetic exchange with related species sharing the same ecological niche is the main mechanism of evolution of s. pneumoniae. the open pan-genome guarantees the species a quick and economical response to diverse environments.

TI  == effect of biofilm on the repair bond strengths of composites.
AB  == composite restorations degrade during wear, but it is unknown how wear affects the composite surface and influences composite-to-composite bonding in minimally  invasive repair. here, it is hypothesized that in vitro exposure of composites to oral biofilm yields clinically relevant degradation of composite surfaces, and its influence on composite-to-composite bonding is determined. biofilms on composite surfaces in vitro increased their roughness and decreased filler particle exposure, except for a microhybrid composite, similar to effects of clinical wear in palatal appliances. failure shear stresses after intermediate-adhesive-resin application were significantly lower after aging by in vitro exposure to biofilms, while silica-coating maintained the same failure stress levels as in non-aged composites. failure modes were predominantly cohesive after silica-coating, while intermediate-adhesive-resin application yielded more adhesive failure. it is concluded that in vitro exposure to oral biofilm is a clinically relevant aging condition, and that silica-coating is to be preferred for the repair of aged composites.

TI  == investigation of supragingival plaque microbiota in different caries status of chinese preschool children by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == this study aimed to detect differences in the richness of total supragingival plaque microbiota as well as the species composition of oral streptococci involved in the different stages of dental caries. forty-five plaque samples were collected from caries-moderate (cm, 4 </= dmfs </= 6), caries-susceptible (cs, dmfs >/= 10), and age-matched caries-free children separately. total dna was isolated directly from each sample, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analyses using universal and primers specific for oral streptococci were carried out. using 16s rdna pcr-dgge, 34 different species of bacteria were identified in a culture-independent manner and classified into 11 genera according to phylogenetic analysis. among them, mitis group streptococci and campylobacter, which were present in health status, no longer appeared in caries-susceptible samples. in addition, capnocytophaga, burkholderia, and prevotella were found significantly less frequently in the cs group samples (p < 0.05), while there were no significant differences among the prevalence of neisseria, leptotrichia, haemophilus, mutans group streptococci, corynebacterium, and actinomyces in the three groups. further dgge analysis of rnpb gene amplicons obtained with oral streptococci species-specific primers showed that a total of 23 species of oral streptococci were identified. streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis showed a significantly higher prevalence in healthy children (p < 0.05), while that of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus did not vary among the three groups. overall, these results suggest that supragingival plaque microbiota as a  whole undergoes a more complicated shift in the caries process.

AB  == background: a completely new approach to diagnose microbial agents at least one day earlier based on mass spectrometric analysis becomes possible in the microbiology laboratory: maldi tof: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight. comparison between results of the new procedure with those obtained by conventional testing is mandatory. methods: 204 clinical isolates grown on agar plates were analysed both, by the maldi tof bruker microflex apparatus and by conventional identification using the vitek ii and api systems,  both from biomerieux. results: of the identified isolates, 72 were gram-positive  and 130 gram-negative; 2 were yeasts (candida). concordance was seen with 61/72 (85%) of the gram-positive bacteria and with 115/130 (88%) of the gram-negative bacteria. in 27 samples (13.2%), a discrepancy of the species and/or genus was obvious. the discrepancy appeared with 16 gram-negative (12.2%) and with 11 gram-positive germs (15.3%, n.s.). in the latter group, 6 samples showed discordance with streptococcus pneumoniae (maldi) and streptococcus mitis/oralis  (conventional identification) constellation. among gram-negative samples, most differences occurred on the species level only, e.g. enterobacter cloacae versus  enterobacter kobei. in 5 cases, discordance was major and appeared on the genus level: enterobacter/raoultella, streptococcus/gemella, pseumdomonas/burkholderia, microbacter/sphingomonas and candida/cryptococcus. the most outstanding difference was microbacterium arborescens (maldi tof) and sphingomonas paucimobilis (conventional). molecular biological identification of two streptococcus mitis group bacteria confirmed the erroneous diagnosis by maldi tof of streptococcus pneumoniae. conclusion: good comparability between maldi tof analysis and conventional identification procedures (86.8%) but special caution is needed when identifying streptococcal species.

TI  == potential of shock waves to remove calculus and biofilm.
AB  == effective calculus and biofilm removal is essential to treat periodontitis. sonic and ultrasonic technologies are used in several scaler applications. this was the first feasibility study to assess the potential of a shock wave device to remove  calculus and biofilms and to kill bacteria. ten extracted teeth with visible subgingival calculus were treated with either shock waves for 1 min at an energy  output of 0.4 mj/mm(2) at 3 hz or a magnetostrictive ultrasonic scaler at medium  power setting for 1 min, which served as a control. calculus was determined before and after treatment planimetrically using a custom-made software using a grey scale threshold. in a second experiment, multispecies biofilms were formed on saliva-preconditioned bovine enamel discs during 64.5 h. they were subsequently treated with shock waves or the ultrasonic scaler (n = 6/group) using identical settings. biofilm detachment and bactericidal effects were then assessed. limited efficiency of the shock wave therapy in terms of calculus removal was observed: only 5% of the calculus was removed as compared to 100% when ultrasound was used (p </= 0.0001). however, shock waves were able to significantly reduce adherent bacteria by three orders of magnitude (p </= 0.0001). the extent of biofilm removal by the ultrasonic device was statistically similar. only limited bactericidal effects were observed using both methods. within the limitations of this preliminary study, the shock wave device was not able to reliably remove calculus but had the potential to remove biofilms by three log steps. to increase the efficacy, technical improvements are still required. this novel noninvasive intervention, however, merits further investigation.

TI  == real-time pcr assays for the detection and quantification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is the main etiologic agent of pneumonia worldwide. because the members of the viridans group streptococci share a high degree of dna sequence homologies, phenotypic and genotypic discriminations of s. pneumoniae from the viridans group are difficult. a quantitative real-time pcr assay targeting the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis gene (cpsa) was developed as a species-specific detection tool for s. pneumoniae. the specificity was evaluated  using genomic dnas extracted from 135 oral cocci strains. twenty-seven s. pneumoniae strains tested positive, whereas 108 other strains including streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis did not show a specific signal. the linear regression of standard curves indicated high correlations between the log numbers of s. pneumoniae cells and the c(t) values (r(2)=0.99). the minimal limit of detection was 32 fg of purified genomic  dna, equivalent to 14 genomes of s. pneumoniae. this new real-time pcr method may be very useful as a rapid and specific tool for detecting and quantifying s. pneumoniae.

TI  == streptococcus mutans inhibits candida albicans hyphal formation by the fatty acid signaling molecule trans-2-decenoic acid (sdsf).
AB  == in the human mouth, fungi and several hundred species of bacteria coexist. here we report a case of interkingdom signaling in the oral cavity: a compound excreted by the caries bacterium streptococcus mutans inhibits the morphological  transition from yeast to hyphae, an important virulence trait, in the opportunistic fungus candida albicans. the compound excreted by s. mutans was originally studied because it inhibited signaling by the universal bacterial signal autoinducer-2 (ai-2), determined by the luminescence of a vibrio harveyi sensor strain. the inhibitor was purified from cell-free culture supernatants of  s. mutans guided by its activity. its chemical structure was elucidated by using  nmr spectroscopy and gc-ms and proved to be trans-2-decenoic acid. we show that trans-2-decenoic acid does not inhibit ai-2-specific signaling, but rather the luciferase reaction used for its detection. a potential biological role of trans-2-decenoic acid was then discovered. it is able to suppress the transition  from yeast to hyphal morphology in the opportunistic human pathogen candida albicans at concentrations that do not affect growth. the expression of hwp1, a hyphal-specific signature gene of c. albicans, is abolished by trans-2-decenoic acid. trans-2-decenoic acid is structurally similar to the diffusible signal factor (dsf) family of interkingdom-signaling molecules and is the first member of this family from a gram-positive organism (streptococcus dsf, sdsf). sdsf activity was also found in s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis, but not in other oral bacteria. sdsf could be relevant in shaping multispecies candida bacteria biofilms in the human body.

AB  == seven streptococcal isolates from the mitis group were analyzed for the presence  of pneumococcal gene homologues by comparative genomic hybridization studies with microarrays based on open reading frames from the genomes of streptococcus pneumoniae tigr4 and r6. the diversity of pneumolysin (ply) and neuraminidase a (nana) gene sequences was explored in more detail in a collection of 14 s. pseudopneumoniae and 29 mitis group isolates, respectively. the mitis group isolates used in the microarray experiments included a type strain (nctc 12261),  two s. mitis isolates from the nasopharynxes of children, one s. mitis isolate from a case of infective endocarditis, one s. mitis isolate from a dental abscess, and one s. oralis isolate and one s. pseudopneumoniae isolate from the nasopharynxes of children. the results of the microarray study showed that the 5  s. mitis isolates had homologues to between 67 and 82% of pneumococcal virulence  genes, s. oralis hybridized to 83% of pneumococcal virulence genes, and s. pseudopneumoniae hybridized to 92% of identified pneumococcal virulence genes. comparison of the pneumolysin, mitilysin (mly), and newly identified pseudopneumolysin (pply) gene sequences revealed that mly and pply genes are more closely related to each other than either is to ply. in contrast, the nana gene sequences in the pneumococcus and streptococci from the mitis group are closely clustered together, sharing 99.4 to 99.7% sequence identity with pneumococcal nana alleles.

TI  == structure and molecular characterization of streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide 10f by carbohydrate engineering in streptococcus oralis.
AB  == although closely related at the molecular level, the capsular polysaccharide (cps) of serotype 10f streptococcus pneumoniae and coaggregation receptor polysaccharide (rps) of streptococcus oralis c104 have distinct ecological roles. cps prevents phagocytosis of pathogenic s. pneumoniae, whereas rps of commensal s. oralis functions as a receptor for lectin-like adhesins on other members of the dental plaque biofilm community. results from high resolution nmr identified  the recognition region of s. oralis rps (i.e. galfbeta1-6galnacbeta1-3galalpha) in the hexasaccharide repeat of s. pneumoniae cps10f. the failure of this polysaccharide to support fimbriae-mediated adhesion of actinomyces naeslundii was explained by the position of galf, which occurred as a branch in cps10f rather than within the linear polysaccharide chain, as in rps. carbohydrate engineering of s. oralis rps with wzy from s. pneumoniae attributed formation of  the galf branch in cps10f to the linkage of adjacent repeating units through sub  terminal galnac in galfbeta1-6galnacbeta1-3galalpha rather than through terminal  galf, as in rps. a gene (wcrd) from serotype 10a s. pneumoniae was then used to engineer a linear surface polysaccharide in s. oralis that was identical to rps except for the presence of a beta1-3 linkage between galf and galnacbeta1-3galalpha. this polysaccharide also failed to support adhesion of a.  naeslundii, thereby establishing the essential role of beta1-6-linked galf in recognition of adjacent galnacbeta1-3galalpha in wild-type rps. these findings, which illustrate a molecular approach for relating bacterial polysaccharide structure to function, provide insight into the possible evolution of s. oralis rps from s. pneumoniae cps.

TI  == mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. ii. microbiological results.
AB  == background: peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. we performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. materials and methods: an expanded checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in  17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. statistics included non-parametric tests and glm multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. results: at selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: fusobacterium nucleatum sp., staphylococci sp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, helicobacter pylori, and tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, and veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). no such  differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. no microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. conclusions: both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. no group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.

TI  == potent anticariogenic activity of aceriphyllum rossii and its components, aceriphyllic acid a and 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic acid.
AB  == aceriphyllum rossii engler (saxifragaceae) have been used as a nutritious food in korea. we found that the methanol extract of a. rossii root and its components, aceriphyllic acid a and 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic acid, potently inhibited the growth of the key cariogenic bacteria, streptococcus mutans, with mic of 2 to 4 microg/ml. they also showed antibacterial activity against other cariogenic bacteria such as s. oralis, s. sobrinus, and s. salivarius with the similar potency. in the time-kill study, aceriphyllic acid a reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by 90% in 1 min at 8 microg/ml, indicating that aceriphyllic acid a had the fast bacteriostatic activity. severe damages of the cell surface of s. mutans by aceriphyllic acid a were observed by transmission electron microscopy, suggesting with its fast antibacterial activity that its mechanism of action might be membrane disruption. these results suggest that the methanol extract of  a. rossii root and its components, aceriphyllic acid a and 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic acid, could have the great potential as natural agents for preventing dental caries.

TI  == energy transfer, volumetric expansion, and removal of oral biofilms by non-contact brushing.
AB  == non-contact removal of oral biofilms offers advantages beyond the reach of bristles, but it is unknown how energy transfer for removal from brush-to-biofilm occurs. in the present study we evaluated non-contact, oral biofilm removal by oscillating-rotating and sonic toothbrushes, and their acoustic output up to 6 mm distance. whereas some brushes removed biofilm when used at a distance of up to 6 mm, others lost efficacy at a distance of 2-4 mm from the biofilm. loss of efficacy was accompanied with high standard deviations and volumetric biofilm expansion. both sonic and oscillating-rotating brushes caused fluid flows and the inclusion of air-bubbles, while non-contact acoustic energy-transfer was demonstrated to decay with distance for both types of brushes. we put forward the following mechanism for non-contact removal: (i) brush energy is absorbed by biofilm, resulting in the visco-elastic expansion of the biofilm; (ii) if the energy absorbed is sufficient and deformation is beyond the yield point, biofilm  removal occurs; and (iii) if deformation is in the plastic range but below the yield point (i.e. at the limiting distance for non-contact removal), biofilm is expanded but not removed.

TI  == biofilm formation and virulence expression by streptococcus mutans are altered when grown in dual-species model.
AB  == background: microbial cell-cell interactions in the oral flora are believed to play an integral role in the development of dental plaque and ultimately, its pathogenicity. the effects of other species of oral bacteria on biofilm formation and virulence gene expression by streptococcus mutans, the primary etiologic agent of dental caries, were evaluated using a dual-species biofilm model and realtime-pcr analysis. results: as compared to mono-species biofilms, biofilm formation by s. mutans was significantly decreased when grown with streptococcus  sanguinis, but was modestly increased when co-cultivated with lactobacillus casei. co-cultivation with s. mutans significantly enhanced biofilm formation by  streptococcus oralis and l. casei, as compared to the respective mono-species biofilms. realtime-pcr analysis showed that expression of spap (for multi-functional adhesin spap, a surface-associated protein that s. mutans uses to bind to the tooth surface in the absence of sucrose), gtfb (for glucosyltransferase b that synthesizes alpha1,6-linked glucan polymers from sucrose and starch carbohydrates) and gbpb (for surface-associated protein gbpb,  which binds to the glucan polymers) was decreased significantly when s. mutans were co-cultivated with l. casei. similar results were also found with expression of spap and gbpb, but not gtfb, when s. mutans was grown in biofilms with s. oralis. compared to mono-species biofilms, the expression of luxs in s. mutans co-cultivated with s. oralis or l. casei was also significantly decreased. no significant differences were observed in expression of the selected genes when s. mutans was co-cultivated with s. sanguinis. conclusions: these results suggest that the presence of specific oral bacteria differentially affects biofilm formation and virulence gene expression by s. mutans.

TI  == profiling of subgingival plaque biofilm microflora from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with periodontitis using quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == background and objective: qualitative and quantitative changes of the subgingival plaque biofilm microflora in periodontal pockets are thought to be associated with the development and progression of periodontitis. the aims of the present study were to quantify the proportions of nine periodontitis-associated bacterial species and four streptococcus species in subgingival plaque, and to evaluate their relationship with periodontitis quantitatively. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 12 periodontally healthy subjects and from 28 patients with periodontitis. the amounts of total and target bacteria were measured by quantitative real-time pcr using universal and species-specific  primers, respectively. results: the proportion of total obligate anaerobes was found to be higher in subjects with periodontitis than in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.05). among obligate anaerobes, tannerella forsythia (2.04 +/- 5.27%, p < 0.05), porphyromonas gingivalis (0.54 +/- 1.41%) and eubacterium saphenum (0.30 +/- 0.96%) were detected at high proportions in subjects with periodontitis, but not in periodontally healthy subjects. by contrast, the proportion of total streptococci was lower in subjects with periodontitis (p < 0.05). specifically, the proportion of t. forsythia, p. gingivalis or e. saphenum increased (>or= 2.78%) and the proportion of streptococcus species decreased to virtually undetectable levels, in subjects with periodontitis. conclusion: obligate anaerobes, including t. forthysia, p. gingivalis and e. saphenum, were identified predominantly in microflora from subjects with periodontitis, whereas  streptococcus species were identified predominantly in microflora from periodontally healthy subjects, suggesting a change in the subgingival environment that resulted in conditions more suitable for the survival of obligate anaerobes. the proportion of these obligate anaerobes in the subgingival plaque of subjects with periodontitis appears to be associated with the status of human periodontitis.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferases modulate the establishment of microcolonies within multispecies biofilms.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is a key contributor to the formation of the extracellular polysaccharide (eps) matrix in dental biofilms. the exopolysaccharides, which are mostly glucans synthesized by streptococcal glucosyltransferases (gtfs), provide  binding sites that promote accumulation of microorganisms on the tooth surface and further establishment of pathogenic biofilms. this study explored (i) the role of s. mutans gtfs in the development of the eps matrix and microcolonies in  biofilms, (ii) the influence of exopolysaccharides on formation of microcolonies, and (iii) establishment of s. mutans in a multispecies biofilm in vitro using a novel fluorescence labeling technique. our data show that the ability of s. mutans strains defective in the gtfb gene or the gtfb and gtfc genes to form microcolonies on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite surfaces was markedly disrupted. however, deletion of both gtfb (associated with insoluble glucan synthesis) and gtfc (associated with insoluble and soluble glucan synthesis) is required for the maximum reduction in eps matrix and biofilm formation. s. mutans grown with sucrose in the presence of streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii steadily formed exopolysaccharides, which allowed the initial clustering of bacterial cells and further development into highly structured microcolonies. concomitantly, s. mutans became the major species in the mature biofilm. neither  the eps matrix nor microcolonies were formed in the presence of glucose in the multispecies biofilm. our data show that gtfb and gtfc are essential for establishment of the eps matrix, but gtfb appears to be responsible for formation of microcolonies by s. mutans; these gtf-mediated processes may enhance the competitiveness of s. mutans in the multispecies environment in biofilms on tooth surfaces.

TI  == [dissertations 25 years after date 21. enhancing resistance to bacteria with chlorhexidine varnish and probiotics].
AB  == the aim of the research described in 'chemotherapy against streptococcus mutans'  was to increase colonization resistance against mutans streptococci by inoculating actinomyces naeslundii on the dentition. actinomyces naeslundii established better after chlorhexidine application than after dental cleansing only but did not exceed the 1% level of the total actinomyces population. this was insufficient to increase the colonization resistance against mutans streptococci. a 33% chlorhexidine varnish was developed. after a single short-term application of the varnish all plaque bacteria were erased. after several hours streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis  and streptococcus gordonii re-established on the surface. actinomyces naeslundii  recovered later, but often with higher numbers. mutans streptococci remained suppressed for months. this led to less acid production in dental plaque and caries reduction. the combination of mechanical cleansing and varnish application resulted in additional pocket reduction. recently, attention is also established  for research on the application ofprobiotics in periodotology.

TI  == rpoa is a useful gene for identification and classification of streptococcus pneumoniae from the closely related viridans group streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading etiological agent of pneumonia, shares a high degree of dna sequence homology with the viridans group of streptococci. the clinical and pathological manifestations may present with different features, and discrimination between s. pneumoniae and its close viridans cocci relatives, such as streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis, is still quite difficult. the 445-bp sequences of the n-terminal region of rpoa from nine s. pneumoniae, seven  s. mitis, ten s. oralis, and two related strains were determined and compared with their respective 16s rrna gene sequences to establish their usefulness in phylogenetic analysis. pairwise comparisons of rpoa sequences among the species showed higher rates of evolution with lower similarities (92.3-100%) than those of 16s rrna genes (96.8-100%). the rpoa-based phylogeny generated deeper branches and presented improved discriminatory resolution than the 16s rrna gene-based phylogeny. these results show that rpoa sequences represent a consistent, but more discriminating, genomic marker than 16s rrna gene sequences for investigating the evolutionary relationships of streptococcus at the species level. rpoa could be a useful marker for identifying and classifying s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis from closely related taxa.

TI  == central role of the early colonizer veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. we investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. of six species tested, only the initial colonizer actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. the initial colonizer streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. the early colonizer veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. the biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. all three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., a. oris, veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. further specificity was seen when fusobacterium  nucleatum (a middle colonizer), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and p. gingivalis did not grow with s. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. we propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.

AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == impact of hydrodynamics on oral biofilm strength.
AB  == mechanical removal of oral biofilms is ubiquitously accepted as the best way to prevent caries and periodontal diseases. removal effectiveness strongly depends on biofilm strength. to investigate the influence of hydrodynamics on oral biofilm strength, we grew single- and multi-species biofilms of streptococcus oralis j22, actinomyces naeslundii tv14-j1, and full dental plaque at shear rates ranging from 0.1 to 50 1/sec and measured their compressive strength. subsequently, biofilm architecture was evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. multi-species biofilms were stronger than single-species biofilms, with strength values ranging from 6 to 51 pa and from 5 to 17 pa, respectively. in response to increased hydrodynamic shear, biofilm strength decreased, and architecture changed from uniform carpet-like to more "fluffy" with higher thickness. s. oralis biofilms grown under variable shear of 7 and 50 1/sec possessed properties intermediate of those measured at the respective single shears.

TI  == mutualistic biofilm communities develop with porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. we report here that p. gingivalis atcc 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. integration of p. gingivalis into multispecies communities was  investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. in flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr using species-specific primers. p. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer  streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces oris, as well as with  veillonella sp. (early colonizer), fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). in three-species flow cells, p. gingivalis grew with veillonella sp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans but not with s. oralis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, it grew with veillonella sp. and f. nucleatum but not with s. oralis and f. nucleatum, indicating that p.  gingivalis and s. oralis are not compatible. however, p. gingivalis grew in combination with s. gordonii and s. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of p. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.

TI  == identification of the binding domain of streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase for porphyromonas gingivalis major fimbriae.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis forms communities with antecedent oral biofilm constituent streptococci. p. gingivalis major fimbriae bind to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) present on the streptococcal surface, and this interaction plays an important role in p. gingivalis colonization. this study identified the binding domain of streptococcus oralis gapdh for p. gingivalis fimbriae. s. oralis recombinant gapdh (rgapdh) was digested with lysyl endopeptidase. cleaved fragments of rgapdh were applied to a  reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatograph equipped with a c18 column. each peak was collected; the binding activity toward p. gingivalis recombinant fimbrillin (rfima) was analyzed with a biomolecular interaction analysis system.  the fragment displaying the strongest binding activity was further digested with  various proteinases, after which the binding activity of each fragment was measured. the amino acid sequence of each fragment was determined by direct sequencing, mass spectrometric analysis, and amino acid analysis. amino acid residues 166 to 183 of s. oralis gapdh exhibited the strongest binding activity toward rfima; confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 166 to 183 of s. oralis gapdh (pep166-183, dnfgvveglmttihaytg) inhibits s. oralis-p. gingivalis biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. moreover, pep166-183 inhibited interbacterial biofilm formation by several oral streptococci and p. gingivalis strains with different types of fima. these results indicate that the binding domain of s. oralis gapdh for p. gingivalis fimbriae exists within the region encompassing amino acid residues 166 to 183 of gapdh and that pep166-183 may be a potent inhibitor of p. gingivalis colonization in the oral cavity.

AB  == purpose: a recent in vivo study has shown considerable contamination of internal  implant and suprastructure components with great biodiversity, indicating bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface, abutment-prosthesis interface, and restorative margins. the goal of the present study was to compare  microbiologically the peri-implant sulcus to these internal components on implants with no clinical signs of peri-implantitis and in function for many years. checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was used to identify and quantify 40 species. material and methods: fifty-eight turned titanium branemark implants in  eight systemically healthy patients (seven women, one man) under regular supportive care were examined. all implants had been placed in the maxilla and loaded with a screw-retained full-arch bridge for an average of 9.6 years. gingival fluid samples were collected from the deepest sulcus per implant for microbiological analysis. as all fixed restorations were removed, the cotton pellet enclosed in the intra-coronal compartment and the abutment screw were retrieved and microbiologically evaluated. results: the pellet enclosed in the suprastructure was very similar to the peri-implant sulcus in terms of bacterial  detection frequencies and levels for practically all the species included in the  panel. yet, there was virtually no microbial link between these compartments. when comparing the abutment screw to the peri-implant sulcus, the majority of the species were less frequently found, and in lower numbers at the former. however,  a relevant link in counts for a lot of bacteria was described between these compartments. even though all implants in the present study showed no clinical signs of peri-implantitis, the high prevalence of numerous species associated with pathology was striking. conclusions: intra-coronal compartments of screw-retained fixed restorations were heavily contaminated. the restorative margin may have been the principal pathway for bacterial leakage. contamination of abutment screws most likely occurred from the peri-implant sulcus via the implant-abutment interface and abutment-prosthesis interface.

TI  == oral bacterial adhesion forces to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction in orthodontic treatment.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction represents a growing problem in orthodontics, because bacteria can adversely affect treatment by causing demineralization of the enamel surface around the brackets. it is important to know the forces with which bacteria adhere to the surfaces of these junction materials, as the strength of these forces will determine how easy it will be to remove the bacteria. we compared the adhesion forces of five initially colonizing and four cariogenic strains of bacteria to an orthodontic adhesive, stainless steel, and enamel, with and without a salivary conditioning film. adhesion forces were determined using atomic force microscopy and a bacterial probe. in the absence of a salivary conditioning film, the strongest bacterial adhesion forces occurred to the adhesive surface (-2.9 to -6.9 nn), while adhesion forces to the enamel surfaces were lowest (-0.8 to -2.7 nn). in the presence of a salivary conditioning film, adhesion forces were reduced strongly, to less than 1 nn, and  the differences between the various materials were reduced. generally, however, initial colonizers of dental hard surfaces presented stronger adhesion forces to  the different materials (-4.7 and -0.6 nn in the absence and presence of a salivary conditioning film, respectively) than cariogenic strains (-1.8 and -0.5  nn).

AB  == fluoride is a reductive agent and may modify the oxide layer of titanium (ti) in  the transgingival region of dental implants. the low ph and the high fluoride concentration of prophylactic mouthwashes and gels (used in caries prevention) may play a role in this phenomenon. our main goal was to examine whether changes  on the surface structure of ti caused by high fluoride concentration and acidic ph alter the adherence and the colonization of bacteria. polished commercially pure ti discs (cp grade 4, camlog, biotechnologies ag, switzerland) were used in  the study. each sample was treated for 1 hour with one of the solutions: mouthwash containing 0.025% (250 ppm) fluoride, a gel containing 1.25% (12500 ppm) fluoride, and a solution of 1% naf (3800 ppm fluoride), ph 4.5. the surface  structure of the discs was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (afm) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps). the colonization of streptococcus mutans was studied by scanning electron microscope (sem) after a 5-day incubation period. the roughness of the treated sample surfaces (ra), as revealed by afm measurements, increased 1.3 times for the gel and the mouthwash, and approximately seven folds for the 1% naf solution, as compared to the control surface. the high fluoride concentration and acidic ph of the gel and the 1% naf  solution resulted in a strong corrosion and a modification of the composition of  the ti surface. the xps spectra showed the formation of a fluoride containing complex (na2tif6) bound strongly to the surface. a correlation was revealed between the roughness of the surface and thickness and maturity of the s. mutans  bacterial colonies developed on the modified ti surface. high fluoride concentration and acidic ph increased the roughness of the ti surface. bacterial  biofilm colonization on this rough surface proved to be more mature. the amount of bacteria was increased due to the changes in the surface caused by fluoride treatment. the present study indicates that high fluoride concentration in an acidic ph environment may affect the development of a healthy transgingival epithelial junction on the ti surface. this work was supported by the simi-nas project of the 5th fwp of the european commission (growth program, grd3-2001-61801), the hungarian ministry of economy and the ec (gvop-3.2.1.-2004-04-0408/3.0), the hungarian ministry of health (ett, 434/2006), and the hungarian scientific research fund (otka f-68440).

TI  == molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(b) and mef(a)] in streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == objectives: although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within cf airways has not yet been examined. we therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. methods: erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (vgs) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and vgs [n = 84; i.e. streptococcus salivarius  (n = 30), streptococcus mitis (n = 17), streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), streptococcus oralis (n = 10), streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), streptococcus infantis (n = 3), streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult cf patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for  at least the previous 7 months. results: almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. the majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(b) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(a) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(e) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(b) and mef(e) genes simultaneously  in 11/99 (11.1%). these results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in vgs in adult cf patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. conclusions: long-term treatment with azithromycin in cf patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal vgs, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.

TI  == transient acid-impairment of growth ability of oral streptococcus, actinomyces, and lactobacillus: a possible ecological determinant in dental plaque.
AB  == introduction: dental plaque ph decreases to about 4 through bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates and this low ph is maintained for from several minutes to about an hour. repeated acidification causes demineralization of the tooth surface, resulting in caries formation. the acidification also influences plaque bacteria. severe acidification kills bacteria efficiently, while physiological acidification, the condition occurring in plaque, kills bacteria partially and may impair growth ability. we, therefore, investigated the effects  of physiological acidification on representative caries-related bacteria. methods: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, lactobacillus paracasei, and actinomyces naeslundii were used. effects of physiological acidification at ph 4.0 on cell viability and growth ability, as well as the growth rate of these bacteria at ph 4.0-7.0, were  investigated. results: mutans streptococci and lactobacillus grew at ph 4.0 but the growth of s. sanguinis and s. oralis ceased below ph 4.2 and ph 4.2-4.4, respectively. acidification at ph 4.0 for 1 h killed 43-89%, 45% and 35-76% of s. sanguinis, s. oralis, and actinomyces, respectively. furthermore, assessment of bacterial growth curves revealed that the growth ability of the surviving cells of s. sanguinis, s. oralis and actinomyces was impaired, but it was recovered within 2-5 h after the environmental ph had returned to 7.0. the acidification neither killed nor impaired the growth of mutans streptococci and lactobacillus.  conclusions: these results indicate that physiological and transient acidification is not sufficient to kill bacteria, but it causes a temporary acid-impairment of their growth ability, which may function as an ecological determinant for microbial composition in dental plaque.

TI  == oral biofilm models for mechanical plaque removal.
AB  == in vitro plaque removal studies require biofilm models that resemble in vivo dental plaque. here, we compare contact and non-contact removal of single and dual-species biofilms as well as of biofilms grown from human whole saliva in vitro using different biofilm models. bacteria were adhered to a salivary pellicle for 2 h or grown after adhesion for 16 h, after which, their removal was evaluated. in a contact mode, no differences were observed between the manual, rotating, or sonic brushing; and removal was on average 39%, 84%, and 95% for streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, and actinomyces naeslundii, respectively, and 90% and 54% for the dual- and multi-species biofilms, respectively. however, in a non-contact mode, rotating and sonic brushes still removed considerable numbers of bacteria (24-40%), while the manual brush as a control (5-11%) did not. single a. naeslundii and dual-species (a. naeslundii and s. oralis) biofilms were more difficult to remove after 16 h growth than after 2  h adhesion (on average, 62% and 93% for 16- and 2-h-old biofilms, respectively),  while in contrast, biofilms grown from whole saliva were easier to remove (97% after 16 h and 54% after 2 h of growth). considering the strong adhesion of dual-species biofilms and their easier more reproducible growth compared with biofilms grown from whole saliva, dual-species biofilms of a. naeslundii and s. oralis are suggested to be preferred for use in mechanical plaque removal studies in vitro.

AB  == aims: to conduct a pilot human clinical trial to assess the safety and to test the ability of a probiotic mouthwash, probiora(3), to affect the levels of streptococcus mutans and certain known periodontal pathogens in the mouth when administered twice daily over a period of 4 weeks. methods and results: the mouthwash contained three specific strains of naturally occurring oral bacteria and was tested at two dose levels: 10(6) and 10(8) colony forming units each of strep. oralis strain kj3sm, strep. uberis strain kj2sm, and the spontaneous lactic acid-deficient variant of strep. rattus, strain jh145. substantial decreases in the levels of the marker bacteria were observed. no safety issues were noted with the twice daily application of this mouthwash. conclusions: despite the small number of subjects and the use of young, orally healthy adults, along with the inherent variability in the microbiological measurements, the probiotic mouthwash was able to substantially affect the levels of dental pathogens in saliva and periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque. significance and impact of the study: the results of this pilot human study suggest that the probiotic mouthwash product may be safe for daily use as an aid in maintaining both dental and periodontal health.

TI  == denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of pcr-amplified gki genes: a new technique for tracking streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are a well-known cause of infections in immunocompromised patients, accounting for severe morbidity and mortality. streptococcus mitis group species (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis) are among the vgs most often encountered in clinical practice. identifying the portal of entry for s. mitis group strains is crucial for interventions preventing bacterial translocation. unfortunately, tracking the source of s. mitis group strains is dependent on a combination of extremely laborious and time-consuming cultivation and molecular techniques (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-pcr [eric-pcr]). to simplify this procedure, a pcr analysis with newly designed primers targeting the household gene glucose kinase (gki) was used in combination with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). this gki-pcr-dgge technique proved to be specific for s. mitis group strains. moreover, these strains could be detected in samples comprised of highly diverse microbiota, without prior cultivation. to study the feasibility of this new approach, a pilot study was performed. this confirmed that the source of s. mitis group bacteremia in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia could be tracked back to the throat in five out of six episodes of bacteremia, despite the fact that throat samples are polymicrobial samples containing multiple s. mitis group strains. in contrast, using the classical combination of cultivation techniques and eric-pcr, we could detect these strains in only two out of six cases, showing the superiority of the newly  developed technique. the new gki-pcr-dgge technique can track the source of s. mitis group strains in polymicrobial samples without prior cultivation. therefore, it is a valuable tool in future epidemiological studies.

TI  == population structure of streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis is a member of the normal human oral microbiota, capable of  opportunistic pathogenicity; like related oral streptococci, it exhibits appreciable phenotypic and genetic variation. a multilocus sequence typing (mlst) scheme for s. oralis was developed and the resultant data analysed to examine the population structure of the species. analysis of 113 isolates, confirmed as belonging to the s. oralis/mitis group by 16s rrna gene sequencing, characterized the population as highly diverse and undergoing inter- and intra-species recombination with a probable clonal complex structure. clonalframe analysis of these s. oralis isolates along with examples of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae grouped the named species  into distinct, coherent populations and did not support the clustering of s. pseudopneumoniae with s. mitis as reported previously using distance-based methods. analysis of the individual loci suggested that this discrepancy was due  to the possible hybrid nature of s. pseudopneumoniae. the data are available on the public mlst website (http://pubmlst.org/soralis/).

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

AB  == purpose: : to report a case of polymicrobial keratitis caused by streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. in a  patient who underwent collagen cross-linking for keratoconus. method: : case report. result: : a 32-year-old male presented with a 1-day history of a painful  red eye, occurring 3 days after he had undergone a collagen cross-linking with riboflavin and uv-a on his left eye for keratoconus. he admitted to removing his  bandage contact lens and cleaning it in his mouth before reapplying it in his eye. on presentation, a severe keratitis with an 8-mm epithelial defect and 360-degree ring infiltrate was found. culture results from his contact lens were  positive for s. salivarius and s. oralis, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. were grown from his corneal scrapings. conclusions: : collagen cross-linking  is a promising procedure for the treatment of progressive keratoconus with minimal reported side effects. however, the possibility of a secondary infection  after the procedure exists because the patient is subjected to epithelial debridement and the application of a soft contact lens. the role of the uv light  on the immune mechanisms of the cornea and its effect on corneal wound healing warrant further investigation.

TI  == multi-species biofilm formation on dental materials and an adhesive patch.
AB  == purpose: this laboratory study assessed the influence of surface roughness and contact time on the formation of a multi-species biofilm on dental materials (adhesive patch, composite, amalgam and enamel). materials and methods: rough and smooth specimens of each material were prepared and the mean surface roughness was assessed profilometrically. the biofilms were then allowed to grow either for 15 min or 15 h respectively on saliva-preconditioned specimens of each material,  and colony-forming units on blood agar were counted (n = 9/group) surface morphology was assessed using a scanning electron microscope. results: no difference was found in the biofilm formation rate among all the materials that were tested. after a short incubation period, a statistical significant difference between smooth and rough samples could be detected on amalgam and on the resin composite material (p < or = 0.001). conclusions: surface roughness may influence the initial biofilm adherence, but differences vanish following growth  and maturation. the multi-species biofilm offers a reliable laboratory model for  studying plaque formation.

TI  == clostridium perfringens liver abscess after pancreatic resection.
AB  == background: liver abscess is a rare complication after pancreatectomy. clostridium perfingens is a rare cause of intrahepatic infections. case report: a 65-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer underwent explorative laparotomy, during which encasement of the hepatic artery by the tumor was found. neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy with capecitabine was started, which caused tumor regression, and duodenopancreatectomy was performed. the portal vein was occluded and infiltrated by cancer and therefore was resected and not reconstructed. after a slow recovery, the patient developed hemorrhage at the gastrojejunal anastomosis, which was controlled by fibrin injection. within a few days, she presented with signs of sepsis, and blood cultures yielded clostridium perfringens, streptococcus oralis, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans. the source of  the sepsis proved to be a 9-cm liver abscess, which was drained; cultures grew c. perfringens, hafnia alvei, and enterobacter cloacae. despite antibiotic treatment, the patient died from sepsis and multiorgan failure 27 days after pancreatic surgery. conclusion: such rare infections can follow pancreatic resection with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. clostridium perfringens-associated  liver abscess maintains a high mortality rate.

AB  == plaque formation on dental ceramics may cause gingival inflammation and secondary caries. this in vitro study compared the susceptibility of various dental ceramics to adhere oral streptococci, and verified the influence of substratum surface roughness and surface hydrophobicity. three zirconia ceramic materials and three veneering glass-ceramics were investigated. fifteen test specimens were prepared for each material, polished, and surface roughness and hydrophobicity were determined. after incubation with artificial saliva (2 h, 37 degrees c) for  pellicle formation, specimens were incubated with suspensions of streptococcus gordonii dsmz 6777, streptococcus mutans dsmz 20523, streptococcus oralis dsmz 20627, or streptococcus sanguinis dsmz 20068, respectively, for 2.5 h at 37 degrees c. adherent bacteria were quantified using a fluorescence dye for viable  cell quantification (alamar blue/resazurin). statistical analysis was performed using one- and two-way anova and the tukey-kramer multiple comparison test for post hoc analysis (alpha < 0.05). surface roughness and surface hydrophobicity differed significantly among the various ceramics; protein coating hydrophilized  the surfaces, and led to a homogenization of the surface hydrophobicity of the various ceramics. before protein coating, almost similar relative fluorescence intensities indicating similar adhesion of streptococci were found for the various ceramics; more distinct differences were observed after protein coating.  correlations between surface parameters and streptococcal adhesion were poor. within the limitations of these experiments, the findings of this in vitro study  indicate only little differences between zirconia and glass ceramic with regard to streptococcal adhesion. judging from these results, it is unlikely that exposed zirconia surfaces yield more plaque than glass ceramic surfaces in vivo.

AB  == purpose: to report the early presentation, cause, and successful medical management of combined acanthamoeba keratitis (ak) and infectious crystalline keratopathy (ick). design: interventional case series. methods: retrospective review of 111 ak patients diagnosed and managed at the university of illinois eye and ear infirmary between june 1, 2003 and november 30, 2008 for an additional diagnosis of infectious keratitis. results: of 5 ak patients with microbiologic evidence of an additional bacterial keratitis during their active ak treatment, concomitant ick developed in 3 patients. all patients were examined within 3 weeks of their ak diagnosis and were found to have characteristic signs and symptoms consistent with ick. bacterial culture results at the time of ak diagnosis were negative in 2 patients, but subsequent culture results were positive for streptococcus oralis. initial culture results demonstrated light growth of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus in the remaining patient, who had received partial antibiotic treatment. topical corticosteroids were used  before diagnosis in 2 patients and were in use in only 1 patient after ak diagnosis. all infections resolved with medical therapy alone. one patient later  required penetrating keratoplasty for visual rehabilitation. conclusions: in patients with ak, ick can develop early and without either the use of corticosteroids or a preexisting epithelial defect, inconsistent with previously  suggested mechanisms and major risk factors for secondary infection. combined ak  and ick may exhibit increased pathogenicity with the onset of severe, often new,  pain and acceleration of localized tissue loss and resultant scarring. although early recognition and aggressive medical treatment were successful in resolving the combined infections in our cases, acanthamoeba coinfection, and perhaps endosymbiosis, should be considered in the evaluation and clinical management of  ak, especially in those cases progressing atypically. further research is needed  to understand the precise mechanism of the introduction of coinfectious pathogens and their role in the pathogenicity of ak.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 requires actinomyces naeslundii atcc 43146 for growth on saliva in a three-species community that includes streptococcus oralis  34.
AB  == formation of dental plaque is a developmental process involving initial and late  colonizing species that form polymicrobial communities. fusobacteria are the most numerous gram-negative bacteria in dental plaque, but they become prevalent after the initial commensal colonizers, such as streptococci and actinomyces, have established communities. the unusual ability of these bacteria to coaggregate with commensals, as well as pathogenic late colonizers, has been proposed to facilitate colonization by the latter organisms. we investigated the integration  of fusobacterium nucleatum into multispecies communities by employing two in vitro models with saliva as the sole nutritional source. in flow cell biofilms, numbers of cells were quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilms were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr (q-pcr) using species-specific primers. unable to grow as single-species biofilms, f. nucleatum grew in two-species biofilms with actinomyces naeslundii but not with streptococcus oralis. however, enhanced growth of fusobacteria was observed in three-species biofilms, indicating that there was multispecies cooperation. importantly, these community dynamics yielded an 18-fold increase in the f. nucleatum biomass between 4 h and 18 h in the flow cell inoculated with three species. q-pcr analysis of static biofilms revealed that maximum growth of  the three species occurred at 24 h to 36 h. lower numbers of cells were observed  at 48 h, suggesting that saliva could not support higher cell densities as the sole nutrient. integration of f. nucleatum into multispecies commensal communities was evident from the interdigitation of fusobacteria in coaggregates  with a. naeslundii and s. oralis and from the improved growth of fusobacteria, which was dependent on the presence of a. naeslundii.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the surface properties of dental ceramic materials belonging to different ceramic classes, and to correlate the findings to the initial adherence of three oral streptococcal strains. methods: rectangular specimens were prepared from different ceramic materials (glass/lithium disilicate glass/glass-infiltrated zirconia/partially sintered zirconia/hipped zirconia ceramic) and polished; surface roughness (ra) was determined. glass plates were used as a control. specimens were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline or an artificial saliva (protein mixture; 2h, 37 degrees c). surface free energy (gamma(t)) and its polar (gamma(p)) and disperse (gamma(d)) contribution were determined prior to and after artificial saliva exposure. uncoated and protein-coated specimens were incubated with streptococcus gordonii dsmz 6777, streptococcus oralis dsmz 20068  or streptococcus sanguinis dsmz 20068 suspension for 2.5h at 37 degrees c (n=15 for each treatment and strain). adherent streptococci were quantified fluorometrically. results: the lithium disilicate glass ceramic showed the highest values for ra; the lowest values were found for the glass ceramic, the partially sintered zirconia and the hipped zirconia ceramic. protein coating caused a significant increase in gamma(t) and gamma(p), but not in the control material. the control material showed higher values for streptococcal adhesion than all ceramic materials. after protein coating, only slight and random differences in streptococcal adhesion were found between the various ceramic materials. significance: dental ceramic materials show differences in terms of ra, gamma(t) and initial streptococcal adhesion; however, correlations between surface properties and streptococcal adhesion were poor.

TI  == an in vitro evaluation of hydrolytic enzymes as dental plaque control agents.
AB  == the plaque-control potential of commercially available amylase, lipase and protease was evaluated by observing their effects on coaggregation and on bacterial viability within various plaque microcosms. a quantitative coaggregation assay indicated that protease significantly inhibited the extent of coaggregation of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis (p <0.05) and of porphyromonas gingivalis and s. oralis. amylase significantly (p <0.05) increased the coaggregation of a. naeslundii versus fusobacterium nucleatum and a. naeslundii versus p. gingivalis. concomitant challenge of constant-depth film fermenter-grown plaques with the enzymes did not result in detectable ecological  perturbations (assessed by differential culture and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). similar dosing and analysis of multiple sorbarod devices did not reveal increases in bacterial dispersion which could result from disaggregation of extant plaques. a short-term hydroxyapatite colonization model  was therefore used to investigate possible enzyme effects on early-stage plaque development. whilst culture did not indicate significant reductions in adhesion or plaque accumulation, a vital visual assay revealed significantly increased aggregation frequency following enzyme exposure. in summary, although hydrolytic  enzymes negatively influenced binary coaggregation, they did not cause statistically significant changes in bacterial viability within plaque microcosms. in contrast, enzyme exposure increased aggregation within extant plaques.

AB  == objective: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have increased  understanding of the distribution of oral bacterial species in clinical specimens, though few investigations have been conducted to simultaneously detect oral streptococcal and periodontal species in the same specimens. the purpose of  the present study was to investigate the distribution and correlation of 6 oral streptococcal and 6 periodontal species in saliva specimens taken from children and their mothers. design: seventy-four pairs of children and their mothers were  approved to participate in this study. saliva specimens were collected and bacterial dna extracted, which was subjected to pcr analyses using species-specific sets of primers. the combinations of species able to be detected simultaneously were determined by statistical analyses. results: streptococcus sobrinus and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected more often in the mothers than the children. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus oralis were detected simultaneously in a significant number of specimens, while the presence of campylobacter rectus was correlated with the presence of at least one of the red complex species (p. gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythensis). on the other hand, no correlation was shown between the rates of detection of oral streptococcal and periodontal species. conclusions: our results indicate that among streptococcal and periodontal species, several are able to coexist in saliva, while the presence of both does not have an influence on each other.

TI  == distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in five different intra-oral habitats in young children.
AB  == background: knowledge of the colonization patterns and composition of the oral microbiota can lead to a better understanding of disease initiation. aim: the aim of this study was to examine the distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in  samples from five different oral habitats in young greek children. design: ninety-three children 3-12 years old (mean + sd 7.9 +/- 2.5) (60.2% male, 39.8% female) participated and split into three different age groups: primary (3-6 years), early mixed (6-9 years), and mixed dentition (9-12 years). samples for bacterial enumeration were taken from saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and soft tissues from each child, and were further analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: mean counts and proportions of all the test bacteria differed significantly among sample locations. cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all healthy children. mean  proportions of streptococcus mutans isolated from soft tissue and streptococcus sanguinis from soft tissue, subgingival and saliva samples increased significantly with age, whereas the opposite was seen for lactobacillus acidophilus. conclusions: cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all young children. soft tissues, saliva, and tongue were more often colonized by cariogenic streptococcal species than teeth. these surfaces may serve as reservoirs for oral pathogens, requiring attention during preventive interventions.

TI  == transient bacteremia after removal of a bonded maxillary expansion appliance.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of transient  bacteremia after the removal of a modified bonded rapid maxillary expansion appliance. methods: the sample consisted of 25 subjects (15 girls, 10 boys; mean  age, 14.4 years; range, 12.2-16.6 years). all subjects underwent rapid maxillary  expansion at the start of the orthodontic treatment with the same type of appliance. two 10-ml blood samples were taken, the first as a baseline and the second 3 minutes after removal of the appliance. all blood samples were incubated in an automated blood culture system, and bacteria were identified by using conventional biochemical methods and api kits (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). results: overt soft-tissue bleeding was observed in 11 of the 25 patients during appliance removal, and 8 of 25 patients showed bacteremia after appliance removal. the data were analyzed with the fisher exact test. no statistically significant relationship was found between overt bleeding and bacteremia incidence (p = 0.054). conclusions: because transient bacteremia is caused by trauma from the removal of the modified bonded rapid maxillary expansion appliance, orthodontists should consider the possibility of bacterial endocarditis in at-risk patients when using splint-type tooth-and-tissue-borne rapid maxillary expansion appliances.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant nonhemolytic streptococci on the basis of sequence analysis of 16s-23s intergenic spacer region and partial gdh gene.
AB  == nonhemolytic streptococci (nhs) cause serious infections, such as endocarditis and septicemia. many conventional phenotypic methods are insufficient for the identification of bacteria in this group to the species level. genetic analysis has revealed that single-gene analysis is insufficient for the identification of  all species in this group of bacteria. the aim of the present study was to establish a method based on sequence analysis of the 16s-23s intergenic spacer (its) region and the partial gdh gene to identify clinical relevant nhs to the species level. sequence analysis of the its region was performed with 57 nhs reference or clinical strains. satisfactory identification to the species level was achieved for 14/19 nhs species included in this study on the basis of sequence analysis of the its region. streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis obtained the expected taxon as the best taxon match, but there was a short maximum score distance to the next best match (distance, <10). streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae could not be unambiguously discriminated by sequence analysis of the its region, as was also proven by phylogenetic analysis. these five species could be identified to the group level only by its sequence analysis. partial gdh sequence analysis was  applied to the 11 s. oralis strains, the 11 s. mitis strains, and the 17 s. pneumoniae strains. all except one strain achieved a satisfactory identification  to the species level. a phylogenetic algorithm based on the analysis of partial gdh gene sequences revealed three distinct clusters. we suggest that sequence analysis of the combination of the its region and the partial gdh gene can be used in the reference laboratory for the species-level identification of nhs.

TI  == comparative structural and molecular characterization of ribitol-5-phosphate-containing streptococcus oralis coaggregation receptor polysaccharides.
AB  == the antigenically related coaggregation receptor polysaccharides (rps) of streptococcus oralis strains c104 and sk144 mediate recognition of these bacteria by other members of the dental plaque biofilm community. in the present study, the structure of strain sk144 rps was established by high resolution nmr spectroscopy as [6galfbeta1-6galnacbeta1-3galalpha1-2ribitol-5-po(4)(-)-6galfbeta1-3galbeta1](n), thereby indicating that this polysaccharide and the previously characterized rps  of strain c104 are identical, except for the linkage between gal and ribitol-5-phosphate, which is alpha1-2 in strain sk144 versus alpha1-1 in strain  c104. studies to define the molecular basis of rps structure revealed comparable  genes for six putative transferases and a polymerase in the rps loci of these streptococci. cell surface rps production was abolished by disrupting the gene for the first transferase of strain c104 with a nonpolar erm cassette. it was restored in the resulting mutant by plasmid-based expression of either wcjg, the  corresponding gene of s. pneumoniae for serotype 10a capsular polysaccharide (cps) biosynthesis or wbap for the transferase of salmonella enterica that initiates o-polysaccharide biosynthesis. thus, wcjg, like wbap, appears to initiate polysaccharide biosynthesis by transferring galactose-1-phosphate to a lipid carrier. in further studies, the structure of strain c104 rps was converted to that of strain sk144 by replacing the gene (wefm) for the fourth transferase in the rps locus of strain c104 with the corresponding gene (wcrc) of strain sk144 or streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 10a. these findings identify genetic markers for the different ribitol-5-phosphate-containing types of rps present in  s. oralis and establish a close relationship between these polysaccharides and serogroup 10 cpss of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == zinc and copper play a role in coaggregation inhibiting action of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background/aim: we investigated the mechanisms of adherence of salivary and serum proteins, which mimic gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), to porphyromonas gingivalis, and the effects of these adhered proteins on coaggregation and hemagglutination properties. methods: the amounts of salivary and serum proteins  adhering to p. gingivalis were determined using (3)h-labeled and non-labeled proteins. the coaggregation between p. gingivalis and streptococcus oralis or streptococcus gordonii was observed. hemagglutination was evaluated using sheep erythrocytes. proteins that interacted with zinc or copper in saliva and serum and on p. gingivalis were examined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. results: the amount of salivary or serum proteins that adhered to the surface of p. gingivalis strains was increased by cations, especially zinc and copper ions. the pretreatment of bacterial cells with salivary or serum proteins before the assay inhibited coaggregation with gram-positive bacteria and hemagglutination. these phenomena were enhanced by the presence of zinc or copper ions during the pretreatment of p. gingivalis with proteins. we detected protein bands that were related to these cations in saliva  and serum and on p. gingivalis. conclusions: our findings suggest that zinc and copper ions markedly enhanced the adhesion and accumulation of salivary and serum proteins on cells of p. gingivalis and inhibited the coaggregation and hemagglutination of p. gingivalis. these cations might be useful for limiting the settlement of p. gingivalis in the gingival sulcus with the goal of preventing periodontal disease.

TI  == autoinducer-2 is produced in saliva-fed flow conditions relevant to natural oral  biofilms.
AB  == aims: we evaluated the ability of a dual-species community of oral bacteria to produce the universal signalling molecule, autoinducer-2 (ai-2), in saliva-fed biofilms. methods and results: streptococcus oralis 34, s. oralis 34 luxs mutant  and actinomyces naeslundii t14v were grown as single- and dual-species biofilms within sorbarods fed with 25% human saliva. ai-2 concentration in biofilm effluents was determined by the vibrio harveyi bb170 bioluminescence assay. after homogenizing the sorbarods to release biofilm cells, cell numbers were determined by fluorometric analysis of fluorescent antibody-labelled cells. after 48 h, dual-species biofilm communities of interdigitated s. oralis 34 and a. naeslundii t14v contained 3.2 x 10(9) cells: fivefold more than single-species biofilms. however, these 48-h dual-species biofilms exhibited the lowest concentration ratio of ai-2 to cell density. conclusions: oral bacteria produce ai-2 in saliva-fed biofilms. the decrease of more than 10-fold in concentration ratio seen between 1 and 48 h in s. oralis 34-a. naeslundii t14v biofilms suggests that peak production of ai-2 occurs early and is followed by a very low steady-state level. significance and impact of the study: high oral bacterial biofilm densities may be achieved by inter-species ai-2 signalling. we propose that low concentrations of ai-2 contribute to the establishment of oral commensal biofilm  communities.

TI  == phylogenetic analyses and detection of viridans streptococci based on sequences and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the rod shape-determining protein  gene.
AB  == background: population analysis of viridans streptococci is important because these species are associated with dental caries, bacteremia, and subacute endocarditis, in addition to being important members of the human oral commensal  microbiota. design: in this study, we phylogenetically analyzed the rod shape-determining protein gene (roda), which is associated with cellular morphology, cell division, and sensitivity for antibiotics, and demonstrated that the diversity of the roda gene is sufficient to identify viridans streptococci at the species level. moreover, we developed a more convenient denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) method based on the diversity of the roda gene (roda-dgge) for detecting nine dominant streptococcal species in human saliva, namely, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus vestibularis,  streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. results: this roda-dgge method proved useful in detecting viridans streptococci without cultivation, isolation, and phenotypic characterization. conclusion: analysis of the oral microbiota by roda-dgge offers a higher resolution than the  conventional dgge using 16s rdna and may be an alternative in the microbial diagnosis of streptococcal infection.

TI  == tinidazole inhibitory and cidal activity against anaerobic periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the in vitro activity of tinidazole against anaerobic periodontal pathogens (25 prevotella buccae, 18 prevotella denticola, 10 prevotella intermedia, 6 prevotella melaninogenica, 5 prevotella oralis, 10 fusobacterium nucleatum and 8  veillonella spp.) was determined by agar dilution. mic(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) were 8 microg/ml for veillonella spp., 4 microg/ml for p. intermedia, 2 microg/ml for p. buccae, 1 microg/ml for fusobacterium spp. and 0.5 microg/ml for other prevotella spp. cidal activity was studied by killing curves with tinidazole and amoxicillin (alone and in combination) at concentrations similar to those achieved in crevicular fluid (41.2 microg/ml tinidazole and 14.05 microg/ml amoxicillin) against an inoculum of ca. 10(7)colony-forming units/ml of four bacterial groups, each one composed of four different strains of the following periodontal isolates: prevotella spp., fusobacterium spp. and veillonella spp. (anaerobes) and one amoxicillin-susceptible streptococcus spp. (facultative) in a proportion  of 1:1:1:1. when only beta-lactamase-negative prevotella or fusobacterium strains were tested, significantly higher reductions were found with amoxicillin (>4 log  reduction at 48 h) versus controls. the presence of beta-lactamase-positive prevotella spp. or f. nucleatum strains rendered amoxicillin inactive (no reductions at 48 h), with no differences from controls. amoxicillin+tinidazole produced >3 log reduction at 24h and >4 log reduction at 48 h regardless of the presence or not of beta-lactamase-positive strains. the presence in crevicular fluid of beta-lactamases produced by beta-lactamase-positive periodontal pathogens may have ecological and therapeutic consequences since it may protect beta-lactamase-negative periodontal pathogens from amoxicillin treatment. in vitro, tinidazole offered high antianaerobic activity against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative periodontal pathogens, avoiding amoxicillin inactivation.

TI  == effect of ozone treatment on different cariogenic microorganisms in vitro.
AB  == ozone treatment has been presented and discussed in the literature, as one of the "new" ways to treat dental caries. the aim of this paper was to study the in vitro effect of ozone on some common oral microorganisms related to dental caries using scanning electron microscopy (sem). the effect of ozone was tested on three different strains of mutans streptococci and one lactobacillus strain. after exposure of bacteria to ozone treatment for 0 to 60 sec, cultivation on different chair side strips and agar plates took place. preparation and performance of scanning electron analyses in a field emission scanning electron microscope at 10 kv was then carried out. it was found that gaseous ozone treatment for 20 seconds or more was effective to kill the different microorganisms in vitro. treatment of 20, 40 and 60 seconds of ozone prevented the bacteria to grow on the different media. treatment times shorter than 20 seconds resulted in varying results with a limited effect on bacterial growth for treatments of 5-10 sec, respectively. the  difference between ozone-treated and untreated specimens was macroscopically readily discernable. none of the strains treated with ozone for 60 seconds showed any bacterial growth. only samples with untreated bacteria could be found in the  sem analyses in form of large and high colonies. this study presents a clear result of the bactericide effect of ozon (in vitro) on four different strains of  bacteria associated with dental caries.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

AB  == introduction: the aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the fess method. material and methods: studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. during the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. results: in the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. in 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, vankomycin, teicoplanin and levofloxacin. staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. another bacteria (escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. in 3 cultures (4.17%) we found klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100%  resistance to penicillins. in three cases pseudomonas fluorescens and proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of klebsiella pneumoniae. two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures  were noted: citrobacter freundii, streptococcus oralis and hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and cefuroxime was as high as 100%. conclusion: in the  operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. this indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. the cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.

TI  == influence of a chitosan on oral bacterial adhesion and growth in vitro.
AB  == generally, mechanical plaque control without chemical support is insufficient to  prevent oral diseases, and an ongoing quest exists for new antimicrobials for use in oral healthcare. chitosans are polycationic, naturally occurring antimicrobials that are rapidly finding their way into oral healthcare. in this study we determined the effects of pellicle treatment with chitosan on bacterial  adhesion and growth. chitosan caused a reduction in bacterial adhesion and was responsible for bacterial death upon contact compared with a buffer control. exposure of adhering bacteria to a chitosan solution or a buffer control did not  cause detachment, but the chitosan solution left a small proportion of the adhering bacteria alive. growth after exposure to chitosan was similar to (streptococcus mutans atcc700610, streptococcus oralis hm1, streptococcus sobrinus hg1025) or less than (s. mutans ns, actinomyces naeslundii hm1) that of  the control, while biofilm viability after chitosan treatment was lower than that of the control, except for s. oralis hm1. therefore, chitosan is a promising antimicrobial for use in oral healthcare.

TI  == characterization of a streptococcus sp.-veillonella sp. community micromanipulated from dental plaque.
AB  == streptococci and veillonellae occur in mixed-species colonies during formation of early dental plaque. one factor hypothesized to be important in assembly of these initial communities is coaggregation (cell-cell recognition by genetically distinct bacteria). intrageneric coaggregation of streptococci occurs when a lectin-like adhesin on one streptococcal species recognizes a receptor polysaccharide (rps) on the partner species. veillonellae also coaggregate with streptococci. these genera interact metabolically; lactic acid produced by streptococci is a carbon source for veillonellae. to transpose these interactions from undisturbed dental plaque to an experimentally tractable in vitro biofilm model, a community consisting of rps-bearing streptococci juxtaposed with veillonellae was targeted by quantum dot-based immunofluorescence and then micromanipulated off the enamel surface and cultured. besides the expected antibody-reactive cell types, a non-antibody-reactive streptococcus invisible during micromanipulation was obtained. the streptococci were identified as streptococcus oralis (rps bearing) and streptococcus gordonii (adhesin bearing).  the veillonellae could not be cultivated; however, a veillonella 16s rrna gene sequence was amplified from the original isolation mixture, and this sequence was identical to the sequence of the previously studied organism veillonella sp. strain pk1910, an oral isolate in our culture collection. s. oralis coaggregated  with s. gordonii by an rps-dependent mechanism, and both streptococci coaggregated with pk1910, which was used as a surrogate during in vitro community reconstruction. the streptococci and strain pk1910 formed interdigitated three-species clusters when grown as a biofilm using saliva as the nutritional source. pk1910 grew only when streptococci were present. this study confirms that rps-mediated intrageneric coaggregation occurs in the earliest stages of plaque formation by bringing bacteria together to create a functional community.

AB  == objectives: the aim of the present study was to compare the susceptibility of one novel silorane-based and four widely used conventional methacrylate-based resin composites to adhere oral streptococci and to relate any differences to surface roughness, hydrophobicity and type of matrix. methods: specimens of restoratives  filtek silorane, filtek z250, tetric evoceram, quixfil and spectrum tph were prepared (10.0-mm diameter, 2.0-mm height). surface roughness was assessed by perthometer measurements and hydrophobicity according to water contact angles was determined by computerized image analysis. bacterial suspensions of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans  were incubated for 2.5 h at 37 degrees c with 15 test specimens for each material and adhesion was quantified with fluorescence dye alamar blue/resazurin and an automated multi-detection reader. glass served as reference. statistical analysis was performed using the mann-whitney u-test (alpha=0.05). results: median roughness values of all composites ranged between 0.04 and 0.11 microm, median contact angles between 59.7 degrees and 92.1 degrees. significantly lowest fluorescence intensities of all test materials were found on filtek silorane for  three of four streptococcal strains. the fluorescence intensities of the four conventional methacrylate resin composites were significantly higher and comparable among each other. significance: when compared against four conventional methacrylate composite resins, a general significance to a lower quantity of adhering streptococci was found on the novel silorane-based composite resin, which might result from its increased hydrophobicity. the low adhesion potential of the silorane-based composite may potentially improve the longevity of direct fillings and reduce recurrent caries.

TI  == differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. there have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (nt), nonencapsulated pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. the use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. in this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between nt s. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cpnc) and other known typeable or  nt pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including pnc tigr4 and r6, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cpnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kda were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. additionally random forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cpnc isolates was tentatively identified. information gained from this  study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cpnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.

TI  == evolution of streptococcus pneumoniae and its close commensal relatives.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group of streptococci which, according to 16s rrna-sequence based phylogenetic reconstruction, includes 12 species. while other species of this group are considered prototypes of commensal bacteria, s. pneumoniae is among the most frequent microbial killers worldwide. population genetic analysis of 118 strains, supported by demonstration of a distinct cell wall carbohydrate structure and competence pheromone sequence signature, shows that s. pneumoniae is one of several hundred evolutionary lineages forming a cluster separate from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus infantis. the remaining lineages of this distinct cluster are commensals previously collectively referred to as streptococcus mitis and each represent separate species by traditional taxonomic standard. virulence genes including the operon for capsule polysaccharide synthesis and genes encoding iga1 protease, pneumolysin, and autolysin were randomly distributed among s. mitis lineages. estimates of the evolutionary age of the lineages, the identical location of remnants of virulence genes in the genomes of commensal strains, the pattern of genome reductions, and the proportion of unique genes and their origin support the model that the entire cluster of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, and s. mitis lineages evolved from pneumococcus-like bacteria presumably pathogenic to the common immediate ancestor of hominoids. during their adaptation to a commensal life style, most of the lineages gradually lost the majority of genes determining virulence and became genetically distinct due to sexual isolation in  their respective hosts.

AB  == the two recently characterized streptococcus pneumoniae strains--r6chi and r6cho(-)--that have lost the unique auxotrophic requirement of this bacterial species for choline differ in their mechanisms of choline independence. in strain r6chi the mechanism is caused by a point mutation in tacf, a gene that is part of the pneumococcal lic2 operon, which is essential for growth and survival of the bacteria. cultures of lic2 mutants of the encapsulated strain d39chi growing in choline-containing medium formed long chains, did not autolyze, had no choline in their cell wall, and were completely avirulent in the mouse intraperitoneal model. in contrast, while the cho(-) strain carried a complete pneumococcal lic2  operon and had no mutations in the tacf gene, deletion of the entire lic2 operon  had no effect on the growth or phenotype of strain cho(-). these observations suggest that the biochemical functions normally dependent on determinants of the  pneumococcal lic2 operon may also be carried out in strain cho(-) by a second set of genetic elements imported from streptococcus oralis, the choline-independent streptococcal strain that served as the dna donor in the heterologous transformation event that produced strain r6cho(-). the identification in r6cho(-) of a large (20-kb) s. oralis dna insert carrying both tacf and licd genes confirms this prediction and suggests that these heterologous elements may  represent a "backup" system capable of catalyzing p-choline incorporation and export of teichoic acid chains under conditions in which the native lic2 operon is not functional.

TI  == antibacterial activity of yoghurt against viridans streptococci in vitro.
AB  == objective: yoghurt consumption leads to a selective decrease in the oral level of mutans streptococci. it is not clear whether this decrease is due to the bactericidal activity of yoghurt or other mechanisms. the present study investigated the differences in susceptibility to yoghurt between several strains of viridans streptococci. design: the sources of variation were minimised, at the expense of the external validity of the study, using culture collection strains.  each strain was tested separately on five occasions in planktonic form and logarithmic growth phase. two strains of each of the following streptococcus species were tested: mutans, sobrinus, gordonii, oralis, parasanguinis and sanguinis. one millilitre [10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)] of each strain was incubated (37 degrees c, 60min) with 9ml of fat-free plain yoghurt containing streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus (10(8) and 10(7)cfu/g, respectively) in gently vortexed tubes. survival rates were calculated every 15min by dividing the number of viable cells, obtained using conventional laboratory procedures, by the baseline number. results: survival rates were 8% (s. mutans 6519t), 12% (s. mutans 31738), 35% (s. oralis 25671) and >50% (all other species tested) after 15min, and 0.01% (s. mutans) and >10% (all other species tested) after 30min. overall, s. parasanguinis and s. sobrinus were the most resistant species. when heat-treated yoghurt (<10cfu/g bacteria and inactivated bacteriocins) was used, this antibacterial activity was not found. conclusion: in vitro, yoghurt with live bacteria showed selective anti-mutans activity, suggesting that the overall decrease in mutans streptococci in vivo could be due to a bactericidal effect on s. mutans but not on s. sobrinus.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the effect of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on oral microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on the viability of some oral bacterial species. it also evaluated the ability of these bacteria to metabolize those substances. single-species biofilms of streptococcus gordonii, porphyromonas gingivalis, or fusobacterium nucleatum and dual-species biofilms of s. gordonii -- f. nucleatum and f. nucleatum -- p. gingivalis were grown on hydroxyapatite discs. seven species were studied as planktonic cells, including streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, and the species mentioned above. the viability of planktonic cells and biofilms was analyzed by susceptibility tests and time-kill assays, respectively, against different concentrations of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine. high-performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantify nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations in the culture media after the assays. susceptibility tests and viability assays showed  that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine cannot reduce or stimulate bacterial growth. high-performance liquid chromatography results showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations were not altered after bacteria exposure. these findings indicate that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine, in the concentrations used, cannot affect significantly the growth of these oral bacterial strains. moreover, these species do not seem to metabolize these substances.

TI  == engineering the glucansucrase gtfr enzyme reaction and glycosidic bond specificity: toward tailor-made polymer and oligosaccharide products.
AB  == two long-standing questions about glucansucrases (ec 2.4.1.5) are how they control oligosaccharide versus polysaccharide synthesis and how they direct their glycosidic linkage specificity. this information is required for the production of tailor-made saccharides. mutagenesis promises to be an effective tool for enzyme engineering approaches for altering the regioselectivity and acceptor substrate specificity. therefore, we chose the most conserved motif around the transition state stabilizer in glucansucrases for a random mutagenesis of the glucansucrase gtfr of streptococcus oralis, yielding different variants with altered reaction specificity. modifications at position s628 achieved by saturation mutagenesis guided the reaction toward the synthesis of short chain oligosaccharides with a drastically increased yield of isomaltose (47%) or leucrose (64%). alternatively, gtfr variant r624g/v630i/d717a exhibited a drastic switch in regioselectivity from a dextran type with mainly alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages to a mutan type polymer with predominantly alpha-1,3-glucosidic linkages. targeted modifications demonstrated that both mutations near the transition state stabilizer, r624g and v630i, are contributing to this alteration. it is thus shown that mutagenesis can guide the transglycosylation reaction of glucansucrase enzymes toward the synthesis of (a) various short chain oligosaccharides or (b) novel polymers with completely altered linkages, without  compromising their high transglycosylation activity and efficiency.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == a predatory mechanism dramatically increases the efficiency of lateral gene transfer in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == bacteria that are competent for natural genetic transformation, such as pneumococci and their commensal relatives streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis, take up exogenous dna and incorporate it into their genomes by homologous recombination. traditionally, it has been assumed that genetic material leaking from dead bacteria constitutes the sole source of external dna for competent streptococci. here we describe a mechanism for active acquisition of homologous dna that dramatically increases the efficiency of gene exchange between and within the streptococcal species mentioned above. this mechanism gives competent  streptococci access to a common gene pool that is significantly larger than their own genomes, a property representing a considerable advantage when these bacteria are subjected to external selection pressures, such as vaccination and treatment  with antibiotics.

TI  == assessment of the microbiota in root canals of human primary teeth by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to evaluate in vivo the prevalence of microorganisms in root canals of human primary teeth, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. methods: fifty-five root canals of primary teeth with irreversible pulpitis (group 1) and 51 root canals of teeth with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis (group 2) were selected. microbiological samples were collected and submitted to checkerboard dna-dna hybridization using 34 genomic dna probes. the  results were analyzed statistically by mann-whitney u-test at a 5% significance level. results: the most prevalent species in group 1 were: (1) campylobacter rectus (87%); (2) gemella morbilorum (78%); (3) streptococcus gordonii (71%); (4) capnocytophaga ochracea (69%); (5) treponema denticola (58%); and (6) streptococcus intermedius (49%). the most prevalent species in group 2 were: (1)  c. rectus (90%); (2) t. denticola (88%); (3) s. intermedius (77%); (4) g. morbilorum (73%); (5) streptococcus oralis (67%); (6) c. ochracea (63%); (7) s. gordonii (55%); (8) streptococcus mitis (51%); and (9) leptotrichia buccalis (51%). except for peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces israelii, the most prevalent bacterial strains in the root canals with apical periodontitis were also those found in larger numbers (p<.05). groups 1 and 2 differed significantly (p<.05) regarding the total number of bacterial cells detected in the root canal  samples, with group 2 showing remarkably larger bacterial cell numbers. conclusions: root canals of primary teeth have a great bacterial diversity, characterizing a polymicrobial endodontic infection with presence of: (1) anaerobic and facultative micro organisms; (2) black-pigmented rods; and (3) streptococci. a large number of anaerobic species were detected in teeth with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis, and a significantly smaller number of bacterial cells were found in teeth with irreversible pulpitis.

TI  == interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis with oral streptococci requires a motif that resembles the eukaryotic nuclear receptor box protein-protein interaction domain.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis initially colonizes the oral cavity by interacting with  organisms in supragingival plaque, such as the oralis group of oral streptococci. this interaction involves the association of the streptococcal antigen i/ii with  the minor fimbrial antigen (mfa1) of p. gingivalis. our previous studies showed that a peptide (bar) derived from antigen i/ii inhibits p. gingivalis adherence and subsequent biofilm formation on streptococcal substrates. in addition, screening a combinatorial peptide library identified select amino acid substitutions in the nitvk active region of bar that increased the adherence of p. gingivalis to streptococci. here we report that incorporating these residues in a synthetic peptide results in more-potent inhibition of p. gingivalis adherence and biofilm formation (i(50) [50% inhibition] at 0.52 microm versus i(50) at 1.25 microm for bar). in addition, a second structural motif in bar, comprised of the amino acids kkvqdllkk, was shown to contribute to p. gingivalis  adherence to streptococci. consistent with this, the kkvqdllkk and nitvk motifs are conserved only in antigen i/ii proteins expressed by the oralis group of streptococci, which interact with p. gingivalis. interestingly, the primary and secondary structures and the functional characteristics of the amphipathic vqdll  core alpha-helix resemble the consensus nuclear receptor (nr) box protein-protein interacting domain sequence (lxxll) of eukaryotes. bar peptides containing amino  acid substitutions with the potential to disrupt the secondary structure of vqdll were less-effective inhibitors of p. gingivalis adherence and biofilm formation,  suggesting that the alpha-helical character of vqdll is important. furthermore, replacing the lysines that flank vqdll with acidic amino acids also reduced inhibitory activity, suggesting that the association of vqdll with mfa1 may be stabilized by a charge clamp. these results indicate that the mfa1-interacting interface of streptococcal antigen i/ii encompasses both the kkvqdllkk and nitvk  motif and suggest that the adherence of p. gingivalis to streptococci is driven by a protein-protein interaction domain that resembles the eukaryotic nr box. thus, both motifs must be taken into account in designing potential peptidomimetics that target p. gingivalis adherence and biofilm formation.

TI  == adhesion of oral streptococci to all-ceramics dental restorative materials in vitro.
AB  == in recent years, patients have benefited from the development of better and more  esthetic materials, including all-ceramics dental restorative materials. dental plaque formation on teeth and restorative materials plays an important role in the pathogenesis of oral diseases. this study investigates initial adhesion of stationary phase streptococcal species to different all-ceramics dental restorative materials. the saliva-coated materials were incubated with the bacteria for 1 h in an in vitro flow chamber which mimics environmental conditions in the oral cavity. number and vitality of adhering bacteria were determined microscopically after staining. surface roughness and the composition  of the materials had no distinctive influence on bacterial adhesion. however, s.  mutans and s. sobrinus adhered about tenfold less numerous to all materials than  the other streptococcal species. further, there was a correlation between bacterial vitality and materials' glass content. the results showed that early plaque formation was influenced predominantly by the presence of the salivary pellicle rather than by material dependent parameters whereas the composition of  the all-ceramics appeared to have influenced the percentage of viable cells during the adhesion process. this presented in vitro technique may provide a useful model to study the influence of different parameters on adherence of oral  streptococcal species.

TI  == mutations in the tacf gene of clinical strains and laboratory transformants of streptococcus pneumoniae: impact on choline auxotrophy and growth rate.
AB  == the nutritional requirement that streptococcus pneumoniae has for the aminoalcohol choline as a component of teichoic and lipoteichoic acids appears to be exclusive to this prokaryote. a mutation in the tacf gene, which putatively encodes an integral membrane protein (possibly, a teichoic acid repeat unit transporter), has been recently identified as responsible for generating a choline-independent phenotype of s. pneumoniae (m. damjanovic, a. s. kharat, a. eberhardt, a. tomasz, and w. vollmer, j. bacteriol. 189:7105-7111, 2007). we now  report that streptococcus mitis can grow in choline-free medium, as previously illustrated for streptococcus oralis. while we confirmed the finding by damjanovic et al. of the involvement of tacf in the choline dependence of the pneumococcus, the genetic transformation of s. pneumoniae r6 by using s. mitis sk598 dna and several pcr-amplified tacf fragments suggested that a minimum of two mutations were required to confer improved fitness to choline-independent s.  pneumoniae mutants. this conclusion is supported by sequencing results also reported here that indicate that a spontaneous mutant of s. pneumoniae (strain jy2190) able to proliferate in the absence of choline (or analogs) is also a double mutant for the tacf gene. microscopic observations and competition experiments during the cocultivation of choline-independent strains confirmed that a minimum of two amino acid changes were required to confer improved fitness to choline-independent pneumococcal strains when growing in medium lacking any aminoalcohol. our results suggest complex relationships among the different regions of the tacf teichoic acid repeat unit transporter.

TI  == role of sucrose in the fitness of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == introduction: dental caries has been closely linked to fermentable carbohydrates  as key environmental factors. sucrose has been identified as the most cariogenic  carbohydrate. streptococcus mutans, considered to be the primary pathogen causing dental caries, is able to utilize sucrose as a nutrient source, partially for the production of intracellular storage components and for the production of extracellular glucans via the glucosyltransferases gtfb, gtfc, and gtfd. the following study explores the competitiveness and fitness of s. mutans when grown  with different concentrations of sucrose. methods: growth competition with oral streptococci and antimicrobial susceptibility in static biofilm models grown without sucrose or with 0.1% or 0.5% sucrose were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy. the numbers of surviving s. mutans of both wild-type and an isogenic gtf-negative mutant after antimicrobial treatment were determined as colony-forming units. results: s. mutans was able to establish microcolonies with increasing sucrose concentration in the presence of other streptococcal competitors during biofilm development. the antimicrobial susceptibility decreased when sucrose was available as substrate and was dependent on the presence of the gtfs. conclusion: the increased resistance against antimicrobial  treatment was associated with the availability of sucrose, but was not influenced much by the concentration used during this study. the resistance was strongly associated with the gtf activity, excluding any intracellular metabolic effect of sucrose in the resistance mechanism.

TI  == salivary gel-forming mucin muc5b--a nutrient for dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == introduction: model systems with oral bacteria from dental plaque have demonstrated that the utilization of complex glycoproteins as a food source cannot be undertaken by single species but requires concerted degradation by a multi-species consortium, with each member contributing one or a few hydrolytic enzymes. unlike previous studies, the aim of the present investigation was to explore the ability of fresh dental plaque to degrade salivary mucin, muc5b, isolated by methods designed to retain intact the natural polymeric structure and physiological conformation, in an attempt to mimic the naturally occurring interaction between the oral microbiota and salivary mucins. methods: human salivary muc5b was isolated from whole saliva by density-gradient centrifugation  and incubated with freshly isolated supragingival dental plaque with samples subjected to fluorescent staining for viability and metabolic activity. in addition, the degradation of muc5b oligosaccharide side chains was studied using  a lectin assay, recognizing three different carbohydrate epitopes commonly found  on mucin oligosaccharide side chains. results: the addition of purified salivary  muc5b elicited a strong metabolic response from the biofilm cells, whereas individual strains of streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii isolated from the same plaque were not able to utilize the muc5b. the degradation of terminal saccharide moieties on the muc5b was demonstrated by a marked decrease in both sialic acid and fucose reactivity. conclusion: these results have shown that dental plaque is capable of utilizing human salivary muc5b as a nutrient source, a process possibly requiring the synergistic degradation of the molecule  by a consortium of oral bacteria in the plaque community.

TI  == molecular and antigenic characterization of a streptococcus oralis coaggregation  receptor polysaccharide by carbohydrate engineering in streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == the coaggregation receptor polysaccharides (rps) of streptococcus oralis and related species are recognized by lectin-like adhesins on other members of the oral biofilm community and by rps-specific antibodies. the former interactions involve beta-galnac or beta-gal containing host-like motifs in the oligosaccharide repeating units of these polysaccharides, whereas the latter involves features of these molecules that are immunogenic. in the present investigation, the molecular and corresponding structural basis for the serotype  specificity of s. oralis atcc 10557 rps was determined by engineering the production of this polysaccharide in transformable streptococcus gordonii 38. this involved the systematic replacement of genes in the rps cluster of strain 38 with different but related genes from s. oralis 10557 and structural characterization of the resulting polysaccharides. the results identify four unique genes in the rps cluster of strain 10557. these include wefi for an alpha-gal transferase, wefj for a galnac-1-phosphotransferase that has a unique acceptor specificity, wefk for an acetyl transferase that acts at two positions in the hexasaccharide repeating unit, and a novel wzy associated with the beta1-3 linkage between these units. the serotype specificity of engineered polysaccharides correlated with the wefi-dependent presence of alpha-gal in these molecules rather than with partial o-acetylation or with the linkage between repeating units. the findings illustrate a direct approach for defining the molecular basis of polysaccharide structure and antigenicity.

AB  == objective: to assess the value of aspergillus galactomannan (gm) double-direct sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) in the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (ipa). methods: ninety adult sd rats were randomly divided into 5 groups, including 4 groups of pulmonary infection by aspergillus fumigatus (a. fumigatus), candida albicans, mucor, and streptococcus pneumoniae,  respectively, and a colonization group by a. fumigatus in the pharynx oralis (n = 18 each). for the infection models, suspensions of pathogenic bacteria and fungi  were instilled into the lungs of the rats by tracheal intubation. for the colonization model, the suspension of a. fumigatus was applied to the nasal cavity and pharynx oralis of the rats. the animals were sacrificed on days 3, 7,  and 12 after inoculation, and blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture and used for gm detection. the lung tissues were prepared for routine pathology examination, and hexamethylene tetramine silver staining was used to detect the fungi. a double-direct sandwich elisa was employed to detect gm optical density index in the serum samples. results: the lung tissues of rats infected with a. fumigatus, candida albicans, mucor and streptococcus pneumoniae all showed remarkable inflammatory reactions, and hyphae were observed in rats with fungal infection (including a. fumigatus and mucor), and spores in rats infected with candida albicans. the lung tissues of the a. fumigatus colonization rats showed no inflammatory reactions. the serum gm optical density index of the groups infected with a. fumigatus, candida albicans, mucor and streptococcus pneumoniae, and the a. fumigatus colonization group were 1.69 +/- 0.29, 0.89 +/- 0.46, 0.87 +/- 0.39, 0.77 +/- 0.34 and 0.90 +/- 0.49, respectively. the serum gm optical density index of the ipa group was higher than those of the other 4 groups (p < 0.05). if the cutoff odi was 1.5, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv) and negative predictive value (npv) for diagnosis of ipa in the rats were 78.6%, 87.5%, 57.9% and 94.9%, respectively. the sensitivity for a. fumigatus infection on days 3, 7, and 12 was 60.0%, 80% and 100%, and the specificity was 95.5%, 81.0% and 85.7%, respectively. conclusion: gm detection could distinguish aspergillus infection from candida albicans, mucor, streptococcus pneumoniae infection and aspergillus colonization. the sensitivity  of the test for the diagnosis of ipa tended to be higher with longer duration of  infection. a cutoff odi of 1.5 showed the best sensitivity and specificity for ipa in this rat model.

AB  == objectives: viridans group streptococci (vgs) cause severe diseases such as infective endocarditis and septicaemia. genetically, vgs species are very close to each other and it is difficult to identify them to species level with conventional methods. the aims of the present study were to use sequence analysis of the rnase p rna gene (rnpb) to identify vgs species in clinical blood culture  isolates, and to compare the results with the api 20 strep system that is based on phenotypical characteristics. methods: strains from patients with septicaemia  or endocarditis were analysed with pcr amplification and sequence analysis of the rnpb gene. clinical data were registered as well. results: one hundred and thirty two vgs clinical blood culture isolates from patients with septicaemia (n=95) or  infective endocarditis (n=36) were analysed; all but one were identified by rnpb. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii strains  were most common in the patients with infective endocarditis. in the isolates from patients with haematological diseases, streptococcus mitis and s. oralis dominated. in addition in 76 of the isolates it was possible to compare the results from rnpb analysis and the api 20 strep system. in 39/76 (51%) of the isolates the results were concordant to species level; in 55 isolates there were  no results from api 20 strep. conclusion: sequence analysis of the rnase p rna gene (rnpb) showed that almost all isolates could be identified. this could be of importance for evaluation of the portal of entry in patients with septicaemia or  infective endocarditis.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds manufactured as bone replacement materials.
AB  == rapid prototyping (rp)-produced scaffolds are gaining increasing importance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. microbial adhesion on the surface of replacement materials has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome. consequently, it is important to examine the adherence of microorganisms on rp-produced scaffolds. this research focussed on manufacturing of scaffolds by 3d-bioplotting and examination of their microbial adhesion characteristics. tricalciumphosphate (tcp), calcium/sodium alginate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolic  acid) (plga) constructs were produced and used to study the adhesion of dental pathogens. six oral bacterial strains, one candida strain and human saliva were used for the adhesion studies. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were determined and scanning electron microscopy (sem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) were performed. microorganisms adhered to all scaffolds. all strains, except for streptococcus oralis, adhered best to plga scaffolds. streptococcus oralis adhered to each of the biomaterials equally. streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis adhered best to plga scaffolds, followed by alginate and tcp. prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus  sanguis, and candida albicans showed the highest adherence to plga, followed by tcp and alginate. in contrast, the microorganisms of saliva adhered significantly better to tcp, followed by plga and alginate. sem observations correlated with the results of the cfu determinations. clsm detected bacteria within deeper sheets of alginate. in conclusion, because of the high adherence rate of oral pathogens to the scaffolds, the application of these biomaterials for bone replacement in oral surgery could result in biomaterial-related infections. strategies to decrease microbial adherence and to prevent infections due to oral  pathogens are discussed.

TI  == direct visualization of spatial and temporal patterns of antimicrobial action within model oral biofilms.
AB  == a microscopic method for noninvasively visualizing the action of an antimicrobial agent inside a biofilm was developed and applied to describe spatial and temporal patterns of mouthrinse activity on model oral biofilms. three species biofilms of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, and actinomyces naeslundii were grown in glass capillary flow cells. bacterial cells were stained with the fluorogenic esterase substrate calcien am (cam). loss of green fluorescence upon  exposure to an antimicrobial formulation was subsequently imaged by time-lapse confocal laser scanning microscopy. when an antimicrobial mouthrinse containing chlorhexidine digluconate was administered, a gradual loss of green fluorescence  was observed that began at the periphery of cell clusters where they adjoined the flowing bulk fluid and progressed inward over a time period of several minutes. image analysis was performed to quantify a penetration velocity of 4 mum/min. an  enzyme-based antimicrobial formulation led to a gradual, continually slowing loss of fluorescence in a pattern that was qualitatively different from the behavior observed with chlorhexidine. ethanol at 11.6% had little effect on the biofilm. none of these treatments resulted in the removal of biomass from the biofilm. most methods to measure or visualize antimicrobial action in biofilms are destructive. spatial information is important because biofilms are known for their structural and physiological heterogeneity. the cam staining technique has  the potential to provide information about the rate of antimicrobial penetration, the presence of tolerant subpopulations, and the extent of biomass removal effected by a treatment.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microbial flora in specific oral sites in 13 dentate subjects, 6-8 months after completed radiation therapy (rt group) and in 13 matched controls. material and methods: the microflora on the tongue, buccal mucosa, vestibulum, supragingival plaque and subgingival region was analysed using duplicate sampling and cultivation technique. a clinical examination was also performed. results: candida albicans was found in one or more sites in 54% of the rt subjects and in 15% of the controls. in three rt subjects, c. albicans  was found at all four sites analysed. an unexpected finding was that enterococci  were found in all rt subjects and in high number in 38%. none of the controls harboured enterococci. in supragingival plaque, lactobacillus spp. were detected  in 92% of the rt subjects and the number and proportion of lactobacillus spp. were extremely high compared with the controls. mutans streptococci were detected in high numbers in 31% of the rt subjects, while they were not detected in 23%. conclusion: the microbial results explain why some rt subjects have an increased  susceptibility to oral diseases and stress that site-specific microbial analysis  is an important diagnostic tool when planning oral health preventive care for rt  subjects.

TI  == heritability of oral microbial species in caries-active and caries-free twins.
AB  == oral microbes that colonize in the mouths of humans contribute to disease susceptibility, but it is unclear if host genetic factors mediate colonization. we therefore tested the hypothesis that the levels at which oral microbes colonize in the mouth are heritable. dental plaque biofilms were sampled from intact tooth surfaces of 118 caries-free twins. an additional 86 caries-active twins were sampled for plaque from carious lesions and intact tooth surfaces. using a reverse capture checkerboard assay the relative abundance of 82 bacterial species was determined. an integrative computational predictive model determined  microbial abundance patterns of microbial species in caries-free twins as compared to caries-active twins. heritability estimates were calculated for the relative microbial abundance levels of the microbial species in both groups. the  levels of 10 species were significantly different in healthy individuals than in  caries-active individuals, including, a. defectiva, s. parasanguinis, s. mitis/oralis, s. sanguinis, s. cristatus, s. salivarius, streptococcus sp. clone  ch016, g. morbillorum and g. haemolysans. moderate to high heritability estimates were found for these species (h(2) = 56%-80%, p < .0001). similarity of the overall oral microbial flora was also evident in caries-free twins from multivariate distance matrix regression analysis. it appears that genetic and/or  familial factors significantly contribute to the colonization of oral beneficial  species in twins.

TI  == [phenotypes and genetic mechanisms of resistance to macrolides and lincosamides in viridans group streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are part of the oropharyngeal, intestinal and genital flora, but they may cause endocarditis and bacteremia in susceptible patients. penicillin- and macrolide-resistant strains are increasing every year.  the aim of this study was to investigate genetic mechanisms of resistance to macrolides in clinically relevant isolates. we identified 85 isolates from january 2004 to june 2006. susceptibility to penicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin, clindamycin and gentamycin was determined. a resistance phenotype was assigned according to the disk approximation test (erythromycin-clindamycin). the mechanism of resistance was determined by pcr for the following genes: ermb,  erma, ermc, erma (tr) and mefa/e. we identified 51 isolates belonging to streptococcus anginosus species, most of which were obtained from abdominal abscesses, and 34 isolates belonging to other species, most of which were obtained from blood cultures. the macrolide resistance rate was 28.2% (24/85). the mls(b) phenotype was observed in 66.7% of the isolates, primarily in the s. anginosus group. the m phenotype was predominant in s. mitis and s. oralis. isolates that expressed the constitutive mls(b) phenotype carried the ermb gene,  and those that expressed the inducible mlsb phenotype carried the erma gene. isolates that expressed the m phenotype carried the mefa/e gene. there was coresistance with penicillin in 20.8% (5/24) of the isolates. coresistance with penicillin was low. these results suggest that screening for macrolide resistance in vgs would be desirable because of the potential transmission of resistance genes to other pathogenic streptococci.

TI  == lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc 179 displays probiotic potential in vitro and protects against trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs)-induced colitis and salmonella infection in murine models.
AB  == lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc 179, lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc 287 and streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 were studied for their probiotic potential.  firstly, strains were screened for antimicrobial activity towards a broad range of target strains, including lactic acid bacteria, food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. l. fermentum aca-dc 179 was active against five streptococci, including the two pathogenic strains streptococcus oralis lmg 14532t and streptococcus pneumoniae lmg 14545t. s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 was active against the majority  of the strains tested, including not only lactic acid bacteria but also many food spoilage or pathogenic species. the three potential probiotic strains were found  to survive variably at ph 2.5 and were unaffected by bile salts. only s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 exhibited bile salt hydrolase activity, while none of the  strains was haemolytic. moreover, strains exhibited variable susceptibility towards commonly used antibiotics. l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 induced the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-12, ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. also elevated levels of the anti-inflammatory il-10 were observed with l. fermentum aca-dc 179. this strain consequently was found to significantly reduce colitis in a tnbs-induced colitis mouse model. furthermore, l. fermentum aca-dc 179 was successfully applied in an experimental salmonella-infection mouse model. to conclude, strain l. fermentum aca-dc 179 possesses desirable probiotic properties, such as antimicrobial activity and immunomodulation in vitro, which were confirmed in vivo by the use of animal models.

TI  == effects of amine fluoride on biofilm growth and salivary pellicles.
AB  == the amine fluoride (amf) n'-octadecyl-trimethylene-diamine-n,n,n'-tris(2-ethanol)-dihydro-fluoride is a cationic antimicrobial which can have beneficial effects on plaque formation. here, we determine changes in pellicle and bacterial cell surface properties of the strains actinomyces naeslundii hm1, streptococcus mutans ns, s.mutans atcc 700610, s. sobrinus hg1025 and s. oralis hm1 upon adsorption of this amf and accompanying effects on bacterial adhesion and biofilm growth. in vitro pellicles had a zeta potential of -12 mv that became less negative upon adsorption of amf.  the chemical functionalities in which carbon and oxygen were involved changed after amf adsorption and amf-treated pellicles had a greater surface roughness than untreated pellicles. water contact angles in vitro decreased from 56 to 45 degrees upon amf treatment, which corresponded with water contact angles (44 degrees ) measured intraorally on the front incisors of volunteers immediately after using an amf-containing toothpaste. all bacterial strains were negatively charged and their isoelectric points (iep) increased upon amf adsorption. minimal inhibitory concentrations were smallest for strains exhibiting the largest increase in iep. adhesion to salivary pellicles and biofilm growth of the mutans  streptococcal strains were significantly reduced after amf treatment, but not of  a. naeslundii or s. oralis. however, regardless of the strain involved, biofilm viability decreased significantly after amf treatment. the electrostatic interaction between cationic amf and negatively charged bacterial cell surfaces is pivotal in establishing reduced biofilm formation by amf through a combination of effects on initial adhesion and killing. the major effect of amf treatment, however, was a reduction brought about in biofilm viability.

AB  == culture-independent, biomarker-targeted bacterial enumeration and identification  strategies were employed to estimate total bacterial burden and diversity within  the cabin air of commercial airliners. samples from each of 4 flights on 2 commercial carriers were collected via air-impingement. the total viable microbial population ranged from below detection limits to 4.1 x 10(6) cells/m(3) of air, as assessed by the atp assay. a gradual accumulation of microbes was observed from the time of passenger boarding through mid-flight, followed by a sharp decline in bacterial abundance and viability from the initiation of descent through landing. representatives of the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-proteobacteria,  as well as gram-positive bacteria, were isolated in varying abundance. neisseria  meningitidis rrna gene sequences were retrieved in great abundance from airline a followed by streptococcus oralis/mitis sequences. pseudomonas synxantha sequences dominated airline b clone libraries, followed by those of n. meningitidis and s.  oralis/mitis. the cabin air samples examined herein housed low bacterial diversity and were often dominated by a particular subset of bacteria: opportunistic pathogenic inhabitants of the human respiratory tract and oral cavity.

AB  == the pathogenesis of osler's nodes and janeway lesions remains a mystery despite vigorous debate over the last 113 years. they are given great emphasis among the  clinical signs of bacterial endocarditis but are seldom seen in practice. two cases of subacute bacterial endocarditis are presented. a 66-year-old woman with  bartonella henselae endocarditis developed osler's nodes on the hands postoperatively, and a 23-year-old man with streptococcus oralis endocarditis developed tender macules with an appearance suggestive of janeway lesions on one  heel. the dermatopathology was similar in the two cases, consisting of a leukocytoclastic vasculitis without micro-abscess formation or visible organisms. although the appearance is usually consistent, it is not always possible to distinguish osler's nodes from janeway lesions based purely on clinical presentation. furthermore, the histology of both clinical signs can look similar. further reports are needed before more firm conclusions can be drawn, however, it may be that the histological appearance of osler's nodes and janeway lesions is primarily determined by the nature of the causative organism, while the clinical  appearance may be determined by anatomical site.

AB  == objective: to determine which cell fraction(s) of streptococcus mitis biovar 1 serve as the best source of antigens recognized by salivary siga antibodies in infants. design: whole cells of 38 reference and wild-type isolates of s. mitis,  streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, enterococcus casseliflavus, and enterococcus faecalis were fractionated into cell walls (cw), protease-treated cell walls (ptcw), cell membranes (cm) and cell protein (cp). whole cells and these fractions were tested for binding by rabbit anti-s. mitis sk145 and anti-s. oralis sk100 sera, and also by salivary siga antibodies from infants and adults.  results: anti-sk145 and anti-sk100 sera bound whole cells and fractions of all strains of s. mitis and s. oralis variably. cluster analysis of antibody binding  data placed the strains into s. mitis, s. oralis and 'non-s. mitis/non-s. oralis' clusters. antigens from cw and cm best discriminated s. mitis from s. oralis. cm  bound the most infant salivary siga antibody and ptcw bound the least. in contrast, adult salivary siga antibody bound all of the cell fractions and at higher levels. conclusions: presumably the relatively short period of immune stimulation and immunological immaturity in infants, in contrast to adults, result in low levels of salivary siga antibody that preferentially bind cm of s.  mitis but not ptcw. by utilizing isolated cell walls and membranes as sources of  antigens for proteomics it may be possible to identify antigens common to oral streptococci and dissect the fine specificity of salivary siga antibodies induced by oral colonization by s. mitis.

TI  == genetic relatedness of the streptococcus pneumoniae capsular biosynthetic loci.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) produces 1 of 91 capsular polysaccharides (cps) that define the serotype. the cps loci of 88 pneumococcal serotypes whose cps is synthesized by the wzy-dependent pathway were compared with each other and with additional streptococcal polysaccharide biosynthetic loci and were clustered according to the proportion of shared homology groups (hgs), weighted for the sequence similarities between the genes encoding the shared hgs. the cps loci of the 88 pneumococcal serotypes were distributed into eight major clusters and 21 subclusters. all serotypes within the same serogroup  fell into the same major cluster, but in six cases, serotypes within the same serogroup were in different subclusters and, conversely, nine subclusters included completely different serotypes. the closely related cps loci within a subcluster were compared to the known cps structures to relate gene content to structure. the streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis polysaccharide biosynthetic loci clustered within the pneumococcal cps loci and were in a subcluster that also included the cps locus of pneumococcal serotype 21, whereas  the streptococcus agalactiae cps loci formed a single cluster that was not closely related to any of the pneumococcal cps clusters.

TI  == identification of structural determinants for substrate binding and turnover by glucosyltransferase r supports the permutation hypothesis.
AB  == segments that may crucially influence the catalytic behaviour of glucosyltransferases of the glucansucrase type were selected for modification. this was done by sequence alignments, followed by structural modelling of the putative catalytic domain, based on a permuted form of the glucosyltransferase r  (gtfr) of streptococcus oralis. five selected regions, located in the c-terminal  half of the potential catalytic domain, were replaced by segments found at equivalent positions in other glucosyltransferases. the exchanges of four of these regions significantly affected catalysis by gtfr. this identified c-terminal determinants for substrate binding and turnover and supports the so-called permutation hypothesis with respect to enzymes of the glucansucrase type. based on the model, roles are proposed for specific residues. major effects appear to involve a re-positioning of the c-terminal tyr965 that very likely serves as a hydrophobic platform for the substrate.

[4]]. the concentration of the cwps antibodies in non-immunized individuals often exceeds the concentration of the serotype-specific pneumococcal antibodies. therefore, the pneumococcal elisa requires an adsorption step to remove the unprotective cwps antibodies [konradsen hb, sorensen ub, henrichsen j. a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for measuring type-specific anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antibodies. j immunol meth 1993;164(1):13-20.

[8]]. recently a new pneumococcal cps elisa was recommended with an extra serum absorption step with 22f cps to remove antibodies against an extra unknown common cross-reactive component. the aim of this study was to characterize the active component in the  22f capsule. a non-capsulated pneumococci was prepared from a 22f capsulated pneumococci. the cell wall polysaccharide (cwps2) purified from this pneumococci  has a better adsorption potential than 22f capsule in the pneumococci elisa. structure characterization of the commercial available cwps and cwps2 was done by nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr). the nmr results showed that commercial cwps had one phosporylcholine per sugar repeat while the cwps2 had two phosporylcholine per sugar repeat explaining an immunological difference between the two variants  of cwps. in addition the licd2 gene responsible for the attachment of the second  cholin in the cwps tetra sugar repeat was inactive in the strain used for purifying the commercial cwps but active in the strain expressing cwps2.

AB  == in the present study, we evaluated the ability of lectin from talisia esculenta (tel) and a protein from labramia bojeri seeds (labramin) to inhibit adherence of microorganisms and exert antimicrobial effects. the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of these proteins were determined using 5 species of  bacteria: streptococcus mutans ua159, streptococcus sobrinus 6715, streptococcus  sanguinis atcc10556, streptococcus mitis atcc903 and streptococcus oralis pb182.  in addition, an adherence assay was performed using these 5 bacterial species and sterile polystyrene microtiter plates coated with human saliva. filtered protein  solutions (6.25 to 100 mug/ml) were added to saliva-coated plates, and the plates were then incubated for 1 h at 37 degrees c. after incubation, the plates were washed, and a bacterial suspension (10(6 )cfu/ml) was then transferred to each plate, followed by incubation at 37 degrees c for 1 h (10% co(2)). adherence of bacteria to the acquired pellicle was visualized by staining with crystal violet, and absorbance was measured using a plate reader at 575 nm. neither labramin nor  tel, at any of the concentrations used, inhibited growth of any of the microorganisms. however, labramin inhibited adherence of s. mutans and s. sobrinus. the present results indicate that labramin is potentially useful as a biofilm-inhibiting drug.

TI  == a novel tem contrasting technique for extracellular polysaccharides in in vitro biofilms.
AB  == in the past, the visualization of the extracellular matrix of biofilms on an ultrastructural level was hampered by shrinkage artifacts. in addition, the reproducible contrasting of extracellular polysaccharides (eps) has not satisfactorily been solved. here we describe a method overcoming these difficulties, which produces artifact-free transmission electron microscopic (tem) images using multispecies biofilms grown in vitro. sufficient contrast was  achieved by replacing schiff's reagent with the osmiophilic amino acid methionine. in addition, shrinkage was avoided by replacing the classical dehydration agents with ethylene glycol and 1,2-pentanediol. applying this method provided images of biofilms with an intact matrix in which differentially contrasted bacteria were embedded. all six members of the biofilm consortium (streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus oralis, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium  nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, and candida albicans) could be distinguished.  within the matrix, structural differences of eps, probably due to different proportions of alpha-1,3 and alpha-1,6 linkages, were apparent. fibrilar polysaccharides were evident around microcolonies of s. sobrinus, and fluffy polysaccharides were detected in the vicinity of s. oralis microcolonies. the ultrastructure of biofilms prepared for tem using this method allows the imaging  of undistorted eps as well as the differentiated contrasting of the six microbial species of the in vitro biofilm model. this is a major step forward in determining the spatial arrangement of microorganisms in biofilms on an ultrastructural level.

TI  == fluoroquinolone resistance in atypical pneumococci and oral streptococci: evidence of horizontal gene transfer of fluoroquinolone resistance determinants from streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == atypical strains, presumed to be pneumococcus, with ciprofloxacin mics of > or =4.0 microg/ml and unique sequence variations within the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of the gyrase and topoisomerase genes in comparison with the streptococcus pneumoniae r6 strain, were examined. these strains were reidentified using phenotypic methods, including detection of optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, and agglutination by serotype-specific  antisera, and genotypic methods, including detection of pneumolysin and autolysin genes by pcr, 16s rrna sequencing, and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). the analysis based on concatenated sequences of the six mlst loci distinguished the "atypical" strains from pneumococci, and these strains clustered closely with s.  mitis. however, all these strains and five of nine strains from the viridans streptococcal group possessed one to three gyra, gyrb, parc, and pare genes whose qrdr sequences clustered with those of s. pneumoniae, providing evidence of horizontal transfer of the qrdrs of the gyrase and topoisomerase genes from pneumococci into viridans streptococci. these genes also conferred fluoroquinolone resistance to viridans streptococci. in addition, the fluoroquinolone resistance determinants of 32 well-characterized streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis strains from bacteremic patients were also compared. these strains have unique amino acid substitutions in gyra and parc that were distinguishable from those in fluoroquinolone-resistant pneumococci and the "atypical" isolates. both recombinational events and de novo mutations play an important role in the development of fluoroquinolone resistance.

TI  == odontogenic bacteria in periodontal disease and resistance patterns to common antibiotics used as treatment and prophylaxis in odontology in spain.
AB  == resistance in streptococci or gram-negative bacteria is associated with antibiotic consumption. scarce information exists on the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with periodontitis in countries with high antibiotic consumption, as this is an area in which microbiological testing is not performed in daily practice. the present study was undertaken to explore the susceptibility of bacterial isolates in periodontitis to antibiotics prescribed in odontology in spain as treatment for local infections or prophylaxis for distant focal infections. periodontal samples were  prospectively collected in 48 patients classified by pocket depth of <4 mm and >or=4 mm. species were identified by culture, selecting the five most frequent morphotypes per sample, and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). susceptibility was determined by e-test. a total of 261 isolates were identified: 72.9% patients had streptococcus oralis; 70.8% streptococcus mitis; 60.4% prevotella buccae; 39.6% prevotella denticola; 37.5% fusobacterium nucleatum; 35.4% prevotella intermedia; 25% capnocytophaga spp.; 23% veillonella spp.; 22.9% prevotella melaninogenica and streptococcus sanguis; and <20% other species. streptococcus viridans resistance rates were 0% for amoxicillin, approximately 10% for clindamycin, 9-22% for tetracycline, and for azithromycin ranged from 18.2% for s. sanguis to  47.7% for s. mitis. prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, with amoxicillin resistance ranging from 17.1% in p. buccae to 26.3% in p. denticola. metronidazole resistance was <6% in all prevotella species, while clindamycin resistance ranged from 0 to 21.1%. beta-lactamase production was positive in 54.1% prevotella spp., 38.9% f. nucleatum, 30% capnocytophaga spp., and 10% veillonella spp. in this study, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the most active antibiotic against all species tested, followed by metronidazole in the case of anaerobes.

TI  == involvement of minor components associated with the fima fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis in adhesive functions.
AB  == the fima fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis, the causative agent of periodontitis, have been implicated in various aspects of pathogenicity, such as  colonization, adhesion and aggregation. in this study, the four open reading frames (orf1, orf2, orf3 and orf4) downstream of the fimbrilin gene (fima) in strain atcc 33277 were examined. orf2, orf3 and orf4 were demonstrated to encode  minor components of the fimbriae and were therefore renamed fimc, fimd and fime,  respectively. immunoblotting analyses revealed that inactivation of either fimc or fimd by an ermf-ermam insertion, but not inactivation of orf1, was accompanied by concomitant loss of the products from the downstream genes, raising the possibility that fimc, fimd and fime constitute a transcription unit. the fime mutant produced fimc and fimd, but fimbriae purified from it contained neither protein, suggesting that fime is required for the assembly of fimc and fimd onto  the fimbrilin (fima) fibre. the fimc, fimd and fime mutants lost autoaggregation  abilities. fimbriae purified from these three mutants showed attenuated binding activities to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of streptococcus oralis and to two extracellular matrix proteins, fibronectin and type i collagen. these  results suggest that fime, as well as fimc and fimd, play critical roles in the adhesive activities of the mature fima fimbriae in p. gingivalis.

TI  == identification of periodontopathic bacteria in gingival tissue of japanese periodontitis patients.
AB  == introduction: the identification of invading periodontopathic bacteria in tissues is important to determine their role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.  the objective of this study was to identify periodontopathic bacteria in diseased gingival tissue of periodontitis patients. methods: subgingival plaque and gingival tissue were collected from 32 generalized chronic periodontitis (cp), 16 generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) and eight localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) patients. detection frequencies and quantities of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and tannerella forsythensis were investigated by polymerase chain reaction. the prevalences of streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sobrinus were also examined and the distribution of a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes was observed. results: p. gingivalis and t. forsythensis were detected in approximately 70% of tissue samples and 50% of plaque samples in the three periodontitis groups. prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in tissue samples was higher in the lagp (63%) group  than in either the cp (16%) or the gagp (38%) group. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype c was detected in 50% of lagp patients. detection frequencies of s. oralis and s. sobrinus were markedly low in both plaque and tissue samples from all three periodontitis groups. amounts of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythensis in the tissue samples were not different among the three periodontitis groups. conclusion: p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythensis can localize in diseased gingival tissue and may be involved in periodontal tissue destruction. serotype c is the predominant serotype of a. actinomycetemcomitans in japanese lagp patients.

TI  == the microbiological profiles of saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque and  dental caries in adults with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.
AB  == introduction: the relationships between suspected bacteria in saliva, yeasts in oral rinse, and supragingival and subgingival plaque versus root surface and coronal caries in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a non-diabetic group were explored. methods: one-hundred and five patients with type 2 diabetes and 103 non-diabetic subjects were recruited; their periodontal status, plaque index  and magnitude of root surface and coronal caries were assessed. saliva and an oral rinse were cultured for mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts. toothbrush samples of supragingival plaque and curette samples of subgingival plaque were assessed for 17 bacterial species using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: type 2 diabetes patients had significantly more severe periodontitis, a higher plaque index and a higher prevalence and magnitude of root surface caries than non-diabetic subjects. significantly more diabetic subjects had higher levels of treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus intermedius in their supragingival plaque than non-diabetic subjects. no significant difference  was found for the organisms in saliva, oral rinse and subgingival plaque between  the two groups. after adjustment for diabetic status, root surface caries was associated with an increased count of mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts in saliva and of streptococcus mutans in supragingival plaque samples. coronal caries was only associated with lactobacilli and yeasts in saliva. conclusion: the number of cariogenic organisms in saliva and oral rinse estimated by culture demonstrated a stronger association with both root surface and coronal caries compared to those 17 species assessed with the checkerboard method in supragingival and subgingival plaque.

TI  == discrepancy in antimicrobial susceptibility test results obtained for oral streptococci with the etest and agar dilution.
AB  == a total of 270 viridans group streptococci (vs) isolated from healthy children, identified to the species level, were tested for their susceptibilities to penicillin, imipenem, erythromycin, and vancomycin. a total of 270 isolates and 1,080 organism-antibiotic combinations were evaluated. the overall susceptibility rates of all isolates obtained by the etest (et) versus agar dilution (ad) were 60.4% versus 61.8% for penicillin, 63.8% versus 63.9% for erythromycin, 90.6% versus 96% for vancomycin, and 99.1% versus 96.0% for imipenem, respectively. major discrepancies occurred in the testing of the susceptibility of streptococcus mutans to vancomycin, with 59.5% (et) versus 100% (ad), followed by s. salivarius, with 84.1% versus 100%; s. oralis, with 82.1% versus 96.4%; and s. mitis, with 90% versus 100%, respectively. there were also differences in the rates of susceptibility of s. mutans, 66.5% (et) versus 85.1% (ad), and s. intermedius, 82.9% versus 72.1%, respectively, to penicillin. general agreement between the results of et and ad was obtained for 973 organism-antibiotic combinations out of 1,080 antibiotic combinations, i.e., 90.1%. very major errors were found for 6.8% of isolates, and major errors were found for 3.2% of isolates; the minor errors were negligible. agreement between the results of the  two methods was 98.7% for penicillin, 94.6% for vancomycin, 96.9% for imipenem, and 99.9% for erythromycin. the highest rate of very major errors was for vancomycin, at 5.4%. the et appears to be as efficient as ad for susceptibility testing of vs, except for vancomycin, where very major errors in the results were relatively high.

TI  == microorganisms in root carious lesions in adults.
AB  == purpose: root caries is emerging as a significant problem in the middle aged and  elderly subjects because of the improving general health conditions, and medical  and technological advances. the purpose of this investigation was to assess the prevalence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as yeasts of candida genus in root carious lesions in middle-aged and older adults. material and methods: specimens of root carious lesions were collected from 78 adults for bacteriological and mycological studies. standard procedures of culture, isolation, and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and fungi were used in the study. results: the analysis of results was performed independently in two age groups of adults, i.e. 52 subjects aged 35-44 years (middle age) and 26-aged 55-72 years (older age). there were 120 bacterial strains isolated from root carious lesions in middle-aged subjects, 63 (52.5%) strains belonged to 5 genera of aerobic bacteria and 57 (47.5%)--to 7 genera of anaerobic bacteria (p > 0.05). while in the second group, 85 strains were isolated, 54 (63.5%)--6 genera  of aerobic bacteria and 31 (36.5%)--4 genera of anaerobic bacteria (p = 0.0004).  there were no differences between the isolation rate of a various species in both examined groups, except for streptococcus spp., s. oralis, micrococcus spp., neisseria spp. and veillonella spp., which statistically significantly most frequent occurred in elderly (p < 0.05). the yeasts of candida genus of 4 species (c. albicans, c. lusitaniae, c. pelliculosa, and c. pulcherrima) were isolated from middle-aged subjects (32.7%) with the comparable rate to older adults (30.8%; only c. albicans) (p > 0.05). among all isolated microorganisms, candida  spp., were comprised about 10% in both examined groups (p > 0.05). conclusions: aerobic gram-positive cocci (staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp.) as well  as anaerobic ones (peptostreptococcus spp.), and candida albicans were occurred most frequently in root carious lesions in middle-aged and older adults.

TI  == crossing the barrier: evolution and spread of a major class of mosaic pbp2x in streptococcus pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis.
AB  == a paradigm for streptococcus interspecies gene transfer is represented by the mosaic pbp genes encoding the target enzymes for beta-lactam antibiotics, the penicillin-binding proteins, in streptococcus pneumoniae. we investigated a collection of oral streptococci from three continents by comprehensive multi-locus sequence typing analysis in order to trace the origin of a mosaic block belonging to a dominant family of mosaic pbp2x implicated in penicillin resistance of s. pneumoniae. one widespread family of mosaic pbp2x occurred in all three distinct clusters of s. pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis, documenting independent inter- and intraspecies recombination events. moreover, potential ancestor genes of this mosaic block could be identified in two penicillin-susceptible s. mitis strains from south africa and spain, facilitating the identification of pbp2x mutations relevant for resistance development.

TI  == sequence of oral bacterial co-adhesion and non-contact brushing.
AB  == non-contact plaque removal offers advantages in interproximal spaces, fissures, and pockets. it requires the generation of strong fluid flows and the inclusion of air bubbles to become effective. a pair of co-adhering streptococci and actinomyces has been used previously to demonstrate non-contact removal by sonic  brushing. here we determined the influence of the sequence of co-adhesion of streptococci and actinomyces on non-contact removal from a salivary pellicle by rotary and sonic brushing. after bacterial adhesion, pellicles were brushed in a  wet and immersed state, with a distance up to 4 mm to the bristle tips. bacteria  adhering to pellicles from the sequence streptococci followed by actinomyces appeared more difficult to remove and left more large co-aggregates than from the sequence actinomyces followed by streptococci. at contact, rotary and sonic brushing performed equally well in bacterial removal, while at 4 mm, both had lost some efficacy.

TI  == oral streptococcal strains isolated from odontogenic infections and their susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify at species level and to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility of oral streptococcal strains isolated from 100 pus samples collected from romanian patients with different odontogenic infections. the isolates were identified at species level using the rapid id 32 strep system  and their susceptibility was testing by the etest, against: penicillin g, ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline. for the investigation of  erythromycin resistance phenotype the disk diffusion test was used. the isolates  belonged to several species, with streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis predominating. reduced susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was found only among the isolates belonging to s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups. resistance to erythromycin was detected among all species, except for: s. constellatus, s. intermedius and s. gordonii, and the m phenotype was established, while resistance to tetracycline was detected within all species but s. gordonii. in contrast, clindamycin was fully active. as most odontogenic infections are mixed  infections, often involving strictly anaerobic bacteria, which are frequently beta-lactamase producers, the association of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, like amoxiclav, is recommended when the antimicrobial treatment is necessary.

AB  == objective: to assess the in vitro effect of five bacterial strains isolated from  semen samples (escherichia coli, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus oralis, bacteroides ureolyticus, and ureaplasma urealyticum) on reactive oxygen intermediate (roi) release and lipid sperm membrane peroxidation in the coincubated suspensions of white blood cells (wbc) with spermatozoa. design: an in vitro model of semen infection. setting: basic research laboratory. patient(s): healthy normozoospermic volunteers and healthy blood donors. intervention(s): none. main outcome measure(s): chemiluminescent assay was used to evaluate roi generation by wbc. malondialdehyde (mda) concentration was determined in sperm lysates using high-performance liquid chromatography. result(s): of the bacterial strains tested, b. ureolyticus, s. haemolyticus, and  e. coli caused the greatest damage to sperm membrane lipids. an increase in mda levels in sperm lysates was a natural consequence of bacteria-induced roi generation. the wbc usually enhanced harmful activity of the infectious agent toward the cell membranes. conclusion(s): the harmful effect of bacteria on spermatozoa depends on the type and species of microorganisms invading, colonizing, or infecting the male genital tract and is associated with the accompanying oxidative stress. the presence of leukocytes in semen appears to be  the additional factor enhancing the sperm lipid membrane peroxidation, which may  affect the fertility status.

AB  == renal deterioration often occurs in cases of infectious endocarditis (ie), but, ie- associated nephritis with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (rpgn) is rare. patients with severe infection (e.g., ie) sometimes show positivity for cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-anca). therefore, diagnosis  and treatment are very difficult in cases of rpgn with ie and positivity for c-anca. such cases are rare, only 12 have been reported in the english literature. herein, we describe the case of a 50-year-old man who presented with  rpgn with ie and tested positively for c-anca. he was referred to our hospital because of leg edema, purpura and renal dysfunction. laboratory tests revealed serum creatinine elevation and positivity for c-anca and proteinase 3-specific (pr3)-anca. rpgn and acute renal failure were diagnosed. hemodialysis and steroid therapy were started. streptococcus oralis was isolated by blood culture. transthoracic echocardiography revealed grade iii mitral valve insufficiency with two vegetations. therefore, ie was diagnosed. the steroid therapy was stopped, and antibiotic therapy was begun. because there was no improvement, surgical therapy was performed. the operation was successful, but the patient died of brain hemorrhage. our experience in this case indicates c/pr3-anca positive rpgn  must be ruled out in patients with infectious disease, particularly ie, together  with renal symptoms, and renal biopsy should be performed.

TI  == efficacy and mechanisms of non-antibacterial, chemical plaque control by dentifrices--an in vitro study.
AB  == objectives: the provision of antiplaque benefits to dentifrices assists patients  in improving hygiene and reducing susceptibility to gingivitis and caries. chemical plaque control involves different mechanisms and is mostly associated with antibacterial effects, but also includes effects on pellicle surface chemistry to improve cleansing or discourage renewed plaque formation. it is the  aim of this paper to analyze in vitro detachment of co-aggregating oral actinomyces and streptococci from pellicle surfaces by dentifrice supernates and  to study subsequent de novo streptococcal deposition. methods: detachment by dentifrices of a co-adhering bacterial pair was studied in the parallel plate flow chamber on a 16 h pellicle coated surface. after detachment by perfusing the chamber with a dentifrice, re-deposition was initiated by flowing with a fresh streptococcal suspension. the dentifrices included both a regular, sls-fluoride based formulation as well a pyrophosphate, anticalculus and antimicrobial formulations. results: all dentifrice supernates containing sls were effective in detaching co-adhering bacteria from pellicles surfaces, except in combination with snf(2). when hexametaphosphate was added immediate detachment was relatively low, but continued even during re-deposition. the re-deposition of streptococci after detachment by other, naf containing dentifrices involved relatively few large aggregates, presumably because fluoride was able to block bi-dentate calcium binding sites on the bacterial cell surfaces, mediating co-adhesion. when pyrophosphate was present in addition to naf, re-deposition involved significantly more large aggregates, likely because pyrophosphate served as a bi-dentate bridge between calcium bound on the bacterial cell surfaces. conclusion: commercially available dentifrice formulations differ in their ability to stimulate bacterial detachment from pellicles and dependent on their composition yield the formation of large co-adhering aggregates of actinomyces and streptococci in de novo deposition.

TI  == relationship between the ability of oral streptococci to interact with platelet glycoprotein ibalpha and with the salivary low-molecular-weight mucin, mg2.
AB  == the oral streptococci streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis are common aetiological agents of infective endocarditis, and their ability to adhere to and induce the aggregation of platelets is thought to be a virulence trait. the platelet glycoprotein gpibalpha has been implicated  as the adhesion receptor for s. sanguinis and s. gordonii, but it is not known if this is the case for s. oralis and other species. the aim of this study was to determine the gpibalpha-interactive capability of a range of oral streptococci and to determine the relationship between this capability and their ability to interact with the salivary constituents that they would encounter in their normal habitat. all platelet-adhesive s. sanguinis strains and most s. gordonii strains  adhered in a gpibalpha-dependent manner, but strains of s. oralis, streptococcus  cristatus, streptococcus parasanguinis and streptococcus mitis had no direct affinity for platelets. those strains that were able to bind gpibalpha also bound to the low-molecular-weight submandibular salivary mucin, mg2, and this interaction was sialic acid-dependent. the data suggest that s. sanguinis and s.  gordonii may be efficient colonizers of platelet vegetations because of their adaptation to recognize sialylated salivary mucins. in contrast, s. oralis does not interact with platelets and so is likely to colonize vegetations through an as yet unidentified mechanism.

AB  == intraoral bony defects can be filled with bony particles that are collected in a  titanium filter. the aim of this study was to determine quantitatively and qualitatively the degree of this contamination. over a period of 3 months, bony particles were collected from 50 patients undergoing oral surgery. the bony particles were scraped off the filter, resuspended, and incubated aerobically and anaerobically on human blood agar media. colony forming units (cfu) were determined as well as the most common species of bacteria. all samples showed anaerobic and aerobic growth. after anaerobic incubation in 44 samples the number of bacteria was higher (38) or equal (six) to that after aerobic incubation. on average, 435,000 cfu (aerobic) and 1,013,000 cfu (anaerobic) per sample were found. the most frequently identified bacteria belonged to veillonella spp. in the anaerobic and to streptococcus oralis in the aerobic cultures. in 43 samples  black-pigmented colonies were detected. only bacteria common in the oral cavity were identified. prophylactic antibiotic therapy may be indicated when using filtered bony particles for intraoral augmentation procedures.

TI  == physiological and serological variation in streptococcus mitis biovar 1 from the  human oral cavity during the first year of life.
AB  == objective: the purpose of the study was to explore the physiological and antigenic diversity of a large number of streptococcus mitis biovar 1 isolates in order to begin to determine whether these properties contribute to species persistence. design: s. mitis biovar 1 was collected from four infants from birth to the first year of age. at each of eight to nine visits, 60 isolates each were  obtained from the cheeks, tongue and incisors (once erupted) yielding 4440 in total. these were tested for production of neuraminidase, beta1-n-acetylglucosaminidase, beta1-n-acetylgalactosaminidase, iga1 protease and amylase-binding. antigenic diversity was examined by elisa and western immunoblotting using antisera raised against s. mitis biovar 1 nctc 12261(t) and  sk145. results: three thousand three hundred and thirty (75%) of the isolates were identified as s. mitis biovar 1 and 3144 (94.4%) could be divided into four  large phenotypic groups based on glycosidase production. fifty-four percent of the isolates produced iga1 protease, but production was disproportionate among the phenotypes. between one-third and one-half of the strains of each phenotype bound salivary alpha-amylase. antisera against strains nctc 12261(t) and sk145 displayed different patterns of reactivity with randomly selected representatives of the four phenotypes. conclusions: s. mitis biovar 1 is physiologically and antigenically diverse, properties which could aid strains in avoiding host immunity and promote re-colonization of a habitat or transfer to a new habitat.

TI  == tigecycline (gar-936) activity against streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci including streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly s. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. tigecycline (gar-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with  a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. the studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and fewer  strains of s. gallolyticus (98 strains) and streptococcus mutans (50 strains). these strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted  by clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/ml for tigecycline per us food and drug administration). penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (s. sanguis) to 98% (s. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was  also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for s. gallolyticus. in conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and s. gallolyticus with an overall mic90 at < or = 0.06 microg/ml; the highest mic was only 0.25 microg/ml.

AB  == interactions between enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. the aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions  between e. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella oralis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus anginosus. intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. all e.  faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with f. nucleatum; e. faecalis did not coaggregate with p. anaerobius or s. anginosus. one strain, e. faecalis e1, coaggregated with p. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. coaggregation interactions between e. faecalis and f. nucleatum observed in this study suggest  a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.

TI  == molecular characterization of disease-associated streptococci of the mitis group  that are optochin susceptible.
AB  == eight optochin-susceptible (opt(s)) alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococcus isolates were characterized at the molecular level. these isolates showed phenotypic characteristics typical of both viridans streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. comparison of the sequence of housekeeping genes from these isolates with those of s. pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae suggested that the opt(s) isolates corresponded to streptococci of the mitis group. besides, the opt(s) streptococci were negative by a gen-probe accuprobe pneumococcus test and hybridized with specific pneumococcal probes (lyta and ply) but also with ant, a gene not present in most s. pneumoniae strains. moreover, the isolates were insoluble in 1% sodium deoxycholate but completely dissolved in 0.1% deoxycholate. sequence analysis of  the lyta gene revealed that the opt(s) streptococci carried lyta alleles characteristic of those present in nonpneumococcal streptococci of the mitis group. the determination of the partial nucleotide sequence embracing the atp operon encoding the f(o)f(1) h(+)-atpase indicated that the optochin susceptibility of the isolates was due to the acquisition of atpc, atpa, and part of atpb from s. pneumoniae by horizontal gene transfer.

TI  == sites in the ch3 domain of human iga1 that influence sensitivity to bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influence of regions, other than the hinge, on the susceptibility of human iga1 to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases, was examined using iga1 mutants bearing amino acid deletions, substitutions, and domain swaps. iga1 lacking the tailpiece retained its susceptibility to cleavage by all of the iga1  proteases. the domain swap molecule alpha1alpha2gamma3, in which the ch3 domain of iga1 was exchanged for that of human igg1, was resistant to cleavage with the  type 1 and 2 serine iga1 proteases of neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae, but remained sensitive to cleavage with  the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. substitution of the iga1 calpha3  domain motif pro440 -phe443 into the corresponding position in the cgamma3 domain of alpha1alpha2gamma3 resulted now in sensitivity to the type 2 iga1 protease of  n. meningitidis, indicating the possible requirement of these amino acids for sensitivity to this protease. for the h. influenzae type 2 protease, resistance of an iga1 mutant in which the ch3 domain residues 399-409 were exchanged with those from igg1, but sensitivity of mutant hubovalpha3 in which the calpha3 domain of bovine iga replaces that of human iga1, suggests that ch3 domain residues glu403, gln406, and thr409 influence sensitivity to this enzyme. hence,  unlike the situation with the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus spp., the sensitivity of human iga1 to cleavage with the serine iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus involves their binding to different sites specifically in the ch3 domain.

AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with  chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. method: subgingival  plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. the samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples = 21,832). mean counts, % dna probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. significance of difference between groups was determined using the mann-whitney test. association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of p. gingivalis plus t. forsythia  less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. all analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: for the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens p. gingivalis and t. forsythia as well as eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. there were significantly more capnocytophaga gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii and veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. e. nodatum, t. denticola, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher  counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions  of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. conclusions: this investigation confirmed the strong association of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of e. nodatum and t. denticola  with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. other species, including s. oralis, eikenella corrodens, s.  intermedius and f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were present in low proportions.

TI  == autoinducer 2: a concentration-dependent signal for mutualistic bacterial biofilm growth.
AB  == 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (dpd), a product of the luxs enzyme in the catabolism of s-ribosylhomocysteine, spontaneously cyclizes to form autoinducer 2 (ai-2). ai-2 is proposed to be a universal signal molecule mediating interspecies communication among bacteria. we show that mutualistic and abundant biofilm growth in flowing saliva of two human oral commensal bacteria, actinomyces naeslundii t14v and streptococcus oralis 34, is dependent upon production of ai-2 by s. oralis 34. a luxs mutant of s. oralis 34 was constructed which did not produce ai-2. unlike wild-type dual-species biofilms, a. naeslundii t14v and an s. oralis 34 luxs mutant did not exhibit mutualism and generated only sparse biofilms which contained a 10-fold lower biomass of each species. restoration of  ai-2 levels by genetic or chemical (synthetic ai-2 in the form of dpd) complementation re-established the mutualistic growth and high biomass characteristic for the wild-type dual-species biofilm. furthermore, an optimal concentration of dpd was determined, above and below which biofilm formation was  suppressed. the optimal concentration was 100-fold lower than the detection limit of the currently accepted ai-2 assay. thus, ai-2 acts as an interspecies signal and its concentration is critical for mutualism between two species of oral bacteria grown under conditions that are representative of the human oral cavity.

TI  == the role of platelets in infective endocarditis.
AB  == there is growing evidence that platelets play an important role in the development of infective endocarditis (ie). this review focuses on interactions between bacteria and platelets. many types of microorganism are capable of causing endocarditis. the oral streptococci, particularly streptococcus sanguis and s. oralis, remain the most common causative bacteria in ie but staphylococcus aureus is becoming an increasingly important agent. several species of bacteria and fungi are able to cause platelet aggregation in vitro, and there are indications that this ability is associated with the production of severe disease. different bacteria appear to utilise different mechanisms of aggregation, and mechanisms for adhesion may be distinct from those responsible for aggregation. at least one commonly studied strain of s. sanguis apparently utilises the host's igg and complement responses to induce platelet activation. ie may therefore be among the number of diseases in which immunological activation of platelets is thought to be of importance. other bacterial strains have their own adhesins and agonists. the more virulent bacteria, notably the staphylococci, also possess proteolytic enzymes and may directly activate coagulation pathways, whereas less virulent, opportunistic pathogens, such as some streptococci and candida albicans, may rely on interactions with host factors for colonisation and proliferation. it is proposed that platelets are involved in formation of the non-bacterial thrombotic vegetation (nbtv) and are necessary for the effective adhesion of bacteria to the nbtv, and that platelets  also influence the persistence and clinical outcome of the disease through proliferation of the thrombotic vegetation. it is hypothesised that successful colonisation of the heart valves by a micro-organism depends on effective adhesion of the bacteria or fungi to platelets, in combination with the ability to induce platelet activation and aggregation.

TI  == bacterial interference of penicillin-sensitive and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae by streptococcus oralis in an adenoid organ culture: implications for  the treatment of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections in children and adults.
AB  == objectives: the role of the viridans group of streptococci (streptococcus oralis) in the prevention of colonization with streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated  in an adenoid organ culture system. methods: the adenoids from 10 patients who were undergoing adenoidectomy for either hypertrophy or recurrent otitis media were used. results: streptococcus oralis parker and s. oralis booth (two organisms isolated from the nasopharynges of patients undergoing adenoidectomy only and patients undergoing adenoidectomy and bilateral tympanostomy with tubes, respectively) uniformly inhibited both penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae. although both strains of s. oralis inhibited  the growth of both s. pneumoniae strains, strain parker provided more complete inhibition than did strain booth. conclusions: the results indicate that some strains of s. oralis may inhibit the growth of the most serious pathogens in the  nasopharynx. it is therefore possible that colonization of inhibitory strains of  viridans streptococci may be used in the nasopharynx as a relatively safe and inexpensive approach to prevention of recurrent otitis media in some children and of recurrent suppurative sinusitis in both children and adults.

AB  == the presence of l-rhamnose (rha) branches in the coaggregation receptor polysaccharides (rps) of streptococcus gordonii 38 and streptococcus oralis j22 was eliminated by replacement of wefb with ermam in these strains. the expression of this gene in s. oralis 34 did not, however, result in the addition of rha branches to the linear rps of this strain, which is identical to that produced by the wefb-deficient mutant of s. gordonii 38. this paradoxical finding was explained by a subtle difference in acceptor specificity of the galactose-1-phosphotransferases encoded by downstream wefc in s. gordonii 38 and  wefh in s. oralis 34. these genes were distinguished by the unique ability of wefc to act on the branched acceptor formed by the action of wefb.

TI  == molecular characterization of subject-specific oral microflora during initial colonization of enamel.
AB  == the initial microbial colonization of tooth surfaces is a repeatable and selective process, with certain bacterial species predominating in the nascent biofilm. characterization of the initial microflora is the first step in understanding interactions among community members that shape ensuing biofilm development. using molecular methods and a retrievable enamel chip model, we characterized the microbial diversity of early dental biofilms in three subjects. a total of 531 16s rrna gene sequences were analyzed, and 97 distinct phylotypes  were identified. microbial community composition was shown to be statistically different among subjects. in all subjects, however, 4-h and 8-h communities were  dominated by streptococcus spp. belonging to the streptococcus oralis/streptococcus mitis group. other frequently observed genera (comprising at least 5% of clone sequences in at least one of the six clone libraries) were actinomyces, gemella, granulicatella, neisseria, prevotella, rothia, and veillonella. fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) confirmed that the proportion of streptococcus sp. sequences in the clone libraries coincided with the proportion of streptococcus probe-positive organisms on the chip. fish also revealed that, in the undisturbed plaque, not only streptococcus spp. but also the rarer prevotella spp. were usually seen in small multigeneric clusters of cells. this study shows that the initial dental plaque community of each subject  is unique in terms of diversity and composition. repetitive and distinctive community composition within subjects suggests that the spatiotemporal interactions and ecological shifts that accompany biofilm maturation also occur in a subject-dependent manner.

TI  == identification of oral bacteria associated with crevicular epithelial cells from  chronic periodontitis lesions.
AB  == bacterial invasion of host epithelial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; however, the interactions between subgingival species and the gingival crevice cells are not fully understood. this study determined the prevalence of a group of oral bacterial species on or in epithelial cells derived from periodontal pockets and the gingival crevice of subjects with periodontitis. samples of epithelial cells were obtained from 120 sites with periodontal pockets > or =4 mm and 92 periodontally healthy sites from 49 patients (mean age 46.3+/-1.4 years; 43% males) with chronic periodontitis. bacteria in or on epithelial cells were separated from unattached bacteria by percoll density-gradient centrifugation. the presence and levels of 33 oral species were determined in epithelial cell samples by whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. the most frequently detected species were porphyromonas gingivalis (42%), treponema denticola (38%), prevotella intermedia  (37%), streptococcus intermedius (36%), campylobacter rectus (35%), streptococcus sanguinis (35%) and streptococcus oralis (34%). species of actinomyces were found in low prevalence and levels. the data indicated that there were more micro-organisms on or in epithelial cells obtained from periodontal pockets than  from healthy sulci; however, no significant differences regarding the percentage  and level of any specific species were found between these sites. veillonella parvula, s. oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis tended to be more prevalent in sites without disease. these findings demonstrated that a wide  range of oral species may be detected on or in crevicular epithelial cells from sites with periodontitis and from periodontally healthy sulci.

AB  == background and aims: most cases of infective endocarditis are caused by nonenterococcal streptococci. the emergence of strains resistant to penicillin is increasingly recognized worldwide. this study sought to assess the effect of penicillin resistance on presentation and outcome of streptococcal endocarditis.  methods: a retrospective study was conducted in a single tertiary care hospital.  results: between august 1996 and december 2004, patients infected with nonenterococcal streptococcal endocarditis and known minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) to penicillin were included in this study. a total of 62 cases were identified: 48 (77%) cases of the streptococcal endocarditis were caused by viridans streptococci. the most common species groups identified were streptococcus mitis in 12 (19%) cases, streptococcus oralis in 9 (15%) cases, streptococcus sanguis in 7 (11%) cases and streptococcus mutans in 7 (11%) cases. there were 36 male and 26 female patients with a median age of 46 years (range: 1-85). twenty-two patients (35%) had peripheral embolization and 10 patients (16%) died in hospital. twenty-eight (45%) of the 62 patients were infected with  streptococcal strains of mics > or =0.125 microg/ml to penicillin. infection with streptococcal strains of mics > or =0.125 microg/ml to penicillin was associated  with a lower incidence of all-site embolization, but was not associated with higher mortality or increased frequency of surgery. conclusions: high-level penicillin resistance of the streptococci responsible for endocarditis was increasingly common and medical therapy with vancomycin had a good response. penicillin resistance was associated with a decreased risk of embolization, but was not associated with higher mortality.

TI  == interactive forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating oral bacterial pairs.
AB  == the temporo-spatial development of plaque is governed by adhesive interactions between different co-aggregating bacterial strains and species. physico-chemically, these interactions are due to attractive lifshitz-van der waals and acid-base forces, and occur despite electrostatic repulsion and with a  critical influence of temperature. the forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating pairs have never been measured, however. the aim here, thus, is to investigate, by atomic force microscopy, whether there is a difference in interactive forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating bacterial pairs  at 10 degrees c, 22 degrees c, and 40 degrees c. actinomyces naeslundii 147 was immobilized on poly-l-lysine-coated tipless afm cantilevers, while streptococci were immobilized on poly-l-lysine-coated glass surfaces. upon approach, a repulsive force was measured, regardless of whether a co-aggregating or non-co-aggregating pair was involved. however, upon retraction, the co-aggregating pair exhibited larger adhesive forces and energies than did the non-co-aggregating pair. adhesive interactions between the co-aggregating pair were smallest at 40 degrees c.

TI  == comparison of bacterial plaque samples from titanium implant and tooth surfaces by different methods.
AB  == studies have shown similarities in the microflora between titanium implants or tooth sites when samples are taken by gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) sampling methods. the purpose of the present study was to study the microflora from curette and gcf samples using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method to assess the microflora of patients who had at least one oral osseo-integrated implant and who were otherwise dentate. plaque samples were taken from tooth/implant surfaces and from sulcular gingival surfaces with curettes, and from gingival fluid using filter papers. a total of 28 subjects (11 females) were enrolled in the study. the mean age of the subjects was 64.1 years (sd+/-4.7). on average, the implants studied had been in function for 3.7 years (sd+/-2.9). the  proportion of streptococcus oralis (p<0.02) and fusobacterium periodonticum (p<0.02) was significantly higher at tooth sites (curette samples). the gcf samples yielded higher proportions for 28/40 species studies (p-values varying between 0.05 and 0.001). the proportions of tannerella forsythia (t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola were both higher in gcf samples (p<0.02 and p<0.05, respectively) than in curette samples (implant sites). the microbial  composition in gingival fluid from samples taken at implant sites differed partly from that of curette samples taken from implant surfaces or from sulcular soft tissues, providing higher counts for most bacteria studied at implant surfaces, but with the exception of porphyromonas gingivalis. a combination of gcf and curette sampling methods might be the most representative sample method.

AB  == there are no experimental studies regarding the prophylactic efficacy of linezolid against infective endocarditis. nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis of the aortic valve was induced in rabbits by the insertion of a polyethylene catheter. twenty-four hours later, animals were randomly assigned to a control group, and groups receiving either ampicillin (two doses of 40 mg/kg of body weight each, given intravenously, 2 h apart) or linezolid (a single per os dose of 75 mg/kg). the first dose of ampicillin and the single dose of linezolid were  administered 0.5 and 1 h, respectively, prior to the intravenous inoculation of approximately 10(7) cfu of streptococcus oralis or enterococcus faecalis. linezolid peak levels in rabbit serum were similar to the peak serum levels in humans following a 600-mg oral dose of linezolid. linezolid prevented endocarditis in 87% of s. oralis-challenged rabbits (p < 0.001 versus controls; p = 0.026 versus ampicillin). in rabbits challenged with e. faecalis, linezolid prevented endocarditis in 73% (p = 0.003 versus controls; p = 0.049 versus ampicillin). ampicillin prevented endocarditis due to s. oralis or due to e. faecalis in 47% (p = 0.005 versus controls) and in 30% (p = not significant versus controls) of the challenged animals, respectively. in conclusion, linezolid was effective as prophylaxis against endocarditis caused by a strain of s. oralis and to a lesser degree against that caused by a strain of e. faecalis.  its prophylactic efficacy was superior to that of ampicillin.

TI  == interleukin 1alpha increases the susceptibility of rabbits to experimental viridans streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == major predisposing conditions for infective endocarditis (ie) are the presence of a cardiac platelet-fibrin vegetation and of circulating bacteria with relatively  low susceptibility to microbicidal activity of blood platelets. the influence of  proinflammatory conditions on development of ie is unknown. we studied the effects of the presence of a catheter, inserted to induce platelet-fibrin vegetations, and of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1alpha in rabbit experimental ie. leaving the catheter in place after challenge with viridans streptococci predisposed for experimental ie. ie susceptibility rapidly decreased between 0 to 6 h after catheter removal. the catheter did not predispose for ie by providing a site for bacterial adherence, as almost all explanted catheters were culture negative. to mimic the proinflammatory influence of the catheter, rabbits were injected with interleukin-1alpha at 24 h after catheter removal and  at 0, 1, and 3 h before bacterial challenge. interleukin-1alpha injected 3 h prior to challenge significantly increased ie incidence due to a platelet releasate-susceptible streptococcus oralis strain, with rapidly increasing numbers of bacteria within the vegetations. ie due to the streptococcus sanguis strain less susceptible to platelet releasate was not enhanced. we conclude that  proinflammatory stimuli, either a catheter or interleukin-1alpha, enhanced susceptibility to ie due to the platelet releasate-susceptible s. oralis. as with rabbits, temporary intravascular proinflammatory conditions may predispose for ie in humans at risk for this serious infection.

TI  == distribution and genetic diversity of the abc transporter lipoproteins piua and piaa within streptococcus pneumoniae and related streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. the existence of approximately 90 antigenically distinct capsular serotypes has greatly complicated the development of an effective pneumococcal vaccine. virulence-associated proteins common and conserved among all capsular types now represent the best strategy to combat pneumococcal infections. piua and piaa are  the lipoprotein components of two pneumococcal iron abc transporters and are required for full virulence in mouse models of infection. here we describe a study of the distribution and genetic diversity of piua and piaa within typical and atypical s. pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mitis strains. the genes encoding both piua and piaa were present in all typical pneumococci tested, (covering 20 and 27 serotypes, respectively). the piua gene was highly conserved within the typical pneumococci (0.3% nucleotide divergence), but was also present in "atypical" pneumococci and the closely related species s. mitis and s. oralis, showing up to 10.4% nucleotide divergence and 7.5% amino acid divergence from the typical pneumococcal alleles. conversely, the piaa gene  was found to be specific to typical pneumococci, 100% conserved, and absent from  the oral streptococci, including isolates of s. mitis known to possess pneumolysin and autolysin. these are desirable qualities for a vaccine candidate  and as a diagnostic tool for s. pneumoniae.

TI  == identification of new acceptor specificities of glycosyltransferase r with the aid of substrate microarrays.
AB  == finding opportunities to construct sugar motifs and to transfer them to targets of biological relevance and rapid identification of glycosylation events are important goals for glycobiology and a field of increasing interest. here we have applied an enzyme microarray screening system for the identification of new acceptor specificities of the glycosyltransferase r (gtfr) from streptococcus oralis (e.c. 2.4.1.5), which was able to effect the synthesis of sugar motifs in  short times and with low amounts of substrate. these observations resulted in the development of a convenient alpha-glycosylation by the non-leloir glycosyltransferase gtfr, with sucrose as substrate and with different alcohols and amino acid derivatives as acceptors, for the synthesis of glycoethers and glycosylated amino acids not observed with the use of familiar gtfs with high sequence homology.

TI  == viridans streptococci isolated by culture from blood of cancer patients: clinical and microbiologic analysis of 50 cases.
AB  == clinical and microbiologic studies of 50 cases of viridans streptococcal bacteremia in cancer patients were performed. the bacteria were identified to species level by sequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene. at least nine streptococcus spp. were found, including s. mitis (25 strains, 50.0% of 50); currently unnamed streptococcus spp. (11 strains); s. parasanguis (five strains); s. anginosus (three strains); s. salivarius (two strains); and one strain each of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus, and s. vestibularis. there were no s. oralis strains. among 11 antibiotics of nine classes tested, no resistance to vancomycin, linezolid, or quinupristin-dalfopristin was seen. resistance to penicillin (mic, 4 to 12 mug/ml) was noted only among s. mitis strains (28.0%, 7/25) and not non-s. mitis strains (0/25) (p = 0.004). significantly more s. mitis strains than non-s. mitis strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones and to > or =3 classes of antibiotics. isolation of quinolone-resistant organisms was associated with the prior usage of quinolones (p = 0.002). quantitative blood cultures showed that the strains resistant to levofloxacin or gatifloxacin were associated with higher colony counts than were their corresponding nonresistant strains. the young and elderly patients also had higher levels of bacteremia caused predominantly by s. mitis. septic shock was present in 17 (34.0% of 50) patients, and 13 of those cases were caused by s. mitis (p = 0.007). these results suggest that s. mitis is the most common cause of viridans streptococcal  bacteremia in cancer patients and is more resistant to antibiotics than other species.

TI  == the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  == some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. streptococcus mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus fermentans, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, actinomyces naeslundi, a. israelii, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto columbia  agar with haemin and vitamin k and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. the resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. the red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. all colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. the green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, f. nucleatum and s. sobrinus. the red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) p. intermedia, a. naeslundi, a. israelii, l. fermentans, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. with all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. we conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator  of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.

TI  == use of phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses to identify nonhemolytic streptococci isolated from bacteremic patients.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate molecular and phenotypic methods for the identification of nonhemolytic streptococci. a collection of 148 strains consisting of 115 clinical isolates from cases of infective endocarditis, septicemia, and meningitis and 33 reference strains, including type strains of all relevant streptococcus species, were examined. identification was performed by phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of four housekeeping genes, ddl, gdh, rpob, and soda; by pcr analysis of the glucosyltransferase (gtf) gene; and by conventional phenotypic characterization and identification using two commercial kits, rapid id 32 strep and streptogram and the associated databases.  a phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of the four housekeeping genes allowed unequivocal differentiation of recognized species and was used as the reference. analysis of single gene sequences revealed deviation clustering in eight strains (5.4%) due to homologous recombination with other species. this was particularly evident in s. sanguinis and in members of the anginosus group of streptococci. the rate of correct identification of the strains by both commercial identification kits was below 50% but varied significantly between species. the most significant problems were observed with s. mitis and s. oralis  and 11 streptococcus species described since 1991. our data indicate that identification based on multilocus sequence analysis is optimal. as a more practical alternative we recommend identification based on soda sequences with reference to a comprehensive set of sequences that is available for downloading from our server. an analysis of the species distribution of 107 nonhemolytic streptococci from bacteremic patients showed a predominance of s. oralis and s. anginosus with various underlying infections.

TI  == [influence of environmental factors on synthesis rate of hydrogen peroxide by streptococcus oralis].
AB  == objective: to investigate the influence of a broad range of environmental conditions on initial rates of hydrogen peroxide produced by streptococcus oralis (s. oralis). methods: for each rate measurement, 1 ml aliquots of 10(12) cells/l  mid-logarithmic phase s. oralis in tsby were centrifuged and respectively washed  by phosphate buffer containing 0.01-10 mmol/l glucose or sucrose, phosphate buffer with 5.0-7.5 ph or bis-tris buffer containing 0.01-100 mmol/l ca(2+), 0.01-100 mmol/l f(-) or 0.01-100 mmol/l hfpo(3)(-). after s. oralis was cultured  in respective buffer for 10, 20 and 30 min at 37 degrees c, the concentration of  hydrogen peroxide in supernatant was assayed spectrophotometrically in 96-well micro-plate by abts-hrp at a(405). results: synthesis rate of hydrogen peroxide by s. oralis was 7.48 micromol/l per minute without carbohydrate, the synthesis rate of hydrogen peroxide by s. oralis increased with 0.01-10 mmol/l glucose and  0.01-10 mmol/l sucrose, but there was no statistically significant difference in  synthesis rate among the carbohydrate groups. the rates of h2o2 synthesis were inhibited in the buffer at ph 5.0-6.0, compared with ph 7.0 (p < 0.05). ca(2+) had little influence on the rate of h2o2 synthesis. ic(50) of h2o2 synthesis rates by s. oralis responded to fhpo(3)(-) and f(-) were 12.65 mmol/l and 1.90 mmol/l respectively. conclusions: environmental conditions may influence the synthesis rate of h2o2 by s. oralis.

TI  == experimental infective endocarditis induced by human supragingival dental plaque  in rats.
AB  == human dental plaque is thought to contribute to disease, not only in the oral cavity but also at other body sites. to investigate the pathogenicity of dental plaque in tissues remote from the mouth, we examined the ability of human supragingival dental plaque to induce infective endocarditis (ie) in rats. in total, 15 out of 27 catheterized rats survived after intravenous injections with  human supragingival dental plaque suspensions containing 3 x 10(6) colony-forming units (cfu) of bacterial cells. in surviving rats, infected vegetations were formed in all except one rat. the microbial composition of the infected vegetations was different from that of the respective dental plaque inocula, with streptococcus oralis comprising the majority of the isolates. in rats affected with endocarditis, the aortic sinus was filled with fibrinous vegetation containing bacteria. inflammatory cells infiltrated the aortic valve, the aorta adjacent to the valve, and the cardiac muscles. the inoculation of catheterized rats with a cell suspension of s. oralis isolate (5 x 10(6) cfu) was not lethal but capable of inducing endocarditis in all animals. the results suggest that if  dental plaque were introduced into the bloodstream, it could serve as a potent source of bacteria causing ie in humans.

TI  == macrolide resistance mechanisms and in vitro susceptibility patterns of viridans  group streptococci isolated from blood cultures.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to study the macrolide resistance mechanisms and antimicrobial susceptibilities of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from blood cultures. methods: in vitro susceptibilities to nine antimicrobials were studied for 85 vgs isolated from blood cultures by agar dilution. pheno- and genotyping of erythromycin-resistant isolates were studied by the double disc test and pcr. results: resistance to erythromycin was found in 27% (n = 23) of the isolates. erythromycin-resistant streptococcus oralis (n = 13) predominated among the other erythromycin-resistant species isolated. the phenotypes among 23  erythromycin-resistant isolates were as follows: 12 constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (cmls(b)) resistance phenotype and 11 macrolide (m) resistance phenotype. of the cmls(b) isolates 11 had erm(b) genes and 11 of the m phenotype isolates had mef(a) genes. four of the cmls(b) isolates had both erm(b) and mef(a) genes. none of the isolates had erm(tr) genes. combined resistance to erythromycin with penicillin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and quinupristin/dalfopristin was found in 100, 61, 74, 100 and 100% of the isolates, respectively. no resistance was found for vancomycin, linezolid and levofloxacin. conclusions: the macrolide resistance mechanisms of our vgs isolates revealed that the cmls(b) phenotype associated with erm(b) and the m phenotype associated with mef(a) genes are found with similar frequencies.

TI  == carbohydrate engineering of the recognition motifs in streptococcal co-aggregation receptor polysaccharides.
AB  == the cell wall polysaccharides of certain oral streptococci function as receptors  for the lectin-like surface adhesins on other members of the oral biofilm community. recognition of these receptor polysaccharides (rps) depends on the presence of a host-like motif, either galnacbeta1-3gal (gn) or galbeta1-3galnac (g), within the oligosaccharide repeating units of different rps structural types. type 2gn rps of streptococcus gordonii 38 and type 2g rps of streptococcus oralis j22 are composed of heptasaccharide repeats that are identical except for  their host-like motifs. in the current investigation, the genes for the glycosyltransferases that synthesize these motifs were identified by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) analysis of genetically altered  polysaccharides. rps production was switched from type 2gn to 2g by replacing wefc and wefd in the type 2gn gene cluster of s. gordonii 38 with weff and wefg from the type 2g cluster of s. oralis j22. disruption of either wefc or weff abolished cell surface rps production. in contrast, disruption of wefd in the type 2gn cluster or wefg in the type 2g cluster eliminated beta-galnac from the gn motif or beta-gal from the g motif, resulting in mutant polysaccharides with hexa- rather than heptasaccharide subunits. the mutant polysaccharides reacted like wild-type rps with rabbit antibodies against type 2gn or 2g rps but were inactive as co-aggregation receptors. additional mutant polysaccharides with galnacbeta1-3galnac or galbeta1-3gal recognition motifs were engineered by replacing wefc in the type 2gn cluster with weff or weff in the type 2g cluster with wefc respectively. the reactions of these genetically modified polysaccharides as antigens and receptors provide further insight into the structural basis of rps function.

TI  == discrimination of streptococcus pneumoniae from viridans group streptococci by genomic subtractive hybridization.
AB  == two oligonucleotide primer sets for the discrimination of streptococcus pneumoniae from "pneumococcus-like" oral streptococcal isolates by pcr were developed. genomic subtractive hybridization was performed to search for differences between streptococcus pneumoniae strain wu2 and the most closely related oral streptococcus, streptococcus mitis strain 903. we identified 19 clones that contained s. pneumoniae-specific nucleotide fragments that were absent from the chromosomal dna of typical laboratory strains of s. mitis and other oral bacteria. subsequently, oligonucleotide pcr primers for the detection  of s. pneumoniae were designed from the sequences of the subtracted dna fragments, and the specificities of the 19 primer sets were evaluated by pcr using chromosomal dnas extracted from four s. pneumoniae clinical isolates and from 20 atypical organisms classified as s. mitis or s. oralis, which harbored genes encoding the pneumococcal virulence factors autolysin (lyta) or pneumolysin (ply), as templates. of the 19 primer sets, two (spn9802 and spn9828) did not amplify pcr products from any of the pneumococcus-like streptococcal strains that we examined. the genes containing the spn9802 and spn9828 sequences encoded proteins of unknown function that did not correspond to any previously described  proteins in other bacteria. these new oligonucleotide primers may be very useful  for early and correct diagnosis of s. pneumoniae infections.

TI  == differentiation of mutans streptococci by intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == it is difficult to distinguish mutans streptococci on the species level, and even more so on the subspecies level. intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) (icm) was applied to reference strains of five of the species of the mutans group (streptococcus criceti, streptococcus downei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus ratti, streptococcus sobrinus), nonmutans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis), and  177 mutans streptococci isolated from saliva of 10 children. from the analysis of the reference strains, readily distinguishable icm mass spectra were obtained for the different species. based on multivariate statistical analysis, a correct and  unambiguous assignment was made of the spectra of 159 isolated mutans streptococci to s. mutans and 16 isolates to s. sobrinus. two isolates were sorted out and were identified by sequencing of their 16s rrna genes as streptococcus anginosus. in addition, icm indicated a misclassification for some  reference strains (aht, v 100 and e 49) and re-classified aht and e 49 as s. ratti and v 100 as s. sobrinus. this was confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing. based  on a statistical similarity analysis of the spectra of reference strains and a quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of icm, the isolates identified as either s. mutans or s. sobrinus were phenotyped on the subspecies level. in the population of the clinical isolates, 14 unambiguously different s. mutans and three different s. sobrinus phenotypes were detected. icm proved to be a powerful tool for a differentiation of mutans streptococci down to the subspecies level.

TI  == microbubble-induced detachment of coadhering oral bacteria from salivary pellicles.
AB  == the presence and maturity of the salivary pellicle influences microbial adhesion  and its tenacity in the oral cavity, posing a challenge to different plaque-control systems. some plaque-control systems rely on surface-tension forces arising from passing microbubbles sprayed over the pellicle. passage of such bubbles is accompanied by a high fluid flow, but systematic studies are lacking on the contribution of fluid flow vs. microbubbles towards plaque removal. therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the detachment efficacy of laminar fluid flow (wall shear rates 11,000-16,000 s(-1)), with and without microbubbles, towards the detachment of actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1 and streptococcus oralis j22, and their coadhering aggregates, from salivary pellicles formed over 2 h or 16 h from reconstituted human whole saliva. microbubbles in a fluid flow were more efficient at inducing single bacterial detachment, resulting in almost complete (97%) removal for s. oralis j22 and a 15-fold increase in a. naeslundii t14v-j1 removal as compared to the detachment caused by fluid flow alone. a. naeslundii was more difficult to remove and apparently formed the strongest bonds with high-molecular-weight proteins in 16-h pellicles. the detachment of coaggregates after 2 min left a substantial amount of adhered bacterial mass, including more than 60% of singly attached a. naeslundii on the pellicle surface, providing nucleation sites for the de novo adhesion of coadhering streptococci.

TI  == endocarditis-associated oral streptococci promote rapid differentiation of monocytes into mature dendritic cells.
AB  == endocarditis is frequently attributable to oral streptococci, but mechanisms of pathogenesis are not well understood, although monocytes appear to be important.  high titers of interleukin-12 (il-12) are produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) after engaging streptococcus mutans, but monocytes in developing endocardial vegetations tend to disappear rather than become macrophages. these data prompted the hypothesis that streptococcus-infected monocytes differentiate into short-lived il-12-producing dendritic cells (dcs) rather than macrophages. pbmc from healthy subjects were stimulated with six isolates of oral streptococci, three nonstreptococcal oral bacteria, or il-4 plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and the appearance of cells with markers typical of mature dcs (cd83(+), cd86(+), cd11c(+), and cd14(-)) was  monitored. supernatant fluids from the pbmc cultures were harvested and il-12 p70 levels were determined. s. mutans-stimulated monocytes were analyzed for their ability to elicit allogeneic mixed-lymphocyte reactions. all streptococci examined, except one strain of streptococcus oralis (35037), rapidly induced up-regulation of cd83 and cd86 and a loss of cd14 in the cd11c(+) monocyte population within 20 h. induction of il-12 was cd14 dependent and correlated with streptococcal isolates that promoted the dc phenotype. major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii expression was up-regulated by s. mutans, and these cells  were short-lived and elicited potent allogeneic mixed-lymphocyte reactions typical of dcs. in summary, monocytes stimulated with endocarditis-associated oral streptococci rapidly exhibited the dc phenotype and functions. these data suggest that the initiation of bacterial endocarditis by oral streptococci may involve monocyte-to-dc differentiation, and this may help explain the low levels  of macrophages in the site.

AB  == objectives: the object of this study was to investigate the diversity among streptococcal species isolated from root canals in conjunction with endodontic therapy and to characterize their production of extracellular proteins. study design: consecutive root canal samples (rcs) taken as bacteriological controls during root canal treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis were analyzed in a total of 100 clinical cases. bacteria were isolated and classified by selective media and gas liquid chromatography. streptococcal strains were identified by carbohydrate fermentation, hydrolysis of aesculin/arginine, and production of enzymes. releases of extracellular proteins by streptococci and enterococcus spp  in fluid culture media were examined with sds-page and 2-dimension gel electrophoresis (2 de). extracellular proteins produced were quantified and qualitatively analyzed. specific proteins were targeted with western immunoblot assays. comparisons were made with type strains. results: of a total of 241 bacterial strains recovered in the first samples submitted, streptococcus gordonii, s anginosus, and s oralis were the most frequently isolated streptococci. in 49 of 89 resubmitted samples showing bacterial growth, s gordonii and s oralis still predominated among streptococci. other common bacterial isolates were enterococcus spp, lactobacillus paracasei, and olsenella  uli. quantitative and qualitative differences in extracellular protein production were observed among clinical isolates and laboratory streptococcal strains. in similar conditions for growth, s intermedius, s anginosus, s oralis, and s gordonii were strong producers of extracellular proteins (>3.0 microg/ml), while  enterococcus spp and s mutans were weak. whole cell protein extracts showed a different profile from that of extracellular proteins. the chaperone protein dnak was recognized to be produced extracellularly by s gordonii, s oralis, s anginosus, and s parasanguis. conclusions: being strong producers of extracellular proteins and by virtue of common presence in teeth undergoing endodontic therapy, s gordonii, s anginosus, and s oralis may be of pathogenic significance in posttreatment apical periodontitis.

TI  == nana, a neuraminidase from streptococcus pneumoniae, shows high levels of sequence diversity, at least in part through recombination with streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, contains at least two genes, nana and nanb, that express sialidase activity. nana is a virulence determinant of pneumococci which is important in animal models of colonization and middle ear infections. the gene encoding nana was detected in all 106 pneumococcal strains screened that represented 59 restriction profiles. sequencing confirmed a high level of diversity, up to 17.2% at the nucleotide level and 14.8% at the amino acid level. nana diversity is due to a number of mechanisms including insertions, point mutations, and recombination generating mosaic genes. the level of nucleotide divergence for each recombinant block is greater than 30% and much higher than the 20% identified within mosaic pbp genes, suggesting that a high selective pressure exists for these alterations. these data indicate that at least one of the four recombinant blocks identified originated from a streptococcus oralis isolate, demonstrating for the first time  that protein virulence determinants of pneumococci have, as identified previously for genes encoding penicillin binding proteins, evolved by recombination with oral streptococci. no amino acid alterations were identified within the aspartic  boxes or predicted active site, suggesting that sequence variation may be important in evading the adaptive immune response. furthermore, this suggests that nana is an important target of the immune system in the interaction between  the pneumococcus and host.

TI  == the complex oral microflora of high-risk individuals and groups and its role in the caries process.
AB  == the involvement of the oral biofilm in the caries process requires re-evaluation. the essential role of mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus) in the caries process is not proven. acid production by dental plaque is not dependent upon the presence of mutans streptococci; caries occurs in the absence of these species and their presence does not necessarily indicate caries  activity. other oral bacteria, non-mutans streptococci, actinomyces spp. and bifidobacterium spp., are acidogenic and aciduric. they outnumber mutans streptococci in dental plaque, and there are data which support a role for these  bacteria in the initiation and progression of caries. molecular studies demonstrate the great diversity and complexity of the flora associated with caries. many taxa identified have not been cultured and the role of these taxa is not known. we have, in mutans streptococci, good markers of disease but not necessarily the aetiological agents of the disease. considerably more research is required to investigate the transition of tooth surfaces from being intact and sound to the white spot lesion stage. a combination of conventional and molecular approaches are required to elucidate the involvement of an individual taxon and of microbial populations with particular traits in the caries process.

TI  == influence of fluid shear and microbubbles on bacterial detachment from a surface.
AB  == prevention of microbial adhesion and detachment of adhering microorganisms from surfaces is important in many environmental, industrial, and medical applications. fluid shear is an obvious parameter for stimulating microbial detachment from surfaces, but recently it has been pointed out that a passing air-liquid interface also has potential in stimulating microbial detachment. in the present study, the ability of microbubbles to stimulate detachment of bacterial strains from a glass surface is compared with the effects of fluid flow. adhesion and detachment of actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1, streptococcus oralis j22, and their coadhering aggregates were studied on glass, mounted in a parallel plate flow chamber. high fluid wall shear rates (11,000 to 16,000 s(-1)) were established in a laminar flow regime in the absence and presence of microbubbles. wall shear rates stimulated detachment ranging from 70% to 30% for  s. oralis and a. naeslundii, respectively. coadhering aggregates were detached up to 54%. the presence of microbubbles in the flow increased the detachment of a. naeslundii within 2 min of flow from 40% in the absence of microbubbles to 98%, while detachment of neither s. oralis nor coadhering aggregates was affected by the presence of microbubbles. in summary, extremely high fluid flows can be effective in stimulating microbial detachment, depending on the strain involved.  the addition of microbubbles to the flow allows the detachment of tenaciously adhering bacteria not detached by flow alone, but not of adhering coaggregates.

TI  == fiber optic fluorescence microprobe for endodontic diagnosis.
AB  == successful endodontic therapy requires total debridement as well as complete obturation of the root canal to the cemento-dentinal junction. the goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy for the detection and localization of pathological dentin, pulpal remnants, and microorganisms within the root canal. specific aims were to identify: 1) characteristic excitation/emission spectra for healthy dentin, decayed dentin, enamel, and pulp; 2) the potential of specific spectral data for  differentiating between these tissues; and 3) the potential of spectral data for  detecting the presence and identifying four common endodontic pathogens. fluorescence spectra were determined in the tissues of permanent human teeth, extirpated healthy and necrotic pulps, and four endodontic pathogens. excitation/emission spectra were collected at 366 nm, 405 nm, and 440 nm excitation. marked differences in spectral signatures between the different tissues under investigation were observed. we postulate that the differences in fluorescence spectra of decayed vs. healthy dentin are due to the loss of mineralized tissue components and increased organic presence and water in these tissues. pulpal tissue showed distinctly different fluorescence spectra from healthy and decayed dentin, providing a basis for differentiating between tissue  categories. each bacterial species demonstrated distinct spectral emission patterns.

TI  == the influences of hinge length and composition on the susceptibility of human iga to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influences of iga hinge length and composition on its susceptibility to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were examined using a panel of iga hinge mutants. the iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis strains sk4 and sk49, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae cleaved iga2-iga1 half hinge, an ab featuring half of the  iga1 hinge incorporated into the equivalent site in iga1 protease-resistant iga2, whereas those of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and s. sanguis strain sk1 did not. hinge length reduction by removal of two of the four c-terminal proline residues rendered iga2-iga1 half hinge resistant to all streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases but it remained sensitive to cleavage by the serine-type  iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus spp. the four c-terminal proline residues could be substituted by alanine residues or transferred to the n-terminal extremity of the hinge without affect on the susceptibility of the ab  to cleavage by serine-type iga1 proteases. however, their removal rendered the ab resistant to cleavage by all the iga1 proteases. we conclude that the serine-type iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus require the fab and fc regions to be  separated by at least ten (or in the case of n. gonorrhoeae type i protease, nine) amino acids between val(222) and cys(241) (iga1 numbering) for efficient access and cleavage. by contrast, the streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases require 12 or more appropriate amino acids between the fab and fc to maintain a minimum critical distance between the scissile bond and the start of the fc.

TI  == microcalorimetric study on the influence of temperature on bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == binding isotherms and heats of interaction have been determined at 15, 25, and 40 degrees c for a coaggregating and a non-coaggregating oral bacterial pair. heats  of interaction were measured upon three consecutive injections of streptococci into an actinomyces suspension using isothermal titration calorimetry. after each injection, the number of streptococci injected remaining free in suspension was quantified microscopically and the degree of binding between the two bacterial strains was established. the coaggregating pair shows positive cooperative binding. the highest cooperativity, at 25 degrees c, correlates with a strong, macroscopically visible coaggregation. the non-coaggregating pair shows low cooperativity and lacks macroscopically visible coaggregation. interactions between the coaggregating partners seem to be mainly due to specific, enthalpically saturable and favorable binding sites. even though the enthalpic part of the interaction is saturated, cooperativity increases with consecutive injections, implying that the coaggregation phenomenon is driven by entropy gain. the change in heat capacity (deltac(p)) is positive for the non-coaggregating pair from 15-40 degrees c as well as for the coaggregating pair beyond 25 degrees c. at lower temperatures the coaggregating pair causes a negative deltac(p). the  decrease in heat capacity together with an increase in entropy is considered to be indicative of hydrophobic interactions playing an important role in the formation of large coaggregates as observed for the coaggregating pair at 25 degrees c.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic selection of microbiota surviving under dental restorations.
AB  == the effects of sealing infected carious dentine below dental restorations on the  phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the surviving microbiota was investigated.  it was hypothesized that the microbiota would be subject to nutrient limitation or nutrient simplification, as it would no longer have access to dietary components or salivary secretion for growth. the available nutrients would be limited primarily to serum proteins passing from the pulp through the patent dentinal tubules to the infected dentine. ten lesions were treated, and infected  dentine was sealed below dental restorations for approximately 5 months. duplicate standardized samples of infected dentine were taken at baseline and after the removal of the restorations. the baseline microbiota were composed primarily of lactobacillus spp., streptococcus mutans, streptococcus parasanguinis, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces gerencseriae. none of these  taxa were isolated among the microbiota of the dentine samples taken after 5 months, which consisted of only actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus mitis. the microbiota of the final sample exhibited a significantly (p < 0.001) increased ability to produce glycosidic enzymes (sialidase, beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase, and beta-galactosidase), which liberate sugars from glycoproteins. the genotypic diversity of s. oralis and a. naeslundii was significantly (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively) reduced in the final samples. there was significantly (p < 0.001) greater genotypic diversity within these taxa between the pairs of dentine samples taken at baseline than was found in the 5-month samples, indicating that  the dentine was more homogenous than it was at baseline. we propose that during the interval between placement of the restorations and their removal, the available nutrient, primarily serum proteins, or the relative simplicity and homogeneity of the nutrient supply significantly affected the surviving microbiota. the surviving microbiota was less complex, based on compositional, phenotypic, and genotypic analyses, than that isolated from carious lesions which were also exposed to salivary secretions and ph perturbations.

TI  == luxs-based signaling affects streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is implicated as a major etiological agent in human dental caries, and one of the important virulence properties of this organism is its ability to form biofilms (dental plaque) on tooth surfaces. we examined the role  of autoinducer-2 (ai-2) on s. mutans biofilm formation by constructing a gs-5 luxs-null mutant. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant in 0.5% sucrose defined medium was found to be markedly attenuated compared to the wild type. scanning electron microscopy also revealed that biofilms of the luxs mutant formed larger  clumps in sucrose medium compared to the parental strain. therefore, the expression of glucosyltransferase genes was examined and the gtfb and gtfc genes, but not the gtfd gene, in the luxs mutant were upregulated in the mid-log growth  phase. furthermore, we developed a novel two-compartment system to monitor ai-2 production by oral streptococci and periodontopathic bacteria. the biofilm defect of the luxs mutant was complemented by strains of s. gordonii, s. sobrinus, and s. anginosus; however, it was not complemented by s. oralis, s. salivarius, or s. sanguinis. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant was also complemented by porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 but not  by a p. gingivalis luxs mutant. these results suggest that the regulation of the  glucosyltransferase genes required for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation is regulated by ai-2. furthermore, these results provide further confirmation of previous proposals that quorum sensing via ai-2 may play a significant role in oral biofilm formation.

TI  == loop-mediated isothermal amplification method targeting the lyta gene for detection of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == it is difficult to separate streptococcus pneumoniae from the genotypically similar species streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis, which are commensals of the human oral cavity. a novel nucleic acid amplification technique, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp), which amplifies dna under isothermal conditions (63 degrees c) with high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity, was examined regarding its applicability for detecting s. pneumoniae. an s. pneumoniae-specific lamp primer targeting the lyta gene was designed. the primer specificity was validated using 10 streptococcus and 7 non-streptococcus species. within 60 min, the assay could detect 10 or more copies of purified s. pneumoniae dna with a sensitivity 1,000 times that of conventional pcr. clinical  isolates of 21 other strains (3 s. oralis, 17 s. mitis, and 1 streptococcus species) that harbor virulence-factor-encoding genes (lyta or ply) were tried to  differentiate s. pneumoniae. the detection of s. pneumoniae in clinical isolates  was more selective using the lamp method than using conventional pcr. therefore,  lamp appears to be a sensitive and reliable means of diagnosing s. pneumoniae infection.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

AB  == objective: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions  of 39 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples after scaling and root planing (srp) alone or in combination with systemic metronidazole and/or professional cleaning in subjects with chronic periodontitis. methods: forty-four adult subjects (mean age 45+/-6 years) with periodontitis were randomly assigned  in four treatment groups, a control (c, n=10) that received srp and placebo and three test groups treated as follows: t1 (n=12): srp and metronidazole (m, 400 mg tid) for 10 days; t2 (n=12): srp, weekly professional supragingival plaque removal for 3 months (pc) and placebo; and t3 (n=10): srp, m and pc. subgingival  plaque samples were taken from seven sites per subject at baseline and 90 days post-therapy. counts of 39 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and among groups using ancova. results: the mean counts of the majority of the species were reduced post-therapy in the 4 treatment groups. counts (x 10(5)+/-sem) of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella  forsythensis and treponema denticola were significantly reduced in groups t2 and  t3. levels of beneficial species, such as some actinomyces species, veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii were minimally affected in levels when the combined therapy was applied (t3). mean proportions of red complex species decreased from 18.4% at baseline to 3% at 90 days post-therapy in group t3 (p<0.01), from 25.8% to 2.3% in group t2 (p<0.01), from 17.7% to 5.6% in group t1 (p<0.05) and from 19.4% to 8.8% in group c (ns). proportions of the suspected periodontal pathogens from the orange complex were also markedly reduced in groups t2 and t3. conclusions: all treatments reduced counts and proportions of red complex species. adjunctive therapy appeared to have a greater effect and also affected members of the orange complex.

AB  == the influence of streptococcus mitis bms biosurfactants on the adhesion of eight  pioneer and four cariogenic oral bacterial strains was, for a first screening, examined in a microtiter plate assay. the adhesion to pellicle-coated wells of three cariogenic strains was inhibited >70% by the biosurfactants, while only one pioneer strain showed >70% reduction. the reduction for the other strains did not exceed 50%. subsequently, adhesion of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 and streptococcus sobrinus hg 1025, both cariogenic strains, and actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1 and streptococcus oralis j22, two pioneer strains, to biosurfactants-coated enamel with and without a salivary pellicle was studied in  a parallel plate flow chamber. a biosurfactants coating to enamel with or without a pellicle caused a reduction in the number of adhering cariogenic organisms, although no such reduction was observed for the pioneer strains. consequently, it is concluded that s. mitis bms biosurfactants may play a protective role against  adhesion of cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == effect of mutations in the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge on its susceptibility to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == components of the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge governing sensitivity to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were investigated. recombinant antibodies with distinct hinge mutations were constructed from a hybrid comprised of human iga2 bearing half of the human iga1 hinge region. this hybrid antibody and all the mutant antibodies derived from it were resistant to cleavage by the iga1 proteases from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strains but  were cleaved to various degrees by those of streptococcus pneumoniae, some streptococcus sanguis strains, and the type 1 and 2 iga1 proteases of haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. remarkably, those  proteases that cleave a pro-ser peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies lacking a pro-ser peptide bond in the hinge, and those that cleave a pro-thr peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies devoid of a pro-thr peptide bond in the hinge. thus, the enzymes can cleave alternatives to their preferred postproline peptide bond when  such a bond is unavailable. peptide sequence analysis of a representative antibody digestion product confirmed this conclusion. the presence of a cleavable peptide bond near the ch2 end of the hinge appeared to result in greater cleavage than if the scissile bond was at the ch1 end of the hinge. proline-to-serine substitution at residue 230 in a hinge containing potentially cleavable pro-ser and pro-thr peptide bonds increased the resistance of the antibody to cleavage by many iga1 proteases.

TI  == a new in vivo interdental sampling method comparing a daily flossing regime versus a manual brush control.
AB  == objective: the impact of flossing the interdental space is typically assessed by  visual methods of questionable reliability, such as clinician observations and evaluations for scoring of plaque on visual tooth surfaces. the objective of this study was to develop and validate a method to measure interproximal quantities of dental plaque, thereby permitting quantitative evaluations of between-teeth cleaning and biofilm removal. methodology: laboratory studies were performed correlating the quantity of bacteria to the amount of measured protein in a sample using a standardized protein assay (bio-rad protein assay) and samples containing single bacterial species and saliva/bacterial pellets. analysis of the plaque was standardized against a bovine serum albumin (bsa) control. pilot studies helped develop a technique for hygienist-applied interproximal flossing,  reducing contamination from saliva and other possible sources of indeterminate error. repeated sampling experiments were carried out to optimize the technique needed to remove the majority of quantifiable plaque, the best choice of flossing material, and establish the technique for collection. a pilot clinical trial assessed the benefits of daily flossing in reducing measurable quantities of interproximal plaque using the developed method. thirty-nine subjects had six interdental sites (distributed across all four quadrants, pre-molar and molar boundaries) sampled on either side, over a three-week treatment period, in two balanced and equally sized treatment groups, with twice-daily manual brushing with or without daily flossing. results: laboratory studies confirmed the accuracy of the protein detection kit in assaying bacterial plaque loads from single species or complex biofilms. in pilot developmental screens, single flossing sweeps with appropriate dental floss were sufficient to remove the majority of quantifiable biomass from interproximal sites. the clinical study demonstrated that after three weeks, interdental plaque in floss users was significantly reduced versus baseline scores. non-floss users showed no significant reduction. in direct comparison, less interdental plaque was recovered from subjects who had followed a daily flossing regime compared to subjects who had used a manual toothbrush alone (p = 0.0866). conclusion: the sampling method quantified the cleaning effects of daily flossing on interproximal plaque levels. daily flossing significantly reduced the amount of plaque found between the teeth compared to a manual brushing regimen alone. this  new method should be useful in future studies on the evaluation of mechanical or  chemical means of interproximal plaque control.

TI  == validation of serotyping of streptococcus pneumoniae in europe.
AB  == introduction: serotyping of pneumococci has become increasingly important as new  pneumococcal vaccines are introduced and place emphasis on knowledge of national  serotype-distributions and their development over time. aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of serotyping of pneumococci in europe, and to  focus on possible problems with methods, procedures, etc. that may lead to wrong  serotypings. methods: this study was part of a larger eu-project. eleven reference laboratories in europe participated in the validation of pneumococcal serotyping. the streptococcus unit at ssi functioned as the gold standard for use of the neufeld test. each laboratory was asked to type 70 blinded pneumococcal strains by use of their normal serotyping procedure and to answer to a questionnaire regarding their experience and serotyping procedure for pneumococci. the 70 strains were chosen to represent all the 23 pneumococcal types included in the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine plus a number of other less  common types. results: a total of 735 serotypings was performed. five laboratories performed complete serotyping whereas the remaining six laboratories performed partial or variable serotyping into groups or types that did not belong to groups. in general, a high degree of consensus appeared between the 11 european reference laboratories. of 735 serotypings, 39 erroneous serotypings were made (5% of all). most serotyping errors included a wrong serotype within the correct serogroup, where especially types 9n, 18c and 19f were mistyped. furthermore, misidentification of noncapsular pneumococci like s. mitis and s. oralis was also a frequent error. for 22 strains (30%) of pneumococci, serotyping mistakes were made. the erroneous serotypings were neither correlated to the use  of other methods than the neufeld test, nor to the serotyping routine of the laboratories. a number of errors may be due to a serotyping result based on a negative reaction with a specific factor serum, instead of a positive reaction with another factor serum. this may be chosen in order to simplify the serotyping procedure. thus, all the necessary factor sera must be used in order to assure correct serotyping. conclusions: overall, the quality of serotyping of pneumococci was high, and a high degree of consensus was found between the eleven laboratories. it is important to use all the necessary factor sera for serotyping, to perform all the necessary tests and to base a serotyping result always on one or more positive reactions and not on a negative reaction alone. more focus on serotyping of serotypes within groups seems to be warranted.

TI  == preliminary investigation of bacteremia incidence after removal of the haas palatal expander.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of bacteria in  the bloodstream immediately after removing haas palatal expanders; this could be  considered an invasive procedure. methods: eight patients (18.5 +/- 3.9 years old) wearing haas palatal expanders had 5-ml blood samples taken immediately before and 10 minutes after removal of the apparatus. the blood was aseptically inoculated into hemoculture bottles and incubated at 37 degrees c for 7 days. medium alterations suggesting bacterial growth were investigated by using gram staining. results: bottles containing blood taken before apparatus removal did not show bacterial growth. however, 4 of the 8 postremoval blood samples showed turbidity after 5 days, and bacterioscopy analysis showed gram-positive cocci. subsequent cultures in blood-agar medium plates allowed classifying the bacteria  as viridans streptococcus. conclusions: there is a strong possibility that trauma after removing haas expanders might be correlated to transitory bacteremia, thereby implying the need for a more careful approach when dealing with special patients, such as those at risk of cardiopathic complications.

AB  == the relationship between microflora, eruption status and caries status in the first permanent molar of young children was investigated in 177 children aged 6-7 years. a significantly greater proportion of fully erupted teeth were classified  as sound and plaque-free compared to partially erupted teeth. fully erupted teeth yielded greater numbers and proportions of mutans streptococci compared with significantly greater numbers and proportions of actinomyces israelii in partially erupted teeth. logistical regression analysis showed significant associations between white spot lesions in partially erupted teeth and increased  numbers of streptococcus oralis, mutans streptococci and streptococcus salivarius whereas the presence of actinomyces naeslundii was associated with health. significantly greater numbers and proportions of s. oralis and s. salivarius were isolated from partially erupted teeth with white spot lesions whereas streptococcus mutans was isolated in significantly greater numbers and proportions from fully erupted molars with white spots. this study suggests that  organisms other than mutans streptococci are associated with caries development in erupting permanent molar teeth.

TI  == identification of early microbial colonizers in human dental biofilm.
AB  == aims: to elucidate the first colonizers within in vivo dental biofilm and to establish potential population shifts that occur during the early phases of biofilm formation. methods and results: a 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridization assay was employed to identify 40 different bacterial strains. dental biofilm samples were collected from 15 healthy subjects, 0, 2, 4 and 6 h after tooth cleaning and the composition of these samples was compared with that of whole saliva collected from the same individuals. the bacterial distribution in biofilm samples was distinct from that in saliva, confirming the selectivity of the adhesion process. in the very early stages, the predominant tooth colonizers were found to be actinomyces species. the relative proportion of streptococci, in particular streptococcus mitis and s. oralis, increased at the expense of actinomyces species between 2 and 6 h while the absolute level of actinomyces remained unaltered. periodontal pathogens such as tannerella forsythensis(bacteroides forsythus), porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola as well as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were present in extremely low levels at all the examined time intervals in this healthy group of  subjects. conclusion: the data provide a detailed insight into the bacterial population shifts occurring within the first few hours of biofilm formation and show that the early colonizers of the tooth surface predominantly consist of beneficial micro-organisms. significance and impact of the study: the early colonizers of dental plaque are of great importance in the succession stages of biofilm formation and its overall effect on the oral health of the host.

AB  == streptococcus oralis 264-3, streptococcus mitis 254-1 and s. mitis 264-1, isolated from the oral cavities of two children were each found to carry the tet(m) gene but exhibited different degrees of reduced susceptibility to tetracycline (tetracycline mics of 2, 8 and 64 mg/l, respectively). the aim of this study was to determine the molecular basis for the different levels of tetracycline resistance (tc(r)) observed. escherichia coli hb101 carrying the cloned tet(m) genes exhibited similar levels of tetracycline susceptibility to those observed in the parental streptococcal strains (mics of 1, 16, and 64 mg/l  for tet(m) genes from s. oralis 264-3, s. mitis 254-1 and s. mitis 264-1, respectively). dna sequencing revealed that s. oralis 264-3 had a tet(m) gene highly homologous to tet(m) carried by tn916 from enterococcus faecalis (99.6% identity), while the intermediate- and high-level tc(r) strains had tet(m) sequences that resembled the tet(m) gene of tn5251 from streptococcus pneumoniae  (99.3% and 99.4% identity, respectively). no differences were observed in the upstream attenuator structure for each of the strains and differences in reduced  tetracycline susceptibilities could be attributed to changes in the deduced amino acid sequences of the tet(m) proteins.

TI  == oral streptococcal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mediates interaction  with porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae.
AB  == interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis with plaque-forming bacteria is necessary for its colonization in periodontal pockets. participation of streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and p. gingivalis fimbriae in this interaction has been reported. in this investigation, the contribution of various oral streptococcal gapdhs to interaction with p. gingivalis fimbriae was examined. streptococcal cell surface gapdh activity was measured by incubation of a constant number of streptococci with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and analysis for the conversion of nad+ to nadh based  on the absorbance at 340 nm. coaggregation activity was measured by a turbidimetric assay. cell surface gapdh activity was correlated with coaggregation activity (r = 0.854, p < 0.01) with spearman's rank correlation coefficient. s. oralis atcc 9811 and atcc 10557, streptococcus gordonii g9b, streptococcus sanguinis atcc 10556, and streptococcus parasanguinis atcc 15909 exhibited high cell surface gapdh activity and coaggregation activity; consequently, their cell surface gapdhs were extracted with mutanolysin and purified on a cibacron blue sepharose column. subsequently, their dna sequences were elucidated. purified gapdhs bound p. gingivalis recombinant fimbrillin by western blot assay, furthermore, their dna sequences displayed a high degree of homology with one another. moreover, s. oralis recombinant gapdh inhibited coaggregation between p. gingivalis and the aforementioned five streptococcal strains in a dose-dependent manner. these results suggest that gapdhs of various  plaque-forming streptococci may be involved in their attachment to p. gingivalis  fimbriae and that they may contribute to p. gingivalis colonization.

TI  == accuracy of phenotypic and genotypic testing for identification of streptococcus  pneumoniae and description of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae sp. nov.
AB  == we have identified an unusual group of viridans group streptococci that resemble  streptococcus pneumoniae. dna-dna homology studies suggested that a subset of these isolates represent a novel species that may be included in the s. oralis-s. mitis group of viridans group streptococci. we suggest that this novel species be termed streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. a combination of phenotypic and genetic reactions allows its identification. s. pseudopneumoniae strains do not have pneumococcal capsules, are resistant to optochin (inhibition zones, less than 14  mm) when they are incubated under an atmosphere of increased co2 but are susceptible to optochin (inhibition zones, >14 mm) when they are incubated in ambient atmospheres, are not soluble in bile, and are positive by the genprobe accuprobe pneumococcus test. the bile solubility test is more specific than the optochin test for identification of s. pneumoniae. genetic tests for pneumolysin  (ply) and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (soda) and identification tests with a commercial probe, accuprobe pneumococcus, do not discriminate between the new species and s. pneumoniae.

TI  == path-dependency of the interaction between coaggregating and between non-coaggregating oral bacterial pairs--a thermodynamic approach.
AB  == coaggregation, i.e. specific recognition between bacteria from different species, is a well-described phenomenon in the human oral cavity but remains physically poorly understood. with our study we aimed at elucidating some aspects of the mechanism of the coaggregation between the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis j22 and actinomyces naeslundii 147, in particular with respect to the driving force for coaggregation and its pathway-dependency. to that end, the macroscopic turbidity of the bacterial suspension, the morphology of the coaggregates, binding isotherms and heats of interaction were compared between the above-mentioned coaggregating bacterial pair and a non-coaggregating pair, streptococcus sanguis pk1889 and a. naeslundii 147. the coaggregating pair forms  large aggregates, which rapidly sediment from the suspension while the non-coaggregating pair forms only very small coaggregates that remain homogeneously suspended. coaggregation is further characterized by a high affinity between the partner cells that bind to each other in a strong cooperative mode. the interactions between both pairs occur under the release of  heat and are thus enthalpically favorable. more heat is released for the coaggregating than for the non-coaggregating pair. adding the coaggregating bacteria in steps to each other leads to saturation of enthalpically favorable binding sites. this is observed when the streptococcus is added to the actinomyces as well as when the addition is done the other way around. it is concluded that the cooperativity of the coaggregation process is based on an increase of entropy. it is furthermore shown that the density of the coaggregates as well as the heat effect of formation of these coaggregates depend on the number of steps in which the partner cells are added to each other. adding s. oralis j22 in three steps to a. naeslundii 147 results in the formation of denser coaggregates under the release of less heat, as compared to that of addition in one step. these differences point to a larger entropy increase when in a step-wise mixing the coaggregating bacteria are allowed to form more densely-packed coaggregates.

TI  == gram-positive mera gene in gram-negative oral and urine bacteria.
AB  == clinical mercury resistant (hg(r)) gram-negative bacteria carrying gram-positive  mercury reductase (mera)-like genes were characterized using dna-dna hybridization, pcr and sequencing. a pcr assay was developed which discriminated  between the mera genes related to staphylococcus and those related to the bacillus/streptococcus mera genes by the difference in size of the pcr product. dna sequence analysis correlated with the pcr assay. the mera genes from acinetobacter junii, enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli were sequenced and shared 98-99% identical nucleotide (nt) and 99.6-100% amino acid identity with the staphylococcus aureus mera protein. a fourth mera gene, from pantoeae agglomerans, was partially sequenced (60%) and had 99% identical nt and 100% amino acid identity with the streptococcus oralis mera protein. all the hg(r) gram-negative bacteria transferred their gram-positive mera genes to a gram-positive enterococcus faecalis recipient with the resulting transconjugants  expressing mercury resistance. these gram-positive mera genes join gram-positive  tetracycline resistance and gram-positive macrolide resistance genes in their association with mobile elements which are able to transfer and express in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == effect of hydrophobicity on in vitro streptococcal adhesion to dental alloys.
AB  == non-specific interactions such as electrostatic interactions, and surface free energy are of importance in bacterial adhesion to dental surfaces as they determine whether or not bacteria are attracted to the surface. the relationship  between adherence of streptococcus mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis and s. sanguinis on precious and non-precious dental alloys, and the bacterial and alloy surface hydrophobicities (a measure of the surface free energy) was studied. the number of adhering bacteria was determined by fluorescence microscopy counts. the hydrophobicity of the bacteria and alloy surfaces were evaluated by adhesion to hexadecane and water contact angles, respectively. our results showed that (i) the surfaces of the tested alloys were hydrophobic, (ii) s. sanguinis, s. mutans  and s. oralis were hydrophobic, and (iii) s. mitis was hydrophilic. s. oralis, the more hydrophobic strain, demonstrated the highest adherence on the tested materials, whereas s. mitis adhered least on the hydrophobic surfaces. for the tested alloys, bacterial adherence was highest for the high gold content alloy, and lowest for the non-precious alloy. our results showed that for the tested bacterial strains, there was a significant correlation between bacterial adhesion and substratum hydrophobicity: hydrophobic metal surfaces favor adhesion of hydrophobic bacteria.

TI  == changing incidence of detected streptococcal bacteraemia in north yorkshire, england.
AB  == background & objectives: streptococcal bacteraemia remains a major and challenging clinical problem throughout the world. the epidemiology of these infections appears to be changing. in the present study we analysed the data collected over a period of 20 yr (1978-1999) to throw light on this. methods: laboratory records of all patients yielding clinically significant, non-pneumococcal, nonenterococcal streptococcal bacteraemia were reviewed for the decades 1978-1988 and 1990-1999 in the two districts (combined population 260,000). results: from a total of 3134 patients with detected bacteraemia 338 (10.8%) yielded streptococci. the organisms comprised: in the beta-haemolytic group (n=169), gas (32%), gbs (34%), gcs (5%), ggs (28%), grs (1%); in the non-haemolytic/streptococcus milleri group (n=160): s. milleri (21%), s. bovis (10%), s. sanguis (30%), s.mitis (10%), s. oralis (8%) and other 'viridans' streptococci (20%); nine isolates were of anaerobic streptococci. there was a steady increase in the number of blood cultures submitted for investigation during the period and streptococcal isolations of all species rose in proportion  (approximately x 2.5) in the second decade compared with the first. complementary data on the occurrence of necrotising fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome in these districts suggested a real increase in the occurrence of serious forms of gas infection. interpretation & conclusion: an increase in the level of detected streptococcal bacteraemia was seen in this part of england over 20 yr, involving  a wide variety of different streptococcal species. this represented both improved ascertainment of infection and an increase in the burden of disease in the population.

AB  == intraoral bony defects can be filled with bony particles that are collected in a  titanium filter while drilling. the rinsing liquid is contaminated with blood and saliva which implies that the bony particles are also contaminated with bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine quantitatively and qualitatively the degree of this contamination. over a period of three months bony particles were collected from 50 patients undergoing surgery. the bony particles were scraped off the filter, resuspended and incubated aerobically and anaerobically on human  blood agar media. colony forming units (cfu) were determined as well as the most  common species of bacteria. all samples showed anaerobic and aerobic growth. after anaerobic incubation in 44 samples the number of bacteria was higher (38) or equal (six) to that after aerobic incubation. on average 435,000 cfu (aerobic) and 1,013,000 cfu (anaerobic) per sample were found. the most frequently identified bacteria belonged to veillonella spp. in the anaerobic and to streptococcus oralis in the aerobic cultures. in 43 samples black pigmented colonies were detected. there were only bacteria identified which are common in the oral cavity.

AB  == the feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna (rdna) intergenic spacer (its) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (vs) was evaluated. the its regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of vs were amplified by pcr and sequenced. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis,  s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the its lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. the intraspecies similarity scores for the its sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for s. gordonii strains.  the interspecies similarity scores for the its sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. phylogenetic analysis of the its regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of vs is not parallel to that of the 16s rrna genes. one  hundred six clinical isolates of vs were identified by the rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux vitek, marcy l'etoile, france) and by its sequencing, and the  level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their its sequences. the accuracy of using its sequencing for identification of vs was verified by 16s rdna sequencing for all strains except strains of s. oralis and s. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16s rdna sequences. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by its sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of vs.

AB  == the contamination of dental unit water lines (duwl) is an emerging concern in dentistry. the aim of this study was to use an in vitro duwl to model microbial contamination and evaluate the decontamination efficacy of tetraacetylethylenediamine (taed) solutions. a duwl biofilm model used to simulate clinical conditions was used to generate a range of biofilms in duwl. three distinct biofilms were generated: (1) biofilm from water, (2) biofilm from  a mix of water + contaminating human commensal bacteria, (3) biofilm from water with contaminating oral bacteria added after biofilm formed. the contaminating oral species used were streptococcus oralis, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. decontamination by simple water flushing or flushing with  taed was evaluated (2, 5 and 10 min intervals). the duwl tubes were split and samples were plated onto a range of media, incubated and bacteria enumerated. water flushing did not reduce the number of microorganisms detected. bacteria were not detected from any of the taed sampling points for any of the biofilm types tested. interestingly, if contamination was introduced to new duwl along with the waterborne species a biofilm was formed containing only the waterborne species. if however, an existing biofilm was present before the introduction of "contaminating" bacteria then these could be detected in the biofilm. this implies that if the duwl are new or satisfactorily cleaned on a regular basis then the associated cross-contamination aspects are reduced. in conclusion, taed  provides effective control for duwl biofilms.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == inhibitory effects of cranberry juice on attachment of oral streptococci and biofilm formation.
AB  == cranberry juice is known to inhibit bacterial adhesion. we examined the inhibitory effect of cranberry juice on the adhesion of oral streptococci strains labeled with [3h]-thymidine to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads (s-ha). when the bacterial cells were momentarily exposed to cranberry juice, their adherence  to s-ha decreased significantly compared with the control (p < 0.01). their hydrophobicity also decreased dependently with the concentration of cranberry juice. we also evaluated the inhibitory effect of cranberry juice on biofilm formation. by using a microplate system, we found that the high molecular mass constituents of cranberry juice inhibited the biofilm formation of the tested streptococci. the inhibitory activity was related to the reduction of the hydrophobicity. the present findings suggest that cranberry juice component(s) can inhibit colonization by oral streptococci to the tooth surface and can thus slow development of dental plaque.

TI  == pcr detection and identification of oral streptococci in saliva samples using gtf genes.
AB  == oral streptococci are major constituents of dental plaque, and their prevalence is implicated in various pathologies. therefore, accurate identification of oral  streptococci would be valuable for studies of cariogenic plaque and for diagnostic use in infective endocarditis. many oral streptococci possess glucosyltransferase enzymes that synthesize glucan, which is an obligate component of dental plaque. we established a rapid and precise method to identify oral streptococci by pcr using the species-specific region from the glucosyltransferase gene. with the species-specific primers, streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, s. oralis, and s. gordonii could be successfully distinguished. further, we developed a simple method to extract the bacterial dna from saliva. using the resultant dna as a template, the proposed pcr detection was performed. their distribution was in accord with results of conventional biochemical tests. these findings indicate that the present pcr method is useful for the analysis of oral streptococci and can be successfully used in clinical applications to identify pathogenic bacteria associated with oral infectious disease and/or endocarditis.

TI  == glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of streptococcus oralis functions as a coadhesin for porphyromonas gingivalis major fimbriae.
AB  == cohesive interactions between porphyromonas gingivalis and plaque-forming bacteria, such as streptococcus oralis, are considered to play an important role  in the colonization of p. gingivalis in periodontal sites. although p. gingivalis fimbriae have been reported to mediate coaggregation with s. oralis, the s. oralis molecule involved has not been identified. we identified the coadhesin of  s. oralis atcc 9811 and purified it by affinity column chromatography. we found that the molecular mass of the purified protein was approximately 40 kda. dot blot and western blot assays showed binding of the 40-kda protein to p. gingivalis fimbriae. further, turbidimetric assays showed that the coadhesin inhibited coaggregation between p. gingivalis and s. oralis in a dose-dependent manner. analyses of the amino-terminal sequences of the protein and its lysyl endopeptidase-cleaved fragments revealed that the coadhesin was identical to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh). next, we cloned the gene that encodes s. oralis gapdh and found that the sequence had a high degree of homology with the sequences of gapdhs of various bacteria, including streptococcus gordonii and fusobacterium nucleatum. to confirm the contribution of s. oralis gapdh to the interaction with p. gingivalis, a recombinant gapdh protein was generated in escherichia coli; this protein bound to p. gingivalis fimbriae and had an inhibitory effect on coaggregation. these results suggest that s. oralis gapdh functions as a coadhesin for p. gingivalis fimbriae. in addition, considering the high degree of homology of the gapdhs of various bacteria, those  of other plaque-forming bacteria also may contribute to the colonization of p. gingivalis.

AB  == the development and clinical evaluation of a lightcycler pcr assay, including an  internal process control (ipc), to detect the streptococcus pneumoniae autolysin  gene in clinical samples is reported. the assay was developed to provide a second target for use in conjunction with existing pneumolysin pcr assays to increase the reliability of non-culture pcr diagnosis of pneumococcal infection. primers amplify a 173 bp fragment of the autolysin gene (lyta), which is detected by fluorescence-labelled hybridization probes. an ipc was designed to check for the  presence of pcr inhibitors and loss of assay sensitivity. the ipc product was amplified by the lyta primers and detected by a second set of hybridization probes. the analytical specificity of the autolysin pcr assay was 100% against 39 other bacterial species tested; these included related streptococci and other organisms. the assay, which could reliably detect 50 fg purified pneumococcal dna per reaction, was capable of distinguishing between s. pneumoniae and atypical streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis strains known to contain the lyta gene. using dna extracts from a panel of edta bloods from patients with blood-culture-confirmed pneumococcal infection, the autolysin pcr had a sensitivity of 42.9%, which was similar to a previously reported taqman pneumolysin pcr (43.8%) run in parallel. total agreement was shown between the autolysin assay and the pneumolysin taqman assay when used to test 23 culture-negative clinical samples, of which eight were positive by pcr, adding valuable clinical information. a specific autolysin-based lightcycler assay has been developed to complement pneumolysin pcr for the detection of s. pneumoniae in clinical samples. this should be a particularly useful tool for the rapid and  sensitive diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis, even after an antibiotic has been administered. however, poor sensitivity on blood samples limits its usefulness in other bacteraemic infections.

AB  == this study compared removal of pairs of co-adhering and non-co-adhering oral actinomyces and streptococci from salivary pellicles by manual, rotating/oscillating electric and sonic toothbrushes, applying weights up to 240  g. first, actinomyces were allowed to adhere to a pellicle in a parallel plate flow chamber, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were perfused through  the chamber at 33 degrees c. on average, 34-39% of the adhering bacteria were adhering as single organisms. for co-adhering and non-co-adhering pairs, 33 and 10% of the adhering bacteria were involved, respectively, in aggregates comprising more than 10 organisms. brushing by hand removed 82% at low weight (40 g), which was less than by electric (93%) or sonic (92%) brushing, while for all  modes of brushing bacterial removal increased with increasing weight to 95-99%. for a non-co-adhering pair, subsequent exposure of brushed pellicles to a streptococcal suspension yielded only 2-16% of bacteria involved in large aggregates, regardless of the mode of brushing. for the co-adhering pair, however, de novo streptococcal adhesion to hand-brushed pellicles yielded 34-57%  of bacteria involved in large aggregates, while electric and sonic brushing left  22-35% of the bacteria involved in large aggregates. de novo streptococcal adhesion for the co-adhering pair increased with increasing weight for the electric and sonic brush in contrast to the manual brush. since a strong influence of co-adhesion is evident in de novo streptococcal adhesion, despite nearly complete removal of all actinomyces, these observations suggest that the three modes of brushing leave footprints to which streptococci preferentially adhere.

AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

TI  == multiplex fish analysis of a six-species bacterial biofilm.
AB  == established procedures use different and seemingly incompatible experimental protocols for fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) with gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. the aim of this study was to develop a procedure, based on fish and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm), for the analysis of the spatial organization of in vitro biofilms containing both gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria. biofilms composed of the six oral species actinomyces naeslundii, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus  oralis, streptococcus sobrinus, and veillonella dispar were grown anaerobically for 64.5 h at 37 degrees c on hydroxyapatite disks preconditioned with saliva. conditions for the simultaneous in situ hybridization of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were sought by systematic variation of fixation and exposure to lysozyme. after fixation and permeabilization biofilms were labeled by fish with 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes ana103 (for the detection of a. naeslundii), euk116 (c. albicans), fus664 (f. nucleatum), mit447 and mit588 (s. oralis), sob174 (s. sobrinus), and vei217 (v. dispar). probes were used as 6-fam, cy3 or cy5 conjugates, resulting in green, orange-red or deep-red fluorescence of target cells, respectively. thus, with two independent triple-hybridizations with three probes carrying different fluorescence-tags, all six species could be visualized. results show that the simultaneous investigation by fish of complex biofilms composed of multiple bacterial species with differential gram-staining properties is possible. in combination with the optical sectioning properties of clsm the technique holds great promise for the analysis of spatial alterations in biofilm composition in response to environmental challenges.

TI  == denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography detection of ribosomal mutations conferring macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  == mutations in genes coding for l4 (rpld) or l22 (rplv) ribosomal proteins or in 23s rrna (rrl gene) are reported as a cause of macrolide resistance in streptococci and staphylococci. this study was aimed at evaluating a denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) technique as a rapid mutation screening method. portions of these genes were amplified by pcr from total dna of 48 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 16),  streptococcus pyogenes (n = 6), streptococcus oralis (n = 2), and group g streptococcus (n = 2). thirty-seven of these strains were resistant to macrolides and harbored one or several mutations in one or two of the target genes, and 11 were susceptible. pcr products were analyzed by dhplc. all mutations were detected, except a point mutation in a pneumococcal rpld gene. the method detected one mutated rrl copy out of six in s. aureus. this automated method is promising for screening of mutations involved in macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci.

TI  == efficacy of garenoxacin in treatment of experimental endocarditis due to staphylococcus aureus or viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the activity of garenoxacin was investigated in rats with experimental endocarditis due to staphylococci and viridans group streptococci (vgs). the staphylococci tested comprised one ciprofloxacin-susceptible and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) isolate (isolate 1112), one  ciprofloxacin-susceptible but methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) isolate (isolate p8), and one ciprofloxacin-resistant mutant (grla) of p8 (isolate p8-4). the vgs tested comprised one penicillin-susceptible isolate and one penicillin-resistant isolate (streptococcus oralis 226 and streptococcus mitis 531, respectively). to simulate the kinetics of drugs in humans, rats were infused intravenously with garenoxacin every 24 h (peak and trough levels in serum, 6.1 and 1.0 mg/liter, respectively; area under the concentration-time curve [auc], 63.4 mg. h/liter) or levofloxacin every 12 h (peak and trough levels in serum, 7.3 and 1.5 mg/liter, respectively; auc, 55.6 mg. h/liter) for 3 or 5 days. flucloxacillin, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone were used as control drugs. garenoxacin, levofloxacin, flucloxacillin, and vancomycin sterilized >/=70% of the vegetations infected with both ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylococcal isolates (p < 0.05 versus the results for the controls). garenoxacin and vancomycin also sterilized 70% of the vegetations infected with ciprofloxacin-resistant mrsa isolate p8-4, whereas treatment with levofloxacin failed against this organism (cure rate, 0%; p < 0.05 versus the results obtained with the comparator drugs). garenoxacin did not select for resistant derivatives  in vivo. in contrast, levofloxacin selected for resistant variants in four of six rats infected with mrsa isolate p8-4. garenoxacin sterilized 90% of the vegetations infected with both penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant isolates of vgs. levofloxacin sterilized only 22 and 40% of the vegetations infected with penicillin-susceptible s. oralis 226 and penicillin-resistant s. mitis 531, respectively. ceftriaxone sterilized only 40% of those infected with penicillin-resistant s. mitis 531 (p < 0.05 versus the results obtained with garenoxacin). no quinolone-resistant vgs were detected. in all the experiments successful quinolone treatment was predicted by specific pharmacodynamic criteria (d. r. andes and w. a. craig, clin. infect. dis. 27:47-50, 1998). the fact that the activity of garenoxacin was equal or superior to those of the standard comparators against staphylococci and vgs indicates that it is a potential alternative for the treatment of infections caused by such bacteria.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of the mechanisms of macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin resistance in viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the presence of erm genes conferring constitutive and inducible resistance, as well as that of the mefa gene conferring only constitutive resistance, was investigated using pcr in 70 erythromycin resistant (mic>or=1 mg/l) strains of viridans group streptococci (vgs) (18 streptococcus mitis biotype 1, 16 s. mitis  biotype 2, 15 s. oralis, 12 s. salivarius and nine s. sanguis) isolated from the  oropharynx of healthy greek children. all of the 56 isolates belonging to resistance phenotype m harbored the mefa gene. all of the 14 isolates constitutively resistant to macrolides and lincosamides (phenotype cr) harbored the ermb gene. co-presence of both genes was not observed, whereas class a erm gene (previously known as ermtr) was not detected. our results are consistent with a possible role of vgs as a reservoir of resistance genes now prevalent in pathogenic species of streptococci.

TI  == non-contact removal of coadhering and non-coadhering bacterial pairs from pellicle surfaces by sonic brushing and de novo adhesion.
AB  == coadhesion between oral microbial pairs is an established factor in the spatiotemporal development and prevalence of mixed-species communities in early dental plaque in vivo. this study compares removal and de novo adhesion of pairs  of coadhering and non-coadhering oral actinomyces and streptococci by sonic brushing on salivary pellicles in a non-contact mode as a function of the distance between the brush and the pellicle surface in vitro. first, actinomycetes were adhered to a pellicle surface, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were allowed to adhere. removal was examined by non-contact,  sonic brushing with a wetted brush on a either a wetted or a substratum immersed  to a depth of 7 mm. after brushing, de novo adhesion of streptococci to brushed pellicles was studied. for coadhering and non-coadhering pairs, 34% and 9%, respectively, of the adhering bacteria were involved in aggregates comprising more than 10 organisms. non-contact, sonic brushing removed up to 99% of the adhering bacteria, regardless of the state of immersion of the substratum. bacterial removal decreased with increasing distance of up to 6 mm between brush  and pellicle surface. for the non-coadhering pair, subsequent exposure of pellicles to a streptococcal suspension yielded about 6% of bacteria involved in  large aggregates. alternatively, de novo adhesion of the coadhering streptococcal strain to pellicles brushed on the wetted substratum yielded 31% of bacteria involved in large aggregates, but after brushing the immersed substratum only 12% of the adhering bacteria were found in large aggregates. it is concluded that non-contact sonic brushing, under immersion, removes high percentage of adhering  bacterial pairs up to a distance of 6 mm between the brush and the pellicle surface. however, non-contact, sonic brushing with only a thin wet film on the substratum may leave footprints to which streptococci preferentially adhere.

TI  == viridans streptococcus bacteremia in children on chemotherapy for cancer: an underestimated problem.
AB  == the authors discuss the morbidity associated with viridans streptococcus bacteremia, and its implications on the choice of antibiotics used as prophylaxis and treatment. they retrospectively studied the case notes of 38 children who were being treated for various malignant conditions in their unit and developed 40 episodes of bacteremia with viridans streptococci between october 1995 and january 1999. viridans streptococci were the third commonest blood culture isolate during this period, after coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus. the majority of the isolates were streptococcus mitis (55%). others were s. sanguis (25%), s. oralis (12.5%), s. salivarius (5%), and s. acidominimus (2.5%). twenty-five percent of the patients had been treated with regimens that included cytosine arabinoside, 60% were receiving prophylactic co-trimoxazole, and 87.5% were neutropenic. thirty percent of patients had abnormal chest x-rays, and 15% were hypotensive; 2 patients required admission to the intensive care unit. initial antibiotic therapy was changed because of failure of clinical response in 60% of cases, despite the infecting organism being sensitive in vitro. this study confirms the importance of viridans streptococci as a cause of bacteremia in pediatric hematology and oncology patients, leading to significant morbidity. further work is required to establish the optimal treatment for viridans streptococcus bacteremia.

TI  == effect of the environment on genotypic diversity of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis in the oral biofilm.
AB  == the genotypic diversity of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (424 isolates) and streptococcus oralis (446 isolates) strains isolated from two sound approximal sites in all subjects who were either caries active (seven subjects) or caries free (seven subjects) was investigated by using the repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr. the plaque from the caries-active subjects harbored significantly greater proportions of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and a smaller proportion of a. naeslundii organisms than the plaque sampled from the caries-free subjects. these data confirmed that the sites of the two groups of subjects were subjected to different environmental stresses, probably determined  by the prevailing or fluctuating acidic ph values. we tested the hypothesis that  the microfloras of the sites subjected to greater stresses (the plaque samples from the caries-active subjects) would exhibit reduced genotypic diversity since  the sites would be less favorable. we found that the diversity of a. naeslundii strains did not change (chi2 = 0.68; p = 0.41) although the proportional representation of a. naeslundii was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). conversely, the diversity of the s. oralis strains increased (chi2 = 11.71; p = 0.0006) and the proportional representation of s. oralis did not change. we propose that under these environmental conditions the diversity and number of niches within the oral biofilm that could be exploited by s. oralis increased, resulting in the increased genotypic diversity of this species. apparently, a. naeslundii was not  able to exploit the new niches since the prevailing conditions within the niches  may have been deleterious and not supportive of its proliferation. these results  suggest that environmental stress may modify a biofilm such that the diversity of the niches is increased and that these niches may be successfully exploited by some, but not necessarily all, members of the microbial community.

TI  == in vitro activities of garenoxacin (bms-284756) against streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis compared to those of six other quinolones.
AB  == the activity of garenoxacin, a new quinolone, was determined in comparison with other quinolones against different strains of s. pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci (vgs), and enterococcus faecalis. strains were quinolone-susceptible clinical isolates and quinolone-resistant strains with defined mechanisms of resistance obtained from either clinical isolates or derivatives of s. pneumoniae r6. clinical quinolone-susceptible strains of s. pneumoniae, vgs and e. faecalis  showed garenoxacin mics within a range of 0.03 microg/ml to 0.25 micro g/ml. garenoxacin mics increased two- to eightfold when one mutation was present in the parc quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr), fourfold when one mutation was present in the gyra qrdr (s. pneumoniae), 8- to 64-fold when two or three mutations were associated in parc and gyra qrdr, and 2,048-fold when two mutations were present in both the gyra and parc qrdrs (streptococcus pneumoniae). increased active efflux had a moderate effect on garenoxacin mics for s. pneumoniae and vgs. against s. pneumoniae, garenoxacin behaved like moxifloxacin and sparfloxacin, being more affected by a single gyra mutation than by a single parc mutation. although garenoxacin was generally two- to fourfold more active than moxifloxacin against the different wild-type or mutant strains of s. pneumoniae, vgs, and e. faecalis, it was two- to fourfold less active than  gemifloxacin. at four times the respective mic for each strain, the bactericidal  effect of garenoxacin, observed at 6 h for s. pneumoniae and at 24 h for s. oralis and e. faecalis, was not influenced by the presence of mutation either in  the parc or in both the parc and gyra qrdrs.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == quantitative evaluation of bacteria adherent to polyelectrolyte hema-based hydrogels.
AB  == the use of adhesive poly(hema)-based hydrogels is standard practice in dental restorative procedures. microorganisms, which potentially can cause oral pathologies, may colonize these polymers. in the present work, bacterial adhesion to polymers prepared with 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (hema) and to different molar ratios of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane-sulfonic acid (amps) and/or to 2-methacryloyloxyethyl-tri-methyl-ammonium chloride (metac) co-monomers were tested. a colorimetric assay system that utilizes the microbo revelation medium (microbo srl, rome, italy) for microbial counts is shown to be capable of counting the number of adherent bacterial cells without removing them from polymer surfaces. in conditions that mimic those present in the oral cavity, similar bacterial adhesion percentages on the same polymer were observed with the different bacteria belonging to both gram-positive and gram-negative genera, such as streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus oralis (resident microorganisms in the oral cavity) and staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (transient microorganisms in the oral cavity). it is determined that the physico-chemical characteristics of poly(hema)-based hydrogels are the major  factors promoting bacterial adhesion, which increased with increasing water content in the swollen polymers, reaching maximal values on the cationic polymers.

TI  == enthalpy of interaction between coaggregating and non-coaggregating oral bacterial pairs--a microcalorimetric study.
AB  == bacterial adhesion and coaggregation are involved in the development of oral biofilms, called dental plaque. although various techniques have already been used to study different aspects of these bacterial interactions, microcalorimetry has not yet been applied. this paper describes how isothermal reaction calorimetry can be employed to determine the enthalpy of coaggregation between two oral bacterial pairs. for most biological processes, the enthalpy tends to reach a minimum value, reflecting the most stable state, which is directly related to the heat content of the system. the calorimeter consists of four measuring units where reaction ampoules are filled with 1.5 ml of an actinomyces  naeslundii 147 suspension, while reference ampoules are filled with buffer only.  after equilibration at 25 degrees c, 80 microl of a streptococcal suspension was  titrated into the reaction ampoules. to study possible saturation of the binding  sites on the actinomyces surface, three consecutive injections with streptococcal suspensions were done. following each injection, a 20-microl aliquot was taken from the ampoule kept outside the calorimeter and the number of free (s(f)) and bound (s(b)) streptococci was determined microscopically. experiments were carried out with a coaggregating streptococcal strain (streptococcus oralis j22)  and a non-coaggregating strain (streptococcus sanguis pk1889), serving as a control. the coaggregation enthalpy was exothermic, that is, heat was released in the reaction ampoule upon coaggregation and the heat released by the coaggregating pair minus the heat released by the non-coaggregating pair yielded  a coaggregation enthalpy of -0.015 x 10(-6) mj/bound streptococcus for the first  injection. upon consecutive injections, the coaggregation enthalpy decreased to -0.0004 x 10(-6) mj/bound streptococcus. comparison with enthalpy changes reported for lectin-carbohydrate binding suggests that a huge number of binding sites are involved in the formation of one bacterial coaggregate.

TI  == effect of acidic ph on expression of surface-associated proteins of streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis, a member of the mitis group of oral streptococci, is implicated in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and is the predominant aciduric non-mutans-group streptococcus in dental plaque. we undertook to identify the most abundant surface-associated proteins of s. oralis and to investigate changes in protein expression when the organism was grown under acidic culture conditions. surface-associated proteins were extracted from cells  grown in batch culture, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption  ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. putative functions were assigned by homology to a translated genomic database of streptococcus pneumoniae. a total of 27 proteins were identified; these included a lipoprotein, a ribosome recycling factor, and the glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enolase. the most abundant protein, phosphocarrier protein hpr, was present as three isoforms. neither lactate dehydrogenase nor pyruvate oxidase, dominant intracellular proteins, were present among the proteins on the gels, demonstrating that proteins in the surface-associated pool did not arise as a result of cell lysis. eleven of the proteins identified were differentially expressed when cells were grown at ph 5.2 versus ph 7.0, and these included superoxide dismutase, a homologue of dipeptidase v from lactococcus lactis, and the protein translation elongation factors g, tu, and ts. this study has extended the range of streptococcal proteins known to be expressed at the cell surface. further investigations are required to ascertain their functions at this extracellular location and determine how their expression is influenced by other environmental conditions.

TI  == identification of streptococcus sanguinis with a pcr-generated species-specific dna probe.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to design a pcr-generated dna probe and determine the specificity of the probe for the identification of clinical isolates of streptococcus sanguinis. to do this, we examined over 200 arbitrarily primed pcr (ap-pcr) amplicon patterns obtained with dna from clinical isolates of s. sanguinis. a 1.6-kb dna amplicon that was common to all ap-pcr profiles was extracted from agarose gels and then cloned and sequenced. a search for a similar sequence in the genbank database with the blastn program revealed that the 1.6-kb dna fragment comprised an intergenic region between two housekeeping genes, uncc  (proton-translocating atpase) and mura (udp-n-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase). three digoxigenin-labeled dna probes were synthesized on the basis  of the sequence of the 1.6-kb fragment: the sequence of probe ssa-1 contained the proton-translocating atpase (uncc) and the entire intergenic region, the sequence of probe ssa-2 contained only the intergenic region, and the sequence of probe ssa-3 contained an internal region of the mura gene. dot blot hybridization showed that the three probes displayed signals for hybridization to both s. sanguinis strain atcc 10556 and the s. sanguinis clinical isolates. probe ssa-1,  however, hybridized to dna from s. oralis and s. mitis. probe ssa-3 hybridized to dna from s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, and s. vestibularis. the probe ssa-2-specific intergenic region appeared to be specific for s. sanguinis. the results from this study suggest that probe ssa-2 may serve as a species-specific dna probe for the identification of clinical isolates of s. sanguinis.

AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == viridans group streptococci are donors in horizontal transfer of topoisomerase iv genes to streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 46 ciprofloxacin-resistant (cip(r)) streptococcus pneumoniae strains were isolated from 1991 to 2001 at the hospital of bellvitge. five of these strains showed unexpectedly high rates of nucleotide variations in the quinolone  resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of their parc, pare, and gyra genes. the nucleotide sequence of the full-length parc, pare, and gyra genes of one of these isolates revealed a mosaic structure compatible with an interspecific recombination origin. southern blot analysis and nucleotide sequence determinations showed the presence of an ant-like gene in the intergenic pare-parc regions of the s. pneumoniae cip(r) isolates with high rates of variations in their pare and parc qrdrs. the ant-like gene was absent from typical s. pneumoniae strains, whereas it was present in the intergenic pare-parc regions of the viridans group streptococci (streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis). these results suggest that the viridans group streptococci are acting as donors in the horizontal transfer of fluoroquinolone resistance genes to s. pneumoniae.

AB  == chronic maxillary sinusitis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the role of microbial infection remains undefined. bacteria have been isolated from chronically inflamed sinuses; however, their role in the chronicity of inflammation is unknown. the objective of this study was to determine whether bacteria are present in clinical samples from chronic maxillary sinusitis and to  assess the diversity of the flora present. washes and/or tissue samples from endoscopic sinus surgery on 11 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis were subjected to pcr amplification of bacterial 16s rdna using three universal primer pairs, followed by cloning and sequencing. the samples were also assessed for the presence of bacteria and fungi by conventional culture methods. viable bacteria and/or bacterial 16s rdna were detected from maxillary sinus samples of five of the 11 patients examined (45 %). three sinus samples were positive by both pcr and culture methods, one was positive only by pcr, and one only by culture. thirteen bacterial species were identified: abiotrophia defectiva, enterococcus avium, eubacterium sp., granulicatella elegans, neisseria sp., prevotella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sp. fungi were not detected. in one  patient streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis, and in another patient pseudomonas aeruginosa, were detected from both the sinus and the oral cavity using species-specific pcr primers. these results suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be detected in nearly half of chronic maxillary sinusitis  cases.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.

AB  == background: the oxazolidinone class of antimicrobials has demonstrated remarkable activity against gram-positive cocci. linezolid has proven to be a first-line therapeutic option for vancomycin-resistant strains. linezolid clinical trial results and subsequent published case reports cite rare resistance emerging in patients receiving prolonged therapy. objective: to report the initial linezolid-resistant organisms from cases obtained through the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, after screening >40,000 gram-positive cocci without resistance between 1998 and 2000. methods: during 2001-2002, 8 resistant  strains (from 8 different patients) located in 6 states from 7 different participating sentry institutions in the us were identified among bloodstream, respiratory, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infection isolates of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus oralis. resistance was detected by reference broth microdilution methods and confirmed by identical results using etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and the standardized disk diffusion method. results: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and disk diffusion tests showed elevated mics (> or =8 microg/ml) and small inhibitory zone diameters (< or =15 mm) for all strains to both linezolid and the investigational oxazolidinone azd2563. vancomycin resistance was detected in 2 of the 8 linezolid-resistant strains. all enterococci and the viridans-group streptococcus (s. oralis) strain showed resistance to erythromycin. e. faecium strains were resistant to penicillins, but susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. only 3 of the patients had previously received the drug. conclusions: linezolid resistance remains rare, with only 8 isolates among 9833 (0.08%) monitored isolates identified between january 1, 2001, and june 30, 2002. resistance, however, was no longer limited to enterococci. clinical laboratories should test linezolid more widely to detect emerging resistance, especially for patients receiving oxazolidinone therapy. longitudinal surveillance programs are warranted to detect a trend in the development of resistance, determine the molecular mechanism of resistance, and recommend alternative therapies or epidemiologic interventions.

TI  == glucan-binding proteins of the oral streptococci.
AB  == the synthesis of extracellular glucan is an integral component of the sucrose-dependent colonization of tooth surfaces by species of the mutans streptococci. in investigators' attempts to understand the mechanisms of plaque biofilm development, several glucan-binding proteins (gbps) have been discovered. some of these, the glucosyltransferases, catalyze the synthesis of glucan, whereas others, designated only as glucan-binding proteins, have affinities for different forms of glucan and contribute to aspects of the biology of their host  organisms. the functions of these latter glucan-binding proteins include dextran-dependent aggregation, dextranase inhibition, plaque cohesion, and perhaps cell wall synthesis. in some instances, their glucan-binding domains share common features, whereas in others the mechanism for glucan binding remains unknown. recent studies indicate that at least some of the glucan-binding proteins modulate virulence and some can act as protective immunogens within animal models. overall, the multiplicity of gbps and their aforementioned properties are testimonies to their importance. future studies will greatly advance the understanding of the distribution, function, and regulation of the gbps and place into perspective the facets of their contributions to the biology  of the oral streptococci.

TI  == coaggregation-mediated interactions of streptococci and actinomyces detected in initial human dental plaque.
AB  == streptococci and actinomyces that initiate colonization of the tooth surface frequently coaggregate with each other as well as with other oral bacteria. these observations have led to the hypothesis that interbacterial adhesion influences spatiotemporal development of plaque. to assess the role of such interactions in  oral biofilm formation in vivo, antibodies directed against bacterial surface components that mediate coaggregation interactions were used as direct immunofluorescent probes in conjunction with laser confocal microscopy to determine the distribution and spatial arrangement of bacteria within intact human plaque formed on retrievable enamel chips. in intrageneric coaggregation, streptococci such as streptococcus gordonii dl1 recognize receptor polysaccharides (rps) borne on other streptococci such as streptococcus oralis 34. to define potentially interactive subsets of streptococci in the developing plaque, an antibody against rps (anti-rps) was used together with an antibody against s. gordonii dl1 (anti-dl1). these antibodies reacted primarily with single cells in 4-h-old plaque and with mixed-species microcolonies in 8-h-old plaque. anti-rps-reactive bacteria frequently formed microcolonies with anti-dl1-reactive bacteria and with other bacteria distinguished by general nucleic acid stains. in intergeneric coaggregation between streptococci and actinomyces, type 2 fimbriae of actinomyces recognize rps on the streptococci. cells reactive with antibody against type 2 fimbriae of actinomyces naeslundii t14v (anti-type-2) were much less frequent than either subset of streptococci. however, bacteria reactive with anti-type-2 were seen in intimate association with anti-rps-reactive cells. these results are the first direct demonstration of coaggregation-mediated interactions during initial plaque accumulation in vivo. further, these results demonstrate the spatiotemporal development and prevalence  of mixed-species communities in early dental plaque.

TI  == classification of oral streptococci by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with direct activity stain for glycosyltransferases.
AB  == thirty eight strains of oral streptococci were divided into six types by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de) followed by glycosyltransferase (glt)  activity stain: type 1, streptococcus mutans; type 2, streptococcus rattus; type  3, streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus downei; type 4, streptococcus cricetus; type 5, streptococcus salivarius; and type 6, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii. in types 1, 2 and 5, two glucosyltransferases synthesizing water-insoluble (gtf-i) and water-soluble glucans (gtf-s) and a fructosyltransferase (ftf) were detected. in types 3 and 4, gtf-i and two gtf-ss were detected. only one gtf-s was detected in type 6. the 2-de patterns for these six types were clearly distinguished from each other based on the kind, number and location of glts in gel.

TI  == the antibacterial properties of solid supported liposomes on streptococcus oralis biofilms.
AB  == a novel system for the delivery of drugs to bacterial biofilms has been developed. the system is based on the use of anionic and cationic liposomes as drug carriers adsorbed on the surface of zinc citrate particles. the adsorption process results in the formation of solid supported vesicles (ssvs) which aids the stabilisation of the liposomes. anionic liposomes have been prepared by incorporation of phosphatidylinositol (pi) into dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (dppc) liposomes and cationic liposomes have been prepared by incorporation of dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide (ddab) into dppc plus cholesterol liposomes.  the liposomes were adsorbed onto zinc citrate particle and targeted to immobilised biofilms of the oral bacterium streptococcus oralis. the liposomes were used to carry the bactericides, triclosan, a lipid-soluble agent, and the aqueous-soluble penicillin-g, and their ability to inhibit bacterial growth from  immobilised biofilms was accessed. zinc citrate is itself a bactericide and is used in the formulation of toothpastes. the ssvs carrying the drugs have therapeutic properties. to trace the origin of these properties, each component of the ssv was investigated alone and in combination in binary systems. some combinations showed synergistic (or additive) antibacterial effects while others  showed regressive effects compared with their components.

TI  == invasion and killing of human endothelial cells by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == colonization of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci can result in infective endocarditis and possibly atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. we investigated the ability of  selected oral streptococci to infect monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) in 50% human plasma and to produce cytotoxicity. planktonic streptococcus gordonii ch1 killed huvec over a 5-h period by peroxidogenesis (alpha-hemolysin) and by acidogenesis but not by production of protein exotoxins. huvec were protected fully by addition of supplemental buffers and bovine liver catalase to the culture medium. streptococci were also found to  invade huvec by an endocytic mechanism that was dependent on polymerization of actin microfilaments and on a functional cytoskeleton, as indicated by inhibition with cytochalasin d and nocodazole. electron microscopy revealed streptococci attached to huvec surfaces via numerous fibrillar structures and bacteria in membrane-encased cytoplasmic vacuoles. following invasion by s. gordonii ch1, huvec monolayers showed 63% cell lysis over 4 h, releasing 64% of the total intracellular bacteria into the culture medium; however, the bacteria did not multiply during this time. the ability to invade huvec was exhibited by selected  strains of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. mutans, s. mitis, and s. oralis but only weakly by s. salivarius. comparison of isogenic pairs of s. gordonii revealed a requirement for several surface proteins for maximum host cell invasion: glucosyltransferase, the sialic acid-binding protein hsa, and the hydrophobicity/coaggregation proteins csha and cshb. deletion of genes for the antigen i/ii adhesins, sspa and sspb, did not affect invasion. we hypothesize that peroxidogenesis and invasion of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci are integral events in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and atherosclerosis.

TI  == quantitative detection of moraxella catarrhalis in nasopharyngeal secretions by real-time pcr.
AB  == the recognition of moraxella catarrhalis as an important cause of respiratory tract infections has been protracted, mainly because it is a frequent commensal organism of the upper respiratory tract and the diagnostic sensitivity of blood or pleural fluid culture is low. given that the amount of m. catarrhalis bacteria in the upper respiratory tract may change during infection, quantification of these bacteria in nasopharyngeal secretions (npss) by real-time pcr may offer a suitable diagnostic approach. using primers and a fluorescent probe specific for  the copb outer membrane protein gene, we detected dna from serial dilutions of m. catarrhalis cells corresponding to 1 to 10(6) cells. importantly, there was no difference in the amplification efficiency when the same dna was mixed with dna from npss devoid of m. catarrhalis. the specificity of the reaction was further confirmed by the lack of amplification of dnas from other moraxella species, nontypeable haemophilus influenzae, h. influenzae type b, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus pyogenes, bordetella pertussis, corynebacterium diphtheriae, and various neisseria species. the assay applied to  npss from 184 patients with respiratory tract infections performed with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of up to 98% compared to the culture results. the numbers of m. catarrhalis organisms detected by real-time pcr correlated with the numbers detected by semiquantitative culture. this real-time  pcr assay targeting the copb outer membrane protein gene provided a sensitive and reliable means for the rapid detection and quantification of m. catarrhalis in npss; may serve as a tool to study changes in the amounts of m. catarrhalis during lower respiratory tract infections or following vaccination against s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, or n. meningitidis; and may be applied to other clinical samples.

TI  == prevalence of csh-like fibrillar surface proteins among mitis group oral streptococci.
AB  == the prevalence of csh-like fibrillar surface proteins among oral streptococci was investigated by elisa and by immunoelectron microscopy using antiserum raised to  recombinant fragments of csha of streptococcus gordonii dl1. the majority of s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis strains tested elaborated short (ca. 50-80 nm long) surface fibrils and reacted with antiserum to the amino acid repeat region of csha, demonstrating the widespread nature of csh-like proteins among these species. in contrast, reactivity with antiserum raised to the adhesion-mediating non-repetitive region of csha was more restricted. on the basis of the elisa results, several isolates were selected for immunogold analysis using csha antisera. immunogold-negative staining showed a surface distribution of 10 nm gold particles consistent with antibody binding to  short fibrils. long fibrils (>150 nm long), where present, were not significantly labelled with gold. the results suggest that some of the short peritrichous fibrils on many mitis group streptococci comprise csh-like fibrillar protein. further, the data are consistent with our hypothesis that the antigenically conserved amino acid repeat region of csh-like proteins forms a scaffold for cell-distal presentation of the amino-terminal non-repetitive region that, at least in s. gordonii dl1, functions as an adhesin.

TI  == mass transport of macromolecules within an in vitro model of supragingival plaque.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the diffusion of macromolecules through an in vitro biofilm model of supragingival plaque. polyspecies biofilms containing actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sobrinus, veillonella dispar, and candida albicans were formed on sintered hydroxyapatite disks and then incubated at room temperature for defined  periods with fluorescent markers with molecular weights ranging from 3,000 to 900,000. subsequent examination by confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the mean square penetration depths for all tested macromolecules except immunoglobulin m increased linearly with time, diffusion coefficients being linearly proportional to the cube roots of the molecular weights of the probes (range, 10,000 to 240,000). compared to diffusion in bulk water, diffusion in the biofilms was markedly slower. the rate of diffusion for each probe appeared to be constant and not a function of biofilm depth. analysis of diffusion phenomena through the biofilms suggested tortuosity as the most probable explanation for retarded diffusion. selective binding of probes to receptors present in the biofilms could not explain the observed extent of retardation of diffusion. these results are relevant to oral health, as selective attenuated diffusion of fermentable carbohydrates and acids produced within dental plaque is thought to be essential for the development of carious lesions.

TI  == amino acid sequence requirements in the hinge of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) for cleavage by streptococcal iga1 proteases.
AB  == the amino acid sequence requirements in the hinge of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) for cleavage by iga1 proteases of different species of streptococcus were  investigated. recombinant iga1 antibodies were generated with point mutations at  proline 227 and threonine 228, the residues lying on either side of the peptide bond at which all streptococcal iga1 proteases cleave wild-type human iga1. the amino acid substitutions produced no major effect upon the structure of the mutant iga1 antibodies or their functional ability to bind to fcalpha receptors.  however, the substitutions had a substantial effect upon sensitivity to cleavage  with some streptococcal iga1 proteases, with, in some cases, a single point mutation rendering the antibody resistant to a particular iga1 protease. this effect was least marked with the iga1 protease from streptococcus pneumoniae, which showed no absolute requirement for either proline or threonine at residues  227 to 228. by contrast, the iga1 proteases of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis had an absolute requirement for proline at 227 but not for threonine at 228, which could be replaced by valine. there was evidence in s. mitis that proteases from different strains may have different amino acid requirements for cleavage. remarkably, some streptococcal proteases appeared able to cleave the hinge at a distant alternative site if substitution prevented efficient cleavage of the original site. hence, this study has identified key residues required for the recognition of the iga1 hinge as a substrate by streptococcal iga1 proteases, and it marks a preliminary step towards development of specific enzyme inhibitors.

TI  == influence of dentifrices and dietary components in saliva on wettability of pellicle-coated enamel in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == in vitro salivary pellicles were found to be less hydrophobic by water contact angles than clinically formed pellicles. in this study, water contact angles were measured on enamel coated with pellicles adsorbed from reconstituted human whole  saliva (rhws) and after exposure to dentifrices or dietary components. in addition, adhesion of streptococcus oralis j22 to pellicles formed from rhws with minor amounts of milk added and after exposure to dentifrices was studied. exposure of rhws-pellicles to milk or salad oil yielded an increase in the hydrophobicity of in vitro pellicles to values observed in vivo, but a decrease was seen after exposure to a sugar solution. pellicles formed from saliva with 0.4% milk added attracted less s. oralis cells than pellicles formed in the absence of milk components. exposure of pellicles formed from saliva with milk added to various dentifrices had a variable effect on bacterial adhesion: markedly lower numbers of adhering s. oralis were found for a dentifrice with naf, but exposure to dentifrices containing snf2 or hexametaphosphate showed slightly increased adhesion. in summary, dietary components have influence on the hydrophobicity of enamel pellicles, while combinations of dietary components and  dentifrices certainly influence the adhesiveness of the pellicles. the effects of dietary components on pellicle conditioning film should be taken into consideration in research on the development of ingredients to control intraoral  surface chemistry and microbiology, as well as in the development of oral products.

AB  == as part of a series of longitudinal studies on the development of the indigenous  microflora of the upper respiratory tract, the establishment of streptococci in the oral cavity and nasopharynx and iga1 protease production by the early streptococcal flora was examined in 50 healthy caucasian infants at the ages of 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. in the oral cavity, streptococci were found in all infants on every sampling occasion, streptococcus mitis biovar 1 being the main finding in each age group. s. salivarius and s. mitis biovar 2 reached their highest prevalence during the first year of life, whereas the prevalence of s. oralis and s. sanguis showed no significant increase before 12 months of age. salivary streptococci mainly consisted of the above-mentioned species during the  follow-up period. in contrast to the oral cavity, no stable colonisation pattern  was observed for viridans streptococci in the nasopharynx. s. mitis biovar 1 and  s. pneumoniae, a traditional respiratory pathogen, were the principal streptococcal species among nasopharyngeal isolates. iga1 protease production by  early streptococci was common in infancy. among the oral streptococcal microflora, s. mitis biovar 1 (especially during the first year of life) and s. oralis and s. sanguis constituted the main species responsible for this enzyme activity. in the nasopharynx, iga1 protease was produced by s. mitis biovar 1, s. oralis and s. pneumoniae. in conclusion, streptococcal colonisation differs in these two close habitats in the upper respiratory tract.

AB  == this study examined viridans streptococci (sv) in oral flora of patients at risk  of infective endocarditis (ie) by obtaining 57 isolates from gum-tooth margin swabs of 3 groups of patients. penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by e test. group 1 was from 30 patients with prosthetic heart valves who did not receive antimicrobial agents within 3 months prior to recruitment. group 2 consisted of 21 patients with known rheumatic heart diseases who regularly received penicillin prophylaxis. group 3 was 2 patients with ie caused by sv in whom dental swabs were performed before and on the third day of treatment. streptococcus mitis was found most frequently (49% among 51 oral isolates of sv from patients in group 1 and 2) and in both blood cultures of ie patients. ninety-four per cent of the isolates were penicillin-susceptible and the rest were intermediate-resistant (ir) equally distributed in both groups 1 and 2. in 2 patients with ie, oral sv obtained after 3 days of penicillin therapy had mics rising 3 and 5 folds of the baselines. it is suggested that surveillance of susceptibilities of oral sv in patients at risk for ie should be kept up since this will affect the dose and type of antimicrobial agents in ie prophylaxis.

TI  == native valve endocarditis due to streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus oralis.
AB  == viridans streptococci are the commonest cause of native valve infective endocarditis (ie). the taxonomy of this group is evolving allowing new disease associations to be made. streptococcus vestibularis is a recently described member of the viridans group, first isolated from the vestibular mucosa of the human oral cavity. it has rarely been associated with human disease. streptococcus oralis, another member of the viridans group resident in the human  oral cavity is a well known cause of ie and bacteraemia in neutropenic patients.  we report the first case of native mitral valve endocarditis due to s. vestibularis in a patient with co-existing s. oralis endocarditis.

TI  == distribution of environmentally regulated genes of streptococcus suis serotype 2  among s. suis serotypes and other organisms.
AB  == the occurrence of 36 environmentally regulated genes of streptococcus suis strain 10 among all 35 s. suis serotypes was determined by using hybridization with the  amplified genes as probes. in addition, the distribution of these genes among the virulence phenotypes of serotypes 1 and 2 was assessed. hybridization was also performed with various other streptococcal species and nonstreptococcal bacterial species which may be present in pigs. interestingly, probe ivs-25/iri-1, similar  to agra and sapr, hybridized only with s. suis serotype 1 and 2 strains with virulent phenotypes and is therefore suitable as a diagnostic parameter. only one probe was specific for s. suis. this probe's sequence was identical to the epf gene, a putative virulence factor of s. suis. probe ivs-31 was similar to a virulence factor of s. suis, namely, a gene encoding a fibronectin- and fibrinogen-binding protein. this probe hybridized only with oral streptococci. nearly half of the probes (45%) hybridized with the oral streptococci (s. oralis, s. milleri, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, and s. mitis) and with streptococcus pneumoniae. this indicates a close relationship between s. suis, the oral streptococci, and s. pneumoniae with respect to the selected environmentally regulated genes. one probe only hybridized with gram-negative species and therefore seems to be obtained by s. suis from a gram-negative organism by horizontal transfer.

TI  == groesl sequence determination, phylogenetic analysis, and species differentiation for viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the full-length sequences of the groesl genes (also known as cpn10/60) of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordonii, and  streptococcus sanguis and the near full-length sequence of the groesl genes of streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius were determined. the lengths of the groes genes from the 10 species listed above ranged from 282 to 288 bp, and the full-length sequences of groel determined for  4 species (s. anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. sanguis) revealed that each was 1,623 bp. the intergenic region (spacer) between the groes and groel genes varies in size (15 to 111 bp) and sequence between species. the variation of the groes sequences among the species tested was greater (62.1 to 95.1% nucleotide sequence identities) than that of the groel sequences (77.2 to 95.2% nucleotide sequence identities). phylogenetic analysis of the groes and groel genes yielded evolutionary trees similar to the tree constructed by use of  the 16s rrna gene. the intraspecies variation of the spacer was minimal for clinical isolates of some species. the groesl sequence data provide an additional parameter for identification of viridans group streptococcal species.

TI  == interference of nontypeable haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis by streptococcus oralis in adenoid organ culture: a possible strategy for the treatment of the otitis-prone child.
AB  == the role of viridans group streptococci (streptococcus oralis) in the prevention  of colonization with nontypeable haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis was investigated in an adenoid organ culture system. the adenoids from 100 patients who were undergoing adenoidectomy for either hypertrophy or recurrent otitis media were used. streptococcus oralis parker uniformly inhibited colonization with nontypeable h. influenzae or m. catarrhalis over a 24-hour period of incubation in adenoid organ culture. streptococcus oralis booth, a noninhibitory strain, did not significantly reduce colonization with nontypeable  h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis. the results indicate that some strains of s. oralis may inhibit colonization with potential pathogens in the nasopharynx. it is therefore possible that colonization with inhibitory strains of viridans streptococci may be used in the nasopharynx as a relatively safe and inexpensive  approach to prevention of recurrent otitis media in some children.

TI  == the relationship between odontogenic bacteraemia and orthodontic treatment procedures.
AB  == the purpose of this research was to estimate the prevalence and intensity of bacteraemia associated with orthodontic treatment procedures. the four procedures investigated were: an upper alginate impression, separator placement, band placement, and adjustment of an archwire on a fixed appliance. eighty-one children undergoing general anaesthesia (ga) for dento-alveolar surgery related to their orthodontic treatment were randomly allocated to the impression or separator group. a further 61 children, receiving treatment in the outpatient department, were included and randomly allocated to the banding or archwire adjustment groups. a cannula was inserted into either the left or right antecubital fossa using an aseptic technique. a baseline 6 ml sample of blood was taken before treatment and a second 6 ml sample was taken 30 seconds after the procedure. there was no significant difference in the number of positive blood cultures between baseline (nine, 23 per cent), and following an upper alginate impression (twelve, 31 per cent); between baseline (twelve, 27 per cent), and placement of a separator (fifteen, 36 per cent); between baseline (nine, 36 per cent), and fitting or placement of a band (eleven, 44 per cent); or between baseline (twelve, 33 per cent), and archwire adjustment (seven, 19.4 per cent). for the separator group only the mean total number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria combined, isolated from the blood samples (cfu of bacteria per ml of blood), was significantly greater following the placement of a separator (2.2, sd 9.1), compared with baseline (0.9, sd 0.2; p < 0.02). this investigation demonstrates that the only orthodontic treatment procedure that causes a significant bacteraemia is the placement of a separator.

TI  == selection of dairy bacterial strains as probiotics for oral health.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to select bacterial strains with potential properties as oral probiotics, namely for the prevention of dental caries. we examined 23 dairy microorganisms, out of which we identified two streptococcus thermophilus and two lactcoccus lactis strains that were able to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads to the same extent as streptococcus sobrinus omz176. two of them, strep. thermophilus ncc1561 and lactoc. lactis ssp. lactis ncc2211, were further successfully incorporated into a biofilm mimicking the dental plaque. furthermore, they could grow in such a biofilm together with five  strains of oral bacterial species, representative of supragingival plaque. in this system, lactoc. lactis ncc2211 was able to modulate the growth of the oral bacteria, and in particular to diminish the colonization of streptococcus oralis  omz607, veillonella dispar omz493, actinomyces naeslundii omz745 and of the cariogenic strep. sobrinus omz176. these findings encourage further research with selected non-pathogenic dairy bacterial strains with the aim to decrease the cariogenic potential of dental plaque.

TI  == identification of viridans streptococcal species causing bacterial meningitis in  adults in taiwan.
AB  == in order to determine the species responsible for viridans-group streptococcal meningitis in adults in taiwan, seven cases of culture-proven meningitis due to these organisms were studied. the cases were all identified at the chang gung memorial hospital-kaohsiung over a period of 3 years, and they accounted for 9% (7/78) of all cases of culture-proven bacterial meningitis occurring in adults during this period. of the seven viridans streptococci isolates recovered, streptococcus constellatus accounted for four, streptococcus anginosus for two, and streptococcus oralis for one. thus, it appears that streptococci of the milleri group are the most common species causing bacterial meningitis in adults  in taiwan. the tendency for these organisms to cause invasive central nervous system infections in adults should not be overlooked when these species are recovered from cerebrospinal fluid specimens.

AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  == antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. previous studies suggested that 1 mm naf reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. the present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mm, 10 ppm naf) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. nine oral species were grown at ph 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the ph for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of naf. in addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without naf, and the ph change followed by microelectrode. after 10 days, chemostat ph dropped to ca.  ph 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total cfu) and veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). in comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final ph was significantly higher (ca. ph 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). the culture was predominated by v. dispar (70%) and actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas s. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of  the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. biofilm ph fell to only ph 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). analysis of the data suggests that fluoride  exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. fluoride prevents enrichment of s. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.

TI  == possible overestimation of penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumoniae colonization rates due to misidentification of oropharyngeal streptococci.
AB  == standard identification of streptococcus pneumoniae by optochin and bile solubility testing can lead to ambiguous results for certain isolates. newer bacteriologic identification techniques (e.g., dna probes) now exist. in a prospective point prevalence study of oropharyngeal s. pneumoniae carriage rates  among outpatients, we compared standard organism identification techniques to dna probe testing. by standard identification criteria, 35 (4%) of 872 isolates were  characterized as presumptive s. pneumoniae. thirty of 35 presumptive isolates were recoverable for dna probing; 9 (30%) presumptive isolates were confirmed using a dna probe. the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of these dna probe positive isolates closely paralleled that of clinical blood isolates of s. pneumoniae obtained during the study period. the 21 (70%) dna probe negative isolates, which may represent phylogenetically related species (such as s. mitis  or s. oralis), had significantly reduced antimicrobial susceptibility patterns when compared with the dna probe positive isolates. in colonization studies, if classic criteria (optochin disc zone and bile solubility) are the sole means of identification, s. pneumoniae penicillin resistance rates may be over-reported.

TI  == [therapeutic impact of streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in hematology patients].
AB  == from january 1999 to may 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. they concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. these patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. during 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to  antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. in six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten streptococcus mitis, five s. oralis, two s. sanguis, three s. pneumoniae). a single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the enterococci were one strain of enterococcus  faecalis and three e. faecium. ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l of  penicillin g, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = mic < 32 mg/l), and a strain  was resistant (mic = 32 mg/l). eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. for three strains, the mics of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l and 8-32 mg/l, respectively) were higher. levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. all species were susceptible to glycopeptides. three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. this results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.

TI  == repressed respiration of oral streptococci grown in biofilms.
AB  == the respiratory activities of oral streptococci grown in biofilms were found to be markedly repressed compared with those of cells from aerobic culture, or for streptococcus mutans gs-5, even for those grown in static culture. respiration rates generally reflected levels of nadh oxidase activities in cell extracts. superoxide dismutase levels were somewhat reduced in biofilm cells. however, sensitivities to oxidative damage caused by h2o2, t-butylhydroperoxide, or 8-hydroxyquinoline were not greatly different for cells from suspension cultures  and those from either intact or dispersed biofilms. the capacities of s. sanguis  and s. gordonii to produce h2o2 also were markedly repressed by biofilm growth, and presumably this repression would affect the ecology of dental plaque by reducing oxidative stresses under crowded conditions.

TI  == clinical and microbiological studies of periodontal disease in sjogren syndrome patients.
AB  == background: little is known about the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome (ss), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized  by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of ss patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. methods: 8 primary ss and 10 secondary ss patients were  examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. all patients were diagnosed by the european community criteria. control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. the comparison of clinical status was made  in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. microbiological assays of the subgingival  dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (pa) and a polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, streptococcus oralis). results: the  occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. no significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary ss patients for the pa test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. conclusion: no significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or  secondary ss patients compared with that of control subjects. the results of the  present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with ss do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

TI  == electric field induced desorption of bacteria from a conditioning film covered substratum.
AB  == desorption of three oral bacterial strains from a salivary conditioning film on an indium tin oxide electrode during application of a positive (bacterial adhesion to the anode) or a negative electric current was studied in a parallel plate flow chamber. bacterial adhesion was from a flowing suspension of high ionic strength, after which the bacterial suspension was replaced by a low ionic  strength solution without bacteria and currents ranging from -800 to +800 microa  were applied. streptococcus oralis j22 desorbed during application of a positive  and negative electric current with a desorption probability that increased with increasing electric current. two actinomyces strains, however, could not be stimulated to desorb by the electric currents applied. the desorption forces acting on adhering bacteria are electroosmotic in origin and working parallel to  the electrode surface in case of a positive current, whereas they are electrophoretic and electrostatic in origin and working perpendicular to the surface in case of a negative current. by comparison of the effect of positive and negative electric currents, it can be concluded that parallel forces are more effective in stimulating bacterial desorption than perpendicular forces. the results of this study point to a new pathway of cleaning industrial and biomedical surfaces without the use of detergents or biocides.

AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

TI  == dysregulation of monocyte oxidative burst in streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == background: streptococcal subacute endocarditis is characterized by low-grade systemic inflammation. although structural cardiac defects are pivotal, phagocytic cells, i.e. monocytes and neutrophils, are involved in the induction and the course of bacterial endocarditis. decreased production of reactive oxygen metabolites was described in long-lasting infections. we hypothesized that the oxidative burst of phagocytes induced by the infecting organism is defective in patients with streptococcal endocarditis. patients and methods: the monocytes and neutrophils of 11 patients with streptococcal native valve endocarditis were challenged with the respective pathogens and two control streptococcal strains, and the oxidative burst was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. these experiments were done before any antibiotic therapy was administered, and repeated at least 12 months after recovery. eight volunteers served as healthy controls. results: the monocyte response to the respective pathogens was decreased in the patient groups compared to the response to the control streptococci. after cure the monocyte response to the pathogens was not different to the response to the control strains. the monocyte response of the healthy volunteers did not show any differences between the patients' pathogens and the control strains. the neutrophil oxidative burst to the pathogens was similar to that to the control streptococci in both patient and the volunteer group. conclusion: the decreased response of patient monocytes to the pathogens may contribute to the low-grade inflammatory response and to the course of streptococcal endocarditis.

AB  == csf-a beta 42 may be a marker of alzheimer's disease (ad). a decreased level of csf-a beta 42 is consistently found in ad and has been suggested to be related to the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain. however, low csf-a beta 42 levels have also been found in disorders devoid of plaques, for instance creutzfeldt-jakob disease. to examine if the level of a beta 42 in csf is related to inflammatory processes, we studied csf-a beta 42 levels in eight patients with acute purulent bacterial meningitis, 10 patients with acute viral meningitis and  18 age-matched controls. in acute purulent bacterial meningitis, the csf-a beta 42 level was markedly reduced (28% of that in controls, p<0.0001), whereas no change was found in viral meningitis. after successful treatment of bacterial meningitis, the csf-a beta 42 level increased (p<0.05 compared to baseline) and did no longer differ from that in controls (ns). the decrease could not be explained by interference with high protein levels, since addition of increasing  volumes of serum did not influence the csf-a beta 42 levels. our findings suggest that the reduction in csf-a beta 42 found in bacterial meningitis is not a direct consequence of the inflammatory process. the cause may be disturbance of the clearance of a beta 42 from the brain.

TI  == co-adhesion and removal of adhering bacteria from salivary pellicles by three different modes of brushing.
AB  == this study compares removal of pairs of co-adhering and non-co-adhering oral actinomyces and streptococci by hand, electric and sonic brushing from salivary pellicles. in addition, re-deposition of a co-adhering and non-co-adhering streptococcal strain to brushed pellicles was studied. first, actinomyces were allowed to adhere to a pellicle in a flow chamber, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were perfused through the chamber at 33 c. pellicles with adhering bacterial pairs were brushed and the number of bacteria remaining determined. whereas sonic brushing removed nearly all adhering bacteria, greater  numbers of larger aggregates of the co-adhering pair, involving streptococcus oralis j22, were left behind after hand and electric brushing than of the non-co-adhering pair with streptococcus sanguis pk1889. re-deposition of streptococci to electrically and sonically brushed pellicles, however, was two-fold higher for the co-adhering pair than for the non-co-adhering pair. this  demonstrates a role for co-adhesion in de novo plaque formation. removal by the three different modes of brushing was not affected by the presence of fluoride, indicating that fluoride is not able to disrupt calcium bridges between co-adhering pairs. in contrast, in the presence of lactose only small aggregates  of co-adhering pair were left behind.

TI  == infection and mucosal injury in cancer treatment.
AB  == the oral and gastrointestinal mucosa acts as an important mechanical barrier that prevents local or systemic invasion by microorganisms. cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced mucosal injury (mi) of oral cavity and intestinal epithelium occurs in many patients treated for malignancy. compromise of the mucosal barrier can contribute to local invasion by colonizing microorganisms and, subsequently,  to systemic infection. historically, gram-negative bacteremia has been the most problematic bacterial infection in neutropenic patients, but its incidence has reduced over time because of the use of prophylactic antibiotics. there has been  a shift in the type of infecting organisms responsible for bacteremia in these patients, from predominantly gram-negative organisms to gram-positive cocci. the  viridans group of streptococci is composed of the most frequent bacterial pathogens associated with mi. when speciated, oral colonizers such as streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sangulis ii are the  most frequently identified pathogens. other systemic infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and candida species have also been associated with mi after cancer treatment. infection can also exacerbate mi after cancer treatment. the best recognized example is herpes  simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1). latent virus is frequently reactivated in hsv-seropositive patients; this reactivation leads to stomatitis, which can be indistinguishable from mi caused by cytoreductive therapies. antiviral prophylaxis or treatment can control the virus-induced mi and bring about overall amelioration of mi. recognition of this infectious cause of mi is important in order for clinicians to anticipate and minimize oral toxicity and to facilitate optimal delivery of the antineoplastic regimen.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == salivary concentrations of urea released from a chewing gum containing urea and how these affect the urea content of gel-stabilized plaques and their ph after exposure to sucrose.
AB  == the objectives were to: (1) determine the salivary concentrations of urea during  20 min chewing of a sugar-free gum containing 30 mg of urea; (2) measure the degree to which this urea would diffuse into a gel-stabilized plaque; (3) study the effect of the urea on the fall and subsequent rise in ph (stephan curve) on exposure to 10% sucrose for 1 min; (4) model the measurements 2 and 3 mathematically. in point 1, the salivary urea concentration of the 12 subjects peaked at 47 mmol/l in the first 2 min of gum chewing, falling within 15 min to the unstimulated salivary concentration of 3.4 mmol/l. recovery of urea from the  saliva averaged 81.5%. 'plaques' of 1% agarose or 67% dead bacteria in agarose accumulated urea from the saliva roughly as expected, whereas those plaques containing 8% live and 59% dead streptococcus vestibularis showed negligible accumulation. computer modelling showed this difference to be due to urease of live bacteria breaking down the urea as rapidly as it entered the plaque. simulation of the effect of gum chewing subsequent to initiation of a stephan curve in the latter type of plaque showed a rapid rise in ph but then a fall again on return to unstimulated conditions. this fall had not been seen in previous studies, with streptococcus oralis, nor was it predicted by the computer modelling. neither experimental simulation nor computer modelling suggested that  chewing urea-containing gum before exposure to sucrose would have any effect on a subsequent stephan curve. thus chewing gum is only likely to inhibit caries when  it is chewed after consumption of fermentable carbohydrate, rather than before.

TI  == cariogenic potential of lactosylfructoside as determined by acidogenicity of oral streptococci in vitro and human dental plaque in situ.
AB  == the cariogenic potential of lactosylfructoside [o-beta-d-galactopyranosyl-(1-->4)-o-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-(1<-->2)-beta-d-fruct ofuranoside] was estimated by experiments on oral streptococci in vitro and human dental plaque in situ. lactosylfructoside was unable to support growth of the strains of streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus used in this study. however, it was able to support growth of strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis and s. oralis. acid was produced rapidly by cell suspensions of s. oralis atcc 10557 incubated with lactosylfructoside. application of 5% w/v solution decreased the ph of human dental plaque. the minimum ph value was below 5.3. the results suggest that lactosylfructoside is as acidogenic as lactose and could be cariogenic if it is consumed frequently and retained for a long period in the mouth.

TI  == phosphorylcholine-dependent cross-reactivity between dental plaque bacteria and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.
AB  == antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (pc) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain pc as determined by reactivity with pc-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (igg) g anti-pc are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. these data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-pc responses. recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for pc are elevated in apoe-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ldl) (oxldl) in atherosclerotic plaques. these data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-pc could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxldl, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. we therefore examined the ability of human anti-pc to bind to pc-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition  assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-pc to  pc-bearing actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. our results indicated that pc-bearing strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed  up to 80% of anti-pc igg antibody from human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc  bound to a pc-bearing strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a pc-negative strain. oxldl also absorbed anti-pc from human sera, and oxldl but not ldl reacted with up to 80% of the anti-pc in human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc bound directly to oxldl but not to ldl. the data indicate that pc-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxldl. we propose that pc-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to pc that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.

TI  == pcr and sequencing of independent genetic targets for the diagnosis of culture negative bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == molecular methods utilizing broad-range primers for 16s rdna pcr and sequencing have been widely evaluated for their utility in culture negative diagnostic bacteriology. difficulties in determining the incidence of false positive pcr results, especially in the absence of an equally sensitive confirmatory method however, have prevented wide clinical use of this sensitive technology. here we report two cases of culture-negative endocarditis, in which pcr using 16s rdna broad-range primers generated sequences specific for bartonella spp. and streptococcus oralis, respectively. to confirm these results, a second species- or genus-specific molecular target was chosen for each organism and detected in the split samples sequencially. thus, molecular detection of a second species-specific target can be used to confirm pcr results generated from 16s rdna broad-range primers and to control for potential false positive results due  to environmental and amplicon carry-over contamination during specimen processing and testing in the laboratory.

AB  == the gene encoding the pneumococcal surface adhesin a (psaa) protein has been identified in three different viridans group streptococcal species. comparative studies of the psaa gene identified in different pneumococcal isolates by sequencing pcr products showed a high degree of conservation among these strains. psaa is encoded by an open reading frame of 930 bp. the analysis of this fragment in streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus anginosus strains revealed a sequence identity of 95, 94, and 90%, respectively, to the corresponding open reading frame of the previously reported streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 6b strain. our results confirm that psaa is present and detectable in heterologous bacterial species. the possible implications of these  results for the suitability and potential use of psaa in the identification and diagnosis of pneumococcal diseases are discussed.

TI  == bacterial detachment from salivary conditioning films by dentifrice supernates.
AB  == this study compared the detachment by supernates of nine different dentifrices of four oral bacterial strains adhering to a salivary pellicle in a parallel plate flow chamber. ultra-thin bovine enamel slabs were coated for 1.5 h with human whole saliva. following buffer rinsing, a bacterial suspension of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans or actinomyces naeslundii was perfused through the flow chamber at a shear rate of 30 s-1 for four hours, and the number of adhering bacteria n4h was enumerated by image analysis after buffer rinsing at the same shear rate. then, a 25 wt%-dentifrice/water supernate was perfused through the flow chamber for four minutes, followed by eight minutes of  buffer rinsing and another enumeration of the number of bacteria that had remained adhering nad. finally, an air-bubble was passed through the flow chamber to mimic the occasionally high detachment forces occurring in the oral cavity, and the adhering bacteria nab were counted again. on average, s. sanguis was the  easiest to detach (73% averaged over all dentifrice supernates), while a. naeslundii was the most difficult (22% on average). the combined detachment of bacteria by dentifrice supernates and air-bubble ranged from a low of 16% to a high of 80%. dentifrices containing pyrophosphate and polymeric polyphosphate (hexametaphosphate) surface active ingredients appeared to produce the most consistent and strongest desorption effects on plaque bacteria. factors apparently important to bacterial detachment from pellicle-covered tooth surfaces by dentifrice formulations include the nature of adhesion of bacterial strains and chemical composition of the dentifrice formulations, including ph, surfactant system and the effect of added ingredients (dispersants, metal ions, peroxides, baking soda).

TI  == mutualism versus independence: strategies of mixed-species oral biofilms in vitro using saliva as the sole nutrient source.
AB  == during initial dental plaque formation, the ability of a species to grow when others cannot would be advantageous, and enhanced growth through interspecies and intergeneric cooperation could be critical. these characteristics were investigated in three coaggregating early colonizers of the tooth surface (streptococcus gordonii dl1, streptococcus oralis 34, and actinomyces naeslundii  t14v). area coverage and cell cluster size measurements showed that attachment of a. naeslundii and of s. gordonii to glass flowcells was enhanced by a salivary conditioning film, whereas attachment of s. oralis was hindered. growth experiments using saliva as the sole carbon and nitrogen source showed that a. naeslundii was unable to grow either in planktonic culture or as a biofilm, whereas s. gordonii grew under both conditions. s. oralis grew planktonically, but to a much lower maximum cell density than did s. gordonii; s. oralis did not  grow reproducibly as a biofilm. thus, only s. gordonii possessed all traits advantageous for growth as a solitary and independent resident of the tooth. two-species biofilm experiments analyzed by laser confocal microscopy showed that neither s. oralis nor a. naeslundii grew when coaggregated pairwise with s. gordonii. however, both s. oralis and a. naeslundii showed luxuriant, interdigitated growth when paired together in coaggregated microcolonies. thus, the s. oralis-a. naeslundii pair formed a mutualistic relationship, potentially contact dependent, that allows each to grow where neither could survive alone. s. gordonii, in contrast, neither was hindered by nor benefited from the presence of either of the other strains. the formation of mutually beneficial interactions within the developing biofilm may be essential for certain initial colonizers to  be retained during early plaque development, whereas other initial colonizers may be unaffected by neighboring cells on the substratum.

TI  == altered protein expression of streptococcus oralis cultured at low ph revealed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis is the predominant aciduric nonmutans streptococcus isolated from the human dentition, but the role of this organism in the initiation and progression of dental caries has yet to be established. to identify proteins that are differentially expressed by s. oralis growing under conditions of low ph, soluble cellular proteins extracted from bacteria grown in batch culture at ph 5.2 or 7.0 were analyzed by two-dimensional (2-d) gel electrophoresis. thirty-nine proteins had altered expression at low ph; these were excised, digested with trypsin using an in-gel protocol, and further analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. the resulting fingerprints were compared with the genomic database  for streptococcus pneumoniae, an organism that is phylogenetically closely related to s. oralis, and putative functions for the majority of these proteins were determined on the basis of functional homology. twenty-eight proteins were up-regulated following growth at ph 5.2; these included enzymes of the glycolytic pathway (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase), the polypeptide chains comprising atp synthase, and proteins that are considered to play a role in the general stress response of bacteria, including the 60-kda chaperone, hsp33, and superoxide dismutase, and three distinct abc transporters.  these data identify, for the first time, gene products that may be important in the survival and proliferation of nonmutans aciduric s. oralis under conditions of low ph that are likely to be encountered by this organism in vivo.

AB  == aims: to investigate the effects of surface roughness and type of denture acrylic on the early development of a streptococcus oralis biofilm in a constant depth film fermentor (cdff). methods and results: streptococcus oralis was incubated with acrylic of known surface roughness in the cdff. adherent strep. oralis were  enumerated by viable counting. cold-cure acrylic was rougher (p < 0.01) than heat-cure acrylic after polishing with abrasive paper of any given grit-grade. heat-cure acrylic was colonized by fewer (p < 0.001) bacteria than cold-cure acrylic at any given surface roughness. the number of bacteria adhering to heat-cure and cold-cure acrylic increased linearly with mean surface roughness after 2 h incubation, the increase being greater (p < 0.001) for the cold-cure compared with the heat-cure acrylic. however, after 4 h incubation, surface roughness appeared to have no effect on the number of adherent bacteria. conclusion: the type of acrylic used, and its roughness, affect the early stages  of biofilm formation by strep. oralis. significance and impact of the study: choosing an appropriate type of smooth acrylic could lead to reduced biofilm formation in vivo.

AB  == a theoretical analysis of the detachment of bacteria adhering to substratum surfaces upon the passage of an air-liquid interface is given, together with experimental results for bacterial detachment in the absence and presence of a conditioning film on different substratum surfaces. bacteria (streptococcus sobrinus hg1025, streptococcus oralis j22, actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1, bacteroides fragilis 793e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 974k) were first allowed to adhere to hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic dimethyldichlorosilane (dds)-coated glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber until a density of 4 x 10(6) cells cm(-2)  was reached. for s. sobrinus hg1025, s. oralis j22, and a. naeslundii t14v-j1, the conditioning film consisted of adsorbed salivary components, while for b. fragilis 793e and p. aeruginosa 974k, the film consisted of adsorbed human plasma components. subsequently, air bubbles were passed through the flow chamber and the bacterial detachment percentages were measured. for some experimental conditions, like with p. aeruginosa 974k adhering to dds-coated glass and an air  bubble moving at high velocity (i.e., 13.6 mm s(-1)), no bacteria detached upon passage of an air-liquid interface, while for others, detachment percentages between 80 and 90% were observed. the detachment percentage increased when the velocity of the passing air bubble decreased, regardless of the bacterial strain  and substratum surface hydrophobicity involved. however, the variation in percentages of detachment by a passing air bubble depended greatly upon the strain and substratum surface involved. at low air bubble velocities the hydrophobicity of the substratum had no influence on the detachment, but at high  air bubble velocities all bacterial strains were more efficiently detached from hydrophilic glass substrata. furthermore, the presence of a conditioning film could either inhibit or stimulate detachment. the shape of the bacterial cell played a major role in detachment at high air bubble velocities, and spherical strains (i.e., streptococci) detached more efficiently than rod-shaped organisms. the present results demonstrate that methodologies to study bacterial adhesion which include contact with a moving air-liquid interface (i.e., rinsing and dipping) yield detachment of an unpredictable number of adhering microorganisms.  hence, results of studies based on such methodologies should be referred as "bacterial retention" rather than "bacterial adhesion".

AB  == the purpose of this work was to evaluate the effects of infant dentifrices: a--with lactoperoxidase, glucose oxidase and lactoferrin; b--with 1100 ppm of naf and sodium lauryl sulfate; c--with extract of calendula. the dentifrices were test on biofilms formed in vitro from saliva and dental plaque of infants, using  reference strains a. viscosus (atcc 43146); c. albicans (atcc 51501); l. casei (atcc 4646); s. mitis (atcc 49456); s. mutans (atcc 25175); s. oralis (atcc 35037); s. sanguis (atcc 10586); s. sobrinus (atcc 27609) and isolated clinically microorganisms c. albicans, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus and lactobacillus sp. twenty infants were chosen, who were beginning treatment at the infants clinic of the pediatric dentistry department, federal university of rio de janeiro. a pool of unstimulated saliva and a pool of dental  plaque were collected from which biofilms were produced. supernatants from each dentifrice were prepared and concentrated and diluted solutions of the dentifrices and a control sterile diluent were tested against the biofilms produced, for 1 and 3 minutes, and against the microorganisms. the results were statistically analyzed by the anova and tukey test. after the exposure of the biofilms produced both from saliva and from dental plaque, to the dentifrice b concentrated and 1/2, for 1 and 3 minutes, the viable microorganisms count (cfu/ml), compared to the controls, was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). however, exposure to the dentifrices a and c concentrated and dentifrice b 1/4 and 1/8, for 1 and 3 minutes, was not significantly lethal to the biofilms. the dentifrices a and c, either concentrated or diluted (1/2 to 1/128) and the dentifrice b in the dilutions 1/16 to 1/128 did not have an antimicrobial effect  on any microorganism evaluated. for all the microorganisms evaluated, the dentifrice b concentrated and in the 1/2 dilution showed a significant antimicrobial effect, when compared with the control (p < 0.05).

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin and other related drugs against isolates of streptococcus oralis.
AB  == objective: the in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin a new quinolone was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, various b-lactam and other appropriate  antibiotics such as vancomycin, teicoplanin and clindamycin against 60 isolates of s. oralis. methods: minimal inhibitory concentration was performed using the agar dilution technique and micro-titer method. in addition minimal bactericidal  concentration and time-kill studies were carried out to estimate the bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin against s. oralis isolates. results: trovafloxacin showed a four-fold increase in activity over ciprofloxacin, with a narrow minimal inhibitory concentration range, mic50 and mode values of 0.25 mg/l. although the  minimal inhibitory concentrations of trovafloxacin for s.oralis were relatively high compared to all the antibiotics tested. the in-vitro bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin was greater than all other antibiotics against s. oralis. five out of 10 isolates showed there was a 100% kill within 6 hours of contact; in all other cases, the kill time was between 6 and 24 hours. conclusion: overall, trovafloxacin showed superior minimal inhibitory concentration, bactericidal concentration and kill time when compared with different antibiotics.

TI  == application and evaluation of the interlaboratory reproducibility of trna intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tdna-pcr) for identification of streptococcus species.
AB  == the discriminatory power, speed, and interlaboratory reproducibility of trna intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tdna-pcr) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of streptococci. this method was carried out in three different laboratories under highly standardized conditions for 54 strains belonging to 18 different species. it was concluded that interlaboratory reproducibility of tdna fingerprints produced by means of capillary electrophoresis was sufficiently high to permit the exchange between different laboratories and the construction of common libraries which can be consulted for comparison with fingerprints obtained independently in separate laboratories. in a second step, 17 other species were included in the study and examined in one of the participating laboratories. all streptococcus species studied, except s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis, showed distinguishable tdna fingerprints. a database of well-characterized strains was constructed to enable computer-aided identification of unknown streptococcal isolates.

TI  == antibiotic resistance rates and macrolide resistance phenotypes of viridans group streptococci from the oropharynx of healthy greek children.
AB  == a total of 200 isolates of viridans group streptococci isolated from the oropharynx of healthy greek children were studied. vancomycin, rifampicin, fluoroquinolones and dalfopristin/quinupristin were active against all tested isolates. high level resistance to gentamicin was not seen. intermediate and high-level penicillin resistance was present in 28.5 and 14.5% isolates, respectively, with 41.3% of the latter group, being also resistant to cefotaxime. resistance rates to other antimicrobials were as follows - erythromycin 38.5%, clarithromycin 33.5%, clindamycin 7.5% and tetracycline 23%. penicillin resistance occurred more frequently in streptococcus mitis isolates, while macrolide resistance was more frequent in s. oralis. mlsb resistance phenotype m  was dominant (74%) among erythromycin resistant isolates, with phenotypes ir and  cr being represented by 6 and 20% of isolates, respectively.

TI  == validation of an in vitro biofilm model of supragingival plaque.
AB  == the study of biofilm structure and function mandates the use of model systems for which a host of environmental variables can be rigorously controlled. we describe a model of supragingival plaque containing actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sobrinus, and streptococcus oralis wherein cells are cultivated anaerobically in a saliva-based medium on hydroxyapatite discs coated with a salivary pellicle, with material and pieces of apparatus common to all microbiology laboratories. after 0.5 hr, 16.5 hrs, 40.5 hrs, and 64.5 hrs, the composition of adherent biofilms was analyzed by culture techniques, live/dead fluorescence staining, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. repeated independent trials demonstrated the repeatability of biofilm formation after 40.5 hrs and 64.5 hrs. brief exposures of biofilms to chlorhexidine or triclosan produced losses in viability similar to those observed in vivo. this biofilm model should prove very useful for pre-clinical testing of  prospective anti-plaque agents at clinically relevant concentrations.

TI  == tts, a processive beta-glucosyltransferase of streptococcus pneumoniae, directs the synthesis of the branched type 37 capsular polysaccharide in pneumococcus and other gram-positive species.
AB  == the type 37 capsule of streptococcus pneumoniae is a homopolysaccharide built up  from repeating units of [beta-d-glcp-(1-->2)]-beta-d-glcp-(1-->3). the elements governing the expression of the tts gene, coding for the glucosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of the type 37 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, have been studied. primer extension analysis and functional tests demonstrated the presence of four new transcriptional start points upstream of the previously  reported tts promoter (ttsp). most interesting, three of these transcriptional start points are located in a rup element thought to be involved in recombinational events (oggioni, m. r., and claverys, j. p. (1999) microbiology 145, 2647-2653). transformation experiments using either a recombinant plasmid containing the whole transcriptional unit of tts or chromosomal dna from a type 37 pneumococcus showed that tts is the only gene required to drive the biosynthesis of a type 37 capsule in s. pneumoniae and other gram-positive bacteria, namely streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, and bacillus subtilis. the tts synthase was overproduced in s. pneumoniae and purified as a membrane-associated enzyme. these membrane preparations used udp-glc as substrate to catalyze the synthesis of a high molecular weight polysaccharide immunologically identical to the type 37 capsule. in addition, udp-gal was also a substrate to produce type 37 polysaccharide since a strong udp-glc-4'-epimerase activity is associated to the membrane fraction of s. pneumoniae. these results indicated that tts has a dual biochemical activity that leads to the synthesis of the branched type 37 polysaccharide.

TI  == the use of immunoliposomes for specific delivery of antimicrobial agents to oral  bacteria immobilized on polystyrene.
AB  == antibacterial immunoliposomes have been prepared using covalently bound antibody, raised to the cell surface of the bacterium streptococcus oralis (s. oralis), and incorporating the bactericides chlorhexidine and triclosan. a regrowth assay, in  which the ability of a bacterial biofilm immobilised on polystyrene to grow after exposure to a test solution, was undertaken to study the action of the antibacterial immunoliposomes. the antibacterial anti-oralis immunoliposomes show enhanced growth inhibition of s. oralis, compared to free bactericide, using low  bactericide concentrations. for short exposure times to the biofilms, antibacterial anti-oralis immunoliposomes can show several times enhanced growth  inhibition of s. oralis compared to free bactericide. antibacterial anti-oralis immunoliposomes inhibit the growth of s. oralis more than that of other oral bacteria. the extent of growth inhibition by antibacterial anti-oralis immunoliposomes is linearly related to the number of immunoliposomes targeted to  the biofilm surface.

TI  == mosaic genes and mosaic chromosomes: intra- and interspecies genomic variation of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major causative agent of serious human diseases. the worldwide increase of antibiotic resistant strains revealed the importance of horizontal gene transfer in this pathogen, a scenario that results  in the modulation of the species-specific gene pool. we investigated genomic variation in 20 s. pneumoniae isolates representing major antibiotic-resistant clones and 10 different capsular serotypes. variation was scored as decreased hybridization signals visualized on a high-density oligonucleotide array representing 1,968 genes of the type 4 reference strain knr.7/87. up to 10% of the genes appeared altered between individual isolates and the reference strain;  variability within clones was below 2.1%. ten gene clusters covering 160 kb account for half of the variable genes. most of them are associated with transposases and are assumed to be part of a flexible gene pool within the bacterial population; other variable loci include mosaic genes encoding antibiotic resistance determinants and gene clusters related to bacteriocin production. genomic comparison between s. pneumoniae and commensal streptococcus  mitis and streptococcus oralis strains indicates distinct antigenic profiles and  suggests a smooth transition between these species, supporting the validity of the microarray system as an epidemiological and diagnostic tool.

TI  == altered antigenicity in periodontitis patients and decreased adhesion of porphyromonas gingivalis by environmental temperature stress.
AB  == periodontopathogenic bacteria survive various environmental changes during the progression of periodontal disease. alterations in metabolism and protein expression will have to take place to adapt their physiological functions to environmental stress. we examined the effects of an elevation of 2 degrees c in temperature on the adhesive ability and antigenicity of porphyromonas gingivalis. elevation of growth temperature of p. gingivalis from 37 degrees c to 39 degrees  c remarkably suppressed the expression of surface filamentous structures, such as fimbriae, as well as the adhesive capacities to salivary components and streptococcus oralis. sera of severe periodontitis patients revealed a marked increase in serological activity with 39 degrees c cells than with 37 degrees c cells. the alteration of protein profiles of bacterial surface components by temperature elevation was demonstrated by sds-page, and their western blot profiles were also different from those of cells grown at 37 degrees c. although  a uniform trend was not found in the altered patterns, sera from severe periodontitis patients detected more antigenic proteins in cells grown at 39 degrees c than 37 degrees c cells. these observations suggest that p. gingivalis  downregulates the expression of fimbriae and alters its adhesive capacity and antigenicity by the temperature stress that could occur during the disease progression.

TI  == binding of oral streptococci to human fibrinogen.
AB  == the interaction of oral streptococci with human fibrinogen was investigated. streptococcus gordonii was chosen as a representative species to study the binding to fibrinogen. s. gordonii dl1 adhered to immobilized fibrinogen and bovine serum albumin. binding to immobilized fibrinogen was saturable, concentration and temperature dependent. the binding of s. gordonii dl1 to fibrinogen was inhibited by anti-fibrinogen antibody. heating of the bacteria for 1 h at 95 degrees c resulted in 90% inhibition of the binding. trypsin treatment  of the bacteria resulted in decreased binding. neither lipoteichoic acid nor culturing of the bacteria in a sucrose-supplemented medium had any effect on the  binding. s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis bound to the immobilized fibrinogen, but mutans streptococci did not. none of the oral streptococci tested bound to the fibrinogen in fluid phase. these results suggest that the binding of s. gordonii dl1 to immobilized fibrinogen is mediated through a specific protein adhesin-receptor interaction, and fibrinogen acts as a cryptitope.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

TI  == spatial arrangements and associative behavior of species in an in vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  == the spatial arrangements and associative behavior of actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sobrinus, and streptococcus oralis strains in an in vitro model of supragingival plaque were determined. using species-specific fluorescence-labeled antibodies in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy, the volumes and distribution of the five strains were assessed during biofilm formation. the volume-derived cell numbers of each strain correlated well with respective culture data. between 15 min and 64 h, populations of each strain increased in a manner reminiscent of batch growth. the microcolony morphologies of all members of the consortium and their distributions within the biofilm were characterized, as were interspecies associations. biofilms formed 15 min after inoculation consisted principally of single nonaggregated cells. all five strains adhered strongly to the saliva-conditioned substratum, and therefore, coadhesion played no role during the initial phase of biofilm formation. this observation does not reflect the results of in vitro coaggregation of the five strains, which depended upon the nature of the suspension medium. while the possibility cannot be excluded that some interspecies associations observed at later stages of biofilm formation were initiated by coadhesion, increase in bacterial numbers appeared to be largely a growth phenomenon regulated by the prevailing cultivation conditions.

TI  == utilization and acid production of beta-galactosyllactose by oral streptococci and human dental plaque.
AB  == beta-galactosyllactose is a trisaccharide containing the beta-galactosidic linkage at the nonreducing end. the purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral streptococci could utilize four kinds of beta-galactosyllactoses. three of four beta-galactosyllactoses were unable to support growth of the oral streptococci and to be a substrate for producing acid  from the cell suspensions and dental plaque. 4'-beta-galactosyllactose supported  growth of streptococcus sanguis atcc 35105, atcc 49298, streptococcus mitis atcc  15914, streptococcus oralis atcc 35037, atcc 10557 and streptococcus milleri 10707 and produced acid from dental plaque. although beta-galactosidase activities were observed in all the strains, 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could not  be used as a carbon source for the growth of mutans streptococci. enzymes metabolizing 4'-beta-galactosyllactose were induced when s. oralis atcc 10557 was cultured in medium containing galactose. these results suggested that 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could be as cariogenic as lactose if it is consumed frequently and retained for a long period in the mouth.

TI  == origins of staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus oralis causing bacteraemia in a bone marrow transplant patient.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteraemia in immunocompromised patients is often associated with the use of central venous catheters, while the proposed origin of viridans streptococci causing bacteraemia in this patient group is the  oral cavity. this report describes an episode of polymicrobial bacteraemia caused by staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus oralis followed by several further episodes of s. epidermidis bacteraemia in a 15-year-old boy after bone marrow transplantation. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of smai chromosomal dna digests was used to compare blood culture and oral isolates of s. epidermidis and str. oralis. the results indicated that the mouth was the source  of both s. epidermidis and str. oralis causing the first episode of bacteraemia.  pfge further demonstrated that the central venous catheter was the origin of a second strain of s. epidermidis responsible for subsequent episodes of staphylococcal bacteraemia. both the oral mucosa and central venous lines should  be considered as potential sources of organisms, including coagulase-negative staphylococci, associated with bacteraemia in immunocompromised patients.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole (orn) in sites with or without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients. methods: two pooled bacterial samples consisting of 4 sites each (scaled and non-scaled sites) were obtained from 30 individuals exhibiting eop. all patients received oral hygiene instruction (ohi), supragingival scaling and orn. subgingival scaling and root planing (srp) was carried out only in scaled sites. bacterial samples were taken at baseline (bl) and 1 week and 2, 6, and 12 months after systemic ornidazole administration (500 mg/bid for 7 days). one more sample was taken at scaled sites, one week after srp. results: one week following srp (scaled sites)  gram-negative facultative and anaerobic rods were significantly reduced while gram-positive facultative cocci were significantly increased. after orn administration, p. gingivalis, p. denticola, p. intermedia, b. forsythus, c. rectus, and s. sputigena were no longer detectable in either scaled or non-scaled sites. a statistically significant long-term (2, 6, and 12 months) reduction of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, b. forsythus, and c. rectus and a pronounced increase of s. milleri, s. oralis, and s. sanguis counts in both scaled and non-scaled sites were detected in comparison to baseline. a sustained  reduction of bleeding tendency and of probing depth was also observed in both scaled and non-scaled sites. conclusions: orn combined with srp effects beneficial shifts in the bacterial population associated with substantial clinical improvement, thereby indicating that orn is effective adjunct in the treatment of eop deep periodontal pockets where anaerobic bacteria are predominant.

TI  == the galu gene of streptococcus pneumoniae that codes for a udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase is highly polymorphic and suitable for molecular typing and phylogenetic studies.
AB  == the enzyme utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, udpg:pp) is synthesized by practically all organisms, although prokaryotic udpg:pps are evolutionarily unrelated to the eukaryotic counterparts. the primary structure of prokaryotic udpg:pps is well conserved, although little  information exists on the polymorphism of the genes coding for these enzymes. it  has been reported that the galu gene encoding the streptococcus pneumoniae udpg:pp is absolutely required for the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide,  a sine qua non prerequisite for virulence. a 594 bp fragment covering 66% of the  galu gene from 37 pneumococcal isolates and the type strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sobrinus has been amplified by pcr and sequenced. up to 21 different alleles were found in s. pneumoniae. they possess a mosaic-like structure and belong to, at least, two evolutionarily distinct families that show a sequence divergence of 15-20%. in spite of its marked polymorphism, phylogenetic relationships among pneumococcal strains deduced from the galu gene matched those previously established by using alternative approaches. comparison of the pneumococcal galu alleles with those from other streptococci indicated the existence of a complex network of genetic interchange. the galu gene represents an informative marker to be used alone or in conjunction with other molecular typing methods.

TI  == structures of two cell wall-associated polysaccharides of a streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strain. a unique teichoic acid-like polysaccharide and the group o antigen which is a c-polysaccharide in common with pneumococci.
AB  == the cell wall of streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strain sk137 contains the c-polysaccharide known as the common antigen of a closely related species streptococcus pneumoniae, and a teichoic acid-like polysaccharide with a unique structure. the two polysaccharides are different entities and could be partially  separated by gel chromatography. the structures of the two polysaccharides were determined by chemical methods and by nmr spectroscopy. the teichoic acid-like polymer has a heptasaccharide phosphate repeating unit with the following structure: the structure neither contains ribitol nor glycerol phosphate as classical teichoic acids do, thus we have used the expression teichoic acid-like  for this polysaccharide. the following structure of the c-polysaccharide repeating unit was established: where aat is 2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4, 6-trideoxy-d-galactose. it has a carbohydrate backbone identical to that of one of the two structures of c-polysaccharide previously identified in s. pneumoniae. c-polysaccharide of s. mitis is characterized by the presence, in each repeating  unit, of two residues of phosphocholine and both galactosamine residues in the n-acetylated form. immunochemical analysis showed that c-polysaccharide constitutes the lancefield group o antigen. studies using mabs directed against the backbone and against the phosphocholine moiety of the c-polysaccharide revealed several different patterns of these epitopes among 95 s. mitis and streptococcus oralis strains tested and the exclusive presence of the group o antigen in the majority of s. mitis biovar 1 strains.

TI  == strain-related acid production by oral streptococci.
AB  == acid production, in particular at low ph, is thought to be an important ecological determinant in dental caries. the aim of the present study was to determine the acid producing capability at different ph levels of 47 streptococcal strains, representing 9 species, isolated from human dental plaque. the bacteria were grown until mid log-phase under anaerobic conditions and acid production was measured in a ph-stat system at ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5 and 5.0. at all ph values, the mean velocity of acid production (v(ap)) by streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus was significantly higher (p<0.01; anova) than that of the other oral streptococci, including s. mitis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. vestibularis. however, the v(ap) of some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis, particularly at ph values of 7.0 and 6.0, exceeded that of some strains of s. mutans. the v(ap) decreased with ph for all strains, but some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and strains of the mutans streptococci maintained a relatively high rate of acid production. the results suggest that some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis may play an important role in caries development by modifying the environment in dental plaque to become favourable for the succession of aciduric  species. the study furthermore emphasises the need for detailed species and biovar identification of oral streptococci and for recognition of the significant physiological differences that occur within single species.

TI  == similarity of bacteriocin activity profiles of mutans streptococci within the family when the children acquire the strains after the age of 5.
AB  == it has been shown that there is a window of infectivity for mutans streptococci between the ages of 19 and 31 months, when many children acquire mutans streptococci transmitted from their mothers. part of the children that escape this window acquire mutans streptococci at a later age. in this group, maternal transmission is expected to be less prevalent. the present study compared the bacteriocin activity profiles of mutans streptococci isolated from mothers, fathers and children when the children acquired the mutans streptococci between the ages of 5 and 11. twelve families were randomly selected from a group of 11-year-old children who were known to have acquired mutans streptococci during this age period. from the saliva of the mothers (n = 12), fathers (n = 8) and children (n = 12) approximately 30 mutans streptococci strains were isolated. all isolates were tested twice for bacteriocin activity against 21 indicator strains  with a double-layer technique. bacteriocin activity of strains was considered to  be different when the number of strains against which bacteriocin was produced differed >1 or when the width of one or more inhibition zones differed > or =4 mm. in 7/12 mother-child pairs similar profiles were found. in the 8 father-child pairs similar profiles were only found on 2 occasions. in these 2 families, all 3 ( mother, father and child) harboured strains with a similar profile. in 4/8 father-mother pairs similar profiles were found. there was no correlation between the prevalence of mutans streptococci strains, the number of indicator strains against which the strains made bacteriocin, nor the mean size of the inhibition zones and the presence of similarity of bacteriocin activity profiles of mutans streptococci within the family members. the results show that even when a child acquires mutans streptococci after the age of 5, there may be similarity between  mutans streptococci in mother, father and child, indicating that transmission between the family members occurs.

TI  == anti-adhesive and antibacterial properties of a proprietary denture cleanser.
AB  == the antimicrobial efficacy and anti-adhesive attributes of a proprietary denture  cleanser were evaluated. to determine cleanser antimicrobial efficacy, streptococcus mutans was grown on denture acrylic strips which were then exposed  to the cleanser. to evaluate anti-adhesive efficacy, the strips were treated with the cleanser and then placed in the strep. mutans suspension. following incubation, adhered bacteria were removed and enumerated by viable counting. treated denture acrylic plates were also placed in a parallel-plate flow chamber  and then exposed to strep. oralis. images of adhered bacteria were analysed to determine biofilm coverage. biofilm removal force was quantified by increasing the flow rate between the acrylic plates. the cleanser exhibited a 100% kill against strep. mutans adhered to the acrylic surface, and inhibited attachment of cells by 66%. the flow chamber study found that cleanser-treated denture acrylic  allowed the formation of a multilayer biofilm which was easily removed by a slight increase in flow rate.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == automated immunofluorescence for enumeration of selected taxa in supragingival dental plaque.
AB  == the present study investigated a recently developed automated image analysis technique for its applicability to the enumeration of selected bacteria in supragingival dental plaque. following initial calibration, the system is capable to count fluorescence-labeled target cells in up to 48 samples without user interference. test samples contained a characteristic mixture of planktonic bacteria, small almost planar bacterial aggregates, and large, virtually indisruptable clumps with cells from multiple species. due to their complex composition, these samples provided a challenging validation step for the image analysis system. automated enumeration of target bacteria was compared with visual counting of the fluorescence-labeled bacteria. results are shown for six taxa (actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prev. nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii/strep. oralis/strep. sanguis, strep. sobrinus, and veillonella dispar/ v. parvula) with characteristic differences in abundance, cell morphology and aggregation behavior. results revealed good correspondence between the two enumeration techniques (correlation  coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) provided that the portion of target bacteria exceeded 0.05% of the total bacterial cell number. this work demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of fully automated immunofluorescence to analyze such complex ecosystems as supragingival dental plaque.

TI  == expression of green fluorescent protein in streptococcus gordonii dl1 and its use as a species-specific marker in coadhesion with streptococcus oralis 34 in saliva-conditioned biofilms in vitro.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii is one of the predominant streptococci in the biofilm ecology of the oral cavity. it interacts with other bacteria through receptor-adhesin complexes formed between cognate molecules on the surfaces of the partner cells. to study the spatial organization of s. gordonii dl1 in oral biofilms, we used green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a species-specific marker to identify s. gordonii in a two-species in vitro oral biofilm flowcell system. to drive expression of gfp, we isolated and characterized an endogenous s. gordonii  promoter, phppa, which is situated upstream of the chromosomal hppa gene encoding an oligopeptide-binding lipoprotein. a chromosomal chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene fusion with phppa was constructed and used to demonstrate that phppa was highly active throughout the growth of bacteria in batch culture. a promoterless 0.8-kb gfp ('gfp) cassette was pcr amplified from pbj169 and subcloned to replace the cat cassette downstream of the s. gordonii-derived phppa in pmh109-hpp, generating pma1. subsequently, the phppa-'gfp cassette was pcr amplified from pma1 and subcloned into pdl277 and pva838 to generate the escherichia coli-s. gordonii shuttle vectors pma2 and pma3, respectively. each vector was transformed into s. gordonii dl1 aerobically  to ensure gfp expression. flow cytometric analyses of aerobically grown transformant cultures were performed over a 24-h period, and results showed that  gfp could be successfully expressed in s. gordonii dl1 from phppa and that s. gordonii dl1 transformed with the phppa-'gfp fusion plasmid stably maintained the fluorescent phenotype. fluorescent s. gordonii dl1 transformants were used to elucidate the spatial arrangement of s. gordonii dl1 alone in biofilms or with the coadhesion partner streptococcus oralis 34 in two-species biofilms in a saliva-conditioned in vitro flowcell system. these results show for the first time that gfp expression in oral streptococci can be used as a species-specific marker in model oral biofilms.

TI  == in vitro colonisation of acrylic resin denture base materials by streptococcus oralis and actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == aim: the aim of the study was to compare the attachment of two typical strains of oral bacteria to four denture base materials. design: in vitro study. method: discs of acrylic resin denture base materials (paladon 65, polished and unpolished; palapress; microbase, polished and unpolished, and triad vlc) were placed into petri dishes with schaedler's medium, inoculated with streptococcus oralis 34 or actinomyces viscosus t14v. main outcome measures: after 24 h or 48 h the numbers of adhering bacteria were measured. results: the bacteria adhered to  all discs in similar numbers: 3-9 x 10(6)/ml (viable cell count) and 9-22 x 10(8)/ml (total cell count) for t14v, and 2-6 x 10(6)/ml (viable cell count) and  1.5-3 x 10(8)/ml (total cell count) for 34. conclusions: polishing had little effect on adherence. denture base materials are not resistant against adherence and possible surface damage by oral bacteria. therefore, thorough oral hygiene is important for denture wearers.

TI  == genotypic heterogeneity of streptococcus oralis and distinct aciduric subpopulations in human dental plaque.
AB  == the genotypic heterogeneity of streptococcus oralis isolated from the oral cavity was investigated using repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr. unrelated subjects  harbored unique genotypes, with numerous genotypes being isolated from an individual. s. oralis is the predominant aciduric bacterium isolated from noncarious tooth sites. genotypic comparison of the aciduric populations isolated at ph 5.2 with those isolated from mitis-salivarius agar (msa) (ph 7.0) indicated that the aciduric populations were genotypically distinct in the majority of subjects (chi(2) = 13.09; p = 0.0031). neither the aciduric nor the msa-isolated  strains were stable, with no strains isolated at baseline being isolated 4 or 12  weeks later in the majority of subjects. the basis of this instability is unknown but is similar to that reported for streptococcus mitis. examination of s. oralis strains isolated from cohabiting couples demonstrated that in three of five couples, genotypically identical strains were isolated from both partners and this was confirmed by using salmonella enteritidis repetitive element pcr and enterobacterial pcr typing. these data provide further evidence of the physiological and genotypic heterogeneity of non-mutans streptococci. the demonstration of distinct aciduric populations of s. oralis implies that the role of these and other non-mutans streptococci in the caries process requires reevaluation.

TI  == characterization of bacterial orofacial infections using a new murine model.
AB  == we devised a new murine orofacial infection model using bacteria from odontogenic infection origins and characterized the experimental infections. in this model, bacteria were injected into the submandible of mice. streptococcus constellatus and peptostreptococcus micros produced a single abscess at the injection site and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were low: the median abscess-forming dose (af(50)) of s. constellatus and p. micros were 10(8.5-10.7)and 10(10.2-10.6)cfu/mouse, and their median lethal dose (ld(50)) were >11 and 10(10.6-11)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum produced multiple abscesses and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were strong: af(50)of p. oralis and f. nucleatum were 10(6.0-6.4)and 10(7. 0-8.7)cfu/mouse, and their ld(50)were 10(7.0-7.7)and 10(8.3-9. 9)cfu/mouse, respectively. ld(50)of p. intermedia and p. gingivalis were 10(9.4->11)and 10(8.9-9.1)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis generated a necrotizing lesion, which progressed rapidly. we conclude  that this murine model could reflect human orofacial odontogenic infections and is useful to investigate the pathogenicity of causative bacteria of such infections.

TI  == the influence of oral bacteria on the surfaces of resin-based dental restorative  materials--an in vitro study.
AB  == three tooth-coloured, resin-based restorative materials (charisma, dyract, and pertac) were exposed to typical oral bacteria (s. mutans, s. oralis and a. naeslundii) over a period of up to 35 days. the three strains of bacteria all colonised the resin-based materials within a few hours and formed thick bacterial films. determination of the bacterial glucose consumption and lactate production  during the incubation period showed no difference from the controls which contained no resin samples. following the experimental exposure, the materials were examined by scanning electron microscopy (sem) for possible surface damage and roughness was measured in a perthometer. little damage to the resin-based composite material surfaces (charisma, pertac) could be observed, whereas the polyacid-modified composite material (dyract) showed greater damage. there was a  significant difference in the resin surface roughness after exposure to s. mutans and to a. naeslundii. the study clearly showed that the bacteria used strongly adhered to the resin-based restorative materials. as a consequence of bacterial colonisation and/or poor oral hygiene, damage to the restorative materials might  develop. this suggests the need for dentists to evaluate personal oral hygiene, along with general indications and economic factors, in selecting materials for restorations, since the known anti-bacterial properties of amalgam are considerable.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == purification, characterization, and molecular analysis of the gene encoding glucosyltransferase from streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis is a member of the oral streptococcal family and an early-colonizing microorganism in the oral cavity of humans. s. oralis is known to produce glucosyltransferase (gtase), which synthesizes glucans from sucrose. the enzyme was purified chromatographically from a culture supernatant of s. oralis atcc 10557. the purified enzyme, gtase-r, had a molecular mass of 173 kda  and a pi of 6.3. this enzyme mainly synthesized water-soluble glucans with no primer dependency. the addition of gtase markedly enhanced the sucrose-dependent  resting cell adhesion of streptococcus mutans at a level similar to that found in growing cells of s. mutans. the antibody against gtase-r inhibited the glucan-synthesizing activities of streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguis, as well as s. oralis. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of gtase-r exhibited no similarities to known gtase sequences of oral streptococci. using degenerate pcr primers, an 8.1-kb dna fragment, carrying the gene (gtfr) coding for gtase-r and its regulator gene (rgg), was cloned and sequenced. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the rgg genes of s. oralis and s. gordonii exhibited a close similarity. the gtfr gene was found to possess a species-specific nucleotide sequence corresponding to the n-terminal 130 amino acid residues. insertion of erm or apha into the rgg or gtfr gene resulted in decreased gtase activity by the organism and changed the colony morphology of these transformants. these results indicate that s. oralis gtase may play an important role in the subsequent colonizing of mutans streptoccoci.

TI  == crohn disease arthropathy: antigens in synovial fluid share epitopes with strains of two species of viridans streptococci.
AB  == background: there is evidence to suggest that crohn disease is caused by an immunologic response to an unknown intestinal luminal antigen, probably of bacterial origin. the reported demonstration of yersinia antigen in the synovial  fluid of patients with yersinosis therefore prompted a search for bacterial antigens in the synovial fluid of patients with crohn arthropathy. methods: antisera were raised in rabbits to synovial fluids obtained from seven patients with crohn arthropathy and from seven 'control' subjects with other forms of arthropathy. these antisera were used to probe sonicates of the bacteria cultured from the gastric juice of patients with gastric crohn disease. results: the antisera made from the crohn synovial fluids, but none of those made from the controls, reacted uniquely with antigens in sonicates of strains of two species of viridans streptococci (streptococcus parasanguis and an atypical s. oralis) isolated from four of the five patients with gastric crohn disease. conclusions:  these findings suggest that the arthropathy of crohn disease and, possibly, the intestinal disease itself may involve an immunologically mediated inflammatory response to these antigens.

TI  == isolation and characterisation of sialidase from a strain of streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis, the most virulent of the viridans streptococci, produces a  sialidase and this exo-glycosidase has been implicated in the disease process of  a number of pathogens. the sialidase of s. oralis strain ar3 was purified in order to understand the characteristics of this putative virulence determinant. the enzyme isolated as a high mol. wt aggregate (c. 325 kda) was purified 4520-fold from late exponential phase cultures by a combination of ultrafiltration, ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. the sialidase component had a mol.wt of 144 kda as determined by  sds-page analysis. the purified sialidase released n-acetylneuraminic acid from a range of sialoglycoconjugates including human alpha1-acid glycoprotein, bovine submaxillary mucin, colominic acid and sialyl-alpha2,3- and sialyl-alpha2,6-lactose. also, n-glycolylneuraminic acid was cleaved from bovine  submaxillary mucin. the sialidase had a km of 11.8 microm for alpha1-acid glycoprotein, was active over a broad ph range with a ph optimum of 6.0 and cleaved alpha2,3-, alpha2,6- and alpha2-8-sialyl glycosidic linkages with a marked preference for alpha2,3-linkages. the enzyme was competitively inhibited by the sialic acid derivative, 2,3-dehydro-n-acetylneuraminic acid, with a k(ic)  of 1.2 microm. the characteristics of the purified sialidase would support a nutritional role for this enzyme that may be significant in the proliferation of  this organism in the oral cavity and at extra-oral sites in association with life-threatening infections.

TI  == lack of association between streptococcus oralis and recurrent aphthous stomatitis.
AB  == in the present study, the potential involvement of streptococcus oralis in the aetiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (ras) was investigated using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). biopsies from 28 ras patients were analysed, in  addition to 20 oral lichen planus (olp) and 13 normal biopsies that were used as  controls. pcr was carried out using a primer pair that targets the d-alanine:d-alanine ligase gene and detects dna from both s. oralis and the closely related species streptococcus mitis. discrimination between these two species was achieved by digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases haeiii and hindiii, which both give distinct restriction profiles for each species. s. oralis dna was detected in 8 of 28 (29%) ras samples, 10 of  20 (50%) olp samples and 6 of 13 (46%) normal samples. these results suggest that s. oralis is not of primary aetiological significance in ras.

TI  == co-aggregation as a virulent factor of streptococcus sanguis isolated from infective endocarditis.
AB  == the pathogenicity of strains of the streptococcus sanguis group, isolated from infective endcarditis, was studied by measuring the development of subcutaneous abscesses in mice after infection with s. sanguis and actinomyces viscosus either singly or as co-aggregated pairs. the pathogenicity of the co-aggregates was also examined in various viable combinations of the two bacterial species. more abscesses were formed by a. viscosus than the s. sanguis group including clinical isolates. abscess formation by co-aggregates of combinations of each isolate and  a. viscosus produced a higher percentage of abscess formation than those caused by infection with a pure suspension of a. viscosus or tested streptococci. co-aggregated cells were more resistant to phagocytosis and killing by neutrophils in vivo. these results indicated that s. sanguis group streptococci isolated from infective endocarditis are able to co-aggregate and resist phagocytosis. the ability of co-aggregation of s. sanguis may serve as a survival mechanism in a host defense system and may be linked with virulence of this bacteria.

TI  == genetic relationships between clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mitis: characterization of "atypical" pneumococci and organisms allied to s. mitis harboring s. pneumoniae virulence factor-encoding genes.
AB  == the oral streptococcal group (mitis phylogenetic group) currently consists of nine recognized species, although the group has been traditionally difficult to classify, with frequent changes in nomenclature over the years. the pneumococcus  (streptococcus pneumoniae), an important human pathogen, is traditionally distinguished from the most closely related oral streptococcal species streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis on the basis of three differentiating characteristics: optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, and agglutination with antipneumococcal polysaccharide capsule antibodies. however, there are many reports in the literature of pneumococci lacking one or more of these defining characteristics. sometimes called "atypical" pneumococci, these isolates can be the source of considerable confusion in the clinical laboratory.  little is known to date about the genetic relationships of such organisms with classical s. pneumoniae isolates. here we describe these relationships based on sequence analysis of housekeeping genes in comparison with previously characterized isolates of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis. while most pneumococci were found to represent a closely related group these studies identified a subgroup of atypical pneumococcal isolates (bile insoluble and/or "acapsular") distinct from, though most closely related to, the "typical" pneumococcal isolates. however, a large proportion of isolates, found to be atypical on the basis of capsule reaction alone, did group with typical pneumococci, suggesting that they have either lost capsule production or represent as-yet-unrecognized capsular types. in contrast to typical s. pneumoniae, isolates phenotypically identified as s. mitis and s. oralis, which included isolates previously characterized in taxonomic studies, were genetically diverse. while most of the s. oralis isolates did fall into a well-separated group, s. mitis isolates did not cluster into a well-separated group. during the  course of these studies we also identified a number of potentially important pathogenic isolates, which were frequently associated with respiratory disease, that phenotypically and genetically are most closely related to s. mitis but which harbor genes encoding the virulence determinants pneumolysin and autolysin  classically associated with s. pneumoniae.

TI  == adhesion of candida albicans to oral streptococci is promoted by selective adsorption of salivary proteins to the streptococcal cell surface.
AB  == adhesion of candida albicans to saliva-coated surfaces is an important early step in the colonization of the oral cavity. c. albicans cells also adhere to several  species of oral streptococci including streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguinis in what are believed to be multi-modal interactions. it is now demonstrated that incubation of streptococcal cells of these species with human parotid saliva further promotes the adhesion of c. albicans cells by up to 2-3-fold. various species of streptococci were shown to adsorb different protein components of parotid saliva to their cell surfaces. the basic proline-rich proteins (bprps), to which c. albicans cells bind on nitrocellulose blot overlay, were strongly adsorbed to the surface of s. gordonii cells but not to s. oralis cells. parotid saliva that was pre-adsorbed with s. gordonii cells and then applied to hydroxylapatite beads was <50% effective at supporting adhesion of c. albicans compared with control (non-adsorbed) saliva, demonstrating that bprps are major pellicle receptors. c. albicans cells did not  adsorb bprps from fluid-phase parotid saliva. following size-exclusion chromatography of parotid saliva samples, pooled fractions enriched in bprps promoted maximal adhesion of c. albicans to s. gordonii cells. the results demonstrate that c. albicans cells recognize only surface-bound forms of bprps and suggest that these proteins adsorbed to enamel or to streptococcal surfaces promote c. albicans adhesion and oral colonization.

TI  == cleavage of a recombinant human immunoglobulin a2 (iga2)-iga1 hybrid antibody by  certain bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == to understand more about the factors influencing the cleavage of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) by microbial iga1 proteases, a recombinant human iga2/iga1 hybrid molecule was generated. in the hybrid, termed iga2/a1 half hinge, a seven-amino-acid sequence corresponding to one half of the duplicated sequence making up the iga1 hinge was incorporated into the equivalent site in iga2. insertion of the iga1 half hinge into iga2 did not affect antigen binding capacity or the functional activity of the hybrid molecule, as judged by its ability to bind to iga fcalpha receptors and trigger respiratory bursts in neutrophils. although the iga2/a1 hybrid contained only half of the iga1 hinge, it was found to be cleaved by a variety of different bacterial iga1 proteases, including representatives of those that cleave iga1 in the different duplicated halves of the hinge, namely, those of prevotella melaninogenica, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. sanguis, neisseria meningitidis types 1 and 2, n. gonorrhoeae types 1 and 2, and haemophilus influenzae type 2. thus, for these enzymes the recognition site for iga1 cleavage is contained within half of the iga1 hinge region; additional distal elements, if required, are provided by either an iga1 or an iga2 framework. in contrast, the iga2/a1 hybrid appeared to be resistant to cleavage with s. oralis and some h. influenzae type 1 iga1 proteases, suggesting  these enzymes require additional determinants for efficient substrate recognition.

TI  == periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in behcet's disease.
AB  == background: behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. the aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. methods: thirty-three patients with behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. serum igg antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. results: significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus  oralis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with behcet's disease than in controls (p <0.001-0.05). in contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 compared to controls (p <0.01). conclusions: our data indicate that the patients with behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.

AB  == an internal fragment of the ddl gene, encoding the cytoplasmic enzyme d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase, was sequenced from 566 isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae and single isolates of streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis. the 52 alleles found among the s. pneumoniae isolates fell into two groups. group a alleles were very uniform in sequence and were present in both penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant pneumococci. group b alleles were much more diverse and were found only in penicillin-resistant isolates. the streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis alleles were less diverged from group a alleles than some of the group b pneumococcal alleles, suggesting that the latter alleles contain interspecies recombinational replacements. the ddl gene was located 783 bp downstream of the penicillin-binding protein 2b gene (pbp2b). sequencing of the pbp2b-recr-ddl-murf region of three penicillin-resistant pneumococci that had diverged ddl alleles showed that the whole region from pbp2b to ddl (or beyond) was highly diverged (about 8%) compared with the sequences from three penicillin-susceptible isolates. the high  levels of diversity in the group b ddl alleles from penicillin-resistant isolates were ascribed to a hitchhiking effect whereby interspecies recombinational exchanges at pbp2b, selected by penicillin usage, often extend into, or through,  the ddl gene. the data allow the average size of the interspecies recombinational replacements to be estimated at about 6 kb.

TI  == systemic doxycycline administration in the treatment of periodontal infections (ii). effect on antibiotic resistance of subgingival species.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). saliva samples as  well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. all subjects received full mouth srp and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. control subjects were sampled at the same time points. samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in pras ringer's solution and plated on enriched trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the mann whitney test and over time within each group using the quade test. the mean % (+/-sem) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to  25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. in saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling  to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. the % of resistant isolates did  not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. for all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus constellatus, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus gordonii, eikenella corrodens and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. doxycycline resistant strains of these  species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.

TI  == prevalence of the amylase-binding protein a gene (abpa) in oral streptococci.
AB  == salivary amylase binds specifically to a number of oral streptococcal species. this interaction may play an important role in dental plaque formation. recently, a 585-bp gene was cloned and sequenced from streptococcus gordonii challis encoding a 20.5-kda amylase-binding protein (abpa). the goal of this study was to determine if related genes are present in other species of oral streptococci. biotinylated abpa was used in southern blot analysis to screen genomic dna from several strains representing eight species of oral streptococci. this probe hybridized with a 4.0-kb hindiii restriction fragment from all 13 strains of s. gordonii tested. the probe did not appear to bind to any restriction fragments from other species of amylase-binding oral streptococci including streptococcus mitis (with the exception of 1 of 14 strains), streptococcus crista (3 strains),  streptococcus anginosus (1 strain), and streptococcus parasanguinis (1 strain), or to non-amylase-binding oral streptococci including streptococcus sanguinis (3  strains), streptococcus oralis (4 strains), and streptococcus mutans (1 strain).  primers homologous to sequences within the 3' and 5' ends of abpa yielded products of 400 bp following pcr of genomic dna from the southern blot-positive strains. several of these pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the levels of similarity of these cloned products to the abpa of s. gordonii challis ranged from 91 to 96%. these studies reveal that the abpa gene appears to be specific to s. gordonii and differs from genes encoding amylase-binding proteins from other species of amylase-binding streptococci.

AB  == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15  species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr  products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and  by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna  patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis,  streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.

TI  == isolation of bacteria from cervical lymph nodes in patients with oral cancer.
AB  == thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. all 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent  extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection)  with free flap reconstruction. a total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. bacterial translocation was found more  often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional  lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). as the gingival carcinoma group includes more t4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved  nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. oral streptococci (streptococcus intermedius, strep. constellatus, strep. oralis, strep. mitis, strep. sanguis, strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. aerobic enteric bacteria (enterococcus, escherichia, klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. among the anaerobic bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer  might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain  the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.

TI  == inhibitory effects of oolong tea extract on caries-inducing properties of mutans  streptococci.
AB  == the inhibitory effects of oolong tea extract (ote) on the caries-inducing properties of mutans streptococci were examined in vitro. ote reduced the rate of acid production by mutans streptococci accompanied with the retardation of growth rate of mutans streptococci, while the action by chromatographically isolated oolong tea polyphenol (otf6) was weak. on the other hand, both oolong tea products decreased cell surface hydrophobicity of almost all the oral streptococci examined in the present study, and also induced cellular aggregation of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus gordonii. in these reactions, otf6 showed a more pronounced activity than ote. furthermore, the oolong tea products inhibited the adherence of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. these results suggest that otf6 may inhibit bacterial adherence to the tooth surfaces by reducing the hydrophobicity of mutans streptococci, and ote may inhibit caries-inducing activity of mutans streptococci by reducing the rate of acid production.

TI  == genetic approaches to the identification of the mitis group within the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the usefulness and reliability of partial sequence analysis of the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (soda), autolysin (lyta) gene amplification and species-specific pcr based on the d-alanine:d-alanine ligase (ddl) gene for differentiating each member of the mitis group of the genus streptococcus was investigated. on the phylogenetic tree based on soda partial sequences (366 bp) from 96 strains, including all species currently within the mitis group isolated in different geographic areas (mainly japan and the uk), eight well separated clusters were generated corresponding to recognized species, and all strains fell into those clusters to which they had also been assigned by  dna-dna hybridization. the streptococcus pneumoniae sub-cluster was located within the streptococcus mitis cluster, but the soda gene of s. pneumoniae was very conserved and therefore could be separated from all other species examined.  furthermore, the lyta gene amplification approach could also be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from other species. the species-specific amplification product of the ddl gene was successfully detected in streptococcus  sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii, but failed to be detected in some strains of streptococcus oralis including the type strain and s. mitis. we conclude that  the partial sequence analysis of the soda gene could be applied globally as a reliable and easy method for the accurate identification of all species currently within the mitis group.

TI  == n-acetylneuraminic acid transport by streptococcus oralis strain ar3.
AB  == streptococcus oralis has emerged as one of the most important organisms of the viridans streptococcus group in terms of infections and is recognised as an agent of infective endocarditis and, in immunocompromised patients, septicaemia. the mechanisms by which this organism proliferates in vivo are unknown. however, host-derived sialic acids -- including n-acetylneuraminic acid (neunac) which is  present in serum and cell-associated glycoproteins -- are a potential source of fermentable carbohydrate for bacterial proliferation, especially for sialidase-producing bacteria, including s. oralis. to further elucidate the role  of neunac in supporting growth, this study determined the ability of s. oralis strain ar3 (isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis) to transport neunac and characterised the transport system. the transport of [14c]-labelled neunac into s. oralis was monitored and this transport system was induced by growth of the bacteria in the presence of the n-acetylated sugars neunac, n-acetylglucosamine and n-acetylmannosamine. the transport system followed typical michaelis-menten kinetics, with a km of 21.0 microm and a vmax of 2.65 nmoles of neunac transported/min/mg of dry cell mass. neunac transport was inhibited by the presence of exogenous n-glycolylneuraminic acid, a related sialic acid. chlorhexidine, naf and 2,4-dinitrophenol were potent inhibitors of the transport system, suggesting that the uptake of neunac occurs via a proton motive force-dependent permease system. this is the first report of the mechanism by which neunac transport occurs in pathogenic streptococci. this transport process may have relevance to the acquisition of a source of fermentable carbohydrate and thus bacterial proliferation in vivo.

TI  == the pattern of change in salivary immunoglobulins and antibodies to s. mitis and  s. oralis in children undergoing bone marrow transplantation: use of an indirect  method of assessment.
AB  == the objective of this study was to assess the pattern of change in salivary immunoglobulins and antibodies to s. mitis and s. oralis in 23 children following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and their matched controls. to overcome the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient quantity of whole saliva from very young, sick children saliva was collected in a 5-ml oral rinse of sterile normal  saline. it was not possible to measure the volume of whole saliva in each rinse and the concentration of the salivary immunoglobulins and bacterial antibodies were estimated from 1 ml of oral rinse. despite these shortcomings a pattern of change in the mean concentrations of total salivary iga, secretory iga, antibodies to s. mitis and s. oralis and total igg at specific event- related times during the transplantation period has been demonstrated. there was a significant increase in the concentration of salivary igg 7 days post-transplantation, followed by significant decreases in total salivary iga, secretory iga and antibodies to s. mitis after recovery of the peripheral neutrophil count above 0.5 x 10(9). the concentrations of total iga and antibodies to s. oralis was significantly greater in the transplant group 119 days post-transplantation.

TI  == antiphosphorylcholine antibody levels are elevated in humans with periodontal diseases.
AB  == human immunoglobulin g2 (igg2) serum concentrations and the igg2 antibody response to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans can be influenced by genes, by environmental factors such as smoking, and by periodontal disease status. examination of the igg2 response to phosphorylcholine (pc), a response thought to be mainly induced by the c polysaccharide of streptococcus pneumoniae, suggested  that periodontal disease status was also associated with this response. this prompted the hypothesis that pc is an important oral antigen associated with organisms in the periodontal flora and that anti-pc antibody is elevated as a consequence of periodontal disease. subjects in various periodontal disease diagnostic categories in which attachment loss is exhibited were tested for anti-pc in serum. those with adult periodontitis, localized juvenile periodontitis, generalized early-onset periodontitis, and gingival recession all  had similar levels of anti-pc igg2 serum antibody which were significantly greater than in the group of subjects with no attachment loss. analysis of plaque samples from subgingival and supragingival sites in all diseases categories for reactivity with the anti-pc specific monoclonal antibody tepc-15 revealed that a  substantial proportion of the bacteria in dental plaque (30 to 40%) bear pc antigen; this antigen was not restricted to morphotypes resembling only cocci but was also present on rods and branched filamentous organisms. we found that s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguis, as well as oral actinomycetes, including a. viscosus, a. odontolyticus, and a. israelii, incorporated substantial amounts of  [(3)h]choline from culture media. further analysis of antigens derived from these organisms by western blot indicated that s. oralis, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. odontolyticus, and a. israelii contained tepc-15-reactive antigens. the data show that many commonly occurring bacterial species found in dental plaque contain pc  antigen and that immunization with plaque-derived pc antigens as a consequence of inflammation and periodontal attachment loss may influence systemic anti-pc antibody concentrations.

TI  == growth of viridans streptococci on human serum alpha1-acid glycoprotein.
AB  == viridans streptococci have emerged as major opportunistic pathogens. we suggest that for these bacteria to proliferate in vivo and cause disease, they must utilize host tissue components. we have therefore examined the ability of all recognized species of viridans streptococci to liberate and utilize the constituent sugars of the glycans of the extensively sialylated human serum alpha1-acid glycoprotein (agp) as the sole source of carbohydrate to support in vitro growth. analysis of residual glycans following bacterial growth was performed by high-ph anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. only those species which produced sialidase-namely, streptococcus oralis, s. intermedius, and s. defectivus--grew on agp. the extent of degradation of glycans was dependent on the particular glycosidases produced by the bacteria. s. defectivus produced only a sialidase which released the terminal n-acetylneuraminic acid residues of the glycans, and the liberated sugar was utilized. s. intermedius also produced beta-galactosidase and beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase, which removed galactose and n-acetylglucosamine from desialylated glycans, all of which again were utilized by the organism. s. oralis produced beta-galactosidase, beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase, and alpha-fucosidase and novel alpha- and beta-mannosidases which were apparent only  from the analysis of the residual sugars of agp. s. oralis cleaved all the sugars from agp except for 22% of the n-acetylglucosamine. the residual n-acetylglucosamine residues remaining were those linked to the asparagine of the peptide backbone. all the monosaccharides released by s. oralis from agp, with the exception of fucose, were utilized. sialidase production may be a key factor  for growth of these species of viridans streptococci on glycoproteins in vivo, since they are commonly associated with extra-oral diseases, with s. oralis emerging as an important pathogen.

TI  == molecular relationships and antimicrobial susceptibilities of viridans group streptococci isolated from blood of neutropenic cancer patients.
AB  == from january 1995 to may 1998, 57 episodes of bacteremia due to viridans group streptococci were identified in 50 febrile neutropenic patients with hematologic  malignancies. four patients experienced two separate episodes of streptococcal bacteremia, and one patient had four separate episodes of streptococcal bacteremia. strains were identified to species level as streptococcus mitis (n =  37), streptococcus oralis (n = 19), and streptococcus salivarius (n = 1). epidemiologic relatedness of these strains was studied by using pcr-based fingerprinting with m13 and eric-2 primers and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with restriction enzyme smai. all strains that were isolated from different patients exhibited unique fingerprint patterns, thus suggesting that viridans group streptococcal bacteremia usually derives from an endogenous source. cross-transmission of strains between patients could not be established. four s.  mitis isolates recovered during four separate bacteremic episodes in a single patient had identical fingerprint patterns. susceptibility testing was carried out by broth microdilution technique according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. the mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited were (in milligrams per liter) as follows: 0. 5 (penicillin), 0.5 (amoxicillin), 0.25 (cefotaxime), 2 (chloramphenicol), 4 (erythromycin), 0.5 (clindamycin), >/=32 (tetracycline), >/=32 (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), 4 (ciprofloxacin), 0.5 (sparfloxacin), 0.5 (vancomycin), 0.25 (teicoplanin), and 1  (quinupristin-dalfopristin). high-level penicillin resistance (mic, >/=4 mg/liter) was found in one isolate only, but intermediate penicillin resistance was noted in 11 isolates (19%). resistance rates to other drugs were as follows:  7% (amoxicillin), 4% (cefotaxime), 4% (chloramphenicol), 32% (erythromycin), 9% (clindamycin), 39% (tetracycline), 68% (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), 23% (ciprofloxacin), 0% (sparfloxacin), 0% (vancomycin), 0% (teicoplanin), and 0% (quinupristin-dalfopristin).

TI  == genetic diversity of the streptococcal competence (com) gene locus.
AB  == the com operon of naturally transformable streptococcal species contains three genes, comc, comd, and come, involved in the regulation of competence. the comc gene encodes a competence-stimulating peptide (csp) thought to induce competence  in the bacterial population at a critical extracellular concentration. the comd and come genes are believed to encode the transmembrane histidine kinase and response regulator proteins, respectively, of a two-component regulator, with the comd-encoded protein being a receptor for csp. here we report on the genetic variability of comc and comd within streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. comparative analysis of sequence variations of comc and comd shows that, despite  evidence for horizontal gene transfer at this locus and the lack of transformability of many s. pneumoniae strains in the laboratory, there is a clear correlation between the presence of a particular comc allele and the cognate comd allele. these findings effectively rule out the possibility that the presence of noncognate comc and comd alleles may be responsible for the inability to induce competence in many isolates and indicate the importance of a functional com pathway in these isolates. in addition, we describe a number of novel csps from disease-associated strains of s. mitis and s. oralis. the csps from these isolates are much more closely related to those from s. pneumoniae than to most csps previously reported from s. mitis and s. oralis, suggesting that these particular organisms may be a potential source of dna in recombination events generating the mosaic structures commonly reported in genes of s. pneumoniae that are under strong selective pressure.

TI  == sequential deglycosylation and utilization of the n-linked, complex-type glycans  of human alpha1-acid glycoprotein mediates growth of streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis is the agent of a large number of infections in immunocompromised patients, but little is known regarding the mechanisms by which this fermentative organism proliferates in vivo. glycoproteins are widespread within the circulation and host tissues, and could provide a source of fermentable carbohydrate for the growth of those pathogenic organisms with the capacity to release monosaccharides from glycans via the production of specific glycosidases. the ability of acute phase serum alpha1-acid glycoprotein to support growth of s.oralis in vitro has been examined as a model for growth of this organism on n-linked glycoproteins. growth was accompanied by the production of a range of glycosidases (sialidase, n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase, and beta-d-galactosidase) as measured using the 4-methylumbelliferone-linked substrates. the residual glycoprotein glycans remaining during growth of this organism were released by treatment with hydrazine and their analysis by hpaec-pad and maldi demonstrated extensive degradation of all glycan chains with  only terminal n-acetylglucosamine residues attached to asparagines of the protein backbone remaining when growth was complete. monosaccharides were released sequentially from the glycans by s.oralis glycosidases in the order sialic acid,  galactose, fucose, nonterminal n-acetylglucosamine, and mannose due to the actions of exo-glycosidic activities, including mannosidases which have not previously been reported for s.oralis. all released monosaccharides were metabolized during growth with the exception of fucose which remained free in culture supernatants. direct release of oligosaccharides was not observed, indicating the absence of endo-glycosidases in s.oralis. we propose that this mechanism of deglycosylation of host glycoproteins and the subsequent utilization of released monosaccharides is important in the survival and persistence of this  and other pathogenic bacteria in vivo.

TI  == acid-induced acid tolerance and acidogenicity of non-mutans streptococci.
AB  == acid tolerance and acidogenicity of non-mutans streptococci and their capacity of acid adaptation were studied. the cells of non-mutans streptococci (streptococcus sanguis [streptococcus sanguinis], streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis) grown at ph 7.0 showed 0.0088% to 71% viability after acidification at ph 4.0 for 60 min, whereas the cells of mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans) were not killed by the acidification. washed cells of non-mutans streptococci lowered ph to 4.04-4.33 in the presence of glucose, while mutans streptococci cells lowered ph to 3.70. when the growth ph was shifted to 5.5 for 30-90 min, the viability of non-mutans streptococci after the acidification at ph 4.0 for 60 min increased (0.25% to 91%) and the minimum ph values of the cells in the presence of glucose decreased (3.90 4.19). along with  the increase in acid tolerance and acidogenicity, non-mutans streptococci increased activities of h(+)-atpase and arginine deiminase and amounts of stress  proteins cross-reacting with 60 kda and 70 kda heat shock proteins (hsp60 and hsp70). these results indicate that non-mutans streptococci were capable of increasing their acid tolerance and acidogenicity in response to environmental acidification. furthermore, it is suggested that the acid adaptation observed in  non-mutans streptococci cells could involve the induction of h(+)-atpase, arginine deiminase and stress protein syntheses. the strains of non-mutans streptococci, which are pioneer bacteria for dental plaque formation and predominant in plaque microbial flora, may play a significant role in shifting the dental plaque environment toward acidic and consequently promoting the colonization of more acid-tolerant and acidogenic bacteria such as mutans streptococci and lactobacilli.

TI  == microbiota of successful osseointegrated dental implants.
AB  == background: the long-term survival of dental implants depends, in part, on control of bacterial infection in the peri-implant region. periodontal pathogens  colonized implants symptomatic through infection, whereas the microbiota of successful implants was similar to that of periodontal health. this study examined the impact on the peri-implant microbiota of crown restorations; implant type; length of time of loading; history of implant or periodontal infections; and whether implants replaced single or multiple teeth. it was of particular interest to evaluate implant colonization by species in a newly described red complex of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus. methods: this study sampled 43 partially edentulous subjects with successfully osseointegrated titanium root-form dental implants. eighty-one (81)  non-submerged and 20 submerged asymptomatic implants, 83 crowned, and 36 uncrowned teeth were sampled from peri-implant or subgingival sites. the microbiota of samples was evaluated using whole genomic dna probes in a checkerboard assay to 23 subgingival species. results: implants were colonized principally by oral streptococci, capnocytophagae, veillonella parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the periodontal species,  p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and campylobacter rectus were detected in a few subjects. the microbiota around crowned implants and crowned teeth was similar. streptococcus oralis, p. intermedia, and selenomonas noxia were elevated in samples from uncrowned teeth compared to crowned teeth and implants. microbial complexity increased as loading time increased, but colonization by periodontal pathogens, including red complex  species, was higher in subjects with previous periodontal disease. no differences were observed in the microbiota of 1- and 2-stage implants, or between implants supporting single or multiple restorations. conclusions: while presence of crowns had only a minor impact on the peri-implant microbiota, microbial changes were observed the longer the implants had been in function and in those patients with  a history of periodontal or peri-implant infections. a history of periodontitis had a greater impact on the peri-implant microbiota than implant loading time. the major influence on the peri-implant microbiota was, however, the microbiota on remaining teeth. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, red complex periodontal pathogens, colonized several implants, although all implants were successfully osseointegrated.

AB  == redundancy refers to the observation that many salivary proteins exhibit similar  properties in vitro. it is possible that bacterial adherence to salivary pellicle occurs as a cumulative effect of multiple proteins. this study determined the joint and individual contributions of salivary amylase, s-iga, lysozyme, salivary peroxidase, lactoferrin, and total protein concentrations to adherence by oral viridans streptococci in microplates coated with whole saliva from 123 persons. strains used were: streptococcus gordonii blackburn, 10558, streptococcus mitis 10712, 903, streptococcus oralis 10557, 9811, and streptococcus sanguis 10556, 13379. rabbit antibody against 13379 was used for the detection of adherence. this antibody cross-reacted with all strains. absorbance was standardized against saliva pooled from five donors. all saliva samples had been previously assayed for amylase, lactoferrin, lysozyme, secretory iga, peroxidase, and total protein. adherence scores for all strains except 13379 were significantly and positively correlated. salivas binding high or low levels of one strain tended to bind others correspondingly. multiple regression indicated significant contributions to 10558 adherence from total protein and lactoferrin (positive), and peroxidase  and lysozyme (negative). similar results were obtained for blackburn and 903. significant individual correlations were seen for 9811 and total protein (positive), 10557 and peroxidase (negative), and 13379 and lactoferrin (negative). salivas with high adherence scores contained significantly more protein and lactoferrin, and significantly less peroxidase, than salivas with low adherence scores. these findings support the hypothesis that multiple proteins contribute to the adherence of streptococcal strains in vivo.

TI  == effect of low-molecular-weight chitosans on the adhesive properties of oral streptococci.
AB  == it was previously shown that a low-molecular-weight chitosan and its derivatives  n-carboxymethyl chitosan and imidazolyl chitosan inhibit streptococcus mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite. the ability of the same molecules to interfere with adhesive properties of other oral streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis) was tested. when saliva-coated or -uncoated hydroxyapatite beads were treated with n-carboxymethyl chitosan, a reduction varying from 60% to 98% depending on strains was observed. low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan did not have any effect. growth in n-carboxymethyl chitosan-supplemented medium (final concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 micrograms.ml-1) caused a dose related reduction in the adsorption of all strains to hydroxyapatite and in their affinity towards xylene. no effect was observed with low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan. in contrast to what observed with s. mutans, the three polysaccharides did not affect detachment from hydroxyapatite beads and adherence to cheek epithelial cells of the other streptococci. these results suggest that low-molecular-weight chitosans and/or imidazolyl chitosan, selectively affecting s. mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite, may be very interesting as potential anti-dental caries agents.

TI  == humoral immunity to commensal oral bacteria in human infants: salivary secretory  immunoglobulin a antibodies reactive with streptococcus mitis biovar 1, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis during the  first two years of life.
AB  == secretory immunoglobulin a (siga) antibodies reactive with the pioneer oral streptococci streptococcus mitis biovar 1 and streptococcus oralis, the late oral colonizer streptococcus mutans, and the pioneer enteric bacterium enterococcus faecalis in saliva samples from 10 human infants from birth to age 2 years were analyzed. low levels of salivary siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with whole cells of all four species were detected within the first month after birth, even  though s. mutans and e. faecalis were not recovered from the mouths of the infants during the study period. although there was a fivefold increase in the concentration of siga between birth and age 2 years, there were no differences between the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with the four species over this time period. when the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with all four species were normalized to the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 in saliva, siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with these bacteria showed a significant decrease from birth to 2 years of age. adsorption of each infant's saliva with cells of one species produced a dramatic reduction of antibodies recognizing the other three species. sequential adsorption of saliva samples removed all siga antibody to the bacteria, indicating that the siga antibodies were directed to antigens shared by all four species. the induction by the host of a limited immune response to common antigens that are likely not involved in adherence may be among the mechanisms that commensal streptococci employ to persist in the oral cavity.

TI  == dominant cross-reactive antibodies generated during the response to a variety of  oral bacterial species detect phosphorylcholine.
AB  == the intraperitoneal immunization of balb/c mice with subgingival plaque from advanced periodontal pockets or with certain strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus mitis, or streptococcus oralis yielded frequently indistinguishable igm monoclonal antibodies which were reactive with antigens from a variety of oral bacteria. this study aimed to characterize the specificity of such monoclonal antibodies and the diversity of oral bacteria expressing this target antigen or epitope. using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to study a variety of competitor substances for their capacity to bind to the monoclonal antibodies, we identified phosphorylcholine as the recognized epitope. the concentration of positive bacteria with extraordinarily bright cell wall fluorescence in indirect immunofluorescence assays varied between 0.1% and 15% in subgingival and from 10 to 40% in supragingival plaque samples. labeled bacteria  belonged to different morphotypes, including cocci, rods, and filaments. of 75 species tested in vitro, 14 gram-positive and four gram-negative species were found to harbor positive strains. haemophilus aphrophilus, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces georgiae, actinomyces gerencseriae, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces odontolyticus were human oral species of which all tested strains were capable of binding the cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. in contrast, actinomyces naeslundii was consistently negative. these data provide evidence for a much more common expression of phosphorylcholine by oral bacteria than hitherto believed but do not indicate an obvious association of phosphorylcholine expression with oral health or inflammatory periodontal diseases.

TI  == detection of dextranase-producing gram-negative oral bacteria.
AB  == thirty-one strains of 23 gram-negative oral bacterial species were examined for dextran-degrading activity on agar plates containing blue dextran. one strain each of capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella loescheii,  prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella oralis had detectable dextranase activity. the culture supernatants of p. melaninogenica and p. oralis cells contained dextranases of multiple sizes, but those of the other three species had a single size of enzyme. a 56-kda dextranase was purified from the culture supernatant of p. oralis and the antiserum against the enzyme was prepared with a rabbit. the ouchterlony test showed that the antibody reacted with the supernatants of both p. melaninogenica and p. oralis but not with the others. dot-blot hybridization using the dextranase gene of streptococcus mutans as a probe revealed that there was no significantly homologous sequence in the chromosomal dna of the five species.

TI  == actinomyces serovar wva963 coaggregation-defective mutant strain pk2407 secretes  lactose-sensitive adhesin that binds to coaggregation partner streptococcus oralis 34.
AB  == actinomyces serovar wva963 strain pk1259 mediates intergeneric coaggregation with several oral streptococci. these lactose-inhibitable coaggregations appear to involve a 95-kda putative actinomyces adhesin in complex with type 2 fimbriae. a  coaggregation-defective strain pk2407 lacking type 2 fimbriae synthesizes the putative adhesin but appears unable to present it properly on its surface. antiserum was raised against surface sonicates of pk2407 and was absorbed with a  different coaggregation-defective mutant pk3092 that synthesizes type 2 fimbriae  but no adhesin. this absorbed antiserum specifically blocked lactose-inhibitable  coaggregation of wild-type strain pk1259 and streptococcus oralis 34 and identified a 95-kda protein in ammonium sulfate precipitates of culture supernatant of the coaggregation-defective mutant pk2407. the 95-kda secreted protein was bound to the streptococcal partner cells and to lactose-agarose affinity beads and was released by lactose from both the affinity beads and partner, indicating that the secreted and precipitated protein is biochemically active and may mediate coaggregation with streptococci.

TI  == evidence for mannosidase activities in streptococcus oralis when grown on glycoproteins as carbohydrate source.
AB  == streptococcus oralis when cultured using ribonuclease b as the sole source of carbohydrate, selectively uses the sugars of the man5 glycoform as shown by hpaec and maldi-tof mass spectrometric analyses. the organism is able to do this by producing novel alpha-(1-->3), alpha-(1-->6) and beta-(1-->4) mannosidase activities and these act in a concerted manner in what appears as a single-step process. the selective utilisation of man5 is explained by the absence of an alpha-(1-->2) mannosidase which is required to initiate breakdown of the glycan chains present in the other glycoforms which are components of the glycoprotein.

AB  == statement of problem: the effect of surface finish of dental materials on the subsequent contamination by microorganisms. purpose: this study compared the retention of streptococcus oralis, actinomyces viscosus, and candida albicans on  polished, sandblasted (fine and coarse) and electrobrightened cobalt-chromium alloy and dental acrylic resin to assess in vitro the effect of such techniques on prosthesis contamination. material and methods: standardized cell suspensions  were incubated with test materials for 1 hour at 37 degrees c, after which retained cells were counted by using image analysis (percentage area of a microscopic field covered by cells). results: retention of bacterial cells was substantial (s oralis 12% to 20% and a viscosus 9% to 16%) irrespective of surface finish. maximal retention was observed on cobalt-chromium alloy that had  undergone fine sandblasting and electrobrightening (p < .01). for c albicans, an  increase in surface roughness (0.15 to 3.53 microns) resulted in an increase in retention (3% to 9%). conclusion: cell size and the type of roughening significantly affected the retention of microorganisms on surfaces. electrobrightening of cobalt-chromium alloy did not reduce the surface roughness  or subsequent cell attachment.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

TI  == fluoroquinolone resistance mutations in the parc, pare, and gyra genes of clinical isolates of viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the nucleotide sequences of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs)  of the parc and gyra genes from seven ciprofloxacin-resistant (cpr) isolates of viridans group streptococci (two high-level cpr streptococcus oralis and five low-level cpr streptococcus mitis isolates) were determined and compared with those obtained from susceptible isolates. the nucleotide sequences of the qrdrs of the pare and gyrb genes from the five low-level cpr s. mitis isolates and from the nctc 12261 type strain were also analyzed. four of these low-level cpr isolates had changes affecting the subunits of dna topoisomerase iv: three in ser-79 (to phe or ile) of parc and one in pare at a position not previously described to be involved in quinolone resistance (pro-424). one isolate did not show any mutation. the two high-level cpr s. oralis isolates showed mutations affecting equivalent residue positions of parc and gyra, namely, ser-79 to phe and ser-81 to phe or tyr, respectively. the parc mutations were able to transform streptococcus pneumoniae to ciprofloxacin resistance, while the gyra mutations transformed s. pneumoniae only when mutations in parc were present. these results suggest that dna topoisomerase iv is a primary target of ciprofloxacin in viridans group streptococci, dna gyrase being a secondary target.

TI  == lateral and perpendicular interaction forces involved in mobile and immobile adhesion of microorganisms on model solid surfaces.
AB  == gliding and near-surface swimming of microorganisms are described as a mobile form of microbial adhesion that need not necessarily be reversible. it is argued  that the reversibility of microbial adhesion depends on the depth of the secondary interaction minimum, calculated from the forces between an organism and a substratum acting in a direction perpendicular to the substratum surface. the mobility of adhering microorganisms depends on lateral interactions between the organisms. on ideally homogeneous and smooth model surfaces, only mobile adhesion occurs because the multibody, lateral interactions are weak compared with the thermal or brownian motion energy of the organisms. minor chemical or structural  heterogeneities, which exist on all real-life surfaces, yield a lateral interaction on adhering microorganisms. this causes their immobilization, which helps to explain the physicochemical nature of microbial gliding or near-surface  swimming. moreover, these lateral interaction energies are one order of magnitude smaller than the lifshitz-van der waals, electrostatic, and acid-base forces acting perpendicular to substratum surfaces that are responsible for adhesion.

TI  == analysis of ph-driven disruption of oral microbial communities in vitro.
AB  == previously, a mixed culture chemostat system was used to demonstrate that the ph  generated from carbohydrate metabolism, rather than carbohydrate availability per se, was responsible for the shifts observed in the oral microflora which are associated with high carbohydrate diets and the development of dental caries. the aim of this study was to determine more accurately the microbially generated ph at which such shifts occurred. nine oral bacteria were grown in three independent chemostats, and pulsed with glucose on 10 consecutive days. in one chemostat, ph  control was discontinued for 6 h, and the ph fall was restricted to a minimum value of ph 5.5; the ph fall was arrested in the other two chemostats at either ph 5. 0, or at ph 4.5. when the ph was allowed to fall, the numbers and proportions of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus rhamnosus increased; this increase was directly related to the magnitude of the ph fall. veillonella dispar was the most numerous organism following all glucose pulsing regimes, especially  at low ph. the increase in proportions of acidogenic bacteria was accompanied by  a fall in the proportions of acid-sensitive species (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis). the counts of these species were relatively stable between ph 5.5 and 4.5, but were markedly reduced when the ph fell below ph 4.5; neisseria subflava could not persist in the culture at ph 4.5 or below. the data suggest that the disruption of communities associated with glucose metabolism and low ph can be explained in  terms of a two-stage process. a fall in ph to a value between ph 5.5 and 4.5 may  allow the enrichment of potentially cariogenic species, whilst permitting species associated with health to remain relatively unaffected. a further reduction in ph (<ph 4.5) may not only enhance the competitiveness of odontopathogens, but inhibit the growth and metabolism of non-caries-associated species. the results also indicate that species other that mutans streptococci or lactobacilli are competitive at ph values low enough to demineralise enamel, and thus suggest that a broader range of micro-organisms may be associated with caries initiation.

TI  == composition of pellicles formed in vivo on tooth surfaces in different parts of the dentition, and in vitro on hydroxyapatite.
AB  == saliva from the major salivary glands dominates different areas of the mouth. the parotid (ps) and submandibular/sublingual (sms) saliva differ in their protein composition, and thus, the composition of pellicles formed in various parts of the dentition might vary. in this study, proteins incorporated in 60-min pellicles from the premolar and front regions of the mouths of 4 subjects were examined using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using antibodies to amylase, albumin, iga, parotid saliva agglutinin, low molecular weight sms mucin (mg2) and proline-rich proteins. pellicles formed in vitro on hydroxyapatite using ps, sms and whole saliva from the subjects were examined in a similar manner. the pellicles formed in vitro and in vivo showed a major difference in the appearance of albumin. bands of albumin  were clearly stained in the samples of in vivo pellicles but were not observed or hardly visible in western blots from the experimental, in vitro pellicles. the sites in the dentition from which a specific protein was recovered could differ between the 4 individuals. the overall protein pattern of the pellicles showed, however, characteristics typical of the saliva which may prevail in the part of the mouth where the pellicles were formed. thus, parotid saliva agglutinin, a receptor for streptococcus mutans, was primarily found in the premolar part of the dentition. the mucin mg2, which may mediate the adherence of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis, was in no case clearly seen in pellicles from the premolar region of the upper jaw. the observed variations might be important  to the establishment of microflora and tooth-related disease patterns in various  parts of the dentition.

TI  == actinomyces naeslundii displays variant fimp and fima fimbrial subunit genes corresponding to different types of acidic proline-rich protein and beta-linked galactosamine binding specificity.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 bind to acidic proline-rich proteins (aprps) and statherin via type 1 fimbriae and to beta-linked galactosamine (galnacbeta) structures via type 2 fimbriae. in addition, a. naeslundii displays  two types of binding specificity for both aprps-statherin and galnacbeta, while actinomyces odontolyticus binds to unknown structures. to study the molecular basis for these binding specificities, dna fragments spanning the entire or central portions of fimp (type 1) and fima (type 2) fimbrial subunit genes were amplified by pcr from strains of genospecies 1 and 2 and hybridized with dna from two independent collections of oral actinomyces isolates. isolates of genospecies 1 and 2 and a. odontolyticus, but no other actinomyces species, were positive for hybridization with fimp and fima full-length probes irrespective of binding to aprps and statherin, galnacbeta, or unknown structures. isolates of genospecies 1 and 2, with deviating patterns of galnacbeta1-3galalpha-o-ethyl-inhibitable coaggregation with streptococcus oralis ss34 and mpb1, were distinguished by a fima central probe from genospecies 1 and 2, respectively. furthermore, isolates  of genospecies 1 and 2 displaying preferential binding to aprps over statherin were positive with a fimp central probe, while a genospecies 2 strain with the opposite binding preference was not. the sequences of fimp and fima central gene  segments were highly conserved among isolates with the same, but diversified between those with a variant, binding specificity. in conclusion, a. naeslundii exhibits variant fimp and fima genes corresponding to diverse aprp and galnacbeta specificities, respectively, while a. odontolyticus has a genetically related but distinct adhesin binding specificity.

AB  == the in-vitro susceptibilities of 13 antimicrobial agents were determined for 207  isolates of viridans group streptococci recovered from patients with significant  infections in taiwan during 1995 and 1997. variable degrees of susceptibility existed among nine species. high-level penicillin resistance (mic > or = 4.0 mg/l) was found most frequently in streptococcus oralis (35%), followed by streptococcus mitis (20%) and streptococcus salivarius (8%). however, s. salivarius showed the lowest rate of susceptibility to penicillin (50%). macrolide resistance also occurred most frequently in s. oralis isolates (55%) but in none of streptococcus mutans. penicillin and macrolides tended to be less  active against isolates recovered from non-invasive sites than against those isolated from invasive sites. imipenem was the most active beta-lactam against penicillin-resistant isolates. ofloxacin, vancomycin and teicoplanin showed good  in-vitro activity against all isolates, with mic90s of 2, 1 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. none of these isolates displayed high-level resistance to gentamicin and most isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol. these results indicate the species-related variability of susceptibility, especially to penicillin, macrolides and tetracycline. in addition to s. mitis, s. oralis also  displayed high rates of resistance to penicillin and macrolides. the difference in susceptibilities between species of viridans streptococci indicates the importance of accurate identification and the need for continuing surveillance of antimicrobial resistance.

AB  == sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. rapid bacterial plaque accumulation occurs in sjogren's syndrome patients due to decreases in salivary flow rate. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome  and evaluate serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including  major periodontopathogens, compared to healthy controls. seventeen sjogren's syndrome patients and 14 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque (pl), sulcular bleeding (sbi), periodontal index scores (pi), probing depths (pd), and total number of teeth were recorded. an elisa was used to determine the serum igg antibody level to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms. significantly higher pl, sbi, pd, and pi scores, as well as an increased number of lost teeth were observed in patients with sjogren's syndrome compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to streptococcus oralis were significantly lower in sjogren's syndrome patients than controls (p <0.0002). these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis compared to controls (p <0.006 to 0.0004). our findings indicate that sjogren's syndrome patients have established periodontal disease and serum antibody responses to oral microorganisms previously identified as periodontopathogens in systemically healthy subjects. these results suggest that sjogren's syndrome may affect bacterial colonization in plaque and contribute to increased periodontal disease in this compromised population.

TI  == mutacin production by streptococcus mutans may promote transmission of bacteria from mother to child.
AB  == the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances, mutacins, by mutans streptococci varies among isolates. to find if the degree of mutacin activity of  an isolate was related to its transmission between mother and her child, 19 mothers and their 18-month- to 3-year-old children were sampled for their oral mutans streptococci. in addition, the stability of mutacin activity was studied with isolates from the mothers and with isolates from five unrelated 5-year-old children in 5- to 7-year follow-up studies. a total of 145 oral mutans streptococcal isolates were serotyped by immunodiffusion, ribotyped, and mutacin  typed by the stab culture technique. mutacin was produced by 88% of the strains against more than 1 of the 14 indicator strains, representing mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus mutans  isolates showed more inhibitory activity than did streptococcus sobrinus isolates. identical ribotypes had similar mutacin activity profiles within a subject, initially and in the follow-up studies, in all but two cases. the mothers harbored a total of 37 different mutans streptococcal ribotypes. six children were negative for mutans streptococci. transmission was probable in 9 of 20 mother-child pairs on the basis of the presence of identical strains, as determined by ribotyping and bacteriocin (mutacin) typing. s. mutans strains shared between a mother and her child showed a broader spectrum of inhibitory activity than did nontransmitted strains. in conclusion, the mutacin activity of  clinical isolates is reasonably stable, and this virulence factor seems to be of  clinical importance in early colonization by s. mutans.

TI  == characterization of a novel n-acetylneuraminic acid-specific fusobacterium nucleatum pk1594 adhesin.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum has been identified as significantly associated with sites with active periodontal disease and, as a group, the oral fusobacteria coaggregate with members of all oral bacteria genera tested. monoclonal antibodies were prepared and used in conjunction with other potential inhibitors, such as simple sugars and amino acids, to characterize coaggregation interactions, of f. nucleatum pk1594. four unique monoclonal antibodies, 5h11, 14c7, 19f2 and 29c12, were obtained by their ability to inhibit coaggregation of  f. nucleatum pk1594 with actinomyces israelii pk16. they were also capable of inhibiting other coaggregations including streptococcus oralis h1, s. oralis j22, capnocytophaga ochracea atcc33596, prevotella denticola pk1277 and prevotella intermedia pk1511. all of these interactions were completely inhibited by n-acetylneuraminic acid. neither n-acetylneuraminic acid nor monoclonal antibody  5h11 had any inhibitory effect on other f. nucleatum pk1594 interactions, including all galactose-inhibitable coaggregations. the results indicate that f.  nucleatum pk1594 expresses upon its surface a distinct type of adhesin that mediates coaggregation interactions that are inhibited by n-acetylneuraminic acid.

TI  == identification of bacterial species on or in crevicular epithelial cells from healthy and periodontally diseased patients using dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to identify bacterial species present on or in crevicular epithelial cells in healthy and diseased sites using dna probes. in order to achieve this aim, further improvements were made in the separation of unattached bacteria from those adherent to epithelial cells isolated from the human gingival crevice or periodontal pocket. then the dna probes were used to determine the prevalence of detectable dna from 15 microbial species on or in crevicular epithelial cells. one sample was taken from a single subgingival site  in each of 51 individuals ranging in age from 19 to 45 years. samples were taken  from 27 sites of clinically healthy subjects and 24 samples were taken from subjects having periodontally diseased sites. dna-dna hybridization indicated that a majority of epithelial cells from healthy sites (63%) were in contact with or harbored streptococcus oralis. on the other hand, species such as bacteroides  forsythus, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea and campylobacter rectus were more frequently detected in elevated numbers in periodontally diseased sites. cluster analysis of the microbial profiles generally aggregated subjects with and without periodontitis into separate cluster groups. the cluster patterns suggest the possibility that microbial complexes will be, in part, determined by the receptors available on the epithelial cells.

TI  == the specificity and affinity of immunoliposome targeting to oral bacteria.
AB  == immunoliposomes have been prepared using antibodies raised to an antigenic determinant on the cell surface of the oral bacterium streptococcus oralis (s. oralis) in an investigation of their potential to reduce dental plaque. the n-succinimidyl-s-acetylthioacetate (sata) derivative of the antibodies were conjugated through the reactive m-maleimidobenzoyl-n-hydroxysuccinimide (mbs) derivative of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (dppe) incorporated into liposomes. the degree of antibody conjugation to the liposomes was controlled by  the percentage of dppembs incorporated into the liposomes. the chemical modification of the antibodies did not affect the ability of the antibodies to bind to a s. oralis biofilm. however, the affinity of the immunoliposomes for s.  oralis was much lower than that of the free antibody. the anti-oralis antibodies  were highly specific for s. oralis. the anti-oralis immunoliposomes showed the greatest affinity for s. oralis, when targeted to a range of different oral bacterial biofilms. the immunoliposome targeting affinity for s. oralis was largely unaffected by the number of antibodies conjugated to the liposomal surface or by the net charge of the liposomal lipid bilayer. the immunoliposomes  showed a greater affinity for s. oralis than 'naked' (bearing no antibody) liposomes. however, positively charged liposomes, incorporating stearylamine, adsorbed to s. oralis with greater affinities than the immunoliposomes. the immunoliposomes appeared to be physically stable over a period of 18 months, as judged by particle-size measurements.

TI  == identification of a gene involved in assembly of actinomyces naeslundii t14v type 2 fimbriae.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the actinomyces naeslundii t14v type 2 fimbrial structural subunit gene, fima, and the 3' flanking dna region was determined. the fima gene encoded a 535-amino-acid precursor subunit protein (fima) which included both n-terminal leader and c-terminal cell wall sorting sequences. a second gene, designated orf365, that encoded a 365-amino-acid protein which contained a putative transmembrane segment was identified immediately 3' to fima. mutants in which either fima or orf365 was replaced with a kanamycin resistance gene did not participate in type 2 fimbriae-mediated coaggregation with streptococcus oralis 34. type 2 fimbrial antigen was not detected in cell extracts of the fima mutant by western blotting with anti-a. naeslundii type 2 fimbrial antibody, but the subunit protein was detected in extracts of the orf365 mutant. the subunit protein detected in this mutant also was immunostained by an  antibody raised against a synthetic peptide representing the c-terminal 20 amino  acid residues of the predicted fima. the antipeptide antibody reacted with fima isolated from the recombinant escherichia coli clone containing fima but did not  react with purified type 2 fimbriae in extracts of the wild-type strain. these results indicate that synthesis of type 2 fimbriae in a. naeslundii t14v may involve posttranslational cleavage of both the n-terminal and c-terminal peptides of the precursor subunit and also the expression of orf365.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == microbiota of health, gingivitis, and initial periodontitis.
AB  == this study compared the subgingival microbiota in periodontal health, gingivitis  and initial periodontitis using predominant culture and a dna probe, checkerboard hybridization method. 56 healthy adult subjects with minimal periodontal attachment loss were clinically monitored at 3-month intervals for 12 months. more sites demonstrated small increments of attachment loss than attachment gain  over the monitoring period. sites, from 17 subjects, showing > or = 1.5 mm periodontal attachment loss during monitoring were sampled as active lesions for  microbial analysis. twelve subjects demonstrated interproximal lesions, and 5 subjects had attachment loss at buccal sites (recession). cultural studies identified bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and selenomonas noxia as  the predominant species associated with active interproximal lesions (9 subjects), whereas actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis, were the dominant species colonizing buccal active sites. a. naeslundii, campylobacter gracilis, and b. forsythus (at lower levels than active sites) were the dominant  species cultured from gingivitis (10 subjects). health-associated species (10 subjects) included streptococcus oralis, a. naeslundii, and actinomyces gerencseriae. dna probe data identified higher mean levels of b. forsythus and c. rectus with active (7 subjects) compared to inactive periodontitis sites. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were detected infrequently. cluster analysis of the cultural microbiota grouped 8/9 active interproximal lesions in one subcluster characterized by a mostly gram-negative microbiota, including b. forsythus and c. rectus. the data suggest that b. forsythus c. rectus and s. noxia were major species characterizing sites converting from periodontal health to disease. the differences in location and microbiota of interproximal and buccal active sites suggested that different mechanisms may be involved in increased attachment loss.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == a comprehensive genetic study of streptococcal immunoglobulin a1 proteases: evidence for recombination within and between species.
AB  == an analysis of 13 immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease genes (iga) of strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis was carried out to obtain information on the structure, polymorphism, and phylogeny of this specific protease, which enables bacteria to  evade functions of the predominant ig isotype on mucosal surfaces. the analysis included cloning and sequencing of iga genes from s. oralis and s. mitis biovar 1, sequencing of an additional seven iga genes from s. sanguis biovars 1 through  4, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analyses of iga genes of another 10 strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and 6 strains of s. oralis. all 13 genes  sequenced had the potential of encoding proteins with molecular masses of approximately 200 kda containing the sequence motif hemth and an e residue 20 amino acids downstream, which are characteristic of zn metalloproteinases. in addition, all had a typical gram-positive cell wall anchor motif, lpntg, which, in contrast to such motifs in other known streptococcal and staphylococcal proteins, was located in their n-terminal parts. repeat structures showing variation in number and sequence were present in all strains and may be of relevance to the immunogenicities of the enzymes. protease activities in cultures of the streptococcal strains were associated with species of different molecular  masses ranging from 130 to 200 kda, suggesting posttranslational processing possibly as a result of autoproteolysis at post-proline peptide bonds in the n-terminal parts of the molecules. comparison of deduced amino acid sequences revealed a 94% similarity between s. oralis and s. mitis iga1 proteases and a 75  to 79% similarity between iga1 proteases of these species and those of s. pneumoniae and s. sanguis, respectively. combined with the results of rflp analyses using different iga gene fragments as probes, the results of nucleotide  sequence comparisons provide evidence of horizontal transfer of iga gene sequences among individual strains of s. sanguis as well as among s. mitis and the two species s. pneumoniae and s. oralis. while iga genes of s. sanguis and s. oralis were highly homogeneous, the genes of s. pneumoniae and s. mitis showed extensive polymorphism reflected in different degrees of antigenic diversity.

TI  == investigation of calcium-binding sites on the surfaces of selected gram-positive  oral organisms.
AB  == dental plaque is rich in anionic groups with a high calcium-binding capacity which may affect mineral dynamics at the tooth surface. the two major calcium-binding sites on gram-positive cell surfaces are carboxylate groups (in proteins and peptidoglycan cross-links) and phosphate groups (in lipoteichoic and teichoic acid). equilibrium dialysis was used to measure calcium-binding capacities of whole cells and purified cell-wall material (cwm) from streptococcus mutans r9, strep. oralis ef186, strep. gordonii nctc 7865, strep. downei nctc 11391, actinomyces naeslundii wvu627 and lactobacillus casei ac413. this material was stripped of phosphate (ps-cwm) and treated to mask carboxylate  groups (cm-cwm). whole-cell calcium-binding capacities ranged from 240 (strep. downei) to 50 (l. casei) mu mol/g (dry wt). differences in cwm, ps-cwm and cm-cwm calcium-binding capacities demonstrated the greater importance of phosphate in comparison with carboxylate groups in cell calcium binding. these data indicate that, in streptococci, calcium binding is predominantly phosphate group-based, especially in the teichoic acid-containing strep. oralis. in the other species tested, calcium binding is predominantly carboxylate group-based.

TI  == structural and antigenic types of cell wall polysaccharides from viridans group streptococci with receptors for oral actinomyces and streptococcal lectins.
AB  == lectin-mediated interactions between oral viridans group streptococci and actinomyces may play an important role in microbial colonization of the tooth surface. the presence of two host-like motifs, either galnac beta1-->3gal (gn) or gal beta1-->3galnac (g), in the cell wall polysaccharides of five streptococcal strains accounts for the lactose-sensitive coaggregations of these bacteria with  actinomyces naeslundii. three streptococcal strains which have gn-containing polysaccharides also participate in galnac-sensitive coaggregations with strains  of streptococcus gordonii and s. sanguis. each gn- or g-containing polysaccharide is composed of a distinct phosphodiester-linked hexa- or heptasaccharide repeating unit. the occurrence of these polysaccharides on 19 additional viridans group streptococcal strains that participate in lactose-sensitive coaggregations  with actinomyces was examined. negatively charged polysaccharides that reacted with bauhinia purpurea agglutinin, a gal and galnac binding plant lectin, were isolated from 17 strains by anion exchange column chromatography of mutanolysin-cell wall digests. results from nuclear magnetic resonance and immunodiffusion identified each of 16 polysaccharides as a known gn- or g-containing structural type and one polysaccharide as a new but closely related  gn-containing type. unlike the reactions of lectins, the cross-reactions of most  rabbit antisera with these polysaccharides were correlated with structural features other than the host-like motifs. gn-containing polysaccharides occurred  primarily on the strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis while g-containing polysaccharides were more common among the strains of s. gordonii and s. mitis examined. the findings strongly support the hypothesis that lectin-mediated recognition of these streptococci by other oral bacteria depends on a family of antigenically diverse gn- and g-containing cell wall polysaccharides, the occurrence of which may differ between streptococcal species.

TI  == successful single-dose teicoplanin prophylaxis against experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal aortic valve endocarditis.
AB  == teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is administered both intramuscularly and intravenously. it has a prolonged half-life and a less toxic  profile in comparison to those of vancomycin. the efficacy of a single dose of teicoplanin (18 mg/kg of body weight given intramuscularly) for the prevention of endocarditis due to streptococcus oralis, enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was evaluated after applying the rabbit model. vancomycin at a single dose of 30 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to mrsa and  e. faecium, while ampicillin at a single dose of 40 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to s. oralis. rabbits in the teicoplanin group were infected at 1 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) cfu of each strain. rabbits in the other groups were infected at 0.5 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) cfu of s. oralis (ampicillin group)  or e. faecium and mrsa (vancomycin group). all rabbits were sacrificed 5 days later. teicoplanin and vancomycin protected the animals challenged with e. faecium by 87.5 and 50%, respectively, and protected the animals challenged with  mrsa by 100 and 92%, respectively. teicoplanin and ampicillin protected the animals challenged with s. oralis by 100 and 77%, respectively. prevention of endocarditis by teicoplanin was likely to be due to a prolonged inhibition of bacterial growth by the sustained supra-mics. it is concluded that teicoplanin is very effective in preventing experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal endocarditis and may be an attractive alternative antibiotic in patients allergic to beta-lactams, especially in the outpatient setting.

AB  == the phagocytic bacterial activity on streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus  oralis, clinical isolates from patients suffering from severe oral surgical infections, was evaluated by using sera and neutrophils of patients who had been  treated with polyethylene glycal treated human normal immunoglobulin (venoglobulin-ih). the phagocytic function of the neutrophils against the two strains, approximately 10 cells/neutrophil, was unrelated to the administration of venoglobulin-ih. the bactericidal function of the serum and neutrophils on the third day following venoglobulin-ih administration, on the other hand, rose to 10 times that of the sera and neutrophils of patients with mild infections. the agglutinin titer of venoglobulin-ih against s. intermedius and s. oralis were 32  and 16 times, respectively, indicating an evident rise in these titers against the clinical isolates in comparison with the reference strains of the same organisms. these findings indicated that the oral streptococci that are isolated  from patients with grave infections are associated with an antigenicity that is different from the normal bacterial flora; and these organisms are more labile to phagocytosis by neutrophils that were obtained from patients who have been treated with venoglobulin-ih.

TI  == molecular bases of three characteristic phenotypes of pneumococcus: optochin-sensitivity, coumarin-sensitivity, and quinolone-resistance.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is uniquely sensitive to amino alcohol antimalarials in  the erythro configuration, such as optochin, quinine, and quinidine. the protein  responsible for the optochin (quinine)-sensitive (opts, qins) phenotype of pneumococcus is the proteolipid c subunit of the fzerof1 h(+)-atpase. optr/qinr isolates arose by point mutations in the atpc gene and produce different amino acid changes in one of the two transmembrane alpha-helices of the c subunit. in addition, comparison of the sequence of the atpcab genes of s. pneumoniae r6 (opts) and m222 (an optr strain produced by interspecies recombination between pneumococcus and s. oralis), and s. oralis (optr) revealed that, in m222, an interchange of atpc and atpa had occurred. we also demonstrate that optochin, quinine, and related compounds specifically inhibited the membrane-bound atpase activity. equivalent differences between opts/qins and optr/qinr strains, both in growth inhibition and in membrane atpase resistance, were found. pneumococci also show a characteristic sensitivity to coumarin drugs, and a relatively high level  of resistance to most quinolones. we have cloned and sequenced the gyrb gene, and characterized novobiocin resistant mutants. the same amino acid substitution (ser-127 to leu) confers novobiocin resistance on four isolates. this residue position is equivalent to val-120 of escherichia coli rygb, a residue that lies inside the atp-binding domain but is not involved in novobiocin binding in e. coli, as revealed by crystallographic data. in addition, the genes encoding the parc and pare subunits of topoisomerase iv, together with the region encoding amino acids 46 to 172 (residue numbers as in e. coli) of the pneumococcal ryga subunit, were characterized in respect to fluoroquinolone resistance. the gyra gene maps to a physical location distant from the gyrb and parec loci on the chromosome. ciprofloxacin-resistant (cpr) clinical isolates had mutations affecting amino acid residues of the quinolone resistance-determining region of parc (low-level cpr), or in both resistance-determining regions of parc and gyra  (high-level cpr). mutations were found in residue positions equivalent to ser-83  and asp-87 of the e. coli gyra subunit. transformation experiments demonstrated that topoisomerase iv is the primary target of ciprofloxacin, dna gyrase being a  secondary one.

TI  == comparison of the indigenous oral microbiota and immunoglobulin responses of athymic (nu/nu) and euthymic (nu/+) mice.
AB  == the role of the immune system in the homeostasis of indigenous oral bacterial populations is poorly understood. in this study, we compared the evolution of the indigenous oral microbiota of specific pathogen-free athymic nude (nu/nu) balb/c  mice with that of their corresponding phenotypically normal (nu/-) littermates. we also evaluated corresponding salivary and serum antibody activities (iga and igg) against the predominant indigenous oral bacteria. the bacterial species recovered from the two mouse strains were lactobacillus murinus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus oralis and staphylococcus epidermidis. from 27 days of age, nu/+ and nu/nu mice had significantly different proportions of oral bacterial populations. when the microbiota stabilized (at 40 days of age), the total cultivable microbiota of nu/+ mice was dominated by l. murinus (65-85%), while that of nu/nu mice was dominated by e. faecalis (40-60%). the precise factors that alter the oral resident microbiota in nu/nu mice are unknown. we found that total salivary iga levels were significantly lower in nu/nu mice, but  no association were observed between the level of salivary iga antibody against indigenous bacteria and the proportion of these indigenous bacteria in the oral microbiota. the change in the microbiota of nude mice may have been caused by other factors such as defects in other immune functions or cold stress.

TI  == in vitro models that support adhesion specificity in biofilms of oral bacteria.
AB  == adhesion to adsorbed pellicles and interspecies co-adhesion to form plaque biofilms involve selective interactions of bacterial adhesins with specific receptors. our laboratory has devised in vitro assays for co-adhesion between actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis or porphyromonas gingivalis on saliva-coated mineral and hexadecane droplet substrata. p. gingivalis structures  significant for co-adhesion with a. naeslundii include surface vesicles and fimbriae. a family of arginine-specific cysteine proteinases in vesicles may be involved in adherence to bacteria, to host cells, and to matrix proteins. new research from several laboratories has found that such proteinases are processed  from genes encoding polyproteins containing both proteinase and hemagglutinin domains. in addition to enzyme-substrate recognition, bacterial adhesion is often determined by specific protein-peptide and lectincarbohydrate recognition. a. naeslundii--salivary prolinerich protein, s. gordonii--salivary alpha-amylase, and treponema denticola--matrix protein recognition are examples of the former. co-adhesion of a. naeslundii and s. oralis is an example of the latter. lactose can selectively desorb a. naeslundii cells from mixed biofilms with s. oralis, a  demonstration of the significance of specificity. although non-specific forces are probably secondary to stereochemical fit in determining the selective range of surfaces that bacteria have evolved to recognize and bind, they probably help  stabilize non-covalent bonds within aligned, complementary domains.

TI  == prophyromonas gingivalis fimbriae mediate coaggregation with streptococcus oralis through specific domains.
AB  == fimbriae are major adhesive components on the cell surface of prophyromonas gingivalis. in this study, we evaluated the role of fimbriae in coaggregation with streptococcus oralis. fimbriae purified from p. gingivalis competitively inhibited the coaggregation by 100% at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml. on the other hand, the same amount of lipopolysaccharide isolated from p. gingivalis was inhibited by only 25% of the level of the fimbriae. a fima-inactivated mutant of p. gingivalis failed to show distinct coaggregation activity. fimbriae added to a solution of various strains of streptococci caused their self-aggregation at a concentration of 10 to 30 micrograms/ml. the self-aggregation induced by fimbriae was inhibited by lambda-arginine (20 to 40 mm/l). iodinated fimbriae reacted with s. oralis cells immobilized on the nitrocellulose membrane, and 100  degrees c heating of the cells diminished the binding abilities. recombinant fimbrillin (r-fim, corresponding to whole residues 1 to 337 of native fimbrillin) of p. gingivalis also showed 100% inhibition of the coaggregation. the r-fim variant (residues 1 to 286) lacking the c-terminal 51 residues was as inhibitory  as r-fim. however, the variant (residues 1 to 265) without the c-terminal 72 residues lost 77% of the inhibitory activity. these findings suggested that residues 266 to 286 contain a domain involved in the coaggregation of p. gingivalis with s. oralis. inhibition by three polypeptides corresponding to residues 266 to 286, 266 to 337, and 287 to 337 was studied. peptides 266 to 286  and 266 to 337 inhibited by 96 and 100%, respectively, at a concentration of 1.5  nmol/ml. peptide 287 to 337 also showed a significant inhibitory effect but to a  slightly lesser extent than that of peptide 266 to 286. p. gingivalis fimbriae appear to be involved in coaggregation with streptococci, probably through an adhesive protein molecule(s) of the latter, and the fimbriae possess several domains in the c-terminal residues 266 to 337 for interaction with s. oralis.

TI  == identification and characterization of is1381, a new insertion sequence in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a new insertion sequence (is1381) was identified in the genome of streptococcus pneumoniae r6 as an 846-bp segment containing 20-bp terminal inverted repeats and flanked by 7-bp direct repeats. the three sequenced copies of this element have two overlapping open reading frame (orf) genes named orfa and orfb. however, significant variations between individual copies were found, suggesting that inactivating mutations have occurred in an original single orf. accordingly, the  consensus is1381 element derived from the comparison of the three available copies should contain a single orf sufficient to encode a basic protein of 267 amino acids which exhibited high similarity to the putative transposases of isl2  from lactobacillus helveticus and of is702 from the cyanobacterium calothrix sp.  strain pcc 7601. a minimum of five to seven copies were detected by hybridization experiments in the r6 genome. in remarkable contrast with the two previously reported pneumococcal insertion sequences, several copies of is1381 have been detected in all of the clinical isolates tested so far. interestingly, streptococcus oralis nctc 11427 (type strain), a close relative of pneumococcus,  does not contain this element, but its occurrence in the type strain of streptococcus mitis (nctc 12261) suggests that this species has exchanged dna with s. pneumoniae directly or through an intermediate species.

TI  == in vivo binding of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp (identical to gcdfp-15) to oral and non-oral bacteria detection and identification of ep-gp binding species.
AB  == extra parotid glycoprotein (ep-gp) is a glycoprotein isolated from human saliva,  having homologues in several other body fluids. the biological role of ep-gp and  its homologues is unknown. recently, ep-gp was shown to bind in vitro to the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb. in contrast, no binding to a number of other oral microorganisms could be demonstrated. in the present study we have determined whether binding of ep-gp to bacteria occurs in vivo in saliva and in other ep-gp containing body fluids. therefore the presence of ep-gp on bacteria in vivo was determined by analyzing oral, skin and ear floras by confocal fluoresence microscopy using specific antibodies. about 12% of the in vivo oral flora had ep-gp present on their surface, while approximately 5% of the bacteria  from ear canal or skin was positive for ep-gp. iga was detected on approximately  65% of the salivary bacteria, whereas the high-molecular weight mucin (mg1) and cystatin c were not detectable on any oral bacterium. using a replica-plate assay, a number of ep-gp binding strains in saliva were isolated and identified as gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorium, streptococcus acidominimus, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus parasanguis. bacteria from the ear canal and skin bacteria were identified as staphylococcus hominis. it is concluded that ep-gp is selectively bound in vivo to several oral  and non-oral bacterial species.

TI  == external quality assessment of the serum bactericidal test: results of a methodology/interpretation questionnaire.
AB  == two hundred microbiology laboratories in the uk took part in two separate experimental external quality assessment distributions related to the serum bactericidal test (sbt). in the first, staphylococcus aureus nctc 6571 (vancomycin mic 1 mg/l), was tested against a human serum containing vancomycin 38 mg/l plus gentamicin 0.5 mg/l. in the second, streptococcus oralis paj 112/4183 (penicillin mbc < or = 0.03 mg/l) and streptococcus sanguis paj 107/4184 (penicillin mbc = 128 mg/l) were tested against human serum containing penicillin 15 mg/l. respondents returned their laboratory results and a questionnaire on clinical interpretation and technical aspects. most laboratories (194/199, 97.5%) recommend the use of the sbt in the management of infective endocarditis but only 48 (25.2%) often or always change therapy on the basis of the result. a wide range of interpretative criteria, definitions of bactericidal endpoints and methodologies are used. performance in the first distribution was acceptable for  75% of laboratories but in the second only 34% could identify penicillin tolerance; 34 respondents reported an sbt result of < or = 2 for the tolerant strain, 81 laboratories reported one of > or = 16. technical factors related to acceptable performance were: sonication of broth before counting the inoculum; knowing the inoculum size in cfu/ml; use of a 4-8 h broth culture to make the inoculum; incubation of recovery plates for > 36 h; use of a calibrated pipette to sample for surviving bacteria; use of measured volumes to add the inoculum. use of uncalibrated pipettes or standard loops to recover survivors was related to poor performance. microbiology departments in the uk should review the clinical need to perform the sbt in the light of their local circumstances and if they elect to continue to offer this test, revise their methodologies which could be producing misleading results when testing alpha-haemolytic streptococci.

TI  == autolysis and cell wall degradation in a choline-independent strain of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae has an auxotrophic requirement for choline, and choline  residues that incorporate into the wall and membrane teichoic acids are intimately involved with the control of autolytic phenomena of this bacterium. we report here the re-examination of the role of choline in autolytic cell wall degradation using the choline-independent s. pneumoniae strain r6cho- recovered from a heterologous cross with dna from streptococcus oralis. s pneumoniae cho- cultured in choline-free medium grew with normal generation time but formed long  chains, failed to undergo stationary-phase autolysis, and was also resistant to lysis induced by deoxycholate or penicillin. cell walls produced under these conditions had reduced phosphorus content, contained no choline residues detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance, and had reduced binding capacity for the pneumococcal autolytic amidase, and complete hydrolysis of such walls by the  amidase required prolonged incubation with high concentrations of the enzyme. addition of choline to the growth medium reversed at these phenomena. high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of amidase digests of cell walls  prepared from strain r6cho- grown with or without choline produced identical stem peptide profiles, which were also similar to that of the parental s. pneumoniae strain r6. peptidoglycans prepared by hydrofluoric extraction of cell walls from  cho- growth with or without choline or from the parental strain r6 were uniformly susceptible to the autolytic amidase and were fully degraded to the normal family of stem peptides, indicating that, in sharp contrast to the case of cell walls, the amidase degradation of teichoic acid-free peptidoglycan did not require the presence of choline residues in the substrate.

AB  == the heterogeneous bacterial group known as oral streptococci was screened for the presence of cellular polyglycerolphosphate-containing lipoteichoic acid. this compound was detected in phenol extracts of lyophilized cells by an immunoassay in which polyglycerolphosphate-specific monoclonal antibody was used. polyglycerolphosphate-containing lipoteichoic acid occurred in all 86 strains of  oral streptococci examined except the streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis strains. this confirms the findings of rosan (b. rosan, science 201:918-920, 1978) and hamada et al. (s. hamada, j. mizuno, s. kotani, and m. torii, fems microbiol. lett. 8:93-96, 1980), is consistent with the results of the taxonomic study of oral streptococci performed by kilian et al.

TI  == effect of antibodies on the chain length and growth of streptococcus sobrinus.
AB  == passive immunization has been suggested as a method to prevent colonization of teeth by mutans streptococci. however, the mechanism of action of antibodies, both polyclonal and monoclonal, is not clear. in this study we investigated the effect of polyclonal antibodies (pabs) and a monoclonal antibody (omvu10) on the  chain length and growth of streptococcus sobrinus. during growth in broth s. sobrinus formed significantly longer chains in the presence of pabs in comparison to pre-immune serum (p < 0.01), but pabs did not influence the growth rate of s.  sobrinus in broth. omvu10 did not influence the growth rate nor the chain length. in order to study the effect of the antibodies on adhesion and growth on a surface, s. sobrinus was grown on hydroxyapatite discs in the presence of two other bacteria, streptococcus oralis and actinomyces viscosus. no effect of the antibodies was found on the total cultivable count of the three bacteria after growth on hydroxyapatite discs. however, the morphology of the s. sobrinus microcolonies was different after growth in the presence of both pabs and omvu10. the colonies were less dense and chains of s. sobrinus could be seen using a confocal laser microscope. after growth in the presence of the control antibodies, the colonies were dense and no long chains could be observed. it was  concluded that pabs influenced the chain length, in broth and on hydroxyapatite discs, and the colony morphology of s. sobrinus on hydroxyapatite discs, whereas  omvu10 influenced the colony morphology of s. sobrinus on hydroxyapatite discs.

TI  == influence of ionic strength and substratum hydrophobicity on the co-adhesion of oral microbial pairs.
AB  == co-adhesion between oral microbial pairs (i.e. adhesion of a planktonic microorganism to a sessile organism adhering to a substratum surface) has been described as a highly specific interaction, mediated by stereochemical groups on  the interacting microbial cell surfaces, and also as a non-specific, critical colloid-chemical interaction. in a colloid-chemical approach, microbial co-adhesion is considered as an interplay between, amongst others, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. the aim of this paper was to determine the influence of ionic strength on the co-adhesion of streptococcus oralis 34 to either actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1 or its mutant strain 5951 adhering to glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber. to this end, the ionic strength of the suspension was varied by the addition of kcl. another aim was to investigate whether substratum hydrophobicity affected the co-adhesion between the organisms  by allowing the sessile organisms (in this case the actinomyces) to adhere either to hydrophilic or to hydrophobic, dimethyldichlorosilane (dds)-coated glass. the  kinetics of co-adhesion of s. oralis 34 to the actinomyces decreased with increasing ionic strength, expressed as the ratio, chi, between the local and non-local initial deposition rates of the streptococci in the vicinity of, or far away from, the adhering actinomyces, respectively. in a stationary end-point of co-adhesion, ionic strength appeared not to be a determinant factor for the co-adhesion of s. oralis 34 with a. naeslundii 5951, either when the actinomyces  were adhering to hydrophilic glass or to hydrophobic, dds-coated glass. however,  for s. oralis 34 co-adhering in a stationary end-point with a. naeslundii t14v-j1 in the high-ionic-strength (250 mm kcl) suspension, co-adhesion was far less on hydrophobic, dds-coated glass than on hydrophilic glass. it is possible that the  hydrophobic fibrils on a. naeslundii t14v-j1 bearing the lectin responsible for co-adhesion were immobilized in the latter case by adsorption to the hydrophobic  substratum, making them less available for interaction with the streptococci.

AB  == coaggregation (interactions between two planktonic microorganisms) and co-adhesion (interactions between sessile and planktonic microorganisms) are believed to be important factors in the formation of dental plaque by many investigators, although others doubt whether coaggregation and co-adhesion occur  in vivo. it is known that coaggregation and co-adhesion generally occur equally well in buffer as in saliva, but the influence of temperature on the co-adhesion  of coaggregating oral microbial pairs in saliva is unknown. therefore, co-adhesion of streptococci suspended in saliva to glass with adhering actinomyces present (1.0 x 10(6) cells cm-2) was studied in a parallel plate flow chamber in the temperature range from 22 degrees c to 40 degrees c. in the range  from 22 degrees c up to 35 degrees c both pairs studied, streptococcus oralis 34  with actinomyces naeslundii 5951 and streptococcus oralis j22 with a. naeslundii  5951, displayed similar co-adhesion kinetics and co-adhesion in a stationary end-point, but around and above 37 degrees c co-adhesion almost disappeared. hence, we conclude that co-adhesion of coaggregating oral microbial pairs in saliva may be critically influenced by temperature, especially around the temperatures prevailing in the oral cavity.

TI  == utilization of sialic acid by viridans streptococci.
AB  == the importance of viridans streptococci as agents of serious extra-oral diseases, including endocarditis, is now recognized. we have tested the hypothesis that the ability to utilize sialic acid as a nutrient source may play a role in the proliferation of these organisms. the type strains of the 15 presently recognized species of viridans streptococci and two clinical isolates-s. oralis (ar3), isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis, and s. intermedius (uns35),  a brain abscess isolate-were studied for their ability to utilize sialic acid. only s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. mitis ("oralis group") s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus ("milleri group"), and s. defectivus ("nutritionally variant group") were able to use sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic  acid) efficiently as a sole carbon source. formate, acetate, and ethanol were produced as the major metabolic end-products of sialic acid metabolism, while corresponding glucose-grown cultures produced lactate as the major metabolic end-product. utilization of sialic acid was independent of the production of sialidase. cell-free extracts of sialic acid-grown cultures expressed elevated levels of n-acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase (npl; the first enzyme in the intracellular catabolism of sialic acid) and n-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (glcnac-6-p) deacetylase and glucosamine-6-phosphate (glcn-6-p) deaminase (enzymes involved in the intracellular catabolism of n-acetylglucosamine). these  activities were repressed by growth in the presence of glucose. the intracellular fate of sialic acid, after cleavage by npl into n-acetylmannosamine (mannac) and  pyruvate, is uncertain, but the elevated levels of glcnac-6-p deacetylase and glcn-6-p deaminase in sialic acid-grown cells suggest that phosphorylation and isomerization are possible steps in the metabolism of mannac to generate an intermediate common to the pathway of n-acetylglucosamine metabolism. the species of viridans streptococci that have the ability to utilize sialic acid are those most commonly associated with extra-oral diseases, and this ability is likely to  play a role in the persistence and survival of these infecting organisms in vivo.

AB  == bacterial adherence to the oropharyngeal epithelium is a significant factor in normal microecology, etiopathogenesis of diseases (tonsillitis, gingivitis) and possibly also induction of immune response. bacterial adhesion to human tonsillar epithelium of whole tonsils and swabs was studied by fluorescence, scanning, and  transmission electron microscopy. the epithelial cell borders were well demarcated. on the apical surface of the cells there were irregular microridges.  all forms of microscopy visualized epithelial cells with attached bacteria, often forming microcolonies on the free surface. some bacteria formed excavations on the cell surface. most attached bacteria were coccoid, but variously sized rods were also visible. in transmission electron microscopy, epithelial cells with intracellular bacteria were regularly observed.

TI  == experimental salivary pellicles formed on titanium surfaces mediate adhesion of streptococci.
AB  == the goal of this study was to characterize salivary components of titanium pellicles and to determine how experimental pellicles affect adhesion of several  strains of streptococci to titanium surfaces. titanium experimental pellicles were formed by incubation of fresh human parotid or human submandibular-sublingual saliva on pure titanium beads. pellicle was recovered from the beads using sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer and was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting to identify adsorbed salivary components. streptococcus anginosus, s. oralis, and s. salivarius recovered from in vivo titanium plaque and five reference strains of streptococci were used in adhesion assays to titanium beads with and without experimental salivary pellicles. the experimental pellicle formed on titanium was found to be composed of selected proteins from human parotid and human submandibular-sublingual saliva. salivary alpha-amylase and proline-rich proteins were found in all experimental pellicles, while siga, high-molecular weight mucin, and proline-rich glycoproteins were detected in one of the experimental pellicles examined. adhesion of fresh isolates and reference stains of s. anginosus, s. oralis, and s. salivarius to saliva-coated titanium was reduced compared to that of titanium without saliva coating. however, adhesion of laboratory strains of s. gordonii and s. sanguis was found to be significantly greater to experimental pellicles of human submandibular-sublingual saliva than was the adhesion of the fresh isolates, suggesting that streptococci-colonizing implant surfaces may be inherently less adhesive than other bacterial strains. this study found that salivary pellicles are selectively formed on titanium and mediate in vitro adhesion of streptococci.

TI  == bacterial 16s rdna polymerase chain reaction in the detection of intra-amniotic infection.
AB  == objective: bacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to detect early subclinical intraamhiotic infection. we used universal primers which amplify a dna fragment of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) from all known bacteria and sequenced the positive samples to identify the bacterial species. design: transabdominally  obtained amniotic fluid samples from 20 pregnant women with prelabour rupture of  the fetal membranes (prom), showing no signs of clinical infection, and 16 control samples were analysed with universal bacterial pcr. in addition, routine  bacterial culture and amniotic fluid glucose were studied. results: out of 20 prom patients, five were positive in the pcr. pcr detected ureaplasma urealyticum in two cases, haemophilus influenzae in one case, streptococcus oralis in one case and fusobacterium sp. in one case. only two of these were positive in a routine bacterial culture. both were multibacterial infections, which caused discrepancies between the pcr and culture results. two patients developed infectious complications: both were identified with the pcr assay. amniotic fluid glucose was lower in pcr positive patients compared with pcr negative patients. conclusion: bacterial 16s rdna pcr, in properly controlled conditions, promises to be a fast and reliable test for early intra-amniotic infection especially concerning ureaplasma urealyticum.

TI  == shear bond strength, microleakage and antimicrobial properties of aelitebond.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the shear bond strength (sbs) and microleakage (ml) to dentin as well as the antimicrobial action against five strains of oral bacteria  of aelitebond single primer restorative system. materials and methods: fifteen molars were tested to failure for each of the four time periods: 15 minutes, 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days, after final cure. the test specimens were prepared on  the dentin surfaces of the extracted molars ground on 600 grit sic paper. the bonded cylinders were removed from the assembly apparatus after cure, stored in physiological saline at 37 degrees c for the four different time periods and subjected to a shear bond load at 0.5 mm/minute until fractured. for the microleakage determination, class v cavity preparations were done on the facial surfaces of the roots of 15 canines below the cemento-enamel junction and the specimens thermocycled (500x) between 8 degrees c and 15 degrees c in 2% methylene blue. the teeth were cut into 6 mm thick sections and the sections which included the restorations were separately dissolved in acid. the color intensities of the dissolved sections were measured at a wavelength of 590 nm against a standard curve which was constructed from the dye. the modified model cavity method of meryon & johnson (1989) was used to assess the antimicrobial properties of the restorative system. results: the mean sbs values (in mpa) were  found to be 10.3, 9.8, 11.47 and 9.9 after 15 minutes, 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days, respectively. there was no significant increase (p < 5%) in the sbs after 15 minutes. the ml of 0.76 micrograms dye/ restoration was relatively low in comparison to the sbs values. the restorative system significantly (p < 5%) inhibited the growth of actinomyces naeslundii with 88%, streptococcus mutans with 42%, streptococcus sanguis with 39% and streptococcus oralis with 9%. however, the growth of veillonella parvula was stimulated with 49%.

TI  == identification and characterization of a protease from streptococcus oralis c104.
AB  == streptococcus oralis is among the earliest colonizers of the tooth surface during plaque formation. as such, its enzymatic activities may influence ecologic succession on the tooth surface. in the current study, we use zymograms and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to identify and purify a protease  from s. oralis (sanguis) c104. proteases from s. oralis c104 were detected in cell pellets at 133, 146 and 176 kda as clear proteolytic bands on gelatin-substrate zymograms. preparation of the major (146 kda) protease were obtained by continuous-elution electrophoresis. the protease was active over the  ph range of 7 to 9 with optimum activity between ph 8 and 9. protease activity was inhibited by several serine protease inhibitors including phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, di-isopropyl-phosphofluoridate and aprotinin. the  protease showed highest hydrolytic activity against azoalbumin and bz-pro-phe-arg-na. immunofluorescence studies with a polyclonal antiserum to the  146-kda protease suggest it is present on the cell surface of s. oralis c104. zymograms of cell pellets from other s. oralis strains as well as s. sanguis and  streptococcus mitis suggest that functionally similar proteases are elaborated by many early colonizers of the tooth surface.

TI  == effect of mucin and glucose on proteolytic and glycosidic activities of streptococcus oralis.
AB  == the production of glycosidase and protease activities, which may play a role in the degradation of human glycoproteins, by streptococcus oralis strains isolated  from endocarditis, septicaemia or the oral cavity was investigated with a range of fluorogenic substrates. the ph optima of the proteases ranged from 6.0 to 9.3  and the ph optima for the glycosidases were lower (4.5-6.0), although the ph range over which both groups of enzymes acted was broad. growth in a minimal medium supplemented with glucose resulted in repression of glycosidase activities and elevated proteolytic activity. bacteria from cultures supplemented with porcine gastric mucin (pgm), a model glycoprotein, exhibited higher levels of glycosidase activity, while proteolytic activity was suppressed and glycoprotein-derived monosaccharides were transported at significantly higher rates than those observed for cells grown in media with glucose. pgm-derived cells also exhibited high levels of n-acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase, the first intracellular enzyme in the pathway of sialic acid catabolism. taken together, these data indicate that s. oralis strains produce a range of proteolytic and glycosidic enzymes that may play a role in the degradation of host-derived glycoproteins.

TI  == metabolism of glycoprotein-derived sialic acid and n-acetylglucosamine by streptococcus oralis.
AB  == nine strains of streptococcus oralis, isolated from blood cultures of patients with infective endocarditis or from the oral cavity as part of the normal flora,  were examined for their ability to elaborate sialidase (neuraminidase) and n-acetylglucosaminidase, enzymes which are involved in the degradation of glycoproteins. both glycosidases were induced when bacteria were grown in a minimal medium supplemented with porcine gastric mucin, a model glycoprotein, and repressed when growth occurred in the presence of glucose. cell-free extracts mucin-grown cultures expressed elevated levels of n-acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase (the first intracellular enzyme in the pathway of n-acetylneuraminate catabolism), n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac)-6-phosphate deacetylase and glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (enzymes involved in the intracellular catabolism of glcnac 6-phosphate); activity of each of these intracellular enzymes was markedly repressed when bacteria were grown in media supplemented with alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, a major component of human plasma. cells from these cultures expressed high levels of sialidase, n-acetylglucosaminidase, and the intracellular enzymes involved in the catabolism of n-acetyl-sugars released by action of these glycosidases. high-resolution 1h-nmr spectroscopy of spent culture supernatants revealed that sialic acid and glcnac residues of the molecularly mobile oligosaccharide side-chains of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein had been hydrolysed and the released sugars internalized by the bacteria. these data indicate that s. oralis has the ability to hydrolyse constituents of oligosaccharide side-chains of host-derived glycoproteins and to  utilize simultaneously these released carbohydrates. the biochemical characteristics induced by the growth of s. oralis on glycoproteins may play a role in the survival and persistence of these bacteria at the infection site in vivo.

TI  == defining antibody targets in streptococcus oralis infection.
AB  == immunoblotting of sera from 12 neutropenic patients with streptococcus oralis septicemia and 18 patients with endocarditis due to viridans group streptococci revealed immunodominant s. oralis antigens at 85 and 180 kda. the former cross-reacted with a mouse monoclonal antibody to hsp90. the latter was identified by sequencing positive clones obtained by screening a genomic expression library of s. oralis with pooled sera from patients who had been infected with s. oralis. antibody eluted from one of these clones reacted with the 180-kda antigen of s. oralis. southern blotting confirmed the origin of the clone from s. oralis. the derived amino acid sequence showed 76.2% homology with  the pac protein precursor of streptococcus mutans and 73.8% homology with the spaa protein precursor of streptococcus sobrinus. epitope mapping of the derived  amino acid sequence with sera from patients with viridans group streptococcal endocarditis delineated nine epitopes. peptides 1 (tmypnrqpgsgwdss) and 2 (wyslngkiravdvpk), representing two of these epitopes, and peptide 3 (yevekplepapvaps), representing the repeat proline region, were synthesized. these three peptides were used to screen a phage antibody display library derived from a patient who had recovered from s. oralis infection. two of the human recombinant antibodies produced (soral 3 and soral 4 against peptide 3) and a human recombinant antibody (b3.7) against the conserved epitope (lkvirk) of hsp90 gave statistically significant protection, compared with control groups, in a mouse model of lethal s. oralis infection.

TI  == clinical, microbiological and immunological profile of healthy, gingivitis and putative active periodontal subjects.
AB  == thirteen periodontally healthy subjects were monitored clinically for 6-12 months. clinical measurements at 6-weekly intervals included duplicate pd measurements, presence of plaque, redness, and bleeding on probing. baseline measurements consisted of 2 visits 1 wk apart. microbial samples were taken from  11 of the subjects who had completed at least 8 months of monitoring. levels of serum antibodies to 12 periodontal species were determined from 10 subjects. standard deviations of replicate pd measurements, computed for each subject, ranged from 0.2-0.3 mm over the monitoring period. plaque and redness increased during monitoring, and showed a weak association with pd change. baseline and follow-up distributions of pd changes indicated that changes of > 1.5 mm could reasonably be considered to represent active sites. five subjects demonstrated at least 1 site deepening by 1.5 mm over the period monitored, and these were considered putative active subjects. sites from 2 subjects showed pd increases in the 6 wk just before sampling, and these were considered to represent active sites. species associated with putative active subjects included actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, selenomonas noxia and prevotella nigrescens. streptococcus sanguis, s. gordonii and peptostreptococcus micros were associated  with inactive subjects. s. gordonii and s. oralis were associated with health, whereas p. nigrescens was associated with gingivitis. elevated serum antibodies were detected to a. actinomycetemcomitans in 4 subjects. the predominant microbiota of putative active subjects included some species previously associated with gingivitis, and some species previously associated with progressing periodontitis.

TI  == associations of endodontic symptoms and signs with particular combinations of specific bacteria.
AB  == significant associations have been reported between (a) specific bacterial species isolated from root canals and (b) between individual bacterial species and endodontic symptoms and signs. the prime objective of this study was to determine whether particular combinations of specific bacteria are associated with individual endodontic symptoms and signs. seventy root canals were investigated microbiologically taking care to maintain the viability of obligate  anaerobes, which accounted for 64% of the total species isolated, including peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella oralis, eubacterium aerofaciens, eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella  buccae and prevotella intermedia. significant associations were found between individual clinical features and the following pairs of species: (a) pain (37 cases) and peptostreptococcus spp./prevotella spp., peptostreptococcus spp./prevotella melaninogenica, pstr. micros/prev. melaninogenica (all p < 0.01); (b) swelling (23 cases) and pstr. micros/prevotella spp. (p < 0.01); (c) 'wet' canal (57 cases) and prevotella spp./eubacterium spp. (p < 0.01), peptostreptococcus spp./eubacterium spp. (p < 0.05). thus data from this investigation suggests that statistically significant associations exist between  individual endodontic symptoms and signs and particular combinations of specific  bacteria.

TI  == co-adhesion of oral microbial pairs under flow in the presence of saliva and lactose.
AB  == co-aggregation (interactions between two suspended micro-organisms) between oral  microbial pairs has been studied extensively and is believed to be an important factor in dental plaque formation. however, co-adhesion (interactions between suspended and already-adhering micro-organisms) may well be equally important. the aim of this paper was to determine the influence of saliva and lactose on the co-adhesion of streptococci (s. oralis 34 and s. sanguis pk1889) to actinomyces (a. naeslundii t14v-j1 or 5951) adhering on glass under flow from buffer and saliva in the absence and presence of lactose. the kinetics of co-adhesion as well as co-adhesion in a stationary end-point of co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating pairs was studied in a parallel plate flow chamber by analysis of the spatial arrangement of co-adhering micro-organisms as a function of time.  for co-aggregating pairs, initial deposition rates of streptococci in the immediate vicinity of adhering actinomyces (local initial deposition rates) were  up to 5 to 10 times higher than the non-local initial deposition rates in buffer  and in saliva, respectively. in a stationary end-point of co-adhesion, 5 to 6 times more streptococci co-adhered with the adhering actinomyces than averaged over the entire substratum surface. a non-co-aggregating pair showed only minor preferential (co-)adhesion near the adhering actinomyces. co-adhesion in buffer was fully lost when lactose was added. however, addition of lactose to saliva did not inhibit co-adhesion, but co-adhesion became more reversible. detachment of micro-organisms from the substratum due to the passage of an air-liquid interface, as occurs in the oral cavity during eating, drinking, and speaking, was minimal when deposition was carried out from buffer to bare glass. major detachment of streptococci adhering to the substratum occurred when adhesion was  mediated through a salivary conditioning film on the glass, while detachment of adhering actinomyces and streptococci co-adhering with them remained low. it is suggested that, in the development of dental plaque, adhering actinomyces may act as strongholds for other micro-organisms, like streptococci, to adhere.

TI  == inhibitory effects of funoran on the adherence and colonization of mutans streptococci.
AB  == funoran, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from the seaweed gloiopeltis furcata strongly inhibited the absorption of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha), but enhanced that of streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 and  streptococcus oralis atcc 10557. furthermore, funoran had a strong desorption activity against mutans streptococci preadsorbed to s-ha. in the presence of sucrose, the absorption of cells of streptococcus sobrinus b13, streptococcus mutans ingbritt, and s. mutans mt8148r to s-ha was strongly inhibited by 0.01% funoran. the colonization of s. sobrinus 6715 inoculated on the molar teeth of experimental rats that were administered funoran was less frequent than that in a funoran-free group. the mean buccal and lingual, sulcal, and total caries scores  of rat groups administered funoran were significantly lower than those of the funoran-free group.

TI  == polypeptides associated with tufts of cell-surface fibrils in an oral streptococcus.
AB  == cells of the oral bacterium streptococcus oralis cn3410 produce lateral tufts of  cell-surface fibrils of two lengths. treatment of cells with trypsin resulted in  loss of the tufts and release of longer fibrils intact. sds-page analysis of trypsin extracts containing fibrils revealed two groups of high molecular mass polypeptides which were denoted group a (molecular mass 227-246 kda) and group b  (molecular mass 175-208 kda). antibodies were raised to these two groups of trypsin-extracted polypeptides (teps) and to purified fibrils, and the reactivities of the three different antisera were found to be similar both on nitrocellulose blots of cell-surface polypeptides and in elisa with whole cells.  similar patterns of teps were obtained from cells of a spontaneously derived mutant strain, kp34v, which lacked the short fibril components of tufts. cells of strain kp34v had similar cell-surface hydrophobicity to strain cn3410 cells, and  adhered to the same extent to parotid salivary pellicle or human buccal epithelial cells (becs) as the wild-type cells. trypsin treatment of strain cn3410 cells abolished their surface hydrophobicity and ability to adhere to becs, but did not affect streptococcal cell binding to experimental salivary pellicle. antibodies to teps or fibrils had no effect on cell adhesion to becs or salivary pellicle. the results imply that the short fibril components of tufts are not involved in the cell adhesion properties tested. it is suggested that the teps are components of long fibrils, but they are not determinants of streptococcal cell adhesion to pellicle or to epithelial cells.

TI  == homeologous recombination and mismatch repair during transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae: saturation of the hex mismatch repair system.
AB  == the ability of the hex generalized mismatch repair system to prevent recombination between partially divergent (also called homeologous) sequences during transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated. by using as donor in transformation cloned fragments 1.7-17.5% divergent in dna sequence from the recipient, it was observed that the hex system prevents chromosomal integration of the least and the most divergent fragments but frequently fails to do so for other fragments. in the latter case, the hex system becomes saturated (inhibited) due to an excess of mismatches: it is unable to repair a single mismatch located elsewhere on the chromosome. further investigation with chromosomal donor dna, carrying only one genetically marked divergent region, revealed that a single divergent fragment can lead to saturation of the hex system. increase in cellular concentration of either hexa, the muts homologue that binds mismatches, or hexb, the mutl homologue for which the essential role in repair as yet remains obscure, was shown to restore repair ability in previously saturating conditions. investigation of heterospecific transformation  by chromosomal dna from two related streptococcal species, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis, also revealed complete saturation of the hex system. therefore the hex system is not a barrier to interspecies recombination in s. pneumoniae. these results are discussed in light of those described for the mut system of escherichia coli.

TI  == bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. the absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. to identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a  possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mm) for 4 h and with the ph kept at 7.0 by a ph-stat. removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or  294.4 mm [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, streptococcus sanguis  i and ii (sanguis and oralis), and strep. mitior (mitis biotype i); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mm were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mm when grown anaerobically. earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. the amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. none of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, neisseria sicca, haemophilus segnis, h. parainfluenzae, actinomyces viscosus and staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. the ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mm. this almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with  glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mm. in the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the relation between the biochemical and serological properties of 'streptococcus sanguis' was studied to characterize the strains isolated from dental plaque of patients with behcet's disease and controls. seven reference and 100 clinical strains preserved by the behcet's disease research committee of japan were identified using established criteria and differentiated with antisera against strep. oralis atcc 10557, strep. sanguis atcc 10556 and 'strep. sanguis' st7, compatible with the criteria. uncommon serovars (serotypes) kth-1 (= atcc 49298), kth-2 (= atcc 49296), kth-3 (= atcc kth-4 (= atcc 49297) and b220 (serovar kth-1) with both iga1 protease and neuraminidase (sialidase) were identified as strep. oralis, whereas common serovars st3 with iga1 protease alone and st7 without both enzymes were identified as strep. sanguis and strep. gordonii, respectively. isolates previously ranked as uncommon serovars were identified as strep. oralis, whereas the rest ranked as common serovars were identified as the same species as those of the grouping strains. a soft-agar technique was available for species identification except for strep. oralis serovar kth-1 reacting with the antiserum against strep. gordonii st7. the frequency of isolation of strep. oralis was higher in behcet's disease (52%) than in controls (38%), but no difference was observed between the properties of the two groups of isolates. strep. oralis virulence factors may be involved in breach the mucosal barrier in patients with  specific reactivity to these antigens and inducing behcet's disease.

TI  == sucrose-dependent accumulation of oral streptococci and their adhesion-defective  mutants on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.
AB  == the adhesion and accumulation of oral streptococci on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite was examined in strains representing species that appear in initial plaque (streptococcus sanguise fc1 and streptococcus oralis c5) and in more mature plaque (streptococcus gordonii g9b). washed cells of strains fc1 and  c5 did not attach better to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite than did strain g9b, suggesting that the degree of initial adhesiveness does not alone account for the temporal appearance of these bacteria in dental plaque. growing cells of each strain were also examined for their ability to accumulate on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. the addition of sucrose to the medium promoted the accumulation of strain g9b more than it promoted the accumulation of strains fc1 and c5. sucrose also enhanced the accumulation of adhesion-defective mutants of each strain to levels similar to those of the respective parent strains. these results suggest that sucrose-dependent accumulation may facilitate the colonization of the tooth surface by these species of oral streptococci when adhesion is limited  by reduced bacterial adhesiveness or limited pellicle-binding sites.

TI  == saliva protein binding to layers of oral streptococci in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == this paper reports a system for measuring saliva protein binding to oral streptococci. enamel chips with layers of streptococcus gordonii blackburn or streptococcus oralis 10557 were incubated in vitro with whole saliva from eight persons. blackburn bound significantly more amylase than 10557; no strain differences were seen for lysozyme or lactoferrin. there were significant correlations between saliva and bound amylase and lactoferrin. blackburn and 10557 chips were then placed in ten subjects. sites included the buccal left and  right upper premolars and molars (ul, ur), labial upper central incisors (uc), and lingual lower central incisors (ll). that study was repeated three months later; chips with streptococcus sanguis 13379 were also placed then. blackburn bound significantly more amylase than the other strains. blackburn and 10557 both bound the most amylase at ul and ur, and the least amylase at uc. however, strain 13379 bound less amylase at ul. that strain also bound significantly less siga at ul. all three strains bound the least siga at uc. lysozyme and lactoferrin binding showed few differences among sites or strains. bound protein concentrations were significantly correlated across sites and strains within subjects, but not correlated with whole saliva. strain differences may reflect species differences in amylase binding, or differences in species-specific siga titers. site differences may indicate local variation in protein availability. differences between chip correlations with whole saliva in vitro and in vivo suggest that the salivary film may be modified as it flows over tooth surfaces.

TI  == adherence of candida albicans to a cell surface polysaccharide receptor on streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == candida albicans atcc 10261 and ca2 bound to cells of the oral bacteria streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguis when these bacteria were immobilized onto microtiter plate wells, but they did not bind to cells of streptococcus mutans or streptococcus salivarius. cell wall polysaccharide was extracted with alkali from s. gordonii nctc 7869, the streptococcal species to which c. albicans bound with highest affinity, and was effective in blocking the coaggregation of c. albicans and s. gordonii cells in the fluid phase. when fixed to microtiter plate wells, the s. gordonii polysaccharide was bound by all strains of c. albicans tested. the polysaccharide contained rha, glc, galnac, glcnac, and gal and was related compositionally to previously characterized cell wall polysaccharides from strains of s. oralis and  s. sanguis. the adherence of yeast cells to the immobilized polysaccharide was not inhibitable by a number of saccharides. antiserum raised to the s. gordonii nctc 7869 polysaccharide blocked adherence of c. albicans atcc 10261 to the polysaccharide. the results identify a complex cell wall polysaccharide of s. gordonii as the coaggregation receptor for c. albicans. adherent interactions of  yeast cells with streptococci and other bacteria may be important for colonization of both hard and soft oral surfaces by c. albicans.

TI  == comparison of phenotypic characteristics, dna-dna hybridization results, and results with a commercial rapid biochemical and enzymatic reaction system for identification of viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was evaluated for its ability to identify 21 species of viridans group streptococci; results were compared with dna-dna hybridization results and results of conventional physiological tests. a total of 171 strains of the 21 species including 147 clinical strains was analyzed. of the 156 strains of species included in the database of this system, 136 strains (87%) were correctly identified. incorrect identification occurred for 13 strains (8%), and no identification was given for  7 strains (5%). it was difficult to differentiate s. mitis and s. oralis accurately with this system. of the 17 strains identified as s. mitis by the rapid id 32 strep system, the results of dna-dna hybridization were in agreement  for only 3 strains. s. crista and s. parasanguis, which are not included in the database, were identified as s. mitis or s. sanguis or were not identified, but s. parasanguis could probably be identified by using the rapid id 32 strep system because the biochemical profile is well characterized for this species. the rapid id 32 strep system can be used to differentiate most species for which phenotypic characteristics have been described if the database is revised according to recently reported amended criteria for the identification of viridans group streptococci. however, identification of a few species such as s. mitis and s. oralis is problematic with this system.

TI  == prosthetic hip infection related to a dental procedure despite antibiotic prophylaxis.
AB  == a 39-year-old man with systemic lupus erythematosus who was taking corticosteroids had a prosthetic hip infection with streptococcus oralis after a  dental procedure despite prophylaxis with erythromycin. the causative organism was resistant to erythromycin. for patients with prosthetic joints the literature does not support dental prophylaxis, which even if given appropriately, may fail  to prevent infection. some experts advocate giving antibiotic prophylaxis to patients at high risk, although data supporting this practice are limited. however, considering that most orthopedic surgeons and many dental clinicians provide antibiotic prophylaxis, alternatives to erythromycin such as a first-generation cephalosporin should be considered.

TI  == relatedness among penicillin-binding protein 2b genes of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 2b similarities among streptococcus mitis, s. oralis, and s. pneumoniae using dna fingerprinting and sequencing were investigated. the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed on 41 penicillin-susceptible and -resistant clinical isolates of s. mitis and s. oralis using the susceptible s. pneumoniae r6 pbp 2b primers. pcr products were then analyzed using hinf i and sty i restriction enzymes. of 41 s. mitis/s. oralis isolates studied 15 strains produced a pcr product of a similar size to that of s. pneumoniae r6. on fingerprinting these 15 strains, 11 different patterns were  seen using sty i restriction enzyme and 12 different patterns with hinf i. the pbp 2b genes of the s. mitis and s. oralis isolates studied were found to be very heterogenous. the pbp 2b genes of two s. mitis isolates, mics 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, were sequenced. these pbp 2b genes were found to possess a mosaic  structure when compared to those of other s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococcal species. analysis of these mosaic blocks indicates that both s. mitis strains contain areas that originated from s. pneumoniae as well as regions of unknown origin. pbp 2b sequence comparisons of a susceptible s. oralis with reported sequences of s. pneumoniae r6 and s. mitis nctc 10712 revealed what appears at this stage to be nucleotide regions unique to s. oralis. a penicillin-resistant s. oralis strain contained a pneumococcal region of 272 bp that was flanked by s. oralis sequences. these specific s. oralis regions have been located in pbp 2b genes of penicillin-resistant s. oralis and s. pneumoniae  isolates described from europe and south africa.

TI  == degradative enzymes of oral streptococci.
AB  == members of the streptococcus sanguis group (ssg) and streptococcus milleri group  (smg) were screened for their ability to produce glycosidase, arylamidase (peptidase), protease, dextranase and glycosyltransferase activities. species within each group produced unique patterns of activity. the most commonly produced glycosidases were beta-d-glucosidase, beta-d-galactosidase, n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and n-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase and the least commonly produced glycosidase activity was beta-fucosidase with streptococcus intermedius (smg) being the only species capable of producing the activity. for arylamidase activity, the most commonly produced type was lysine-arylamidase. glycosidase and arylamidase activities were localized to particular sub-cellular fractions. alpha-galactosidase was found only in culture  supernatant fluids whereas n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase was found in all fractions; the culture supernatant, cell wall, cell membrane and cytoplasm. no arylamidase activity was seen in culture supernatants. phe-arg-arylamidase was found only in cytoplasmic fractions whereas val-pro-argarylamidase was found in cell walls, cell membranes and cytoplasmic fraction. protease activity was measured as the degradation of bovine serum albumin (bsa) and casein. casein was  degraded by a number of strains whereas no species/strains were able to degrade bsa. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus (smg), streptococcus mitior and streptococcus defectivus (ssg) were the only species that produced hyaluronidase and no species produced chondroitin sulphatase. the groups were also examined for their abilities to produce glycosyltransferase and dextranase.  strep. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis produced glucosyltransferase and, with the exception of the latter species, fructosyltransferase. no species within the smg was capable of producing either glycosyltransferase.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == detection and incidence of the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(m) in the  microflora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples were collected from 68 patients with adult periodontitis, enumerated on trypticase-soy blood agar plates, with and without tetracycline at 4 micrograms/ml, and incubated anaerobically for 5 days. each different colony morphotype was enumerated, and a representative colony was subcultured for identification and examined for the tetracycline resistance gene  tet(m). both pcr amplification and dna hybridization, using a fragment of tet(m)  from tn1545, were used to detect tet(m). the pcr primers (5'-gacacgccaggacatatgg-3' and 5'-tgctttcctcttgttcgag-3') were chosen to amplify  a 397 bp region of tet(m). tetracycline-resistant bacteria represented approximately 12% of the total viable count. the percentage of tet(m)-positive bacteria in the tetracycline resistant microflora varied from < or = 0.05 to 83%  (mean of 10%). tet(m) was detected in 60% of 204 tetracycline-resistant strains subcultured and identified. the tet(m) containing strains consisted of streptococci (55%, mainly s. intermedius, s. oralis, s. sanguis, and streptococcus sm4), actinomyces d01 (14%), bifidobacterium d05 (11%), and veillonella spp. (10%). tetracycline-resistant strains in which tet(m) was not detected included the prevotella and bacteroides species (41%, mainly bacteroides d28, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and p. oris). these results suggest that tet(m) is widely spread in the adult periodontal microflora, but it appears, with the exception of s. intermedius, to be mainly associated with microorganisms not  considered to be periodontopathogens. assessment of other tetracycline-resistant  genes in oral organisms is needed to fully evaluate the nature of resistance to this antibiotic in the oral flora.

TI  == microbial flora of sinus tracts and root canals of non-vital teeth.
AB  == the occurrence of bacteria in 12 endodontically induced periodontal lesions associated with sinus tracts was examined. the microbial flora encountered in the sinus tract was compared with that of the root canal of the involved teeth which  had not experienced any prior endodontic therapy. all microbiological samples taken from the sinus tract and from the root canal system contained bacteria. seventy-one strains were detected in the extraradicular lesions. of the anaerobic species, fusobacterium nucleatum (7 strains), prevotella intemedia (4 strains) and p. oralis (4 strains) were most frequently found. in the group of the facultative anaerobes streptococcus spp. were predominant. ninety-four strains were isolated from the root canal system of the 12 teeth. p. intermedia (6 strains), p. buccae (5 strains), f. nucleatum (5 strains) and lactobacillus plantarum (5 strains) were most common. in 9 cases, species present in the root canal could be revealed in the extraradicular lesions. it was concluded that a variety of microorganisms were capable of colonizing endodontically induced, extraradicular lesions clinically characterized by sinus tracts.

TI  == a comparison of the microbial flora in carious dentine of clinically detectable and undetectable occlusal lesions.
AB  == it is not known whether the aetiology of occlusal hidden caries lesions (hcl) is  identical to that of small visible lesions (svl). previous studies of the microflora of hcl suggest that relatively few species can be isolated. the aim of the present study was to compare the bacterial composition of dentine from 10 hcl and 17 svl in a population of children aged 8-18 years. the following bacteria were identified: actinomyces spp., mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii. streptococcus mitis, and lactobacillus spp. streptococcus mutans was found more often in the hcl group (p  = 0.03), while streptococcus sobrinus was found more often in the svl group (p =  0.05). however, proportions of both species were lower in the svl group as compared with the hcl group (s. mutans p = 0.07; s. sobrinus p = 0.03). lactobacilli and actinomyces spp. were found at similar levels in both groups. a  more diverse range of streptococcal species and veillonella was found in the svl  group (p = 0.001). these results show a less complex microflora in hcl as compared with svl, indicating that the aetiology of hidden caries might be different from that of open caries.

TI  == streptococci and actinomyces inhibit regrowth of streptococcus mutans on gnotobiotic rat molar teeth after chlorhexidine varnish treatment.
AB  == clinical studies suggest that the long-term suppression of mutans streptococci on tooth surfaces after intensive chlorhexidine therapy is mainly due to bacterial interference. other streptococci and also actinomyces naeslundii are proposed to  inhibit regrowth of mutans streptococci after suppression by the agent. we have tested this hypothesis in gnotobiotic rats associated with streptococcus mutans alone, or associated with s. mutans and strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis biovar i, and  a. naeslundii. left lower jaws in these rats were treated with concentrated chlorhexidine varnish, and the return of s. mutans on the treated jaws monitored. in mono-associated rats, s. mutans regained the level of the untreated right lower jaw in approximately 1 week. in contrast, s. mutans remained suppressed for several weeks in rats multi-associated with other streptococci and actinomyces strains. the suppression was more pronounced in the rats fed on basal diet with little free sugars than in rats fed on a sucrose-containing diet. counts of other streptococci recovered quickly from the intensive chlorhexidine treatment, but a. naeslundii remained suppressed for at least 1 week. the findings demonstrate the  crucial importance of the oral microflora in controlling regrowth of mutans streptococci after chemotherapy.

TI  == isolation and structural characterization of adhesin polysaccharide receptors.
AB  == the procedure for the purification of the adhesin polysaccharide receptor and its hexasaccharide repeating unit from whole s. oralis atcc 55229 by chemical, enzymatic, and chromatographic techniques has been described. chemical, chromatographic, and mass spectrometric procedures allow preliminary structural characterization of the hexasaccharide repeating unit and polysaccharide. the structural characterizations of the hexasaccharide and polysaccharide are completed using several 1d and 2d nmr techniques. identification of the anomeric  1h and 13c signals of the glycosyl residues permits, by virtue of their chemical  shifts and coupling constants (3jhh and 1jch), the determination of the configurations of the glycosidic linkages. the hmbc connectivities permit the establishment of the hexasaccharide sequence as rhap alpha(1-->2)rhap alpha(1-->3)galp alpha(1-->3)galp beta(1-->4)glcp beta(1-->3)gal. the 1h nmr chemical shifts of the polysaccharide, as determined by the combination of cosy and tocsy experiments, and the observed interglycosidic noesy cross-peaks reveal  the structure of the polysaccharide to be [formula: see text] where the position  of the glycerol (gro) phosphate moiety has been determined by [1h, 31p] nmr spectroscopy.

TI  == characterization of coaggregation and fibrinogen-binding by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == we have examined whether the adhesin of porphyromonas gingivalis which aggregates streptococcus oralis contributes to its fibrinogen-binding. various properties of coaggregation between p. gingivalis and s. oralis were compared with those of fibrinogen-binding to p. gingivalis cells. the coaggregation activity was measured by a turbidimetric method and the fibrinogen-binding activity was determined by using 125i-fibrinogen. both the activities showed maximum values in the ph range from 5.0 to 6.0 and they were inhibited by arginine and lysine. heating treatment of p. gingivalis 381 cells at 75 degrees c abrogated the activities. however, treatment of p. gingivalis 381 cells with proteinase k considerably reduced the fibrinogen-binding activity but not the coaggregation activity. metal ions such as zn2+ and cu2+ inhibited the coaggregation activity but enhanced the fibrinogen-binding activity. the results also indicated that p.  gingivalis strains 381, atcc 33277 and su-3 showed relatively higher activities both in coaggregation and fibrinogen-binding, whereas p. gingivalis strains w83,  51 and 165 showing lower fibrinogen-binding activity than p. gingivalis 381 did not coaggregate with s. oralis atcc 9811. these findings suggest that coadhesin of p. gingivalis with s. oralis is not be associated with its fibrinogen-binding.

TI  == kinetics of lactose-reversible coadhesion of actinomyces naeslundii wvu 398a and  streptococcus oralis 34 on the surface of hexadecane droplets.
AB  == most investigations of mechanisms accounting for intergeneric coaggregation have  emphasized stereospecific rather than nonspecific interactions. the purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative importance of lectin-carbohydrate and nonspecific hydrophobic and ionic interactions, using a model based on strains with one of the most well understood specific coaggregation mechanisms, the lactose-reversible coaggregation of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis. the kinetics of coadhesion and desorption of coadherent bacteria were studied using s. oralis 34 bound to hexadecane droplets  as an affinity support for the adhesion of a. naeslundii wvu 398a. light, confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that a. naeslundii cells adhered only to the s. oralis cells, not to exposed hexadecane between the streptococci. coadhesion was inhibited by lactose concentrations as low as 2.0 mm. the rate of coadhesion was halved at 60 mm lactose. the hydrophobicity inhibitors bovine serum albumin and defatted bovine serum albumin  and the salts licl and kcl failed to inhibit coadhesion in the hexadecane assay,  and bovine serum albumin also failed to inhibit coaggregation in a bacterial aggregation assay on glass slides. high concentrations of the salts achieved a 50% rate decrease in a. naeslundii adhesion to the s. oralis-coated droplets only when they were combined with > 20 mm lactose. sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) and tween 20 inhibition was tested by the slide coaggregation assay because they tended to emulsify the droplets; sds was inhibitory. lactose selectively desorbed a. naeslundii from s. oralis-coated droplets at low concentrations equivalent to  those that inhibited coadhesion. neither licl nor kcl desorbed a. naeslundii from the droplets, even at 500 mm. at low concentrations, sds but not tween 20 eluted  both a. naeslundii and s. oralis from the droplets. although the sds results might suggest a degree of cooperative charge interactions, the results support the hypothesis that stereospecific, beta-galactoside-sensitive interactions have  a much greater impact than nonspecific interactions on the coadhesion of a. naeslundii and s. oralis.

TI  == effect of binding of fibrinogen to each bacterium on coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus oralis.
AB  == fibrinogen inhibits the coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus oralis. in this study, we determined which bacterium interacts with fibrinogen in this inhibitory process. although preincubation of each bacterium with fibrinogen did not inhibit coaggregation, its activity was completely eliminated by the addition of protease inhibitors such as n-ethylmaleimide (nem), p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate and n alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone  to the preincubation mixture with fibrinogen and p. gingivalis. however, the inhibition of coaggregation was not found after preincubation of s. oralis with fibrinogen in the presence or absence of the protease inhibitors. labelled materials were recovered from the extract of p. gingivalis cells incubated with radioiodinated fibrinogen in the presence of nem but not in the absence of nem. in the binding experiment, p. gingivalis showed a much higher binding activity to fibrinogen than s. oralis. these findings suggest that fibrinogen and its fragment(s) may mask directly or indirectly the aggregation site with s. oralis on the p. gingivalis cells in its inhibitory process of coaggregation.

TI  == antigenic relationships among immunoglobulin a1 proteases from haemophilus, neisseria, and streptococcus species.
AB  == to investigate the antigenic variation and relationships of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) proteases among different species and genera, we examined a comprehensive  collection of serine type and metallo-type iga1 proteases and corresponding antisera in enzyme neutralization assays. sharing of neutralizing epitopes of metallo-type iga1 proteases from streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis and of serine type iga1 proteases from haemophilus and pathogenic neisseria species was extremely limited. a number of limited to strong cross-reactions in such epitopes were found among serine type iga1 proteases released by members of the genera haemophilus and neisseria,  reflecting the common origin of their iga gene. however, the relatively limited prevalence of shared "neutralizing" epitopes of iga1 proteases from the two genera indicates that they rarely induce immunity to each other. in contrast, extensive sharing of neutralizing epitopes was found between n. meningitidis and  n. gonorrhoeae iga1 proteases, making them potentially attractive vaccine components. among metallo-type iga1 proteases, several pneumococcal proteases were found to induce neutralizing antibodies to iga1 proteases of oral streptococci whereas the opposite was not the case.

AB  == the anti-adherent agent m239,144 has been shown to reduce the adhesion of s. sanguis strains to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite by 27-94%. the purpose of this study was to determine any antibacterial properties of m239,144 which might inhibit replication of the organisms which do adhere and to determine whether m239,144 interferes with the antibacterial properties of the antiseptic agent chlorhexidine. maximum inhibitory dilutions (mids) were calculated using both broth and agar methods. 0.1% m239,144 displayed no antibacterial activity against s. oralis nctc 7864 or s. sanguis nctc 7863 using the broth dilution method and had no antibacterial activity against a range of plaque-forming organisms using the agar dilution method. the anti-bacterial activity of chlorhexidine against four of five oral plaque-forming species was reduced by 0.1% m239,144. the effect of a novel anti-adherent agent, mk239,144, on chlorhexidine staining was assessed in an in vitro model. 1% m239,144 completely prevented chlorhexidine staining at  concentrations from 0.0002% to 0.2%. m239,144/chlorhexidine formulations show potential for a non-staining anti-plaque mouthwash.

TI  == detection of streptococcus pneumoniae dna in blood cultures by pcr.
AB  == we have developed a pcr assay, with primers derived from the autolysin (lyt) gene, for the detection of streptococcus pneumoniae dna in blood cultures. the predicted fragment of 247 bp was detected in all strains of pneumococci, embracing 12 different serotypes that were tested. although dna extracted from four viridans streptococci spp. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus parasanguis) gave amplification products, these were quite different from the predicted fragment for s. pneumoniae. application of the assay for diagnosis of septicemia caused by s. pneumoniae showed concordance between pcr and culture results. however, on four occasions pcr was positive in supernatants from both paired culture bottles while pneumococci were cultured from only one. performing pcr on negative cultures in controlled studies such as vaccine trials may provide a sensitive tool for increasing case detection.

TI  == pioneer oral streptococci produce immunoglobulin a1 protease.
AB  == as part of a longitudinal study of the relationship between bacterial colonization and the secretory immune response, 367 isolates of pioneer viridans  streptococci collected from 40 breast- and bottle-fed neonates within the first month postpartum were tested for the production of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease and glycosidases. fifty percent of the streptococci isolated produced iga1 protease, including all isolates of streptococcus oralis and s. sanguis, 60.7% of s. mitis biovar 1 isolates, and some isolates that could not be identified. three cleavage patterns of alpha 1 heavy chains were observed. six isolates of s. mitis biovar 1 that did not produce iga1 protease attacked the alpha 1 chain. incubation of iga1 protease-negative s. mitis biovar 1 isolates with iga1, either prior to or together with s. sanguis, rendered the iga1 paraprotein resistant to cleavage by the iga1 protease of s. sanguis. the ability of some pioneer streptococci in the human oral cavity to produce iga1 protease and of others to modify the susceptibility of iga1 to cleavage by iga1 protease perhaps enhances their ability to survive in this habitat.

TI  == changes in root canal microbiota during the development of rat periapical lesions.
AB  == periapical lesions are reproducibly induced in rats by pulp exposure and infection from the oral cavity. lesions expand rapidly between day 7 and day 15-20 (active phase), with slowed expansion thereafter. in the present study we characterized the root canal microbiota present during the active phase of lesion development in this system. the mandibular first molars of sprague-dawley rats were exposed on day 0. the teeth were extracted after 7 days (n = 10 animals) and 15 days (n = 10), and the microbiota present in roots was isolated and characterized. the number of colonies isolated per tooth was similar on day 7 (1.53 +/- 0.64 colony-forming units x 10(3)) and day 15 (1.49 +/- 0.37 colony-forming units x 10(3)). no colonies were isolated from unexposed control teeth. anaerobic bacteria increased significantly between day 7 (24.3 +/- 5.7%) and day 15 (47.3 +/- 7.5%), and the proportion of gram-negative organisms increased from day 7 (24.3 +/- 6.1) to day 15 (46.9 +/- 6.8). the predominant bacteria included, on day 7: streptococcus and bacteroides species; on day 15: species of streptococcus, bacteroides, prevotella, neisseria and peptostreptococcus. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus rattus, bacteroides pneumosintes and bacteroides ureolyticus were frequently isolated at both points. although approximately the same mean number of different species (approximately 3.5) was isolated per tooth on both day 7 and 15, the overall diversity of the isolates increased on day 15.(abstract truncated at 250  words)

TI  == mosaic pbpx genes of major clones of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae have evolved from pbpx genes of a penicillin-sensitive streptococcus oralis.
AB  == penicillin-resistant clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae contain mosaic penicillin-binding protein (pbp) genes that encode pbps with decreased affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics. the mosaic blocks are believed to be the result of gene transfer of homologous pbp genes from related penicillin-resistant species.  we have now identified a gene homologous to the pneumococcal pbp2x gene (pbpx) in a penicillin-sensitive streptococcus oralis isolate m3 from south africa that diverged by almost 20% from pbpx of penicillin-sensitive pneumococci, and a central sequence block of a mosaic pbpx gene of streptococcus mitis strain nctc 10712. in contrast, it differed by only 2-4% of the 1 to 1.5 kb mosaic block in pbpx genes of three genetically unrelated penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates, two of them representing clones of serotype 6b and 23f, which are prevalent in spain and are also already found in other countries. with low concentrations of cefotaxime, transformants of the sensitive s. pneumoniae r6 strain could be selected containing pbpx genes from either s. mitis nctc 10712 or s. oralis m3, demonstrating that genetic exchange can already occur between beta-lactam-sensitive species. these data are in agreement with the assumption that pbps as penicillin-resistance determinants have evolved by the accumulation  of point mutations in genes of sensitive commensal species.

TI  == molecular basis of the optochin-sensitive phenotype of pneumococcus: characterization of the genes encoding the f0 complex of the streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus oralis h(+)-atpases.
AB  == the gene responsible for the optochin-sensitive (opts) phenotype of streptococcus pneumoniae has been characterized. sequence comparisons indicated that the genes  involved encoded the subunits of the f0 complex of an h(+)-atpase. sequence analysis and transformation experiments showed that the atpc gene is responsible  for the optochin-sensitive resistant (opts/optr) phenotype. our results also show that natural as well as laboratory optr isolates have arisen by point mutations that produce different amino acid changes at positions 48, 49 or 50 of the atpase c subunit. the nucleotide sequence of the f0 complex of the streptococcus oralis  atpase has also been determined. in addition, comparison of the sequence of the atpcab genes of s. pneumoniae r6 (opts) and m222 (an optr strain produced by interspecies recombination between pneumococcus and s. oralis), and s. oralis revealed that, in m222, an interchange of atpc and atpa had occurred. we also demonstrate that optochin specifically inhibited the membrane-bound atpase activity of the s. pneumoniae wild-type (opts) strains, and found a 100-fold difference between opts and optr strains, both in growth inhibition and in membrane atpase resistance.

TI  == the cell wall polysaccharide of streptococcus gordonii 38: structure and immunochemical comparison with the receptor polysaccharides of streptococcus oralis 34 and streptococcus mitis j22.
AB  == as part of our ongoing investigations involving lectin-mediated adhesion among oral bacteria, the receptor polysaccharide from streptococcus gordonii 38 was isolated and characterized. carbohydrate analysis of the hydrolysed s. gordonii 38 polysaccharide by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (hpaec-pad) showed galactose (gal) (2 mol), n-acetylgalactosamine (galnac) (1 mol), rhamnose (rha) (2 mol), glucose (glc) (1  mol) and galactosamine-6-phosphate (1 mol). mild acid hydrolysis of the polysaccharide yielded a heptasaccharide repeating unit. the structure of the heptasaccharide repeating unit was determined by high-resolution nmr spectroscopy which includes various homonuclear (dqf-cosy, tqf-cosy, noesy and hohaha) and heteronuclear experiments (hmqc), including linkage assignments by 1h-13c long-range correlation (hmbc). complete 1h and 13c nmr assignments for the intact polysaccharide yielded the covalent structure of a heptasaccharide repeating unit: [formula: see text] the structure of the strain 38 polysaccharide is closely related to those of streptococcus mitis j22 and streptococcus oralis 34.  thus, the difference between the strain 38 and j22 heptasaccharides was at their  reducing ends, with galnac beta-(1-->3)-gal in the former and gal beta-(1-->3)-galnac in the latter, while the difference between the 38 heptasaccharide and 34 hexasaccharide was at the non-reducing ends, where a rhamnose branch occurred in the former but not the latter structure. when compared by their quantitative precipitin curves with rabbit antibodies against each streptococcal strain, the strain 38 polysaccharide reacted more like the polysaccharide of strain j22 than that of strain 34. in contrast, each strain was recognized by the gal- and galnac-reactive lectins of actinomyces spp., but only  strains 38 and 34 were recognized by galnac-sensitive lectins of other streptococci. these findings strongly support the hypothesis that the immunogenic features of these polysaccharides are distinct from those detected by lectin binding.

AB  == this study evaluated restriction fragment length polymorphisms of rrna genes (ribotyping) for genotypic identification of 53 oral isolates classified as "streptococcus sanguis" by colony morphology. isolates were from 8-h buccal plaque on lower first permanent molars of 20 subjects. dna was digested with aatii and hybridized with digoxygenin-labeled cdna of escherichia coli 16s and 23s rrna. strains were ribotyped again with alwni or pvuii on the basis of the presence or absence of a 2,290-bp aatii band. band patterns were compared with reference ribotypes for streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus parasanguis strains. forty-eight isolates could be assigned to a species (22 s. sanguis, 14 s. oralis, 12 s. gordonii). multiple species were seen in 14 subjects; multiple strains of the same species occurred in 11 subjects. our findings suggest that ribotyping can be used for genotypic identification of s. sanguis, s. oralis, and s. gordonii isolates.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine varnish on streptococci in dental plaque from occlusal fissures.
AB  == the treatment of tooth surfaces with chlorhexidine varnish may lead to long-lasting suppression of mutants streptococci in dental plaque. microbiological observations following varnish treatment suggest that this prolonged suppression might be caused by bacterial interference. to investigate whether physiologically related organisms, such as other streptococcus species, compete with mutans streptococci in the ecosystem, we have analyzed streptococcal populations on the tooth surface before and after chlorhexidine varnish treatment. occlusal surfaces with high numbers of mutans streptococci were selected in human volunteers and treated with chlorhexidine varnish. analyses of  sequentially collected plaque samples confirmed that s. oralis-group streptococci returned to baseline levels shortly after the chlorhexidine application, while actinomyces naeslundii populations reached prestudy or even higher levels only several days after treatment. mutans streptococci, however, were below the detection level in the 14-day samples, except in 1 individual. the pattern of recolonization by individual streptococcus species after chlorhexidine application closely resembled that of cleaned enamel surfaces: s. oralis and s. sanguis were primary colonizers while s. gordonii became dominant at a later stage. it is concluded that after intensive chlorhexidine treatment, a normal oral microflora reestablished, characterized by low proportions of mutans streptococci.

TI  == the use of lectins in monitoring degradation of oligosaccharide chains in mucin by oral streptococci.
AB  == the ability of utilize mucin oligosaccharides as sources of carbohydrate and energy is believed to be an important mechanism in the ecology of oral streptococci. in this study we have used digoxigenin-labelled lectins of various  specificities to monitor changes in the nonreducing end groups of oligosaccharide chains following their degradation by streptococcus oralis ny 586 and streptococcus sanguis ny 584. the reaction of degraded mucin with peanut lectin,  that recognizes the core disaccharide gal (1,3)galnac in o-glycans, revealed a more extensive degradation of oligosaccharide by s. oralis than by s. sanguis. this corresponds to better growth of s. oralis on the mucin. analyses with datura stramonium lectin showed that terminal gal (1,4)glcnac, or glcnac (1,4)glcnac moieties, in the oligosaccharides are attacked by both strains. reaction patterns with alpha-l-fucose-specific lectins indicated that terminal fucose was released  by s. oralis but not by s. sanguis. this was in accordance with sugar analyses which showed that approximately 40% of the fucose units were released. the results extend previously observed losses of sugars from oligosaccharide chains during growth of these organisms on mucin.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

AB  == the localization of regions of fibrinogen that inhibit coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus oralis was investigated. the coaggregation was inhibited by a alpha and gamma chains, but not by b beta chain. the inhibitory activity of fragment d was more potent than that of fragment e. some cyanogen bromide-treated fragments isolated from a alpha and gamma chains including the nh2-terminal 148-207 amino acid residues of a alpha chain (a alpha  148-207) and gamma 1-78 showed inhibitory activities. a alpha 148-207 was further digested with lysyl endopeptidase. a alpha 158-176 and a alpha 192-206 which contained four and two arginine residues, respectively, retained the inhibitory activities. when the arginine residues of these two peptides were modified by phenylglyoxal, the inhibitory activities were much reduced. these findings suggest that the arginine residues of some specific regions of fibrinogen may play an important role in the inhibition of the coaggregation.

TI  == purification and characterization of chimeric human iga1 and iga2 expressed in cos and chinese hamster ovary cells.
AB  == ag-specific chimeric human iga molecules, of the two human subclasses, iga1 and iga2, have been expressed in two mammalian cell systems. analysis of the secreted iga molecules, purified in milligram quantities from stable chinese hamster ovary transfectants by ag affinity chromatography, has allowed a direct comparison of the biologic properties of the two subclasses. hplc gel filtration analysis revealed that in both subclasses, the iga molecules associate predominantly into  dimers. the monomer units are presumed to interact noncovalently, inasmuch as no  dimers are evident when the antibodies are subjected to sds-page. the recombinant antibodies are glycosylated, inasmuch as a lectin blotting procedure revealed that the h chains of both subclasses are recognized by con a. when subjected to digestion by preparations of iga1-specific proteases secreted by two pathogenic streptococcal strains, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis, the recombinant iga molecules behave just as their natural equivalents. thus, only the chimeric iga1 molecule is cleaved, with the iga2 remaining intact. in terms of interaction with natural effector molecules, both recombinant iga isotypes were shown to interact with fc alpha receptors on calcitriol-stimulated hl-60 cells with similar affinity, but neither antibody was found to interact with human c1q. the expression system described readily permits manipulation of the human iga genes, which should lead to a fuller molecular understanding of how this important antibody mediates its function.

AB  == the predominant microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis was investigated in 21 patients aged 20-40 years. microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque were cultured on selective and non-selective media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. ten species or groups out of a total of 31 were found to comprise the predominant cultivable flora: diphtheroids, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 'streptococcus milleri'-group, bacteroides ureolyticus, capnocytophaga ochracea, the prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex, p. intermedia, p. oralis and unidentified prevotella  spp. two species previously reported at periodontitis sites, namely p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, were not isolated, whereas prevotella species accounted for the majority of isolates in this investigation. the large proportion of non-pigmented prevotella species, p. asaccharolytica and b. ureolyticus that were found have not generally been reported previously. the role of these microorganisms and also coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids and the 'streptococcus milleri'-group requires further investigation in adult periodontitis.

TI  == [clinical efficacy of cefmetazole in intraabdominal infection].
AB  == a number of different organisms can be isolated from intraabdominal infection. the most common are aerobic gram-negative bacilli. anaerobes are not unusual. from june 1989 to january 1990, cefmetazole was administered to 23 patients with  intraabdominal infection at veterans general hospital-taipei. there were six patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, five biliary tract infection, five liver abscesses, five with pelvic inflammatory disease, one acute ruptured appendicitis and another intraabdominal abscess. in addition, ten patients had sepsis. clinical response was satisfactory in 21 (91.3%) of 23 patients, and the  microbiological eradication rate was 90% (36/40). one patient with streptococcus  and bacteroides oralis liver abscess relapsed after organism eradication. therapy failed in a case with pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis infection.  this study showed cefmetazole to be an effective and safe antibiotic for treatment of intraabdominal infection.

TI  == possible role of a choline-containing teichoic acid in the maintenance of normal  cell shape and physiology in streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis atcc 35037 took up radioactively labeled choline from growth medium. most of the choline (80 to 90%) was incorporated into the cell wall teichoic acid, and about 10% was localized in the plasma membrane. while cells grew in choline-free medium, they did so at slow rates and produced cell walls with greatly reduced amounts of phosphate and no detectable choline. cells grown  in choline-free medium had grossly abnormal shape and size. both biochemical and  morphological abnormalities were reversible by addition of choline to the medium.

TI  == dental plaque development on defined streptococcal surfaces.
AB  == coaggregations between bacterial species have been widely studied in vitro but not in the mouth. a new in vivo assay was used to measure the rate and composition of indigenous plaque formation onto bovine enamel chips covered with  a continuous layer of bacteria. chips were covered with streptococcus oralis atcc 10557, which coaggregated with many oral species, or streptococcus gordonii s7, which did not coaggregate with these oral species, and placed in the mouth for 4  and 24 h. there were no differences in the number of most indigenous bacterial species isolated from the two streptococcal surfaces. however, the number of actinomyces viscosus as a proportion of total actinomyces spp. was significantly  different on the two surfaces at 24 h. with the exception of actinomyces naeslundii and a. viscosus removed from the s7 surface, all indigenous species increased significantly in number from 4 to 24 h, irrespective of the streptococcal surface. this study demonstrated that interbacterial coaggregation  had only a limited effect on in vivo plaque development. thus suggesting that environmental factors, growth or other adherence phenomena are dominant in in vivo plaque formation.

AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and proportions of different streptococcal species among the streptococcal flora during infancy. a total of 60 oral samples were collected by oral swabbing of the buccal mucosa and alveolar ridges of 18 infants before tooth eruption and from buccal and lingual surfaces of teeth after tooth eruption. a total of 549 isolates on mitis salivarius agar were speciated, principally by recently revised biochemical criteria of kilian et al. streptococcus mitis biovar 1 predominated, both in prevalence (89%) and proportion of oral streptococci recovered in each sample (median = 87% of streptococcal flora). streptococcus salivarius was also prevalent (94%) but generally represented a small percentage of the total streptococcal flora (median = 3%). streptococcus oralis and streptococcus anginosus strains were detected in approximately one third of predentate and dentate infants in the first year of life. streptococcus sanguis strains were not detected before tooth eruption, but could be detected in 7/14 of the infants with teeth. thus, s. mitis constitutes the major component of the initially colonizing streptococcal microbiota of the young infant.

AB  == in 15 caries-active patients, with a total of 770 exposed root surfaces, the effect of fluoride therapy and professional tooth cleaning was studied during a 1-year period. dental plaque from 92 of the root surfaces and whole saliva samples were analysed at baseline and after 12 months for the presence of specific bacteria. the results showed that the number of active carious lesions had decreased from 99 to 46, while the inactive lesions had increased from 69 to  124. of the active lesions which had been converted into inactive lesions, most were on the buccal and fewest were located on the distal surfaces. lower plaque scores were found on sound and inactive root surfaces compared to active surfaces. the salivary concentrations of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli remained constant during the 12-month observation period. there was a tendency for higher levels of streptococcus mutans in plaque from active lesions compared  with sound root surfaces, whereas an inverse relationship was noted for the streptococcus oralis group. no significant differences in the actinomyces naeslundii counts were detected. in conclusion, the 12-month prophylactic programme had an effect on the clinical surface characteristics of root caries, but the components of the oral microflora selected for study seemed to be relatively unaffected during the observation period.

TI  == mixed continuous cultures of streptococcus mutans with streptococcus sanguis or with streptococcus oralis as a model to study the ecological effects of the lactoperoxidase system.
AB  == mixed continuous cultures of streptococcus species were obtained, using complex carbohydrate (mucin) as a source of nutrients, to study the ecological effects of oxygen and the lactoperoxidase system. s. mutans nctc 10449 was unable to grow as a pure culture on mucin, but attained a significant population size in the presence of s. oralis and s. sanguis strains. the cell densities of the anaerobic mixed cultures decreased when oxygen was supplied, and s. mutans was more suppressed by oxygen than were s. sanguis and s. oralis. however, the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (30 mumol/l in the mixed culture of s. mutans with s. sanguis and 640 mumol/l in the culture with s. oralis) indicated a certain resistance of the organisms to hydrogen peroxide. addition of lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate to the oxygen-supplied cultures had a differential effect on the streptococcal populations. while s. mutans was inhibited, and even disappeared in the culture with s. oralis, the growth of s. sanguis and s. oralis was unaffected. this latter observation was in accordance with the oscn- reductase activities of these organisms. when hydrogen peroxide was also added together with lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate, a further inhibition of s. mutans in the culture with s. sanguis was observed. under these  conditions, s. oralis was also inhibited, perhaps by the strong accumulation of oscn-, exceeding the capacity of the oscn- reductase. the effects of lactoperoxidase on mixed cultures may reflect the situation in the mouth.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == distribution and isolation frequency of eight streptococcal species in saliva from predentate and dentate children and adults.
AB  == the isolation frequency and distribution of eight recently defined streptococcal  species have been investigated in the saliva of adults and that of both predentate and dentate children. the effects of frequency of sugar intake and tooth presence on the distribution of streptococcal species were also analyzed. saliva samples were collected from 121 subjects divided into three study groups:  (a) 56 predentate children (predentate group), (b) 37 dentate children (dentate group), and (c) 28 adults (adult group). up to 17 biochemical and enzymatic tests were used to categorize streptococcal isolates into s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. mutans, and s. gordonii. the mean total and streptococcal salivary colony-forming units (cfu) were lowest in the predentate group and highest in the adult group. streptococci  were found in all the study subjects, and there was no obvious relationship between the total or streptococcal cfu and the number of teeth or the frequency of sugar intake. there was a wide variation in the isolation frequency of streptococcal species in the three study groups. s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. salivarius were the most frequent species isolated, and together they comprised 83% of the total streptococcal isolates. in contrast to studies using older classifications, s. sanguis was a minor species in the saliva though found more often in adults than in children (p < 0.04). s. anginosus was a minor species found in about 10% of adults and children. s. gordonii was detected rarely and only in dentate subjects. s. mutans was detected only in dentate subjects, significantly greater in adults (57.1%) than in children (5.4%, p < 0.001).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the bacillus subtilis hemehy gene cluster, which  encodes protoheme ix biosynthetic enzymes.
AB  == mutations that cause a block in a late step of the protoheme ix biosynthetic pathway, i.e., in a step after uroporphyrinogen iii, map at 94 degrees on the bacillus subtilis chromosomal genetic map. we have cloned and sequenced the hem genes at this location. the sequenced region contains six open reading frames: pona, heme, hemh, hemy, orfa, and orfb. the pona gene product shows over 30% sequence identity to penicillin-binding proteins 1a of escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus oralis and probably has a role in cell wall metabolism. the heme gene was identified from amino acid sequence comparisons as encoding uroporphyrinogen iii decarboxylase. the hemh gene was identified by enzyme activity analysis of the hemh protein expressed in e. coli.  it encodes a water-soluble ferrochelatase which catalyzes the final step in protoheme ix synthesis, the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin ix. the function of the hemy gene product was not elucidated, but mutation analysis shows that it is required for a late step in protoheme ix synthesis. the hemy gene probably encodes an enzyme with coproporphyrinogen iii oxidase or protoporphyrinogen ix oxidase activity or both of these activities. inactivation  of the orfa and orfb genes did not block protoheme ix synthesis. preliminary evidence for a hemehy mrna was obtained, and a promoter region located in front of heme was identified. from these combined results we conclude that the hemehy gene cluster encodes enzymes for the synthesis of protoheme ix from uroporphyrinogen iii and probably constitutes an operon.

TI  == the gene encoding a prevotella loescheii lectin-like adhesin contains an interrupted sequence which causes a frameshift.
AB  == we cloned and sequenced the prevotella loescheii gene plaa, which encodes a lectin-like adhesin that mediates the coaggregation of p. loescheii 1295 with streptococcus oralis 34. a probe derived from the n-terminal amino acid sequence  of the purified adhesin was used to identify the plaa gene from a p. loescheii genomic library constructed in lambda gem-11. sequence analysis of plaa indicates that the initial translation product contains a 22-amino-acid leader. the reading frame of the plaa gene is interrupted after amino acid 28 of the mature protein by a taa termination codon. amplification of the p. loescheii genomic dna in the  region surrounding this codon by the polymerase chain reaction followed by dna sequencing of the cloned dna fragment established that this stop codon was not an experimental artifact. a frameshift beginning 29 bp downstream of the ochre terminator was required to access the only large open reading frame in the gene.  amino acid sequences of six purified peptides derived by limited proteolysis of adhesin with endoproteinase lys-c matched the downstream amino acid sequence derived by translation of the large open reading frame. the gene coding sequence  of 2.4 kb contains sufficient information for the synthesis of an 89-kda protein. a putative rho-independent terminator (delta g = -25.5 kcal/mol [ca. -107 kj/mol]) was detected 38 bp downstream from the plaa stop codon.

TI  == complete structure of the adhesin receptor polysaccharide of streptococcus oralis atcc 55229 (streptococcus sanguis h1).
AB  == this report describes the determination of the complete primary structure of the  adhesin receptor polysaccharide of streptococcus oralis atcc 55229 (previously characterized as streptococcus sanguis h1), a gram-positive bacteria implicated in dental plaque formation. the polysaccharide was isolated from s. oralis atcc 55229 cells after deproteination, enzymatic hydrolysis, and ion exchange chromatography. it was shown to consist of rhamnose, galactose, glucose, glycerol, and phosphate, in molar ratios of 2:3:1:1:1. sequence and linkage assignments of the glycosyl residues were obtained by methylation analysis followed by gas-liquid chromatography and electron-impact mass spectrometry. 31p  nmr spectroscopy revealed that phosphate was present in a diester, connecting glycerol to one of the galactosyl residues. high-performance liquid chromatography of a partial acid hydrolysate of the polysaccharide confirmed this finding by showing galactose 6-phosphate and glycerol 1-phosphate. the structural determination was completed by the combination of two-dimensional homonuclear hartmann-hahn and noe experiments and heteronuclear [1h,13c] and [1h,31p] multiple-quantum coherence experiments. thus, the adhesin receptor polysaccharide of s. oralis atcc 55229 was found to be a polymer composed of hexasaccharide repeating units that contain glycerol linked through a phosphodiester to c6 of the alpha-galactopyranosyl residue and are joined end-to-end through galactofuranosyl-beta(1-->3)-rhamnopyranosyl linkages: [formula: see text] this structure is novel among bacterial cell surface polysaccharides in general and specifically among those implicated in dental plaque formation.

TI  == actinomyces tissue specificity may depend on differences in receptor specificity  for galnac beta-containing glycoconjugates.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii 12104 and a. viscosus ly7 were compared for receptor specificities and adherence properties because these relate to their oral colonization sites. both strains bind galnac beta-containing glycosphingolipids (gsls) in a galnac beta 1-3gal alpha oethyl-sensitive fashion but differ with respect to the number of cells bound to gsls and the effect of neighboring sugar  groups on the binding. their hemagglutination and saccharide inhibition profiles  confirms the existence of two receptor specificities (for example, when galnac beta 1-3gal alpha oethyl is multivalently conjugated to albumin, its inhibitory activity increases fourfold toward strain 12104 but decreases fourfold toward strain ly7). trypsin or chymotrypsin treatment of human erythrocytes, which possess receptor gsls, improves their hemagglutination with strain 12104. in contrast, the same treatment of chicken erythrocytes, which lack receptor gsls, abolishes their hemagglutination. these findings suggest that both gsls and glycoproteins act as functional receptors on eukaryotic cells. the strains also differ with respect to the following galnac beta 1-3gal alpha oethyl-sensitive adherence properties: (i) strain ly7 adheres somewhat better than does strain 12104 to buccal epithelial cells; (ii) in spite of their similar overall coaggregation patterns with streptococci, strain 12104 coaggregates with streptococcus oralis mpb1 but strain ly7 does not; (iii) strain 12104 alone shows galnac beta-sensitive saliva aggregation and adherence to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. the gsl binding patterns of fresh actinomyces isolates reveal a high prevalence of ly7-like specificities among buccal isolates, whereas 12104-like specificities are most prevalent among plaque isolates. these findings strongly suggest that fresh actinomyces isolates use fine specificity for galnac  beta-containing glycoconjugates in recognition and subsequent colonization of specific oral surfaces.

TI  == restriction endonuclease-fragment polymorphisms of oral viridans streptococci, compared by conventional and field-inversion gel electrophoresis.
AB  == oral streptococci formerly classified as streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus mitis have recently been divided into four species. two additional species have also been proposed for this group. each species is genetically distinct, but they have many traits in common, which makes it difficult for clinical isolates to be  identified by phenotypic tests. genotypic comparison may provide an alternative approach. this study used dna fingerprint analysis for comparison of genotypes of 21 reference strains--classified as streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, "streptococcus parasanguis", or "streptococcus crista" in previous dna hybridization studies--and 17 clinical and laboratory strains placed in those groups on the basis of phenotypic tests. hindiii and pvuii digests were run in conventional horizontal agarose gels. sfii digests of reference strains and two laboratory strains were run in field-inversion gels. fingerprint patterns were compared by visual examination, cluster analysis of densitometric traces, and lane-matching software. only two "s. crista" strains and two parent mutant lineages showed fingerprint patterns that were identical by visual examination. fingerprint patterns of all other strains were unique. cluster analysis results could not be considered valid, since replicate lanes in  different gels were not grouped together. hindiii and pvuii digests contained too many bands for correct matching by lane-matching software. sfii digests were correctly matched by computer, with the same results as visual examination. results indicate that the diversity of strains within these streptococcal species was too great to permit species identification by dna fingerprint patterns. this  genotypic diversity suggests that isolates from unrelated hosts may have been separate for long periods of time.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == immunobiological activities of bacteria isolated from the root canals of postendodontic teeth with persistent periapical lesions.
AB  == although intraradicular bacteria are widely considered to be the primary etiological agents of periapical lesions, the immunobiological properties of the  species in question are not adequately known. the aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the pathobiological properties of the 10 most frequently isolated endodontopathic bacterial species. using cellular components of the pathogens obtained by sonic extraction, we have investigated their ability to induce monocyte migration, interleukin 1 production, mitogenic responses of lymphocytes, and the polyclonal activation of b lymphocytes. it was found that all of the tested species enhanced the migration of monocytes and induced mitogenesis in b lymphocytes. the polyclonal activation of b cells and the induction of interleukin 1 by monocytes were found to be stronger in gram-negative anaerobes. furthermore, all of the tested species excluding bacteroides oralis were poor t cell mitogens. these findings show that a wide range of pathobiological properties are attributable to the most frequently isolated endodontic pathogens. it thus seems plausible that a battery of complex  immunological responses induced by such microbes lead to the formation of persistent periapical lesions.

TI  == adherence of oral streptococci to salivary glycoproteins.
AB  == we used an overlay method to study the ability of human salivary glycoproteins to serve as receptors for several strains of streptococci that colonize the oral cavity. parotid and submandibular-sublingual salivas were collected as ductal secretions, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. the resulting blots were overlaid with [35s]methionine-labeled bacteria, and salivary components to which the bacteria bound were detected by autoradiography. potential glycoprotein receptors were identified for 8 of the 16 strains tested. in three cases (streptococcus sanguis 72-40 and 804 and streptococcus sobrinus omz176), highly specific interactions with a single salivary component were detected. removal of  sialic acid residues from the low-molecular-weight salivary mucin prevented adherence of one of these strains (s. sanguis 72-40), suggesting that this saccharide either mediates binding or is a critical component of the receptor site. in the remaining five strains (streptococcus gordonii g9b and 10558, s. sanguis 10556, and streptococcus oralis 10557 and 72-41), interactions with multiple salivary components, including the low-molecular-weight salivary mucin,  highly glycosylated proline-rich glycoproteins, and alpha-amylase, were detected. these results suggest that some oral streptococci can bind specifically to certain of the salivary glycoproteins. the interactions identified may play an important role in governing bacterial adherence and clearance within the oral cavity.

TI  == subclass distribution of salivary secretory immunoglobulin a antibodies to oral streptococci.
AB  == the ability of specific secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) antibodies to inhibit  bacterial colonization of mucosal surfaces may be neutralized by the activity of  bacterial iga1 proteases. because of the resistance of the iga2 subclass to these enzymes, the biological effect of iga1 proteases in vivo may depend on the subclass distribution of the bacterium-specific antibodies. we have estimated the subclass distribution of s-iga antibodies in saliva samples from 13 individuals against iga1 protease-producing (streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis)  and nonproducing (streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis bv. 2) oral streptococci. iga1 was found to be the predominant subclass of antibodies against these four bacteria in most of the saliva samples, corroborating previous data suggesting a role of iga1 proteases in plaque formation. however, variation in the subclass distribution of s-iga antibodies against the same strain was observed. in one individual, iga2 was the predominant subclass of antibodies against all four streptococci and of total salivary s-iga, pointing to the possible significance of genetic variations. the study also addresses methodological problems related to the quantitation of salivary antibodies by solid-phase immunoassays.

AB  == etiology of bacterial infections in the field of oral surgery was studied. a total of 270 samples collected from patients with encapsulated abscess in their oral cavities was examined and bacteria were isolated from the 244 samples (90.4%). the following results were found; 1) organisms more than one from one sample were frequently isolated from cases with parodontitis, pericoronitis and gnathitis. isolation of anaerobic bacteria was common (54.2%). 2) streptococcus milleri and streptococcus sanguis and capnocytophaga species were the most common isolates among aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. 3) peptostreptococcus micros and eubacterium lentum were most frequent isolates among gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. among gram-negative bacteria, oral group  bacteroides, especially bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides buccae and bacteroides oralis were most prominent. 4) isolation frequency of bacteria (both species and strains) was high from samples obtained from patients before antibiotic chemotherapy. 5) most strains were sensitive to midecamycin acetate and josamycin. minimum inhibitory concentration of 80% isolates (mic80) against these antibiotics was 0.39 microgram/ml.

TI  == intrageneric structure of streptococcus based on comparative analysis of small-subunit rrna sequences.
AB  == the partial 16s rrna sequences of 24 streptococcus species were determined by reverse transcription. a comparative analysis of these sequences and the sequences of seven previously studied streptococcal species revealed the presence of several clusters within the genus. the clusters obtained from the sequence analysis agreed in general with the groups outlined on the basis of the results of nucleic acid hybridization studies, but there were some exceptions. the pyogenic group was extended to include streptococcus agalactiae, s. parauberis, s. porcinus, and s. uberis. four oral groups were discerned; these four groups centered on s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, and s. oralis. some species (e.g., s. suis and s. acidominimus) did not cluster with any particular group. our findings are discussed in the context of data from other genetic and chemotaxonomic studies.

TI  == complete structure of the cell surface polysaccharide of streptococcus oralis c104: a 600-mhz nmr study.
AB  == specific lectin-carbohydrate interactions between certain oral streptococci and actinomyces contribute to the microbial colonization of teeth. the receptor molecules of streptococcus oralis, 34, atcc 10557, and streptococcus mitis j22 for the galactose and n-acetylgalactosamine reactive fimbrial lectins of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii are antigenically distinct polysaccharides, each formed by a different phosphodiester-linked oligosaccharide repeating unit. these streptococci all coaggregated strongly with both a. viscosus and a. naesludii strains, whereas s. oralis c104 interacted preferentially with certain strains of the latter species. receptor polysaccharide was isolated from s. oralis c104 cells and was shown to contain galactose, n-acetylgalactosamine, ribitol, and phosphate with molar ratios of 4:1:1:1. the 1h nmr spectrum of the polysaccharide shows that it contains a repeating structure. the individual sugars in the repeating unit were identified  by 1h coupling constants observed in e-cosy and dqf-cosy spectra. nmr methods included complete resonance assignments (1h and 13c) by various homonuclear and heteronuclear correlation experiments that utilize scalar couplings. sequence and linkage assignments were obtained from the heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (hmbc) spectrum. this analysis shows that the receptor polysaccharide of s. oralis c104 is a ribitol teichoic acid polymer composed of a linear hexasaccharide repeating unit containing two residues each of galactopyranose and galactofuranose and a residue each of galnac and ribitol joined end to end by phosphodiester linkages with the following structure.

TI  == effects of salivary bicarbonate content and film velocity on ph changes in an artificial plaque containing streptococcus oralis, after exposure to sucrose.
AB  == chewing-gum stimulation of salivary flow (at the time of the ph minimum following exposure of plaque to carbohydrate) has been shown to cause a rapid increase in plaque ph. the objective of this study was to determine whether the rise in plaque ph is primarily due to the increased buffering capacity of stimulated saliva, or to the fact that an increased flow rate increases the concentration gradient for acid to diffuse from the plaque into the overlying salivary film, which will be moving at a higher velocity. this was investigated with an in vitro technique in which artificial plaque (0.5 or 1.5 mm deep) containing s. oralis cells was exposed to 10% sucrose for one min. the ph values at the proximal and distal undersurfaces of the plaque were then monitored during the passage of a 0.1-mm-thick film of a sucrose-free artificial saliva over the surface, at a range of film velocities (0.8-8 mm/min) that have been estimated to occur in vivo. when a minimum plaque ph had been achieved, the salivary film velocity was  either (a) kept the same, with or without 15 mmol/l hco3 (the concentration measured in chewing-gum-stimulated saliva), (b) increased to 86.2 mm/min, or (c)  increased to 86.2 mm/min with 15 mmol/l hco3 added to the artificial saliva. the  findings suggest that after sucrose ingestion, the rapid rise from minimum plaque ph values, which can occur with gum-chewing stimulation of salivary flow, is due  to the combined effects of the increase in salivary film velocity, and of a greater availability of bicarbonate.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effects of salivary film velocity on ph changes in an artificial plaque containing streptococcus oralis, after exposure to sucrose.
AB  == results from a computer model suggest that following exposure of dental plaque to sucrose, the rate of clearance of acids from plaque into the overlying salivary film will be greatly retarded at low film velocities. this was investigated with  an in vitro technique in which artificial plaque containing s. oralis cells was exposed to 10% sucrose for one min. the ph at the proximal (p) and distal (d) undersurfaces of the plaque (0.5 or 1.5 mm thick) was then monitored during the passage of a 0.1-mm-thick film of a sucrose-free solution over the surface. over  the range of salivary film velocities that have been estimated to occur in vivo (0.8-8 mm/min), lower minimum ph values and increased times for the ph to recover toward neutrality occurred at the lower salivary film velocity. lower ph values were also reached with the 0.5- than with the 1.5-mm-thick plaque. p/d ph gradients, with a lower ph distally, developed at film velocities of 0.8 and 8 mm/min, and the gradients were much more pronounced at the lower velocity. no p/d ph gradients developed when the film velocity was 86.2 mm/min. incorporation of dead s. oralis cells into the plaque at percentages up to 57% reduced the extent  of the ph fall and prolonged the recovery of the ph toward neutrality. the results support the prediction that, other factors being equal, plaque located in regions of the mouth with low salivary film velocity will achieve ph values lower than those of plaque of identical dimensions and microbial composition located in areas where salivary film velocity is high.

TI  == delineation of a segment of adsorbed salivary acidic proline-rich proteins which  promotes adhesion of streptococcus gordonii to apatitic surfaces.
AB  == cells of several strains of streptococcus gordonii attached in much higher numbers to experimental pellicles formed from samples of submandibular or parotid saliva on hydroxyapatite (ha) beads than to buffer controls. the nature of the salivary components responsible were investigated by preparing experimental pellicles from chromatographic fractions of submandibular saliva obtained from trisacryl gf 2000m columns. adhesion of s. gordonii blackburn was promoted by two groups of fractions. the adhesion-promoting activity in the first group of fractions was associated with the family of acidic proline-rich proteins (prps),  while that of the second group is as yet unidentified. experimental pellicles prepared by treating ha with 2 micrograms of pure 150-amino-acid-residue prps (prp-1, prp-2, and pif-s) promoted adhesion of s. gordonii blackburn cells to an  extent comparable to that obtained with unfractionated saliva. however, pellicles prepared from a 106-residue prp (prp-3) were significantly less effective, and those prepared from the amino-terminal tryptic peptide (residues 1 to 30) of the  prp and the salivary phosphoprotein statherin were completely ineffective in promoting adhesion. although adhesion of several strains of s. gordonii was promoted by adsorbed prp-1, the adhesion of several strains of streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus oralis was either not affected or only weakly enhanced by this protein. s. gordonii cells bound avidly to prps adsorbed onto ha beads, but the streptococci did not appear to bind prps in solution, since concentrations of prp as high as 200 micrograms/ml did not inhibit binding of bacterial cells to pellicles prepared from pure prp. s. gordonii cells also attached well to prp or a synthetic decapeptide representing residues 142 to 150  of the prp when the peptide was linked to agarose beads. studies with a series of synthetic decapeptides indicated that the minimal segment of prp which promoted high levels of s. gordonii adhesion was the carboxy-terminal dipeptide pro-gln (residues 149 and 150).

TI  == conservation of the gene encoding streptococcal antigen i/ii in oral streptococci.
AB  == the spap gene of streptococcus mutans serotype c encodes a major cell surface protein, streptococcal antigen (sa) i/ii, with an mr of 185,000, that is thought  to be involved in bacterial adhesion to teeth. proteins with significant amino acid sequence homology to sa i/ii have also been found in s. sobrinus and s. sanguis. the objectives of this study were to investigate the conservation of the spap gene in the mutans groups of streptococci and to determine whether homologous genes were present in other species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci. dna extracted from representative strains of 19 streptococcal species was examined by southern hybridization and partial dna sequence analysis. a series of five overlapping dna probes from the spap gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and used in the southern hybridizations. the entire gene was found to be well conserved in all strains of s. mutans serotypes c, e, and f investigated. a probe from the 3' region of the gene, which encodes residues 857  to 1207 of the sa i/ii protein, hybridized with dna from a number of mutans streptococci, as well as with dna from nonmutans alpha-hemolytic streptococci. conservation within this region was further demonstrated by sequencing gene fragments of two strains of s. intermedius and s. oralis. the results show that some regions of the spap gene are highly conserved not only in the mutans group of streptococci but also in other nonmutans alpha-hemolytic streptococci. this suggests that a family of cell surface proteins which, by analogy with the 185,000-mr sa i/ii of s. mutans, could be involved in bacterial adhesion might exist.

TI  == complete structure of the cell surface polysaccharide of streptococcus oralis atcc 10557: a receptor for lectin-mediated interbacterial adherence.
AB  == lectin-carbohydrate binding is known to play an important role in a number of different cell-cell interactions including those between certain species of oral  streptococci and actinomyces that colonize teeth. the cell wall polysaccharides of streptococcus oralis atcc 10557, s. oralis 34, and streptococcus mitis j22, although not identical antigenically, each function as a receptor molecule for the galactose and n-acetylgalactosamine reactive fimbrial lectins of actinomyces  viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii. carbohydrate analysis of the receptor polysaccharide isolated from s. oralis atcc 10557 shows galactose (3 mol), glucose (1 mol), galnac (1 mol), and rhamnose (1 mol). 1h nmr spectra of the polysaccharide show that is is partially o-acetylated. analysis of the 1h nmr spectrum of the de-o-acetylated polysaccharide shows that it is composed of repeating subunits containing six monosaccharides and that the subunits are joined by a phosphodiester linkage. the 1h and 13c nmr spectra were completely assigned by two-dimensional homonuclear correlation methods and by 1h-detected heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation (1h[13c]hmqc). the linkage of the component monosaccharides in the polymer, deduced from two-dimensional 1h-detected heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation spectra (1h[13c]hmbc), shows  that the repeating unit of the de-o-acetylated polymer is a linear hexasaccharide with no branch points. the complete 1h and 13c assignment of the native polysaccharide was carried out by the same techniques augmented by a 13c-coupled  hybrid hmqc-cosy method, which is shown to be especially useful for carbohydrates in which strong coupling and overlapping peaks in the 1h spectrum pose difficulties. the fully assigned spectra of the native polymer show that each of  two different positions is acetylated in one-third of the repeating subunits and  that the acetylation is randomly distributed along the polymer. the exact positions of acetylation were assigned by a carbonyl-selective hmbc method that unambiguously defines the positions of o-acetylation. the complete structure of the native polysaccharide in s. oralis atcc 10557 is [formula: see text] comparison of this structure with those previously determined for the polysaccharides of strains 34 and j22 suggests that the similar lectin receptor activities of these molecules may depend on internal galactofuranose linked (beta 1----6)- to gal(beta 1----3)galnac(alpha) or galnac(beta 1----3)gal(alpha).

TI  == synergistic degradation of mucin by streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis in mixed chemostat cultures.
AB  == oral streptococci can grow in mucin by utilizing the oligosaccharide chains as a  source of carbohydrate. the degradation of the oligosaccharides by these species  is accomplished by exoglycosidase activities. in this experiment, it was investigated whether strains from different species could cooperate in the release of sugars from the mucin oligosaccharide. to this end, streptococcus sanguis ny 584 and streptococcus oralis strain ny 586 were grown continuously in  a chemically-defined medium, with pig gastric mucin as the growth-limiting source of carbohydrate. in pure cultures, strain ny 586 attained approximately three-fold-higher cell densities than did strain ny 584 in the mucin medium. this was in accordance with the observation that s. oralis ny 586 exhibited fucosidase activity, as indicated by the presence of fucose in the culture fluid. in contrast, strain ny 584 has no fucosidase activity against mucin, and therefore cannot attack fucose-ending oligosaccharide chains. stable mixed cultures of the  strains were obtained. it appeared that s. sanguis ny 584 reached significantly higher cell densities in mixed cultures with s. oralis ny 586 than in pure culture. stimulation of the growth of strain ny 584 was probably due to the generation of non-fucose-ending oligosaccharide chains by fucosidase from strain  ny 586. it is concluded that the synergistic degradation of oligosaccharides in glycoproteins is a potential factor influencing the streptococcal populations in  the mouth.

TI  == ecology of viridans streptococci in the oral cavity and pharynx.
AB  == recently published taxonomic studies of viridans streptococci have resulted in several changes in the nomenclature and definition of oral streptococcal species. with this background, the ecology of streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavities was reinvestigated. the results based on the examination of 1426 streptococcal isolates confirmed and extended earlier findings. apart from mature supragingival plaque, which contained a mixture of all orally encountered streptococci, each site showed a characteristic streptococcal flora. initial dental plaque formation is primarily associated with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1  and streptococcus oralis. our investigation showed that s. sanguis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most prominent streptococci, also on buccal mucosa. in contrast, s. oralis was almost exclusively found in initial dental plaque. streptococcus gordonii, formerly part of s. sanguis, was found in small numbers on the oropharyngeal mucosa and in mature supragingival plaque. the dorsum of the tongue was dominated by s. mitis biovar 2 and streptococcus salivarius, the latter of which was predominant also on the pharyngeal mucosa. streptococcus anginosus was by far the most predominant streptococcus in subgingival plaque. immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease-producing streptococci were primarily isolated  from initial dental plaque and from the buccal mucosa. this lends further support to the concept of iga1 proteases being important for the ability of streptococci  to evade the local immune defence during their initial colonization of certain oral surfaces.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.

TI  == oxygen and the sugar metabolism in oral streptococci.
AB  == streptococci have several ways of adapting themselves to the constantly changing  environment of the human oral cavity. this paper discusses the adaptation of sugar metabolism to variations in oxygen levels. in all streptococci the embden-meyerhof pathway of glycolysis works under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions, but pyruvate is converted into different metabolic end products depending on the oxygen levels. under anaerobic conditions all streptococci form  formate, acetate, and ethanol by a pyruvate formate-lyase pathway. if sugar is in excess, they also form lactate using a lactate dehydrogenase. under aerobic conditions pyruvate formate-lyase is inactivated. this enzyme is then replaced by a pyruvate oxidase in some streptococci and by a pyruvate dehydrogenase in others. the characteristics of these enzymes help streptococci like s. sanguis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, and s. mitis to compete successfully with other bacteria  in those sites of the oral cavity that are freely exposed to saliva, while mutans streptococci have to colonize anaerobic sites such as those in-between the teeth  and in the occlusal fissures of the teeth.

TI  == aggregation of oral bacteria by human salivary mucins in comparison to salivary and gastric mucins of animal origin.

AB  == one proposed mechanism in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis is the direct aggregation of platelets by the bacteria causing the disease. some, but not all, strains of streptococcus sanguis have been reported to aggregate platelets but the taxonomy of this and related taxa has changed recently. the ability to aggregate platelets by 24 genetically grouped laboratory stock strains was studied along with 8 recent isolates from cases of endocarditis. strains belonging to s. sanguis could aggregate platelets, but not s. gordonii, "s. parasanguis", s. mitis, s. oralis or related taxa. also, preliminary data indicate that certain biotypes of s. sanguis lack the ability to aggregate platelets. of the recent clinical isolates, only 4 aggregated platelets and each  of these showed phenotypes typical of s. sanguis. these data suggest that the ability to aggregate platelets is not essential for an organism to be able to cause endocarditis, although it may be a significant virulence factor.

TI  == penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci have obtained altered penicillin-binding protein genes from penicillin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == penicillin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae possess altered forms of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) with decreased affinity for penicillin. the pbp2b genes of these strains have a mosaic structure, consisting of regions that  are very similar to those in penicillin-sensitive strains, alternating with regions that are highly diverged. penicillin-resistant strains of viridans groups streptococci (e.g., s. sanguis and s. oralis) that produce altered pbps have also been reported. the pbp2b genes of two penicillin-resistant clinical isolates of s. sanguis were identical in sequence to the mosaic class b pbp2b genes found in  penicillin-resistant serotype 23 strains of s. pneumoniae. emergence of penicillin resistance appears to have occurred by the horizontal transfer of an altered pbp2b gene from penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae into s. sanguis. the pbp2b genes of three penicillin-resistant s. oralis strains were similar to the mosaic class b pbp2b gene of penicillin-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae but possessed an additional block of diverged sequence. penicillin resistance in s. oralis has also probably arisen by horizontal transfer of this variant form of the class b mosaic pbp2b gene from a penicillin-resistant strain of s. pneumoniae.

AB  == viridans group streptococci were examined for the production of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid in a simple and rapid (15-min) assay. sialidase was produced by all strains of streptococcus oralis and s. intermedius and by a majority of s. mitis strains. s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s.  gordonii, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, "s. parasanguis," and the "tufted fibril group" were uniformly negative. sialidase production may be a useful characteristic to assist in the identification of viridans group streptococci.

TI  == in vitro adherence of microorganisms to denture base resin with different surface texture.
AB  == we examined the effects of various denture base resin surface textures on the adherence of microorganisms. s. sanguis and b. gingivalis adhered in greater amounts to the denture base resin than the other microorganisms tested. as to bacterial adherence according to polishing state, s. oralis, b. gingivalis c-101, and b. intermedius c-001 more adhered to the no. 400 paper-polished surface than  to the buff-polished and smoothening-treated surfaces. s. sanguis less adhered to the smoothening-treated surface. s. mitis and c. albicans, on the other hand, more adhered to the smoothening-treated surface. for the other microorganisms tested, no relationship was observed between surface texture and bacterial adherence. the fall-off test revealed no remarkable differences in the fall-off of s. sanguis and b. gingivalis c-101 by the types of surface treatment. however, the fall-off of c. albicans was poorest from the no. 400 paper-polished surface.  these results indicate that smoothening the denture base surface is important for denture plaque control.

TI  == involvement of human mucous saliva and salivary mucins in the aggregation of the  oral bacteria streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus rattus.
AB  == the contribution of human parotid (par) and submandibular/sublingual (sm/sl) saliva and of the human whole salivary mucin fraction (hwsm) to saliva-induced bacterial aggregation was studied for s. sanguis c476, s. oralis i581, and s. rattus hg 59. the mucous sm/sl saliva showed a much higher aggregation potency towards the s. sanguis and s. oralis strain than did the serous par saliva. the sm/sl saliva-induced aggregation was observed after 30 min, at 60 min followed by the par saliva-induced aggregation, and showed a 4-fold higher aggregation titer  of 128 for s. sanguis, and an 8-fold higher titer of 516 for s. oralis. in contrast, the par saliva showed a slightly higher aggregation activity than the sm/sl saliva towards s. rattus as judged by a twofold higher titer of 64. morphologically, however, the sm/sl saliva-induced aggregation of s. rattus was far more pronounced as was also found for s. sanguis. finally, the hwsm-induced aggregation showed a 4 to 8-fold higher titer than the originating salivary source, measuring 2048 for s. oralis and 128 for s. rattus. moreover, no difference was observed in aggregation activity between the hwsm from whole saliva of a blood group o donor and the hwsm from sm/sl saliva of a blood group a donor. all the data point to an important, though not exclusive role of the human salivary mucin fraction in the saliva-induced aggregation of these strains.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with candida albicans.
AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

TI  == molecular aspects of immunoglobulin a1 degradation by oral streptococci.
AB  == using a panel of 143 strains classified according to a novel taxonomic system for oral viridans-type streptococci, we reexamined the ability of oral streptococci to attack human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) molecules with iga1 protease or glycosidases. iga1 protease production was an exclusive property of all strains belonging to streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis (previously s. mitior) and of some strains of streptococcus mitis biovar 1. these are all dominant initiators of dental plaque formation. degradation of the carbohydrate moiety of iga1 molecules accompanied iga1 protease activity in s. oralis and protease-producing strains of s. mitis biovar 1. neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase were identified as extracellular enzymes in organisms of these taxa. by examination with enzyme-neutralizing antisera, four distinct iga1 proteases were detected in s. sanguis biovars 1 to 3, s. sanguis biovar 4, s. oralis, and strains of s. mitis, respectively. the cleavage of iga1 molecules by  streptococcal iga proteases was found to be influenced by their state of glycosylation. treatment of iga1 with bacterial (including streptococcal) neuraminidase increased susceptibility to protease, suggesting a cooperative activity of streptococcal iga1 protease and neuraminidase. in contrast, a decrease in susceptibility was observed after extensive deglycosylation of the hinge region with endo-alpha-n acetylgalactosaminidase. the effector functions of iga antibodies depend on the carbohydrate-containing fc portion. hence, the observation that oral streptococci may cleave not only the alpha 1 chains but also the carbohydrate moiety of iga1 molecules suggests that the ability to evade secretory immune mechanisms may contribute to the successful establishment of these bacteria in the oral cavity.

AB  == streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were the least proteolytic of 8 species of oral streptococci while streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis were the most proteolytic. degradation of fitc-bsa was significantly correlated with the hydrolysis of synthetic endopeptidase substrates. as s. oralis strains proliferate in dental plaque in the absence of dietary food their success, in vivo, might be due partially to their greater proteolytic activity compared to other oral streptococci.

AB  == ten strains of oral streptococci, comprising nine species, were screened for their in vitro cohesive interactions with a freshly isolated strain of neisseria  pharyngis. strains of mutans streptococci, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus mitis were able  to cohere with n. pharyngis cells attached to a salivary pellicle adsorbed to glass. the cohesion was either due to coaggregation between the different genera  or modification of the salivary pellicle by n. pharyngis mw2. s. sanguis ii and streptococcus oralis strains could not cohere with the n. pharyngis strain. extracellular polysaccharide formed from sucrose was found to mediate cohesion between certain strains of mutans streptococci or s. oralis and n. pharyngis mw2.

TI  == amylase-binding as a discriminator among oral streptococci.
AB  == the ability of 51 strains, belonging to streptococcus sanguis, 's. mitior', s. oralis and related groups, to bind salivary amylase was studied. most strains were grouped according to their dna-relatedness and then compared using 14 phenotypic tests. s. mitis, 's. mitior' and three relatively new groups of strains ('cr', 'mgh' and 'tufted mitior') bound salivary amylase, while strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis did not. the ability of strains to bind amylase or not was remarkably consistent within groups and the test proved to be reproducible, rapid and easy to perform. combination of the amylase-binding test  with 6 other conventional physiological tests allowed the construction of a dichotomous identification key which correctly identified 95% of strains for which genetic data was available. these findings suggest that the ability of organisms to bind salivary amylase could become a key test in identification schemes for certain oral streptococci.

TI  == comparison of the initial streptococcal microflora on dental enamel in caries-active and in caries-inactive individuals.
AB  == this study compared the initial (4 h) microflora on enamel in 7 caries-active and in 7 caries-inactive adolescents. in both groups the microflora was dominated by  streptococci which comprised 61 and 78% (median values) of the total viable counts in caries-active and caries-inactive individuals, respectively (p less than 0.01). identification of a total of 700 streptococcal isolates according to  a recently revised classification showed that the predominant streptococci belonged to the species streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1, and streptococcus sanguis. early plaque from caries-inactive individuals differed from that of caries-active individuals by significantly higher proportions of s.  sanguis (p less than 0.05) and iga1 protease producing streptococci (p less than  0.05). in caries-active individuals, there was a tendency to elevated levels of s. mitis biovar 1 (p less than 0.10). in addition, caries-active individuals were colonized by significantly higher numbers of mutans streptococci on the enamel surfaces (p less than 0.01). however, in both groups streptococcus mutans (serotype c) comprised less than or equal to 2% of the early streptococcal flora. streptococcus gordonii, s. mitis biovar 2, and streptococcus salivarius were present in low proportions and did not show differences in distribution that could be related to caries activity. the observed differences in the composition  of the early streptococcal microflora may be a factor that governs the eventual cariogenic potential of dental plaque.

AB  == seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. none coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. strains of bacteroides buccae, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and b. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. however, six bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. most isolates of b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. intermedius, b. loescheii, b. oris, and b. veroralis coaggregated with strains of actinomyces israelii, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. odontolyticus, rothia dentocariosa, or streptococcus sanguis. the strongest coaggregations involved b. denticola, b. loescheii, or b. oris; 22 of 25 strains  coaggregated with a. israelii. only b. loescheii interacted with certain strains  of s. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between a. viscosus and the same strains of s. sanguis. in fact, b. loescheii and a. viscosus were competitors for binding to s. sanguis. many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., s. sanguis and a. israelii). evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the  hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role  in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.

TI  == the presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria as a guideline in the management of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == thirty-eight children who had recurrent tonsillitis and who were chronic carriers of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs) were treated with oral clindamycin. surface tonsillar cultures, obtained prior to therapy and two weeks  after the termination of therapy, were processed for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all cultures. prior to therapy, the average yield was 9.3 isolates (5.2 aerobes and 4.1 anaerobes) per specimen; after the completion of therapy, the average yield was 5.5 isolates (3.0 aerobes and 2.5 anaerobes). the gabhs were completely eliminated after clindamycin therapy, and the numbers of isolates of bacteroides  spp and staphylococcus aureus were reduced. beta-lactamase production was detected prior to therapy in 57 isolates recovered from all tonsillar surfaces. this group included all isolates of s. aureus (15) and bacteroides fragilis (eight), 19 of 34 bacteroides melaninogenicus isolates (56 per cent), and seven of 12 bacteroides oralis isolates (58 per cent). only four isolates of beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains were recovered after the conclusion of therapy. follow-up study of 33 children for eight to 16 months (average, 13 months) showed no recurrence of gabhs in 31.

TI  == quantitative measurement of beta lactamase in tonsils of children with recurrent  tonsillitis.
AB  == tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. the  tonsils' core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. beta lactamase production was assayed in all isolates and beta lactamase activity was measured in the contents of each tonsil. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of 7.9 isolates (4.4 anaerobes  and 3.5 aerobes) per specimen. beta lactamase production was noted in 58 isolates recovered from 39 tonsils (78%). these were all 21 isolates of s. aureus and 10 b. fragilis, 18 of 45 b. melaninogenicus (40%), 7 of 14 b. oralis (50%), and 2 of 13 h. influenzae type b (15%). beta lactamase activity was detected in 33 of the  39 (85%) tonsils which harbored beta lactamase-producing bacteria, and in none of the 11 tonsils which had no beta lactamase-producing bacteria. our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of detectable beta lactamase  activity in the tonsillar tissue in most of the tonsils which harbored beta lactamase-producing organism.

TI  == the role of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in the persistence of streptococcal tonsillar infection.
AB  == the failure of penicillin to eradicate group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs) is a growing problem. this review summarizes current data concerning the  role of aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in the persistence of tonsillar infection caused by gabhs. clinical studies have demonstrated the recovery of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and detectable levels of the enzyme beta-lactamase in cultures of core tonsillar specimens in greater than 80% of the patients. the predominant bacteria have been bacteroides  melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, bacteroides ruminicola, and staphylococcus aureus. these organisms have emerged in about one-third of patients after one course of penicillin therapy and can be transferred to patient's household contacts. these organisms were present in tonsillar cultures in higher numbers in children with acute tonsillitis who did not respond to penicillin therapy than in those who were cured. protection of gabhs by beta-lactamase-producing organisms has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. several studies, including a recent double-blinded study, have demonstrated the ability of clindamycin to eradicate the streptococcal carrier state and to prevent recurrent infection in selected patients.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == bacteriology of dental abscesses of endodontic origin.
AB  == aspirates have been cultured from 10 dental abscesses of endodontic origin, all of which had penetrated beyond the bony alveolus to produce fluctuant swelling. sampling was by syringe aspiration. strict anaerobic techniques, including the use of an anaerobic chamber, were used for serial dilution and plating. randomly  selected colonies (100) from each culture were purified, characterized, and identified. seventy percent of the bacterial isolates were either strict anaerobes or microaerophilic. one abscess yielded a pure culture of a viridans streptococcus, streptococcus milleri. streptococcus intermedius dominated the flora in a second abscess. the common oral streptococcus, streptococcus sanguis,  constituted only 2% of the isolates from one additional infection. fusobacterium  nucleatum, bacteroides melaninogenicus, other bacteroides including b. oralis and b. ruminicola, anaerobic diphtheroids, peptostreptococcus micros, and staphylococcus epidermis were other predominant isolates.

TI  == circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  == root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, actinomyces bovis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides oralis in various combinations. after 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. in 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (ha), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of b. oralis in all five monkeys. agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of b. oralis in titers between  1:40 and 1:320. a marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (lps) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of igm-class. the study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.

TI  == influence of combinations of oral bacteria on periapical tissues of monkeys.
AB  == the present study deals with the ability of 11 bacterial strains, in various combinations, to induce periapical reactions. the indigenous oral bacteria were originally isolated from an experimental apical periodontitis in monkey. eight of the strains were complete collection isolated from one root canal. these strains  were inoculated together, in equal proportions, into 12 root canals. in addition, 63 canals were inoculated with other combination or separate strains. at the end  of the experimental period it was found that in the mixed infections the bacteroides oralis strain predominated in most root canals. in contrast, this bacteroides strain was not reisolated in any of nine root canals when inoculated  in a pure culture. enterococci, however, survived as pure cultures in all canals. the mixed infections showed the greatest capacity of inducing apical periodontitis, as revealed by radiography, and most pronounced was the "eight-strain collection". the facultatively anaerobic streptococci induced only  weak periapical reactions.

TI  == apical periodontitis induced by selected bacterial strains in root canals of immunized and nonimmunized monkeys.
AB  == experimental infections in root canals with streptococcus faecalis ss. liquefaciens (strep-mc4). actinomyces bovis (act-mc6) and bacteroides oralis (bact-mc3) were studied in four immunized and five nonimmunized monkeys. the immunization was performed using antigens of the homologous strains. the antibody level was checked by gel diffusion. in 56 root canals of the immunized animals and 60 root canals of the nonimmunized animals, viable cells of the three bacterial strains were enclosed in equal amounts of various combinations. after 6 months, samples from the root canals were subjected to qualitative and quantitative bacteriologic analyses and the apical area was radiographically and  histologically examined. the analyses revealed no significant difference between  the two groups of monkeys, although the viable cell recovery was slightly higher  in most of the root canals of nonimmunized monkeys. the cell proportion of the strains within the different bacterial combinations was equal in root canals of the two groups of animals. the radiographic and histologic examinations revealed  no significant difference between the two groups of animals regarding the number  of teeth with periapical lesions. the radiographic examination, however, showed a more distinct limitation of the process in the immunized than in the nonimmunized monkeys. histologically the lesions were more encapsulated and had a sparser cell infiltration in immunized than in nonimmunized monkeys. in the latter, inflammatory cells had often infiltrated the bone. mixed infections gave a more severe periapical reaction than single strain infections in both animal groups.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB  == aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. all aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients.  anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only  organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. there were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 bacteroides sp. (including 23 b. melaninogenicus, 5 b. oralis and 4 b. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic gram-positive cocci (including 10 peptostreptococcus sp., 4 peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 fusobacterium sp.; and 3 clostridium sp. there  were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 haemophilus sp. and 3 s. aureus. beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). these were all isolates of s. aureus (3), 8 of 23 b. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 b. oralis (40%). our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.

TI  == insoluble glucan hydrolyzing enzymes from oral bacteroides.
AB  == crude enzymes (en(c)) which hydrolyze insoluble glucan produced by streptococcus  mutans fa-1 were extracted from bacteroides oralis obtained from human dental plaque. extracellular insoluble glucan of s. mutans (isg) and the one which was partially modified by smith degradation (m-isg) were used as substrates. commercial dextran (m.w. 2,000,000) was used as control. composition of the types of glucosidic linkages of the glucans was determined by methylation analysis. the ratio of the alpha-(1--6) linkage and alpha-(1--3) linkage was 96.3% and 0.5% for dextran, 29.2% and 55.1% for isg and 11.9% and 84.9% for m-isg. en(c) was extracted by salting out of the culture of b. oralis with 60% saturation of ammonium sulfate. en(c) hydrolyzed isg, m-isg and dextran, whereas commercial dextranase (alpha-1,6 glucanase) hydrolyzed only dextran. isg was treated with the commercial dextranase until no glucose was detected in the medium, and the remaining material was used for the substrate of enzymes. release of glucose was  detected from the substrate by treatment with en(c), but not with commercial dextranase. these results indicated that en(c) of bacteroides oralis contained at least two types of glucanase, one being dextranase which hydrolyzes the alpha-(1--6) linkage and the other the so-called mutanase which hydrolyzes the alpha-(1--3) linkage.

TI  == effect of bacterial contamination on cecal size and cecal contents of gnotobiotic rodents.
AB  == in the present investigation the effect of various bacterial contaminations of gnotobiotic mice and rats on cecal size is presented. of the species tested, bacteroides oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum did not establish in germ-free mice. streptococcus mutans, clostridium difficile, a neisseria strain and two recent cecal isolates established, but failed to exert an effect upon the cecum of mice. a group k streptococcus and b. fragilis increased the cecal size apparently by increasing the levels of water-soluble protein, peptides, and carbohydrates in the cecal contents. mixed ileal bacteria decreased the cecal size by preventing accumulation of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the cecum. a peptococcus strain caused a reduction by lowering the levels of insoluble material in the cecum. when this strain was combined with two clostridium isolates and introduced into gnotobiotic rats, 50 to 65% cecal reduction was observed. this polycontamination did not decrease the per cent water of the cecal contents but caused lower levels of both soluble and insoluble material to accumulate in the cecum. no net nitrogen absorption from the distal small intestine occurred in either the germ-free or polycontaminated rats.
