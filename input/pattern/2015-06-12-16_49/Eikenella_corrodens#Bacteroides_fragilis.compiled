TI  - Surveillance of susceptibility patterns in 1297 European and US anaerobic and capnophilic isolates to co-amoxiclav and five other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility data were collected for co-amoxiclav and other antimicrobial agents against 1297 recent anaerobe isolates collected in Europe and the USA. The co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) MIC(50/90)s (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid concentration in a ratio of 2:1, expressed in terms of amoxicillin concentration in mg/L) were 0.5/4 for Bacteroides fragilis, </=0.125/1 for Prevotella species, </=0.125/0.25 for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 0.5/1 for Eikenella corrodens, 0.25/8 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, </=0.125/0.5 for Micromonas (Peptostreptococcus) micros, </=0.25/0.5 for Fingoldia (Peptostreptococcus) magna, and </=0.125/0.125 for Porphyromonas species. The co-amoxiclav susceptibility rate for B. fragilis was 94.6%, for P. anaerobius 84.3% and for all other species tested 100%. These data indicate that co-amoxiclav remains an effective drug for the antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis of many anaerobic infections. Among the comparator drugs, metronidazole was very active against all bacterial species (>96% susceptible) except E. corrodens (MIC(50/90) of >32/>64 mg/L), which is a capnophilic organism. Imipenem was also highly active against all species (>98% susceptible). Levofloxacin and clindamycin were the least potent agents tested, particularly against Bacteroides, Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus (levofloxacin susceptibility rates: Bacteroides 72.7%, Prevotella 71.5%, F. magna 72.4%; clindamycin susceptibility rates: Bacteroides 79.5%, Prevotella 92.1%, F. magna 84.7%).
TI  - Isolation of Eikenella corrodens from polymicrobial hepatic abscess: report of one case.
AB  - Eikenella corrodens is a rare cause of hepatic abscess. We report a case of a hepatic abscess caused by (1) Bacteroides fragilis, (2) Streptococcus constellatus and (3) E. corrodens, which illustrates potential problems of antibiotic coverage due to the presence of Eikenella species. The infection followed an episode of acute gastroenteritis and the clinical course appeared indolent evolving over one week. Besides empirical antibiotics, initial percutaneous aspiration was performed and yielded pus which grew E. corrodens concomitantly with Streptococcus species. E. corrodens was sensitive to penicillin but resistant to clindamycin and metronidazole. But B. fragilis was resistant to penicillin. So the antibiotics were switched to amoxicillin/clavulanate. Unfortunately fever persisted and the abscess increased in size. Therefore echo-guided percutaneous drainage with pigtail catheter was installed. Fever subsided 5 days later. After 21 days treatment of antibiotics, the patient was discharged in good condition despite having some sterile fluid in the residual abscess cavity. Two months after discharge the follow-up echogram confirmed complete resolution of the residual abscess. This patient shows us the existence of E. corrodens in pediatric patients, especially when the hepatic abscess is very likely from the spread of an oral or abdominal infection.
TI  - Management of maxillofacial infections: a review of 50 cases.
AB  - Maxillofacial infections often place the oral and maxillofacial surgeon in situations where timely decisions have to be made. These decisions can be life-saving. This study reviews 50 infections treated over a 3-year period. The results reveal rapid resolution of the infections by adhering to fundamental principles in their management: recognition of airway compromise, surgical intervention, and the administration of the appropriate antibiotic. A protocol for the management of maxillofacial infections is described.
TI  - E-test: a new technique for antimicrobial susceptibility testing for periodontal  microorganisms.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to validate the Epsilometer test (E-test) method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of selected periodontopathic microorganisms using the agar dilution method as a standard. The E-test has been developed to provide a direct quantification of antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms. The device consists of a predefined, continuous, and exponential gradient of antibiotic concentrations immobilized along a rectangular plastic test strip. After 48 hours incubation a drop-shaped inhibition zone intersects the graded test strip at the inhibitory concentration (IC) of the antibiotic. Twenty-two subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites were plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% rabbit blood or 5% sheep blood and trypticase soy agar supplemented with vancomycin and bacitracin. A total of 60 strains of key periodontal pathogens (Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, and Capnocytophaga) isolated from 22 sites of 12 patients were studied. The antibiotics tested were clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and ampicillin at concentrations above and below the achieved blood or gingival crevicular fluid levels. As a standard reference the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the agar dilution method. MICs were compared with ICs determined using the E-test method. The results showed an agreement ranging from 67% to 100%; sensitivity ranging from 75% to 100%; predictability ranging from 56% to 100% and specificity ranging from 33% to 96%. The E-test ICs for ampicillin, cefoxitin, and metronidazole against the Gram-negative capnophilic and microaerophilic rods and the black-pigmented anaerobic rods ICs for ampicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline showed a high percentage of agreement with the agar dilution MICS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Sialidase (neuraminidase) activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic  bacteria.
AB  - A filter paper spot test with 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate was used to study the prevalence of sialidase activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria. A total of 567 isolates representing four genera of obligate anaerobes and four genera of capnophilic organisms was tested. Sialidase activity was detected in 94% of 66 isolates from the Bacteroides fragilis group, 98% of 66 B. bivius isolates, and all isolates of the following species (number of isolates follows species name): B. capillosus, 4; B. levii, 2; B. denticola, 22; B. loescheii, 23; B. melaninogenicus, 32; B. forsythus, 44; and B. buccalis, 2. However, sialidase activity was detected in only 29% of 7 B. buccae isolates, 79% of 14 B. disiens isolates, and 55% of 11 B. oralis isolates. Sialidase activity was not detected among any of 13 isolates of B. gracilis, 12 isolates of B. ureolyticus, 61 isolates of B. intermedius, or 26 isolates of B. corporis. Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) asaccharolytica (20 isolates) and P. endodontalis (8 isolates) did not demonstrate sialidase activity, while 25 isolates of P. gingivalis were sialidase positive. Sialidase activity was found in 10 (100%) of 10 isolates of Capnocytophaga ochracea of C. sputigena but not in any of 4 C. gingivalis isolates. Other gram-negative anaerobic or capnophilic bacteria, including the following, were negative for sialidase activity: Fusobacterium nucleatum, 39 isolates; Wolinella recta, 19 isolates; Eikenella corrodens, 17 isolates; Haemophilus aphrophilus, 10 isolates; and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 10 isolates. These data demonstrate sialidase activity in several species of the genera Bacteroides and Porphyromonas and suggest that this characteristic may be useful for identification.
TI  - Symposium on infective endocarditis. III. Endocarditis due to gram-negative bacteria. Report of 56 cases.
AB  - At the Mayo Clinic, 56 patients with infective endocarditis caused by gram-negative bacteria were seen from 1958 through 1979, 35 of whom were seen from 1970 through 1979. The patients were categorized into two divisions: those with medical, naturally acquired valve infections (40 [71%]) and those with infective endocarditis after cardiac operation (16 [29%]). The overall cure rate was 82% (46 of 56 patients); 35 of 40 patients (88%) were cured in the medical group, and 11 of 16 patients (69%) were cured in the surgical group. The patients were further classified on the basis of organism: group 1 (33 patients)--infections caused by Haemophilus (18), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (4), Cardiobacterium hominis (6), Eikenella corrodens (2), Kingella kingii (2), and Bordetella bronchiseptica (1); 32 of these 33 patients (97%) were cured, and 6 of these infections were on prosthetic valves; group 2 (21 patients)--infections caused by enteric aerobic bacilli; 13 of the 21 patients (62%) were cured; group 3 (1 patient)--infection caused by anaerobes (Bacteroides fragilis); this patient died; and group 4 (1 patient)--infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae; this patient was cured. The gram-negative bacteria in the survivors and nonsurvivors and the curative antibiotic regimens were tabulated. Among the 35 survivors in the medical group, a combined antibiotic regimen cured 21 patients (60%) and a single antibiotic agent cured 14 (40%). Among the 11 survivors in the surgical group, combined therapy was given to 8 (73%), a single drug was used once, and operation alone achieved a cure in 2 patients. Compared with past data, the current study indicates an increasing incidence of gram-negative bacterial endocarditis (approximately 10%) and an improving cure rate 82%).
