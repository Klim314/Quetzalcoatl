TI  - Optimisation of the prevention and treatment of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - This paper reviews currently established guidelines for the prevention and treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Endocarditis remains a life-threatening disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. Primary prevention of endocarditis, whenever possible, is therefore very important. In an individual with endocarditis, rapid diagnosis and effective treatment are essential to good patient outcome. The guidelines discussed here are largely based on those issued by the American Heart Association. While most cases of endocarditis are not attributable to an invasive procedure, certain procedures are associated with bacteraemia by organisms commonly associated with endocarditis, and antibacterial prophylaxis is recommended before such procedures. Patient cardiac conditions are stratified into high, moderate and negligible risk categories based on potential outcome if endocarditis develops. For oral, dental, respiratory tract, and oesophageal procedures (most often associated with viridans streptococci) the standard antibacterial regimen is oral amoxicillin. For gastrointestinal and genitourinary procedures (most often associated with enterococci), parenteral antibacterials are most often recommended. For high-risk patients, intramuscular or intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin (or vancomycin and gentamicin in penicillin-allergic individuals) is recommended. For moderate risk patients, an option of oral amoxicillin or parenteral ampicillin is offered. Treatment of bacterial endocarditis is guided by identification of the causative micro-organism. Approximately 80% of cases of endocarditis are due to the gram-positive cocci: streptococci and staphylococci. Other gram-positive organisms include enterococci (predominantly Enterococcusfaecalis and E. faecium) and the HACEK group of organisms (Haemophilus parainfluenzae, H. aphrophilus, Actinobacillus [Haemophilus] actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae). In general, for uncomplicated cases of endocarditis due to penicillin-susceptible viridans streptococci or Streptococcus bovis 4 weeks of benzylpenicillin (or ceftriaxone) is the preferred regimen for most patients aged >65 years. A 2-week course of treatment can be used when gentamicin is added, in patients at low risk for adverse events caused by gentamicin therapy. When endocarditis is caused by strains of viridans streptococci or S. bovis relatively resistant to penicillin, or by enterococci, both benzylpenicillin and gentamicin are recommended. For staphylococcal endocarditis on native heart valves, nafcillin or oxacillin with or without gentamicin is the preferred regimen. In prosthetic valve staphylococcal endocarditis, nafcillin (or oxacillin) with rifampicin and gentamicin is recommended. For all of the above situations, vancomycin is recommended for the patient allergic to penicillin (or methicillin). Finally, consideration of out-of-hospital therapy in selected patients is discussed.
TI  - Measurement of microbial alpha-amylases with p-nitrophenyl glycosides as the substrate complex.
AB  - The detection of alpha-amylase is commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories to aid in differentiating Streptococcus bovis from other streptococci. It is also useful in identifying Eikenella corrodens and the gravis subspecies of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and in separating species of the genera Bacteroides, Clostridium, Actinomyces, and Bacillus. Currently, the most frequently used procedure utilizes starch as the substrate and iodine as the indicator. Starch is incorporated into a agar medium, the isolate is inoculated on the surface, and the medium is incubated for 24 to 48 h. A 15-min test containing p-nitrophenyl polyglycosides as the substrate complex was developed to yield results comparable with the agar-based starch test. The reagent was made in liquid form, 0.20 ml per tube, and could be incubated either in ambient air or at 35 degrees C. When dried, the p-nitrophenyl polyglycoside reagent could be stored at 0 degrees C for 4 weeks.
