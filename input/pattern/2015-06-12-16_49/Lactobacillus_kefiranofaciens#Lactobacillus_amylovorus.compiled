TI  - Determination of lactic microflora of kefir grains and kefir beverage by using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - In this study, we investigated the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages collected from different regions of Turkey by using culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. In the culture-independent detection, 10 different species of bacteria were detected in total by using the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region. Among these species, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens was the most dominant one in the kefir grains, while Lactococcus lactis was found to be significantly prevalent in the kefir beverages. In the culture-dependent detection, the primary differentiation and grouping of the isolates from kefir beverages and kefir grains were performed using repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) fingerprinting, and the results were validated by 16S rDNA full-length sequencing. According to the results of culture-dependent methods, the most frequently isolated species were L. lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Lactobacillus kefiri, respectively. Only 3 species, which are L. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, were detected with both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. This study showed that the combination of both methods is necessary for a detailed and reliable investigation of microbial communities in kefir grains and kefir beverages. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Due to their artisan- and region-dependent microflora, kefir products can be a source of interesting lactic acid bacteria, either new taxa or strains with specific functional properties, which might be used for the development of new starter cultures and innovative food products. Therefore, an increasing demand exists for new strains that show desirable effects on the product characteristics Artisan dairy products are a candidate source of such microorganisms. For this reason, in this study, the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages obtained from different regions of Turkey were studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods.
TI  - Identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Target DNA bands were identified according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. Comigrating bands present in the DGGE profiles were resolved by species-specific PCR. The results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. The dominant lactic acid bacteria included Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. Frequently encountered bacterial species were Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus kitasatonis, and Lactobacillus kefiri. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus buchneri, and Lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. In addition, L. buchneri, L. jensenii, and L. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for the first time in the Xinjiang koumiss. Furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on M17, de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe, Halligan-Pearce, and Kenner fecal media. The results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained by the DGGE analysis. This is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.
TI  - Rapid discrimination of lactobacilli isolated from kefir grains by FT-IR spectroscopy.
AB  - Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used in combination with multivariate statistical analysis for differentiation of lactic bacteria isolated from kefir grains. Twelve reference strains and 42 lactobacilli isolates from four local kefir grains, previously identified by biochemical traditional techniques at species level were included in this study. The spectra were analysed by hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) using Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient and Ward's algorithm. The differentiation between homo- and heterofermentative lactobacilli, proposed as a first level in the classification scheme, was performed with vector normalized first derivatives spectra in the windows 1789-1700, 1059-935, 3000-2927 and 896-833 cm(-1). For heterofermentative lactobacilli the windows 1780-1750, 1500-1200, 2950-2930 and 900-700 cm(-1) were found to contribute to the maximal separation among L. kefir, L. parakefir and Lactobacillus brevis. It was also demonstrated that although this model was robust against small variations in growth temperature (+/-5 degrees C) and growth time (+/-5 h), the make of culture medium used (Biokar or Difco) affected the separation of heterofermentative lactobacilli at species level. For homofermentative lactobacilli the spectral regions 1230-900, 1777-1690, 1357-1240 and 2960-2870 cm(-1), were selected for discrimination among 5 different species that are normally present in kefir grains: L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. kefirgranum, L. kefiranofaciens and L. cassei. The classification and discrimination schemes proposed in this work completely matched with the identification obtained by classical biochemical techniques at species level.
TI  - Reclassification of Lactobacillus kefirgranum Takizawa et al. 1994 as Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens subsp. kefirgranum subsp. nov. and emended description of L. kefiranofaciens Fujisawa et al. 1988.
AB  - Fourteen homofermentative lactic acid bacteria that were isolated from kefir grains and kefir fermented milks were assigned to either Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens or Lactobacillus kefirgranum, based on their characteristic morphotypes, phenotypic features and SDS-PAGE profiles of whole-cell proteins. Further genotypic analyses on representative strains from both taxa demonstrated that L. kefiranofaciens and L. kefirgranum share 100 % 16S rDNA sequence similarity and belong phylogenetically to the Lactobacillus acidophilus species group. DNA-DNA binding values of >79 % and analogous DNA G+C contents of 37-38 mol% showed that the strains studied belonged to one species: L. kefirgranum is a later synonym of L. kefiranofaciens. An emended description is proposed for L. kefiranofaciens. Due to the specific morphological and biochemical characteristics of these taxa in kefir grain formation, it is proposed that L. kefirgranum should be reclassified as L. kefiranofaciens subsp. kefirgranum subsp. nov.
TI  - The antimicrobial properties of different strains of Lactobacillus spp. isolated  from kefir.
AB  - The characteristics of 58 strains of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from kefir were  studied. These strains were tested for adherence to human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells, resistance to acidic pH and bile acid, antimicrobial activities against enteropathogenic bacteria and inhibition of Salmonella typhimurium attachment to Caco-2 cells. The best probiotic properties were observed in L. acidophilus CYC 10051 and L. kefiranofaciens CYC 10058. L. kefiranofaciens CYC 10058 produced an exopolysaccharide, which revealed that it was closely related to kefiran, a polysaccharide with antitumoral properties. This is the first in vitro study about the antimicrobial characteristics of the Lactobacillus population of kefir.
TI  - Lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov., isolated from the posterior fornix of the human vagina.
AB  - Twelve strains isolated from the posterior fornix fluid of the human vagina were  identified as Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gallinarum and Lactobacillus crispatus based on numerical analyses of total soluble cell protein profiles and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR banding patterns. Five strains grouped with the type strains of Lactobacillus gasseri (DSM 20077T) and Lactobacillus jensenii (DSM 20557T) at r > or = 0.83 in one protein profile cluster, well separated from the other species included in this study. However, numerical analysis of the RAPD-PCR banding patterns of representative strains selected from the L. gasseri-L. jensenii protein cluster clearly indicated that they belong to two different species. Four strains (TV 1010, TG 1013, TV 1018T and TV 1045) grouped into another well separated protein profile cluster at r > or = 0.87. Strains selected from this cluster displayed very similar RAPD-PCR banding patterns and clustered at R2 > or = 0.78, separate from the other strains examined. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA of two representative strains, TV 1018T and TG 1013, of this group indicated that it represents a new member of rRNA group I Lactobacillus, which includes Lactobacillus delbrueckii, the type of the genus, and close relatives Lactobacillus acetotolerans, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, Lactobacillus iners, L. jensenii, L. crispatus, L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus hamsteri, L. johnsonii, L. gasseri and Lactobacillus amylolyticus. The name Lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov. is proposed for strains TV 1010 (DSM 13172), TG 1013, TV 1018T and TV 1045, with strain TV 1018T (= DSM 13171T = ATCC 700934T) as the type.
