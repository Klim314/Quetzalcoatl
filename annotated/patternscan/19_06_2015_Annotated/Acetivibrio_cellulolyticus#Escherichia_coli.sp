TI  == engineered platform for bioethylene production by a cyanobacterium expressing a chimeric complex of plant enzymes.
AB  == ethylene is an industrially important compound, but more sustainable production methods are desirable. since cellulosomes increase the ability of cellulolytic enzymes by physically linking the relevant enzymes via dockerin-cohesin interactions, in this study, we genetically engineered a chimeric cellulosome-like complex of two ethylene-generating enzymes from tomato using cohesin-dockerins from the bacteria clostridium thermocellum and acetivibrio cellulolyticus. this complex was transformed into escherichia coli to analyze kinetic parameters and enzyme complex formation and into the cyanobacterium synechococcus elongatus pcc 7942, which was then grown with and without 0.1 mm isopropyl beta-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg) induction. only at minimal protein expression levels (without iptg), the chimeric complex produced 3.7 times more ethylene in vivo than did uncomplexed enzymes. thus, cyanobacteria can be used to sustainably generate ethylene, and the synthetic enzyme complex greatly enhanced production efficiency. artificial synthetic enzyme complexes hold great  promise for improving the production efficiency of other industrial compounds.
