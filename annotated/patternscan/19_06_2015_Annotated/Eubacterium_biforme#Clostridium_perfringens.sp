TI  == green tea increases the survival yield of bifidobacteria in simulated gastrointestinal environment and during refrigerated conditions.
AB  == background: the well-known prebiotics are carbohydrates but their effects may not always be beneficial, as they can also encourage the growth of non-probiotic bacteria such as eubacterium biforme and clostridium perfringens. therefore, new  alternatives such as non-carbohydrate sources to stimulate the growth of probiotics are needed. the aim of this work was to evaluate (i) the green tea polyphenols by hplc-lc/ms and (ii) the protective effect of green tea extract on  viability and stability of b. infantis atcc 15697 and b. breve atcc 15700 microencapsulated in chitosan coated alginate microcapsules during exposure to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and refrigerated storage. results: the major compound identified by hplc-lc/ms in green tea was epigallocatechin gallate followed by caffeine and epigallocatechin. the survival yield of probiotic bacteria in microcapsules with 10% gt during storage at 4 degrees c, demonstrated significantly (p < 0.05) higher number of survival bacteria. microencapsulated b.infantis and b. breve with 5% and 10% gt showed a significantly (p < 0.05) improved survival under simulated gastric conditions (ph 2.0, 2 h) and bile solution (3%, 2 h) when they were compared with microencapsulation without gt addition. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that green tea coencapsulated with b. infantis or b. breve exert a protective effect of bacteria during exposure to gastrointestinal conditions and refrigerated storage. for a health perspective, the results confirm the growing interest probiotic bacteria and the perceived benefit of increasing their numbers in the gastrointestinal tract by microencapsulation.

TI  == identification of predominant human and animal anaerobic intestinal bacterial species by terminal restriction fragment patterns (trfps): a rapid, pcr-based method.
AB  == identification of predominant human and animal intestinal tract anaerobes by conventional methods is cumbersome, time-consuming and less sensitive as compared to molecular methods. we have developed a molecular technique to identify most of the abundant intestinal microflora by polyermase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of a 16s rrna gene fragment using a pair of universal pcr primers.  the forward pcr primer was labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein amino hexy (6-fam)  fluorescent dye to detect the terminal fragment of the pcr products after digestion with restriction enzymes. the pcr products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes and were analysed by capillary electrophoresis using an  automated dna sequencer. the data was analysed with genescan software 2.1. eleven bacteria (eubacterium biforme, e. limosum, peptostreptococcus productus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, c. perfringens and escherichia coli) that are predominant in human and animal intestinal tract were  successfully identified by this rapid molecular technique. this protocol is rapid, accurate, sensitive and capable of identifying multiple organisms in a single sample.

TI  == in vitro study of prebiotic properties of levan-type exopolysaccharides from lactobacilli and non-digestible carbohydrates using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == batch cultures inoculated with human faeces were used to study the prebiotic properties of levan-type exopolysaccharides (eps) from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis as well as levan, inulin, and fructooligosaccharide (fos). denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16s rdna fragments generated by pcr with universal primers was used to analyse the cultures. characteristic changes were revealed in the composition of the gut bacteria during fermentation of the carbohydrates. an enrichment of bifidobacterium spp. was found for the eps and inulin but not for levan and fos. the bifidogenic effect of the eps was confirmed by culturing on selective medium. in addition, the use of eps and fos resulted in enhanced growth of eubacterium biforme and clostridium perfringens, respectively.
