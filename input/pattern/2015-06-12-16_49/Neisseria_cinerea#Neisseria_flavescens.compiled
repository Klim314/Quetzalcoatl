TI  - Biochemical and genomic analysis of the denitrification pathway within the genus  Neisseria.
AB  - Since Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are obligate human pathogens, a comparison with commensal species of the same genus could reveal differences important in pathogenesis. The recent completion of commensal Neisseria genome draft assemblies allowed us to perform a comparison of the genes involved in the catalysis, assembly and regulation of the denitrification pathway, which has been implicated in the virulence of several bacteria. All species contained a highly conserved nitric oxide reductase (NorB) and a nitrite reductase (AniA or NirK) that was highly conserved in the catalytic but divergent in the N-terminal lipid modification and C-terminal glycosylation domains. Only Neisseria mucosa contained a nitrate reductase (Nar), and only Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria cinerea, Neisseria subflava, Neisseria flavescens and Neisseria sicca contained a nitrous oxide reductase (Nos) complex. The regulators of the denitrification genes, FNR, NarQP and NsrR, were highly conserved, except for the GAF domain of NarQ. Biochemical examination of laboratory strains revealed that all of the neisserial species tested except N. mucosa had a two- to fourfold lower nitrite reductase activity than N. gonorrhoeae, while N. meningitidis and most of the commensal Neisseria species had a two- to fourfold higher nitric oxide (NO) reductase activity. For N. meningitidis and most of the commensal Neisseria, there was a greater than fourfold reduction in the NO steady-state level in the presence of nitrite as compared with N. gonorrhoeae. All of the species tested generated an NO steady-state level in the presence of an NO donor that was similar to that of N. gonorrhoeae. The greatest difference between the Neisseria species was the lack of a functional Nos system in the pathogenic species N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis.
TI  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae activates the proteinase cathepsin B to mediate the signaling activities of the NLRP3 and ASC-containing inflammasome.
AB  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a common sexually transmitted pathogen that significantly impacts female fertility, neonatal health, and transmission of HIV worldwide. N. gonorrhoeae usually causes localized inflammation of the urethra and cervix by inducing production of IL-1beta and other inflammatory cytokines. Several NLR (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat) proteins are implicated in the formation of pro-IL-1beta-processing complexes called inflammasomes in response to pathogens. We demonstrate that NLRP3 (cryopyrin, NALP3) is the primary NLR required for IL-1beta/IL-18 secretion in response to N. gonorrhoeae in monocytes. We also show that N. gonorrhoeae infection promotes NLRP3-dependent monocytic cell death via pyronecrosis, a recently described pathway with morphological features of necrosis, including release of the strong inflammatory mediator HMBG1. Additionally, N. gonorrhoeae activates the cysteine protease cathepsin B as measured by the breakdown of a cathepsin B substrate. Inhibition of cathepsin B shows that this protease is an apical controlling step in the downstream activities of NLRP3 including IL-1beta production, pyronecrosis, and HMGB1 release. Nonpathogenic Neisseria strains (Neisseria cinerea and Neisseria flavescens) do not activate NLRP3 as robustly as N. gonorrhoeae. Conditioned medium from N. gonorrhoeae contains factors capable of initiating the NLRP3-mediated signaling events. Isolated N. gonorrhoeae lipooligosaccharide, a known virulence factor from this bacterium that is elaborated from the bacterium in the form of outer membrane blebs, activates both NLRP3-induced IL-1beta secretion and pyronecrosis. Our findings indicate that activation of NLRP3-mediated inflammatory response pathways is an important venue associated with host response and pathogenesis of N. gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Analysis of amino acid sequences of penicillin-binding protein 2 in clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with reduced susceptibility to cefixime and ceftriaxone.
AB  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains with reduced susceptibility to cefixime and ceftriaxone, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefixime of 0.125-0.25 microg/ml and ceftriaxone of 0.031-0.125 microg/ml, were isolated from male urethritis patients in Tokyo, Japan, in 2006. The amino acid sequences of PenA, penicillin-binding protein 2, in these strains were of two types: PenA mosaic and nonmosaic strains. In the PenA mosaic strain, some regions in the transpeptidase-encoding domain in PenA were similar to those of Neisseria perflava/sicca, Neisseria cinerea, Neisseria flavescens, Neisseria polysaccharea, and Neisseria meningitidis. In the PenA nonmosaic strain, there was a mutation of Ala-501 to Val in PenA. In addition, we performed homology modeling of PenA wild-type and mosaic strains and compared them. The results of the modeling studies suggested that reduced susceptibility to cephems such as cefixime and ceftriaxone is due to a conformational alteration of the beta-lactam-binding pocket. These results also indicated that the mosaic structures and the above point mutation in PenA make a major contribution to the reduced susceptibility to cephem antibiotics.
TI  - Distribution of transferrin binding protein B gene (tbpB) variants among Neisseria species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transferrin binding protein B (tbpB), an outer membrane lipoprotein,  is required for the acquisition of iron from human transferrin. Two tbpB families have been documented in Neisseria meningitidis: an isotype I tbpB gene of 1.8 kb and an isotype II tbpB gene of 2.1 kb, the former expressed by meningococci in the disease-associated ST-11 clonal complex and the latter found among meningococci belonging to the hyper-invasive clonal complexes including ST-8, ST-18, ST-32, ST-41/44 as well as N. gonorrhoeae isolates. The origin of the isotype I tbpB gene is unknown, however several features in common with non-pathogenic Neisseria and the ST-11 clonal complex N. meningitidis isolate FAM18 have been documented leading to the hypothesis that the isotype I tbpB gene may also be shared between non-pathogenic Neisseria and ST-11 meningococci. As a result, the diversity of the tbpB gene was investigated in a defined collection of Neisseria species. RESULTS: Two families of isotype I tbpB were identified: family A containing conserved genes belonging to ST-11 meningococci, N. polysaccharea and N. lactamica isolates and family B including more diverse isotype I tbpB genes from N. sicca, N. mucosa, N. flava, N. subflava as well as N. cinerea, N. flavescens and N. polysaccharea isolates. Three isotype II tbpB families were identified with: family C containing diverse tbpB genes belonging to N. polysaccharea, N. lactamica, N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis isolates, family D including another subset of isotype II tbpB genes from N. lactamica isolates and family E solely composed of N. gonorrhoeae tbpB genes. CONCLUSION: This study reveals another instance of similarity between meningococci of the ST-11 clonal complex and non-pathogenic Neisseria with the origin of the isotype I tbpB gene resulting from a horizontal genetic transfer event occurring between these two populations.
TI  - Functional diversity of three different DsbA proteins from Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - The genome of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strain MC58 contains three genes - nmb0278, nmb0294 and nmb0407 - encoding putative homologues of DsbA, a periplasmic thiol disulphide oxidoreductase protein-folding catalyst of the Dsb protein family. DsbA assists the folding of periplasmic and membrane proteins in diverse organisms. While all three cloned genes complemented the DTT sensitivity of dsbA-null Escherichia coli, they showed different activities in folding specific target proteins in this background. NMB0278 protein was the most active in complementing defects in motility and alkaline phosphatase activity, while NMB0294 was the most active in folding periplasmic MalF. NMB0407 showed the weakest activity in all assays. It is extremely unusual for organisms to contain more than one chromosomal dsbA. Among the members of the genus Neisseria, only the meningococcus carries all three of these genes. Strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria cinerea and Neisseria polysaccharea contained only homologues of nmb0278 and nmb0407, while Neisseria flava, Neisseria subflava and Neisseria flavescens carried only nmb0294. It is speculated that the versatility of the meningococcus in surviving in different colonizing and invasive disease settings may be derived in part from an enhanced potential to deploy outer-membrane proteins, a consequence of carrying an extended repertoire of protein-folding catalysts.
TI  - The integration site of the iga gene in commensal Neisseria sp.
AB  - An IgA1 protease is produced by the human pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, Neisseria species. In this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the N. gonorrhoeae strain MS11 and compared to corresponding loci in N. meningitidis and commensal Neisseria species. In N. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpB and ksgA were found immediately downstream of iga. In addition to comL and comA, a homolog of the Escherichia coli YFII gene was identified upstream of iga. Each gene in the iga region (YFII and comL, comA and iga, and trpB and ksgA) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. The comL/ comA and iga/ trpB pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. These terminators contain the common gonococcal DNA uptake sequence (DUS). A highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in N. gonorrhoeae was also found in N. meningitidis. In Southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal DNAs of the commensal species N. mucosa, N. lactamica, N. flavescens, N. cinerea, N. subflava, N. flava, N. sicca or N. elongata. When N. gonorrhoeae comL and trpB were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. This indicated that commensal Neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between comA and trpB. The region between comA and trpB was therefore amplified by PCR. The fragment obtained from N. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal comA and trpB, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology to any known gonococcal sequence. Our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. N. lactamica, which is more closely related to N. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.
TI  - Serotype distribution, antibiotic susceptibility, and genetic relatedness of Neisseria meningitidis strains recently isolated in Italy.
AB  - The availability of new polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C prompted European National Health authorities to carefully monitor isolate characteristics. In Italy, during 1999-2001, the average incidence was 0.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Serogroup B was predominant and accounted for 75% of the isolates, followed by serogroup C with 24%. Serogroup C was isolated almost twice as frequently in cases of septicemia than in cases of meningitis, and the most common phenotypes were C:2a:P1.5 and C:2b:P1.5. Among serogroup B meningococci, the trend of predominant phenotypes has changed from year to year, with a recent increase in the frequency of B:15:P1.4. Only a few meningococci had decreased susceptibility to penicillin, and, in the penA gene, all of these strains had exogenous DNA blocks deriving from the DNA of commensal Neisseria flavescens, Neisseria cinerea, and Neisseria perflava/sicca. Fluorescent amplified fragment-length polymorphism analysis revealed the nonclonal nature of the strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin.
TI  - Mosaic-like structure of penicillin-binding protein 2 Gene (penA) in clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with reduced susceptibility to cefixime.
AB  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains with reduced susceptibility to cefixime (MICs, 0.25 to 0.5 micro g/ml) were isolated from male urethritis patients in Tokyo, Japan, in 2000 and 2001. The resistance to cephems including cefixime and penicillin was transferred to a susceptible recipient, N. gonorrhoeae ATCC 19424, by transformation of the penicillin-binding protein 2 gene (penA) that had been amplified by PCR from a strain with reduced susceptibility to cefixime (MIC, 0.5 micro g/ml). The sequences of penA in the strains with reduced susceptibilities to cefixime were different from those of other susceptible isolates and did not correspond to the reported N. gonorrhoeae penA gene sequences. Some regions in the transpeptidase-encoding domain in this penA gene were similar to those in the penA genes of Neisseria perflava (N. sicca), Neisseria cinerea, Neisseria flavescens, and Neisseria meningitidis. These results showed that a mosaic-like structure in the penA gene conferred reductions in the levels of susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae to cephems and penicillin in a manner similar to that found for N. meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae : Detection and Typing by Probe Hybridization, LCR, and PCR.
AB  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae, first described by Neisser in 1879, is a Gram-negative, nonmotile, nonspore-forming diplococcus, belonging to the family Neisseriaceae. It is the etiologic agent of gonorrhea. The other pathogenic species is Neisseria meningitidis, to which N. gonorrhoeae is genetically closely related. Although N. meningitidis is not usually considered to be a sexually transmitted disease, it may infect the mucous membranes of the anogenital area of homosexual men (1). The other members of the genus, which include Neisseria lactamic a, Neisseriapolysaccharea, Neisseria cinerea, and Neisseria flavescens, which are related to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and saccharolytic strains, such as Neisseria subflava, Neisseria sicca, and Neisseria mucosa, which are less genetically related to the aforementioned, are considered to be nonpathogenic, being normal flora of the nasopharyngeal mucous membranes (2).
TI  - A comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the adk and recA genes of pathogenic  and commensal Neisseria species: evidence for extensive interspecies recombination within adk.
AB  - The sequences of the adenylate kinase gene (adk) and the RecA gene (recA) were determined from the same isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, N. lactamica, N. polysaccharea, N. cinerea, N. mucosa, N. pharyngis var. flava, N. flavescens, and N. animalis. The patterns of sequence divergence observed at adk and recA were very different. Dendrograms constructed from the recA data using two different algorithms were statistically robust and were congruent with each other and with the relationships between the species previously proposed using other data. In contrast, the dendrograms derived from the adk data were noncogruent with each other, and with those from the recA data, and were statistically poorly supported. These results, along with the uniform distribution of pairwise sequence divergences between the species at adk, suggest there has been a history of interspecies recombination within the adk gene of the human Neisseria species which has obscured the phylogenetic relationships between the species. This view was supported by Sawyer's runs test, and the Index of Association (IA) between codons, which provided significant evidence for interspecies recombination between the adk genes from the human Neisseria species, but no evidence of interspecies recombination between the recA sequences.
TI  - A numerical phenotypic taxonomic study of the genus Neisseria.
AB  - A numerical phenotypic taxonomic study of 315 strains of Neisseria and some allied bacteria examined for 155 phenotypic tests showed 31 groups, most of which were reasonably distinct. These fell into four major areas. Areas A, B and C contained species of Neisseria, whereas area D contained the organisms known as 'false neisserias' together with Branhamella, Moraxella and Kingella species. Area A contained N. gonorrhoeae (which showed two subgroups), N. meningitidis (with two subgroups, and N. cinerea closely associated), N. polysaccharea, N. elongata subsp, glycolytica and N. lactamica. Area B contained mainly organisms from the human nasopharynx, and the nine groups were not very distinct: only three, N. mucosa, N. perflava and N. sicca could be recognized by the presence of type strains, and there was little relationship between taxonomic position and species epithets. Area C contained several groups from animals, N. animalis, N. canis and two phenons that may be justified as new species of Neisseria, one from lizards and the other from dental plaque of herbivores. Area C also contained N. elongata, N. subflava (with N. flavescens), type strain of Morococcus cerebrosis and the CDC groups M-5 (N. weaveri) and EF-4. Area D contained Branhamella catarrhalis, a combined group which consists of strains of the 'false neisserias' N. caviae and N. cuniculi, the 'false neisseria' N. ovis, and a group of Moraxella strains. A small group representing Kingella kingae is included in area D. Mean test error was 1.7%.
TI  - Detection of the tetM determinant in Neisseria gonorrhoeae using a non-radioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe.
AB  - Three oligonucleotide probes, complementary to tetM sequences, were labelled non-radiometrically using the DIG-oligonucleotide tailing kit and evaluated for their specificity for the detection of plasmid mediated tetracycline resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Only Probe 3, 5'-GCT CAA CAA TTC TGT TCC AGC-3', was specific for tetM. It hybridized with the tetM-containing 25.2-MDa plasmids from all of the 232 TRNG and the 130 PP/TRNG isolates used in the study. Its sensitivity, determined by dot-blot hybridization, was 0.1 pg of pJ13 plasmid DNA or 10(4) cells. It did not hybridize with the DNA from non-PPNG, CMRNG and tetracycline susceptible isolates from seven other Neisseria species (N. meningitidis, N. subflava, N. cinerea, N. lactamica, N. sicca, N. mucosa, and N. flavescens), Moraxella spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. Probe 3 also hybridized to DNA of three tetracycline resistant P. magnus (MIC = 16 micrograms ml-1) isolates which presumptively carried the tetM determinant. Therefore, probe 3 can be used by reference laboratories as a confirmatory test for TRNG, as well as isolates from other genera containing the tetM determinant.
TI  - Genetic diversity of the iron-binding protein (Fbp) gene of the pathogenic and commensal Neisseria.
AB  - The pathogenic Neisseria and most commensal Neisseria species produce an iron-binding protein (Fbp) when grown under iron-limited conditions. In the current study, we confirmed the presence of Fbp, as well as DNA sequences homologous to the gonococcal fbp, in strains of N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, N. cinerea, N. lactamica, N. subflava, N. kochii and N. polysaccharea. The fbp genes from these strains were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, digested with StuI or RsaI, and the restriction patterns examined. The patterns for the gonococcal and meningococcal fbp were virtually identical; however, variations were observed in the fbp sequences of the commensal Neisseria species. N. flavescens, N. mucosa, N. sicca, N. ovis and Branhamella catarrhalis, did not produce Fbp as detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reactivity with an Fbp specific monoclonal antibody, nor did they hybridize to an fbp-specific DNA probe.
TI  - Interspecies recombination between the penA genes of Neisseria meningitidis and commensal Neisseria species during the emergence of penicillin resistance in N. meningitidis: natural events and laboratory simulation.
AB  - The penicillin-binding protein 2 genes (penA) of penicillin-resistant Neisseria meningitidis have a mosaic structure that has arisen by the introduction of regions from the penA genes of Neisseria flavescens or Neisseria cinerea. Chromosomal DNA from both N. cinerea and N. flavescens could transform a penicillin-susceptible isolate of N. meningitidis to increased resistance to penicillin. With N. flavescens DNA, transformation to resistance was accompanied by the introduction of the N. flavescens penA gene, providing a laboratory demonstration of the interspecies recombinational events that we believe underlie the development of penicillin resistance in many meningococci in nature. Surprisingly, with N. cinerea DNA, the penicillin-resistant transformants did not obtain the N. cinerea penA gene. However, the region of the penA gene derived from N. cinerea in N. meningitidis K196 contained an extra codon (Asp-345A) which was not found in any of the four N. cinerea isolates that we examined and which is known to result in a decrease in the affinity of PBP 2 in gonococci.
TI  - Role of interspecies transfer of chromosomal genes in the evolution of penicillin resistance in pathogenic and commensal Neisseria species.
AB  - The two pathogenic species of Neisseria, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae, have evolved resistance to penicillin by alterations in chromosomal genes encoding the high molecular weight penicillin-binding proteins, or PBPs. The PBP 2 gene (penA) has been sequenced from over 20 Neisseria isolates, including susceptible and resistant strains of the two pathogenic species, and five human commensal species. The genes from penicillin-susceptible strains of N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae are very uniform, whereas those from penicillin-resistant strains consist of a mosaic of regions resembling those in susceptible strains of the same species, interspersed with regions resembling those in one, or in some cases, two of the commensal species. The mosaic structure is interpreted as having arisen from the horizontal transfer, by genetic transformation, of blocks of DNA, usually of a few hundred base pairs. The commensal species identified as donors in these interspecies recombinational events (N. flavescens and N. cinerea) are intrinsically more resistant to penicillin than typical isolates of the pathogenic species. Transformation has apparently provided N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae with a mechanism by which they can obtain increased resistance to penicillin by replacing their penA genes (or the relevant parts of them) with the penA genes of related species that fortuitously produce forms of PBP 2 that are less susceptible to inhibition by the antibiotic. The ends of the diverged blocks of DNA in the penA genes of different penicillin-resistant strains are located at the same position more often than would be the case if they represent independent crossovers at random points along the gene. Some of these common crossover points may represent common ancestry, but reasons are given for thinking that some may represent independent events occurring at recombinational hotspots.
TI  - Branhamella catarrhalis: significance in pulmonary infections and bacteriological features.
AB  - A three-month survey revealed 29 patients at our hospital with symptoms of acute  pulmonary infection, from whom Branhamella catarrhalis was isolated from lower respiratory tract specimens, in 18 cases in pure culture. Approximately 2% of all respiratory tract specimens examined during the period yielded growth of B. catarrhalis. All except one patient suffered from chronic pulmonary disease, notably chronic bronchitis. A phenotypic comparison was made between 55 strains of B. catarrhalis, of which 50 were recent isolates from lower respiratory tract specimens, and 23 Neisseria strains representing Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria cinerea, Neisseria flavescens, Neisseria mucosa, Neisseria pharyngis, and Neisseria lactamica. The morphology of B. catarrhalis colonies is very characteristic, and when the diagnosis is suspected, testing for the ability to hydrolyze tributyrin may confirm it within hours. Ability to produce deoxyribonuclease is another property which differentiates B. catarrhalis from the Neisseria species. Otherwise, the combination of nitrate reduction and failure to produce acid from glucose, maltose, and sucrose establishes the diagnosis.
TI  - The systematic serology of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: antigens associated with pathogenesis in Neisseria spp. from man.
AB  - Sonicates of eight Neisseria species from man were analysed in a micro-Ouchterlony double-diffusion absorption assay in comparison with a gonococcal reference antiserum-antigen system. Five major gonococcal precipitin zones were identified which comprised genus-, species- and type-specific components. One antigen was found in all strains of three species with pathogenic capability--N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis and N. flavescens. It was not detected in N. lactamica, N. pharyngis, N. elongata, N. cinerea or N. catarrhalis.
TI  - Conjugation of plasmids of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to other Neisseria species: potential reservoirs for the beta-lactamase plasmid.
AB  - The discovery that penicillinase production in Neisseria gonorrhoeae was plasmid  mediated and the spread of the beta-lactamase encoding plasmids in gonococcal isolates since 1976, raise the possibility that a nonpathogenic indigenous bacterium could serve as a reservoir for these plasmids. We initiated studies to define the ability of commensal Neisseria species and Branhamella catarrhalis strains, as well as strains of the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis, to serve as recipients in conjugation with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. We found that with N. gonorrhoeae as the donor, 3 of 5 Neisseria cinerea, 2 of 5 Neisseria flava, 0 of 1 Neisseria flavescens, 1 of 3 Neisseria subflava, 0 of 6 B. catarrhalis, 0 of 7 Neisseria lactamica, 1 of 5 Neisseria mucosa, 1 of 7 Neisseria perflava/sicca, and 0 of 13 N. meningitidis strains gave detectable conjugation frequencies (greater than 10(-8). N. cinerea was the only species found to maintain the gonococcal conjugal plasmid (pLE2451). A N. cinerea transconjugant containing pLE2451 was observed to transfer both the beta-lactamase plasmid and pLE2451 to N. gonorrhoeae at high frequency.
TI  - Cellular monosaccharide patterns of Neisseriaceae.
AB  - Sixty-four strains of Neisseria, Moraxella, and Acinetobacter were screened for cellular monosaccharides by gas-liquid chromatography and other chromatographic techniques. The four sugars ribose, glucose, glucosamine, and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (KDO) were detected in all strains. Heptose was detected only in "true neisseriae" (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, N. sicca, N. cinerea, N. flavescens, and N. elongata) and in the tentaively named species Moraxella urethralis. Some marked interspecies dissimilarities within groups were revealed. Thus, N. ovis and M. atlantae were characterized by the presence of mannose. Intraspecies differences were also encountered. N. meningitidis strains of serogroups B and C were distinguished from strains of serogroup A by their sialic acid content. This sugar was also detected in two out of three examined strains of M. nonliquefaciens. In Acinetobacter, heterogeneity of monosaccharide patterns was rather pronounced. The results show the applicability of gas chromatographic "monosaccharide" profiles fo whole cells or extracted carbohydrate in bacterial classification and identification, including differentiation at the subspecies level. In addition, such profiles may be useful for monitoring during purification of cellular polysaccharides.
TI  - Cellular and free lipopolysaccharides of some species of Neisseria.
AB  - Cultures of eight non-pathogenic species of Neisseria grown in simple defined media released lipopolysaccharide (free lipopolysaccharide) by a process distinct from cellular autolysis. Analyses of the pure cellular and free lipopolysaccharides obtained from six species of Neisseria revealed that they were remarkably similar and were devoid of detectable O-antigen side chains. Three distinct types of core-oligosaccharides were demonstrated. Type I core-oligosaccharide was a branched structure of alpha-D-glucopyranosyl units (7 mol) terminated by a reducing end group of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid. Type II core-oligosaccharide contained D-glucose, 2-deoxy-2-amino-D-glucose, L-rhamnose, L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid, phosphate, and ethanolamine in a molar ratio of 3:2:1:1:1:1:1. Type III coreoligosaccharide was composed of D-glucose, L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid, and phosphate in a molar ratio of 3:3:1:1. Lipopolysaccharides of N. caviae and N. sicca contained type I core-oligosaccharides exclusively, while those of N. flava and N. perflava contained only type II core-oligosaccharide. Cellular lipopolysaccharide from N. cinerea contained core-oligosaccharides of types I and II in a ratio of 27:73, while the analogous preparation from N. flavescens contained core-oligosaccharide types II and III in a ratio of 21:4. Free lipopolysaccharides from these two organisms contained only one type of coreoligosaccharide. Lipid A components of all the lipopolysaccharide preparations were very similar being composed of about 25% by weight of dodecanoic acid, 3-hydroxy-dodecanoic acid, and 3-hydroxy-tetradecanoic acid.
