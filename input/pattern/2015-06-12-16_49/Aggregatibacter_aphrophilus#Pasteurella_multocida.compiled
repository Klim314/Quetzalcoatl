TI  - Accurate identification of fastidious Gram-negative rods: integration of both conventional phenotypic methods and 16S rRNA gene analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate identification of fastidious Gram-negative rods (GNR) by conventional phenotypic characteristics is a challenge for diagnostic microbiology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of molecular methods, e.g., 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis for identification of fastidious GNR in the clinical microbiology laboratory. RESULTS: A total of 158 clinical isolates covering 20 genera and 50 species isolated from 1993 to 2010 were analyzed by comparing biochemical and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis based identification. 16S rRNA gene homology analysis identified 148/158 (94%) of the isolates to species level, 9/158 (5%) to genus and 1/158 (1%) to family level. Compared to 16S rRNA gene sequencing as reference method, phenotypic identification correctly identified 64/158 (40%) isolates to species level, mainly Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Pasteurella multocida, and 21/158 (13%) isolates correctly to genus level, notably Capnocytophaga sp.; 73/158 (47%) of the isolates were not identified or misidentified. CONCLUSIONS: We herein propose an efficient strategy for accurate identification of fastidious GNR in the clinical microbiology laboratory by integrating both conventional phenotypic methods and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. We conclude that 16S rRNA gene sequencing is an effective means for identification of fastidious GNR, which are not readily identified by conventional phenotypic methods.
TI  - Electron microscopy of phages in serotypes of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Actinobacillus ureae, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Pasteurella haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida strains were examined by transmission electron microscopy for the presence of bacteriophages. Phages were detected in serotype a (SUNY 75) and e (UOH 1705) and in the fresh clinical isolates UOH Q1243 and UOH Q1247 of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Phages were not found in serotype b, c and d strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans, in the fresh clinical isolate UOH Q1244 of this species or in old strains (including reference strains) of related species from the Actinobacillus-Haemophilus-Pasteurella group.
TI  - Multivariate chemosystematics demonstrate two groups of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains.
AB  - Chemical analysis by us has indicated that Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is not a homogeneous species. The present study used chemometric methods and a multitude of chemical characters to examine this further. Strains were characterized by cell sugar and fatty acid contents, lysis kinetics during EDTA and EDTA plus lysozyme exposure, methylene blue reduction, and API ZYM enzymatic assessment of whole cells and outer membrane vesicles/fragments. In total, 41 quantitative variables were analyzed from each of 9 strains and treated with principal component analysis and soft independent modeling of class analogy. These methods divided A. actinomycetemcomitans into 2 strain groups. One group contained ATCC 33384, ATCC 29522, FDC 2112 and FDC 2043; the other comprised ATCC 29524, ATCC 29523, FDC 2097, FDC 511 and FDC Y4. With an F-test, the groups (classes) of A. actinomycetemcomitans strains could be distinguished at 95% confidence limits. Both groups were distinct from members of the genera Haemophilus and Pasteurella (Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Haemophilus influenzae, Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella haemolytica).
