TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against campylobacter.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control campylobacter and salmonella in live poultry. this  finding is of relevance since campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. in the present work, lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the cecum of twenty tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against campylobacter were further characterized. following their preliminary confirmation as lab, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16s- 23s pcr, specific lactobacilli pcr, and a biphasic approach. most of the lab isolated belonged to the genus lactobacillus, among them lb. sakei (33.3%), lb. salivarius (19.4%), lb. reuteri (8.6%), and lb. curvatus (8.6%). the other lab strains included those of the genus weissella (16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and streptococcus sp. (2.7%). the lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against c. jejuni and c. coli. the activity of three of them, lb. salivarius smxd51, lb. salivarius mms122, and lb.  salivarius mms151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.

TI  == diversity of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. these species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.

TI  == characterisation of the microflora of attieke, a fermented cassava product, during traditional small-scale preparation.
AB  == attieke is a fermented cassava product consumed mainly in cote d'ivoire. the aim  of this study was to characterise the attieke fermentation by examining products  from 15 small-scale production sites at various stages of its preparation. for the preparation of attieke, fresh cassava is grated to a pulp and inoculated with 10% of a spontaneous traditional inoculum. the inocula contained aerobic mesophiles at mean numbers of 8.2 x 10(7) cfu/g and lactic and acetic acids at mean concentrations of 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. the mean ph was 5.0. lactic acid bacteria were the dominant microorganisms in cassava pulp throughout fermentation with the mean numbers being 1.2 x 10(9) cfu/g after 15 h. the identification to the species level of microorganisms from one representative attieke production of good quality showed that, at the start of fermentation, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides was present in the highest numbers, accounting for 20% of all lactic acid bacteria. as the fermentation proceeded, this species was replaced by homofermentative lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, present at 20% and 16%, respectively, and obligate heterofermentatives, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus confusus at 12% and 10%, respectively,  of total lactic acid bacteria in the flora at the end of fermentation. high numbers of acid-sensitive microorganisms, bacillus circulans, bacillus lentus, enterobacter sakazakii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, were transferred to the pulp in the inocula, but acidification to a mean ph of 4.4 with mean lactic and acetic acid concentrations of 0.59% and 0.2%, respectively, prevented their growth and reduced their numbers to less than 10(2) cfu/g at the end of fermentation. the mean numbers of candida tropicalis, the main yeast present, remained relatively constant at about 10(5) cfu/g throughout  attieke production. the mean numbers of aerobic mesophiles decreased to below 10(2) cfu/g as a result of the steaming process. the finished attieke had a mean  ph of 4.4 and mean lactic and acetic acid concentrations of 0.6% and 0.1%, respectively.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from aoc salers cheese.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. the characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: rep-pcr, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna for strain typing and taxonomic identification. the strains  belonged to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garviae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus millieri, streptococcus macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. a  wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. the natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined  to identify and characterize natural microflora. this study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and sb medium selective for enterococcus. the study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of salers cheese and its diversity. a better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.

TI  == analysis of genes encoding d-alanine:d-alanine ligase-related enzymes in leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus spp.
AB  == degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary to sequences encoding conserved amino acid (aa) motifs in d-alanine:d-alanine ligases (ddl) were used to amplify approx. 600-bp fragments from glycopeptide-resistant strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides (lm), lactobacillus plantarum, la. salivarius and la. confusus, and from a susceptible strain of la. leichmannii. comparison of the deduced aa sequences of the pcr products revealed that the ddl-related enzymes of resistant lm and lactobacillus spp. are more akin to each other (47-63% aa identity) than to that of susceptible la. leichmannii (33-37% aa identity), indicating that the ddl-related enzymes in these intrinsically resistant species  of gram+ bacteria exhibit structural differences with those in susceptible species. the ddl-related enzymes, vana and vanb, implicated in acquired resistance to glycopeptides in enterococci, were not closely related to their counterparts in lm and lactobacillus spp., as they displayed only 26-32% aa identity.

TI  == characterization and frequency distribution of species of lactic acid bacteria involved in the processing of mawe, a fermented maize dough from benin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria involved in the natural fermentation of both home-produced and commercial mawe were investigated during a 72 h fermentation period. lactobacillus spp. constitute the majority (94%) of the strains of the lactic acid bacteria isolated, among which 89% represent the betabacterium group. they include l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) (41%), l. fermentum or l. reuteri (19%), l. brevis (26%), l. confusus (less than 2%), l. curvatus (less than 1%) and l. buchneri (less than 1%). other isolated lactic acid bacteria were l. salivarius, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, pediococcus acidilactici and leuconostoc mesenteroides. several species were detected at the early stage of fermentation, but the final stage was dominated by l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) and l. fermentum or l. reuteri totalling 90% of the isolated strains. the trend was the same for both home-produced and commercial mawe. no strains of l. plantarum, generally reported as dominating lactic acid bacteria at the final stage of fermentation of most plant foods, were isolated.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of psychrotrophic lactic acid bacteria from prepacked meat and meat products.
AB  == ninety-four strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from refrigerated, prepacked meat and meat products were together with 59 reference strains of brochothrix, lactobacillus, leuconostoc, pediococcus and streptococcus phenotypically classified, using 96 unit characters. data were examined using simple matching (ssm) or jaccard coefficient (sj), and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. twenty-three clusters with two or more members were defined  at the 84% ssm-similarity level which corresponded to the sj-similarity level of  61%. based on ssm, most field strains were included in nine clusters, and with three unsignificant exceptions these contained no reference strains. the field clusters were designated carnobacterium piscicola (cluster 1; 5% of field isolates), carnobacterium divergens (cluster 2; 9% of field isolates), leuconostoc (cluster 9; 18% of field isolates) and lactobacillus (cluster 4, 10,  11, 12, 13 and 14; together 60% of field isolates). the lactobacillus clusters had many features in common with cluster ii of shaw & harding (1984). phenotypical characteristics of major clusters are given. the ssm and sj based classifications basically coincided for the field strains; the exception was cluster 4 which now were split in two parts. fourteen clusters were made up of mainly reference strains (ssm). most of them included more than one type strain on species level; exceptions were brochothrix thermosphacta (cluster 3), lactobacillus salivarius (cluster 17) and leuconostoc mesenteroides (cluster 18). several rearrangements were seen amongst the clusters of the reference strains when sj, instead of ssm, was used for clustering.

TI  == lactobacilli on plants.
AB  == the distribution, enumeration, and identification of lactobacilli on vegetable plants were studied in an area described geographically as being subtropical and  moist. the lactobacilli were obtained, by means of quantitative enrichment procedures in rogosa's sl broth, from 35.3% of all samples incubated at 32 c, and from 15.4% of the samples incubated at 45 c. less than 10 lactobacilli/g of plant material were enumerated in 54% of all positive samples. the lactobacilli were found much less frequently and in lower numbers than were streptococci or leuconostoc mesenteroides. the most frequently isolated lactobacillus was very simular to, but not identical with, lactobacillus fermenti. it was aerogenic, grew well at both 15 and 45 c, fermented arabinose, lactose, and sucrose, and liberated ammonia from arginine. of the identified species, l. plantarum, l. fermenti, and l. brevis were the most frequently isolated, whereas l. casei, l. viridescens, l. cellobiosus, l. salivarius, and l. buchneri were obtained from small numbers of samples. the widespread but sporadic distribution of lactobacilli in low numbers seems to indicate that these organisms do not normally thrive on plant surfaces. a ternary cycle, beginning with intestinal waste, followed by mechanical distribution to and among plants, and return to the host via the oral cavity, is suggested.
