TI  - Modelling Yersinia enterocolitica inactivation in coculture experiments with Lactobacillus sakei as based on pH and lactic acid profiles.
AB  - In food processing and preservation technology, models describing microbial proliferation in food products are a helpful tool to predict the microbial food safety and shelf life. In general, the available models consider microorganisms in pure culture. Thus, microbial interactions are ignored, which may lead to a discrepancy between model predictions and the actual microbial evolution, particularly for fermented and minimally processed food products in which a background flora is often present. In this study, the lactic acid mediated negative microbial interaction between the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus sakei and the psychrotrophic food pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica was examined. A model describing the lactic acid induced inhibition (i.e., early induction of the stationary phase) of the pathogen [Vereecken, K.M., Devlieghere, F., Bockstaele, A., Debevere, J., Van Impe, J.F., 2003. A model for lactic acid induced inhibition of Yersinia enterocolitica in mono- and coculture with Lactobacillus sakei. Food Microbiology 20, 701-713.] was extended to describe the subsequent inactivation (i.e., decrease of the cell concentration to values below the detection limit). In the development of a suitable model structure to describe the inactivation process, critical points in the variation of the specific evolution rate mu [1/h] with the dynamic (time-varying) pH and undissociated lactic acid profiles were taken into account. Thus, biological knowledge, namely, both pH and undissociated lactic acid have an influence on the microbial evolution, was incorporated. The extended model was carefully validated on new data. As a result, the newly developed model is able to accurately predict the growth, inhibition and subsequent inactivation of Y. enterocolitica in coculture as based on the dynamic pH and lactic acid profiles of the medium.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of peptides from the water-soluble extracts of Italian cheese varieties.
AB  - Water-soluble extracts of 9 Italian cheese varieties that differed mainly for type of cheese milk, starter, technology, and time of ripening were fractionated by reversed-phase fast protein liquid chromatography, and the antimicrobial activity of each fraction was first assayed toward Lactobacillus sakei A15 by well-diffusion assay. Active fractions were further analyzed by HPLC coupled to electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometry, and peptide sequences were identified by comparison with a proteomic database. Parmigiano Reggiano, Fossa, and Gorgonzola water-soluble extracts did not show antibacterial peptides. Fractions of Pecorino Romano, Canestrato Pugliese, Crescenza, and Caprino del Piemonte contained a mixture of peptides with a high degree of homology. Pasta filata cheeses (Caciocavallo and Mozzarella) also had antibacterial peptides. Peptides showed high levels of homology with N-terminal, C-terminal, or whole fragments of well known antimicrobial or multifunctional peptides reported in the literature: alphaS1-casokinin (e.g., sheep alphaS1-casein (CN) f22-30 of Pecorino Romano and cow alphaS1-CN f24-33 of Canestrato Pugliese); isracidin (e.g., sheep alphaS1-CN f10-21 of Pecorino Romano); kappacin and casoplatelin (e.g., cow kappa-CN f106-115 of Canestrato Pugliese and Crescenza); and beta-casomorphin-11 (e.g., goat beta-CN f60-68 of Caprino del Piemonte). As shown by the broth microdilution technique, most of the water-soluble fractions had a large spectrum of inhibition (minimal inhibitory concentration of 20 to 200 microg/mL) toward gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species, including potentially pathogenic bacteria of clinical interest. Cheeses manufactured from different types of cheese milk (cow, sheep, and goat) have the potential to generate similar peptides with antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Predicting inhibition and inactivation of Yersinia enterocolitica through lactic  acid production by Lactobacillus sakei.
AB  - In food technology, there is a need for models taking into account the interactions between microorganisms, in order to correctly predict the safety and shelf life of food products. When leaving these interactions out of consideration, a discrepancy between the model prediction and the actual microbial evolution may occur for certain types of food products. In this study, a model describing the inhibition of the pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica in mono- and coculture with Lactobacillus sakei was extended to describe also the subsequent inactivation of Y. enterocolitica. During the development of a suitable model structure to describe the inactivation process, biological knowledge about this process was incorporated. The extended model was able to predict evolution of Y. enterocolitica in coculture as well as in monoculture.
TI  - Protective cultures inhibit growth of Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in cooked, sliced, vacuum- and gas-packaged meat.
AB  - Contamination of cooked meat products with Listeria monocytogenes poses a constant threat to the meat industry. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the use of indigenous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as protective cultures in cooked meat products. Cooked, sliced, vacuum- or gas-packaged ham and servelat sausage from nine meat factories in Norway were inoculated with 10(3) cfu/g of a mixture of three rifampicin resistant (rif-mutant) strains of L. monocytogenes and stored at 8 degrees C for four weeks. Growth of L. monocytogenes and indigenous lactic acid flora was followed throughout the storage period. LAB were isolated from samples where L. monocytogenes failed to grow. Five different strains growing well at 3 degrees C. pH 6.2, with 3% NaCl, and producing moderate amounts of acid were selected for challenge experiments with the rif-resistant strains of L. monocytogenes. a nalidixic acid/streptomycin sulphate-resistant strain of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and a mixture of three rif-resistant strains of Yersinia enterocolitica O:3. All five LAB strains inhibited growth of both L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7. No inhibition of Y. enterocolitica O:3 was observed. A professional taste panel evaluated cooked, sliced, vacuum-packaged ham inoculated with each of the five test strains after storage for 21 days at 8 degrees C. All samples had acceptable sensory properties. The five LAB strains hybridised to a 23S rRNA oligonucleotide probe specific for Lactobacillus sakei. These indigenous LAB may be used as protective cultures to inhibit growth of L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7 in cooked meat products.
