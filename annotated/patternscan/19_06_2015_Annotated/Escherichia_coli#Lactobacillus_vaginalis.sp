TI  == the significance of lactobacillus crispatus and l. vaginalis for vaginal health and the negative effect of recent sex: a cross-sectional descriptive study across groups of african women.
AB  == background: women in sub-saharan africa are vulnerable to acquiring hiv infection and reproductive tract infections. bacterial vaginosis (bv), a disruption of the  vaginal microbiota, has been shown to be strongly associated with hiv infection.  risk factors related to potentially protective or harmful microbiota species are  not known. methods: we present cross-sectional quantitative polymerase chain reaction data of the lactobacillus genus, five lactobacillus species, and three bv-related bacteria (gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, and prevotella bivia) together with escherichia coli and candida albicans in 426 african women across different groups at risk for hiv. we selected a reference group of adult hiv-negative women at average risk for hiv acquisition and compared species variations in subgroups of adolescents, hiv-negative pregnant women, women engaging in traditional vaginal practices, sex workers and a group of hiv-positive women on combination antiretroviral therapy. we explored the associations between presence and quantity of the bacteria with bv by nugent score, in relation to several factors of known or theoretical importance. results: the presence of species across kenyan, south african and rwandan women was remarkably similar and few differences were seen between the two groups of reference women in kenya and south africa. the rwandan sex workers and hiv-positive women had the highest g. vaginalis presence (p = 0.006). pregnant women had a higher lactobacillus genus mean log (7.01 genome equivalents (geq)/ml) compared to the reference women (6.08 geq/ml). l. vaginalis (43%) was second to l. iners (81.9%) highly present in women with a normal nugent score. recent sexual exposure negatively affected the presence of l. crispatus (<0.001), l. vaginalis (p = 0.001), and lactobacillus genus (p < 0.001). having more than one sexual partner in the last three months was associated with an increased prevalence of g. vaginalis (p = 0.044) and l. iners (p = 0.001). conclusions: although the composition of species across the studied african countries was similar, the presence of protective species i.e. l. crispatus and l. vaginalis in women with a normal nugent score appeared lower compared to non-african studies.  furthermore, lactobacillus species were negatively affected by sexual behavioural. strategies to support protective lactobacillus species are urgently  needed. trial registration: the study is registered at the trial registration at  the national health research ethics council south africa with the number doh2709103223.

TI  == effectiveness of the two microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 and lactobacillus plantarum lp01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium gardnerella vaginalis. bv is not  accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. in contrast, aerobic vaginitis (av) is predominantly associated  with escherichia coli, but streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus are also involved. standard treatment of bv consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. the main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and  recurrences. this study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected  lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize g. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit e. coli, thus identifying a possible use in av. the second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by  bv using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. materials and  methods: for this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to  hinder the growth of g. vaginalis american type culture collection 10231. the bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with lactobacillus plantarum lp01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with bv. the 2 microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 (dsm 26955) and l. plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. the amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. the women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive  nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. a clinical examination was performed and the nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). a statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and  d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. results: l. fermentum  lf15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards g. vaginalis american type culture collection (atcc) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. in the  human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely l. fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01, significantly reduced the nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, p<0.001). eight women (33.3%) recorded a nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. at the  end of the second month, only 4 women registered a nugent score >7, definable as  bv (16.7%, p=0.065 compared with d28). in the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. conclusions: bv, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. furthermore, bv is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. this study suggests the ability of the 2 strains l.  fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01 to counteract acute gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. this could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against gardnerella on  the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. in the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against e. coli, their prospective use in av could also prove interesting.

TI  == lactobacillus crispatus dominant vaginal microbiome is associated with inhibitory activity of female genital tract secretions against escherichia coli.
AB  == objective: female genital tract secretions inhibit e. coli ex vivo and the activity may prevent colonization and provide a biomarker of a healthy microbiome. we hypothesized that high e. coli inhibitory activity would be associated with a lactobacillus crispatus and/or jensenii dominant microbiome and differ from that of women with low inhibitory activity. study design: vaginal swab cell pellets from 20 samples previously obtained in a cross-sectional study  of near-term pregnant and non-pregnant healthy women were selected based on having high (>90% inhibition) or low (<20% inhibition) anti-e. coli activity. the v6 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene was amplified and sequenced using the illumina hiseq 2000 platform. filtered culture supernatants from lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, and gardnerella vaginalis were also assayed for e. coli inhibitory activity. results: sixteen samples (10 with high and 6 with low activity) yielded evaluable microbiome data. there was no difference in the predominant microbiome species in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women (n = 8  each). however, there were significant differences between women with high compared to low e. coli inhibitory activity. high activity was associated with a  predominance of l. crispatus (p<0.007) and culture supernatants from l. crispatus exhibited greater e. coli inhibitory activity compared to supernatants obtained from l. iners or g. vaginalis. notably, the e. coli inhibitory activity varied among different strains of l. crispatus. conclusion: microbiome communities with  abundant l. crispatus likely contribute to the e. coli inhibitory activity of vaginal secretions and efforts to promote this environment may prevent e. coli colonization and related sequelae including preterm birth.

TI  == identification of vaginal lactobacilli with potential probiotic properties isolated from women in north lebanon.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the diversity of vaginal lactobacilli in lebanese women and to evaluate the antagonism, hydrophobicity, and safety characteristics of these strains. this study was performed on samples from 135 women who visited a gynecology clinic in the north of lebanon, between september  2012 and january 2013. from these samples, 53 different isolates of vaginal lactobacilli were collected from vaginal swabs and identified using biochemical and molecular methods. the use of genotypic rep-pcr fingerprinting allowed for the organization of these isolates into 23 different groups. seven of the isolated lactobacilli were antagonistic against the following vaginal pathogens:  gardnerella vaginalis cip7074t, staphylococcus aureus atcc33862, escherichia coli cip103982, and candida albicans atcc10231. the antagonistic lactobacilli strains  were then identified using 16s rdna sequence. the data of this study show that the antagonistic lactobacilli were non-hemolytic, sensitive to most antibiotic tests, free of plasmid dna, and exhibited interesting hydrophobicity and autoaggregation properties positioning them as potential candidates for probiotic design.

TI  == adherence of bacteria to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract of heifers and cows.
AB  == in the present study, we examined the adherence of indigenous vaginal bacteria, probiotic strains, and metritis pathogens to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tracts of heifers and cows and compared their adherence with  the bacterial adherence to mucus collected from the stomach and large intestine of pigs. most of the vaginal strains adhered to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract and strongly adhered to gastric mucus, with the exception of lactobacillus buchneri 24s8. only lactobacillus mucosae 29s8, enterococcus faecium e21, and e. faecium eac adhered to colonic mucus. probiotic  strains adhered strongly to mucus collected from the reproductive tract and gastric mucus but did not adhere to colonic mucus. pathogenic strains were adherent to vaginal, uterine horn, and gastric mucus, except escherichia coli o8:k88ab:h9 (65), fusobacterium necrophorum, and gardnerella vaginalis, which adhered to uterine cervix mucus. only kocuria kristinae and g. vaginalis adhered  to uterine body mucus; e. coli o149:k88ac (ec) adhered to colonic mucus. the strains did not exhibit host specificity but rather strain specificity. the ability to adhere to mucus was a characteristic unique to each strain. to our knowledge, this is the first report regarding in vitro adherence of gras (generally regarded as safe) lactobacilli isolated from different sources to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract.

TI  == in vitro probiotic properties of lactobacillus fermentum sk5 isolated from vagina of a healthy woman.
AB  == a lactobacillus strain isolated from a vaginal tract of a healthy woman was examined in vitro for its probiotic potential. this strain, identified as lactobacillus fermentum sk5, was able to survive at ph 3-4 and 0.1-0.2% bile, and unaffected by pepsin (3 g l(-1)) and pancreatin (1 g l(-1)), but was susceptible  to all tested antibiotics except metronidazole. l. fermentum sk5 had an antimicrobial potential against gastrointestinal pathogenic escherichia coli and  vaginal pathogenic gardnerella vaginalis. the effective substance was suspected to be a bacteriocin-like compound with a molecular weight of more than 10 kda, but hydrogen peroxide was also detected. further studies revealed that l. fermentum sk5 had good autoaggregation characteristic and a high surface hydrophobicity that enhanced its adhesion ability to epithelial cells and for biofilm formation. this lactobacillus showed coaggregation with e. coli and g. vaginalis to affect their adhesion and colonization. the adhesion of l. fermentum sk5 to hela, ht-29 and caco-2 cells and its inhibition of e. coli and g. vaginalis adherence to these cells were demonstrated. these incidences provided evidence of the possible colonization of l. fermentum sk5 that would prevent binding and growth of e. coli and g. vaginalis onto intestinal and vaginal epithelial cells. on the basis of the ability of l. fermentum sk5 to inhibit pathogenic microorganisms through coaggregation and antimicrobial substances, it  is likely that this lactobacillus strain could be a potential probiotic candidate for beneficial use in protecting against gastrointestinal and vaginal microbial infections.

TI  == pregnancy-induced changes in immune protection of the genital tract: defining normal.
AB  == objective: both the state of pregnancy as well as disruption of vaginal flora and immune mediators may increase the risk of human immunodeficiency virus-1 acquisition. the objective of this study was to define immune changes in lower genital and systemic immunity associated with normal pregnancy. study design: this prospective cohort enrolled low-risk pregnant and nonpregnant women ages 18-35 years. pregnant women at <14 weeks and nonpregnant women in follicular phase of the menstrual cycle were included. cervical and vaginal fluid was collected. concentrations of immune mediators were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based methods or multiplex immunoassay. samples were inoculated onto various culture media allowing for growth of lactobacillus species, gardnerella vaginalis, escherichia coli, enterococcus species, anaerobic gram-negative rods, candida, staphylococcus aureus, ureaplasma species, and mycoplasma hominis. concentrations of immune mediators and vaginal colonization frequencies were compared between the pregnant and nonpregnant groups. results: genital tract concentration of interleukin-1beta was higher during pregnancy compared to nonpregnant participants. serum c-reactive protein concentrations were higher in all trimesters of pregnancy. concentrations of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor did not differ between groups. lactobacillus was more commonly isolated from vaginal cultures of nonpregnant participants (100% vs 70.2%, p = .02). identification of candida, g vaginalis, m hominis, and s aureus was common  and not different between groups. ureaplasma species was isolated from >60% pregnant participants. conclusion: the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1beta, as well as the systemic marker of inflammation, c-reactive protein, are increased during pregnancy. the impact of these proinflammatory changes during pregnancy deserves further study.

TI  == the microbiota of the human genitourinary tract: trying to see the forest through the trees.
AB  == based on traditional microbiological methods, namely cultivation and microscopic  analyses, the vaginal microbiota (vmb) has been defined as healthy when it is predominated by hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus spp., most prominently  lactobacillis crispatus. similarly, the vmb has been defined as bacterial vaginosis (bv) when it is predominated by gardnerella vaginalis as well as a number of other anaerobic bacterial species. bv is associated with a distinct vaginal discharge syndrome, poor pregnancy outcomes, pelvic inflammatory disease, post-operative wound infections, and endometritis after elective abortions. additionally, bv predisposes women to infection by hiv as well as other sexually  transmitted diseases (stds). the application of molecular techniques over the last decade to studies of the vmb has significantly advanced our understanding of its structure and variation. it is now clear that the diversity of the vmb is far more complex than previously recognized; it is comprised of many heretofore unknown bacteria in addition to those previously identified by culture. here we describe the application of 454 pyrosequencing technology to a study of vaginal specimens from 92 women attending the new orleans std clinic in an effort to obtain a more precise view of how different types of "trees" (bacteria) assemble  to form a recognizable "forest" (vmb). this knowledge will be useful in the design of future clinical studies that investigate the mechanisms by which the vaginal microbiome influences human health and disease.

TI  == disruption of urogenital biofilms by lactobacilli.
AB  == the process that changes a relatively sparse vaginal microbiota of healthy women  into a dense biofilm of pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria is poorly  understood. likewise, the reverse step whereby an aberrant biofilm is displaced and returns to a healthy lactobacilli dominated microbiota is unclear. in order to study these phenomena, in vitro experiments were performed to examine the structure of biofilms associated with aerobic vaginosis, urinary tract infections, and bacterial vaginosis (bv). uropathogenic escherichia coli were able to form relatively thin biofilms within five days (6 mum height), while atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis formed thicker biofilms 12 mum in height within two days. challenge of e. coli biofilms with lactobacilli did not result in pathogen displacement. however, the resulting thicker lactobacilli infused biofilms, caused significant e. coli killing. e. coli biofilms challenged with secreted products of l. rhamnosus gr-1 caused a marked decrease in cell density, and increased cell death. similarly challenge of bv biofilms with lactobacilli infiltrated bv biofilms and caused bacterial cell death. metronidazole produced holes in the biofilm but did not eradicate the organisms.  the findings provide some evidence of how lactobacilli probiotics might interfere with an aberrant vaginal microbiota, and strengthen the position that combining probiotics with antimicrobials could better eradicate pathogenic biofilms.

TI  == individual and co-operative roles of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the killing activity of enteric strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 against enteric, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated pathogens.
AB  == the mechanism underlying the killing activity of lactobacillus strains against bacterial pathogens appears to be multifactorial. here, we investigate the respective contributions of hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid in killing bacterial pathogens associated with the human vagina, urinary tract or intestine  by two hydrogen peroxide-producing strains. in co-culture, the human intestinal strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and human vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 strains killed enteric salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344, vaginal gardnerella vaginalis dsm 4944 and urinary tract escherichia coli cft073 pathogens. the cell-free culture supernatants (cfcss) produced the same reduction in sl1344, dsm 4944 and cft073 viability, whereas isolated bacteria had no effect. the killing activity of cfcss was heat-stable. in the presence of dulbecco's modified eagle's minimum essential medium inhibiting the lactic acid-dependent killing activity, cfcss were less effective at killing of the pathogens. catalase-treated cfcss displayed a strong decreased activity. tested alone, hydrogen peroxide triggered a concentration-dependent killing activity against all three pathogens. lactic acid alone developed a killing activity only  at concentrations higher than that present in cfcss. in the presence of lactic acid at a concentration present in lactobacillus cfcss, hydrogen peroxide displayed enhanced killing activity. collectively, these results demonstrate that for hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus strains, the main metabolites of lactobacillus, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, act co-operatively to kill enteric, vaginosis-associated and uropathogenic pathogens.

TI  == quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in port-a-cul and copan transport systems.
AB  == transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. in this study, the port-a-cul transport system and the copan  transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and  anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. combination i contained candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, lactobacillus crispatus, and staphylococcus aureus. combination ii  contained lactobacillus iners, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, mobiluncus curtisii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis. duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees c. both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees c than at 24 degrees c. prevotella bivia and prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. however, at 24 degrees c, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in copan transport  medium than when they were stored in port-a-cul transport medium for 96 h (p < 0.002). some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees c for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group b streptococci and candida albicans, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. organisms in copan medium than in port-a-cul medium was observed (p < 0.002). at room temperature, the port-a-cul system is superior to the copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == selection and identification of anaerobic lactobacilli producing inhibitory compounds against vaginal pathogens.
AB  == two strains of lactobacillus crispatus (15l08 and 21l07) and one strain of lactobacillus jensenii (5l08) were selected from amongst 100 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant to mucosal colonization and the production of h2o2 and/or bacteriocin-like compound. all three strains self-aggregated and adhered to vaginal epithelial cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as gardnerella vaginalis and candida albicans. lactobacillus crispatus 15l08 was characterized as a potential h2o2 producer. a high level of bacteriocin-like compound was synthesized by l. jensenii 5l08, with a bactericidal mode of action for g. vaginalis, c. albicans and escherichia coli. however, h2o2-dependent activity alone was not sufficient to inhibit the growth of c. albicans. simultaneous actions of h2o2 and bacteriocin-like compound produced by lactobacilli may be important for antagonizing pathogenic bacteria. these strains of lactobacilli may be excellent candidates for eventual use as probiotics to restore the normal microbial communities in the vaginal ecosystem.

TI  == prebiotic effects of oligosaccharides on selected vaginal lactobacilli and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select endogenous human vaginal lactobacilli strains on the basis of the main probiotic properties observed in the vaginal environment in order to use them for the evaluation of the potential prebiotic properties of oligosaccharides. from vaginal samples of 50 women with a normal flora, 17 lactobacilli strains were first isolated because of their high level of hydrogen peroxide production. then six strains were selected mainly for their ability (i) to adhere to vaginal cells, (ii) to produce compounds in sufficient amount, such as lactic acid, having an inhibitory action on pathogens, and less importantly, (iii) to demonstrate arginine deiminase activity. these six strains  were found to belong to three distinct species: lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii and l. vaginalis. one strain of each species was chosen as a potential vaginal probiotic strain with regard to our criteria. these three strains were then used to evaluate the prebiotic properties of different oligosaccharide series: two fructooligosaccharide series (fos actilight and fos raftilose) and two glucooligosaccharide series varying by their osidic linkages (alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos and alpha-1,2/alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos). the test was based on the ability of the oligosaccharides to promote the growth of the three beneficial strains selected but not of pathogenic microorganisms often encountered in urogenital infections such as candida albicans, escherichia coli and gardnerella vaginalis. oligosaccharide hydrolysis was followed by hplc analysis. this revealed that two oligosaccharide series (fos actilight dp3 and all alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos dp > or = 4) were used only by the lactobacilli strains, the pathogenic microorganisms being unable to metabolise them. the selected lactobacilli and oligosaccharides are good candidates for incorporation  in a formula to prevent vaginal infections.

TI  == a cluster analysis of bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora and pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  == controversy surrounds the association between bacterial vaginosis (bv) and pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). women (n = 1,140) were ascertained at five us centers, enrolled (1999-2001), and followed up for a median of 3 years. serial vaginal swabs were obtained for gram's stain and cultures. pid was defined as 1)  histologic endometritis or 2) pelvic pain and tenderness plus oral temperature >38.8 degrees c, leukorrhea or mucopus, erythrocyte sedimentation rate >15 mm/hour, white blood cell count >10,000, or gonococcal/chlamydial lower genital infection. exploratory factor analysis identified two discrete clusters of genital microorganisms. the first correlated with bv by gram's stain and consisted of the absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus, gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, anaerobic gram-negative rods, and, to  a lesser degree, ureaplasma urealyticum. the second, unrelated to bv by gram's stain, consisted of enterococcus species and escherichia coli. being in the highest tertile in terms of growth of bv-associated microorganisms increased pid  risk (adjusted rate ratio = 2.03, 95% confidence interval: 1.16, 3.53). carriage  of non-bv-associated microorganisms did not increase pid risk. women with heavy growth of bv-associated microorganisms and a new sexual partner appeared to be at particularly high risk (adjusted rate ratio = 8.77, 95% confidence interval: 1.11, 69.2). when identified by microbial culture, a combination of bv-related microorganisms significantly elevated the risk of acquiring pid.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

AB  == objective: we examined the antimicrobial activity and composition of vaginal fluid. study design: vaginal fluid from preweighed tampons was assayed for ph, lactic acid, and antimicrobial polypeptides. the fluid was also fractionated by molecular filtration. antimicrobial activity of whole fluid was determined against representative resident and exogenous microbes, and its fractions were tested against escherichia coli. results: vaginal fluids (5/5 donors) were permissive for lactobacillus crispatus and vaginalis and candida albicans, but not for escherichia coli, streptococcus group b, and lactobacillus jensenii in three of five donors. the antimicrobial activity against e coli was predominantly in a <3-kd fraction and correlated with both low ph and high lactic acid content. compared with a matched ph buffer, lactic acid markedly suppressed the growth of  e coli. concentrated 2- or 5-fold, the protein-rich fraction was active against e coli. conclusion: vaginal fluid exerts selective antimicrobial activity against nonresident bacterial species. the activity is mediated by lactic acid, low ph, and antimicrobial polypeptides.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic effect of lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: to assess antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. study design: antagonistic activity of different lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for  infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. the activity was tested against test organisms associated with  bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella bivia. results: many of the 146 lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as s aureus and  e coli, and a marked number of lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes p anaerobius and p bivia. only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of e faecalis and s agalactiae. indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. the specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. conclusion: lactobacillus strains taken  from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. the specific occurrence rates of active lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.

TI  == clarithromycin-induced alterations in vaginal flora.
AB  == many antibiotics have been shown to alter both the bacterial and the fungal flora of the vagina, in some cases potentially increasing a woman's propensity toward urinary tract infections and vaginal candidiasis. the effects of some of the newer macrolide antibiotics on women's vaginal flora have not been previously studied, and almost none of the previous studies specifically cultured for effects on vaginal lactobacillus. young women (ages 18-45 years) who were about to go onto therapy with clarithromycin, who did not have any conditions known to  affect the vaginal flora (eg, diabetes mellitus, spermicide use, menopausal status without hormone replacement therapy), and who agreed to participate in the study were cultured with aerobic and anaerobic and fungal vaginal cultures before starting the antibiotic. these same women were then retested about 4 to 6 weeks after the start of their antibiotic course, and the results of their preantibiotic and postantibiotic cultures were compared. lactobacillus was present in 33% of patients by vaginal culture before treatment, but this decreased to 0% after treatment. escherichia coli was present in only 8% of patients before treatment, but this increased to 17% of patients after treatment. enterococcus was present in 25% of patients before treatment but in only 8% of patients after treatment. the incidence of gardnerella vaginalis was not affected by the treatment. candida species incidence increased from 17% to 33% with treatment. the overall effects of clarithromycin on the vaginal flora are similar to other older antibiotics that have been tested.

TI  == detection of cervical immunoglobulin a in normal pregnancy.
AB  == the aim of our study was to evaluate a feasible method to quantify the immunoglobulin a concentration in the cervical mucus of women with a normal singleton pregnancy. in 60 immunologic healthy pregnant women cervical mucus samples were taken at a random time in pregnancy using an absorbing cylindrical cotton-swab stick. in this cervical mucus immunoglobulin a concentration was measured by radial immunodiffusion. a vaginal bacterial swab was taken from each  woman. concentration of immunoglobulins in maternal serum was estimated. there was no statistically significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin a concentration between the investigated groups (p = 0.952): 18-24 gestational weeks (gw): 52.8 (6.6-258.4) mg/l; 25-29 gw: 89.3 (4.8-193.8) mg/l; 30-34 gw: 55  (1.4-326) mg/l; 35-40 gw: 59.2 (4-400.9) mg/l. women with a normal vaginal flora  showed a significantly higher cervical immunoglobulin a concentration than those  with a pathological colonization: 92.2 (6.6-400.9) mg/l vs. 42.5 (1.4-326) mg/l (p < 0.05). the serum levels of immunoglobulins a, a1, a2, m and g do not correlate to cervical immunoglobulin a levels nor to gestational age. in normal pregnancy, cervical immunoglobulin a concentration does not change with advancing gestational age, but a pathological vaginal colonization seems to be associated with decreased immunoglobulin a levels.

TI  == is there a protective role for vaginal flora?
AB  == the notion of a protective vaginal flora is relatively new. resident flora manifest colonization resistance to prevent or reduce the likelihood of exogenous microorganisms, viruses, bacteria, yeast, or parasites becoming established in the lower genital tract of women following sexual (hiv, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, candida albicans, trichomonas vaginalis) or nonsexual (uropathogenic e. coli) transmission. the concept of preserving or reestablishing protective flora has been hastened by several factors, including the potential widespread use of vaginal microbicides, the increased heterosexual spread of hiv, and the imminent availability of exogenous lactobacillus species probiotic therapy.

TI  == pathogenesis of abnormal vaginal bacterial flora.
AB  == objective: this study was undertaken to determine the relationships between microscopy findings on wet mounts, such as lactobacillary grade or vaginal leukocytosis, and results of vaginal culture, lactate and succinate content of the vagina, and levels of selected cytokines. study design: in a population of 631 unselected women seeking treatment at an obstetrics and gynecology outpatient clinic, vaginal fluid was obtained by wooden ayre spatula for wet mounting and ph measurement, by high vaginal swab for culture, and by standardized vaginal rinsing with 2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution for measurements of lactate, succinate, interleukin 1beta, interleukin 8, leukemia inhibitory factor, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentrations. lactate and succinate levels were measured by gas-liquid chromatography and the cytokine concentrations were measured by specific immunoassays. both univariate analysis (student t test, welch test, chi(2) test, and fisher exact test) and multivariate regression analysis (cox analysis) were used. results: increasing disturbance of the lactobacillary flora (lactobacillary grades i, iia, iib, and iii) was highly correlated with the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, trichomonas vaginalis, enterococci, group b streptococci, and escherichia coli. vaginal ph and interleukin 8 and interleukin 1beta concentrations increased linearly with increasing lactobacillary grade, whereas lactate concentrations and the presence  of epithelial cell lysis decreased. a similar pattern of associations with increasing leukocyte count was clear, but in addition there was an increase in leukemia inhibitory factor concentration. multivariate analysis of vaginal leukocytosis, lactobacillary grades, and the presence of positive vaginal culture results showed that interleukin 1beta concentration was most closely related to the lactobacillary grade, leukemia inhibitory factor concentration was most closely related to the lactobacillary grade and positive culture results, interleukin 8 concentration was most closely related to positive culture results, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentration was most closely related to vaginal leukocytosis and positive culture results. the concentration ratio of interleukin 1beta to interleukin 1 receptor antagonist remained stable, except when vaginal leukocytosis increased. in its most severe form, with >10 leukocytes per epithelial cell present, a decompensation of the vaginal flora with a collapse in interleukin 1beta and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentrations was seen, but there was a concurrent sharp increase in leukemia inhibitory factor concentration. this pattern was completely different from the course of the cytokine concentrations associated with a lactobacillary grade increase. conclusion: both disturbed lactobacillary grade and the presence of increasing vaginal leukocytosis were correlated with lactobacillary substrate (lactate) concentration, ph, and the concentrations of a variety of cytokines. there was a remarkably linear increase in these cytokines as either leukocytosis  or lactobacillary grade became more severe. in circumstances in which leukocytosis was extreme, however, interleukin 1beta was no longer produced but leukemia inhibitory factor concentrations increased. we speculate that in extreme inflammation the body tries to limit the damage that can be done by exaggerated cytokine production.

TI  == the effects of three nonoxynol-9 preparations on vaginal flora and epithelium.
AB  == to evaluate the effects of nonoxynol-9 (n-9) on the vaginal flora and epithelium, 48 women (16 in each group) were evaluated by use of quantitative vaginal cultures and colposcopy. at baseline and at 0.5, 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after insertion of one of three n-9 preparations (4% gel [conceptrol], 3.5% gel [advantage-24], or a 28% vaginal contraceptive film). the proportion positive for h2o2+ or h2o2- lactobacilli did not change significantly with any of the preparations, but lactobacilli concentrations decreased transiently. both the proportion of women with gardnerella vaginalis and the concentration of g. vaginalis decreased transiently. the proportion of women with escherichia coli increased with the 4% gel, and the concentration increased with all preparations. the number with anaerobic gram-negative rods increased, although the concentrations decreased. symptoms and colposcopic abnormalities were rare. changes in levels of vaginal bacteria were transient after single applications of n-9, but adverse effects may be enhanced with frequent, chronic use.

TI  == adherence of human vaginal lactobacilli to vaginal epithelial cells and interaction with uropathogens.
AB  == three strains of lactobacillus, identified as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus jensenii, were selected from among 70 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant  to mucosal colonization or antagonism. all three self-aggregated and adhered to epithelial vaginal cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as g. vaginalis, and inhibiting the growth in vitro of escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae. the surface components involved in self-aggregation appeared to be proteins for l. gasseri and lipoproteins for l. acidophilus and l. jensenii, as judged by susceptibility to treatment with appropriate degrading enzymes. the factors responsible for adherence to epithelial vaginal cells seemed to be glycoproteins (l. acidophilus and l. gasseri) and carbohydrate (l. jensenii). the receptors of the vaginal cells were glycolipids, which presumably  were the targets of the competition observed between the lactobacilli and the pathogenic microbes.

TI  == the relationship of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli to bacterial vaginosis and genital microflora in pregnant women.
AB  == lactobacilli provide an important microbial defense against genital colonization  by pathogens. the role of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) in the control of genital microflora was explored in a cross-sectional study of 275 women in the second trimester of pregnancy. vaginal cultures were obtained for detection of h2o2-positive and h2o2-negative lactobacilli and other members of the genital microflora. compared with women with h2o2-negative lactobacilli, women colonized  by h2o2-positive lactobacilli were less likely to have bacterial vaginosis, symptomatic candidiasis, and vaginal colonization by gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and  viridans streptococci (p less than or equal to .05 for each comparison). in addition to the above organisms, women without vaginal lactobacilli were more likely than those women with h2o2-positive lactobacilli to have chlamydia trachomatis, and less likely to be colonized by enterococcus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (p less than .05 for each comparison). vaginal colonization by group b streptococci or escherichia coli was not related to the presence of h2o2-positive lactobacilli. these data suggest that the presence of h2o2-positive lactobacilli in the vagina is inversely correlated with infection by some genital pathogens in pregnant women.

TI  == nonoxynol-9: differential antibacterial activity and enhancement of bacterial adherence to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == the antibacterial activity and adherence-enhancing effects of nonoxynol-9 were evaluated against vaginal and uropathogenic bacteria. nonoxynol-9 was markedly less active against the 43 uropathogenic bacterial and yeast strains tested (mic90, greater than 32%) than against the 26 gardnerella vaginalis strains (mic90, less than or equal to 0.015%) and the 53 lactobacillus strains (mic90, 8%) tested. hydrogen peroxide-producing strains of lactobacillus were more susceptible to nonoxynol-9 (mic90, 4%) than nonproducers (mic90, 16%). two escherichia coli strains that expressed type 1 fimbriae and three vaginal strains of lactobacilli adhered in significantly higher numbers to vaginal epithelial cells preincubated with 5% nonoxynol-9 than to control cells preincubated with pbs. spermicides may provide a selective advantage in colonizing the vagina with  nonoxynol-9-resistant uropathogens such as e. coli, perhaps via a reduction in vaginal lactobacilli (especially hydrogen peroxide-producing strains) and through enhancement of adherence of e. coli to epithelial cells.

TI  == vaginal bacteroides species are associated with an increased rate of preterm delivery among women in preterm labor.
AB  == the relationship of high concentrations of vaginal microorganisms with an increased rate of preterm delivery (less than or equal to 34 weeks) among women in preterm labor was evaluated. quantitative vaginal cultures were obtained from  211 women in preterm labor between gestational ages of 22 and 34 completed weeks. preterm delivery occurred in 139 (66%). the rate of preterm delivery was determined by cox proportional hazards models. women with greater than 10(7) cfu/ml of vaginal fluid of facultative lactobacilli had a 40% decreased rate of preterm delivery (rate ratio [rr] = 0.6, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 0.4-0.9). an increased rate of preterm delivery occurred among women with bacteroides bivius at concentrations of greater than 10(4) cfu/ml (rr = 2.0, 95% ci = 1.4-2.9) and bacteroides fragilis (rr = 1.7, 95% ci = 1.0-2.8). other microorganisms, including gardernella vaginalis, the genital mycoplasmas, group b streptococci, escherichia coli, and peptostreptococcus species, were not associated with an increased rate of preterm delivery for women in preterm labor.

TI  == susceptibility of female pelvic pathogens to oral antibiotic agents in patients who develop postpartum endometritis.
AB  == fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. two hundred thirty-one  patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90%  of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of enterococcus faecalis were  4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates  of escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of proteus mirabilis 0.25  and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. in summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety  of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.

TI  == molecular probe for identification of trichomonas vaginalis dna.
AB  == trichomoniasis is one of the most widespread sexually transmitted diseases in the world. diagnosis can be achieved by several methods, such as direct microscopic observation of vaginal discharge, cell culture, and immunological techniques. a 2.3-kb trichomonas vaginalis dna fragment present in strains from diverse geographic areas was cloned and used as a probe to detect t. vaginalis dna in vaginal discharge by a dot blot hybridization technique. this probe was specific  for t. vaginalis dna. it recognized strains from two regions in italy (sardinia,  piemonte) and from mozambique (africa). in addition, our probe did not cross-react with bacterial (escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, and lactobacillus spp.), viral (herpes simplex virus type 2), fungal (candida albicans), protozoan (entamoeba histolytica, giardia lamblia, plasmodium falciparum, leishmania major, and leishmania infantum), or human nucleic acids. the probe reacted with pentatrichomonas hominis and trichomonas foetus. the limit signal recognized by our probe corresponded to the dna of 200 t. vaginalis isolates. the 2.3-kb probe was used in a clinical analysis of 98 samples. of these, 20 samples were found to be positive both with the probe and by cell culture, and only 14 of these were positive by a standard wet mount method.

AB  == bacterial vaginosis is characterized by replacement of the normal lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora with gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and mycoplasma hominis. the present study evaluated the vaginal flora of women with bacterial vaginosis before and after treatment with intravaginal clindamycin cream. sixty-seven nonpregnant women with symptoms and signs of bacterial vaginosis, and without other genital tract infections, were randomly assigned to receive placebo cream or 0.1, 1, or 2% clindamycin cream. quantitative vaginal cultures for facultative and anaerobic bacteria and genital  mycoplasmas were performed at enrollment and at 4-7 days and 4-5 weeks after completion of therapy. at enrollment, g vaginalis was recovered from 99%, bacteroides sp from 94%, peptostreptococcus sp from 81%, and m hominis from 58% of the 67 women with bacterial vaginosis. the vaginal cultures yielded a median of 12 isolates per specimen, with equal numbers of aerobic and anaerobic species. the mean log concentration was 1.2 x 10(9) cfu/ml for aerobic and 2.6 x 10(8) cfu/ml for anaerobic bacteria. after treatment, the frequency and concentration of bacteria per milliliter of vaginal fluid decreased for g vaginalis, bacteroides sp, peptostreptococcus sp, and m hominis. the 2% clindamycin cream had the greatest effect on the bacterial vaginosis-associated flora and resulted  in clinical resolution of bacterial vaginosis in 15 (94%) of 16 women. treatment  with lower concentrations of clindamycin cream had less effect on the vaginal flora and resulted in clinical cure in 25 (71%) of 35 women. therapy was associated with an increase in the frequency and concentration of lactobacillus,  and a probably transient increase in the frequency of escherichia coli and enterococcus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the role of bacterial vaginosis as a cause of amniotic fluid infection, chorioamnionitis and prematurity--a review.
AB  == antepartum bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy has been related to premature delivery, the recovery of microorganisms from amniotic fluid of women in premature labor with intact membranes, to histologic chorioamnionitis and to the  recovery of microorganisms from the placenta or membranes. microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis are commonly recovered from the amniotic fluid and chorioamnion of patients who deliver prematurely. in addition, bacterial vaginosis is associated with maternal infectious morbidity during labor and in the postpartum period. very little is known of the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which bacterial vaginosis may cause preterm labor and/or premature  rupture of the membranes. however, it is of interest to speculate on possible mechanisms. the high concentration of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the vagina and cervix of pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis may increase the possibility of an ascending infection via the cervix, decidua, fetal membranes, maternal placenta, and amniotic fluid. some of the bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis such as bacteroides sp. are particularly virulent. certain bacteria produce enzymes that potentially could affect the fetal membranes or maternal deciduae. bacteroides sp. and group b streptococcus produce proteases. protease enzymes reduce the chorioamniotic membrane strength in vitro. it is even possible that a high concentration of bacteria in the lower genital tract could produce enough proteases to weaken the fetal membrane strength causing premature  rupture of the membranes. bacterial lipases could also produce tissue injury. schwarz et al. demonstrated that lysosomes within fetal membrane cells contain phospholipase a2 in high concentrations. phospholipase a2 is a precursor of prostaglandin synthesis and the destruction of lysosomes within deciduae or chorioamnion cells may induce prostaglandin synthesis resulting in uterine contractions. bejar et al. found a high rate of phospholipase a2 production by bacteroides sp., anaerobic streptococci, fusobacterium sp., and g. vaginalis. benett et al. demonstrated that bacterial products of group b streptococci, viridans streptococci, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis but not of lactobacillus sp. increase the synthesis of prostaglandins in the membranes. thus, selected bacteria, including some closely related to bacterial vaginosis may play a role in the initiation of uterine contractions by stimulating prostaglandin synthesis. in an alternative mechanism, either the release of prostaglandin in the membrane or uterine contraction could cause microbreaks of the membrane that allow bacterial colonization of the membrane.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == microbial flora of the lower genital tract during pregnancy: relationship to morbidity.
AB  == nineteen genera and groups of micro-organisms were isolated from the lower genital tract of 280 women at their first antenatal visit. chlamydia, viruses, and t-strain mycoplasmas were not sought, and only routine methods of anaerobic culture were used. growth was recorded as scanty, moderate or heavy. the population studied was grouped according to age, parity, gestational stage at booking, presence and degree of severity of lower genital tract morbidity, past history of vulvovaginitis, and suspicion of lower genital tract morbidity as evidenced by a request for a report on the microbiological findings. the frequency of isolation of the various microbes in health and in disease is given. the grading of gram-stained smears bore no relation to the isolation rates of lactobacilli, but there was a significant increase (p less than 0-001) in the isolation rates of each of the following: mycoplasma hominis, bacteroides spp., trichomonas vaginalis, gram-variable cocco-bacilli, and anaerobic streptococci in those patients with smears in which lactobacilli were adjudged to be absent. the  isolation of faecal streptococci was increased (p less than 0-001) in women aged  more than 34 years. escherichia coli (p less than 0-05) and anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci (p less than 0-02) were isolated more frequently from those booking after the 25th week of pregnancy. the incidence of m. hominis  (p less than 0-02) and of anaerobic streptococci (p less than 0-05) increased between the first and third trimesters. no significance positive correlations were established between the isolation rates of the various microbes and objective assessment of lower genital tract morbidity or the demonstration of pus cells, but lactobacilli were isolated less frequently (p less than 0-01) from those with morbidity. the isolation of candida albicans (p less than 0-02), t. vaginalis (p less than 0-05), and m. hominis (p less than 0.05) was increased in  patients in whom vulvovaginitis was suspected, and that of t. vaginalis (p less than 0-05) was increased in those with a past history of vulvovaginitis. the study indicates that, other than the pathogens t. vaginalis and c. albicans, only m. hominis could be suspected, on statistical grounds, of being associated with disease of the lower genital tract during early pregnancy.
