TI  == sequence analysis of a cryptic plasmid from flavobacterium sp. kp1, a psychrophilic bacterium.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid found at high copy number was isolated from flavobacterium sp.  kp1, a psychrophilic gram-negative bacterium, cloned, and sequenced. the sequence will appear in the ddbj/embl/genbank databases under the accession number ab007196. the pfl1 plasmid is 2311 nucleotides in length with 32.7% gc content, and shows a distinctive nucleotide sequence without homology to other plasmids of similar length. the plasmid contains two open reading frames of significant length, orfi and orfii. orfi encodes a protein similar to the replication proteins found in gram-negative bacterial plasmids, bacteroides fragilis plasmid  pbi143 and zymomonas mobilis plasmid pzm2. the putative translation product of orfii shows homologies with plasmid recombination proteins found mainly in gram-positive bacterial plasmids such as staphylococcus aureus plasmid pt181.

TI  == nucleotide sequence determination and genetic analysis of the bacteroides plasmid, pbi143.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence and genetic organization of the bacteroides plasmid pbi143 were determined. the plasmid was 2747 base pairs (bp) and had a g+c content of 41% (genbank accession no. u30316). there were two open reading frames greater than 50 codons and these were designated moba and repa. a 56-bp inverted  repeat divided pbi143 into modules with repa and moba in separate regions. there  was a marked difference in the g+c content and codon usage for the two regions; repa had 33% g+c and moba was 44% g+c. moba had homology to other bacteroides mobilization proteins and repa shared homology to a replication protein from zymomonas mobilis plasmid pzm2. these two putative replication proteins formed a  subgroup of the rolling-circle replication.proteins belonging to the psn2 family  of gram-positive plasmids. consistent with this finding, single-stranded pbi143 dna was detected in plasmid containing bacteroides fragilis cultures. availability of the pbi143 sequence allowed the elucidation of the complete nucleotide sequence for pfd288 an 8.9-kb bacteroides shuttle vector (genbank accession no. u30830).
