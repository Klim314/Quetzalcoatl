TI  == cxcl14 displays antimicrobial activity against respiratory tract bacteria and contributes to clearance of streptococcus pneumoniae pulmonary infection.
AB  == cxcl14 is a chemokine with an atypical, yet highly conserved, primary structure characterized by a short n terminus and high sequence identity between human and  mouse. although it induces chemotaxis of monocytic cells at high concentrations,  its physiological role in leukocyte trafficking remains elusive. in contrast, several studies have demonstrated that cxcl14 is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide that is expressed abundantly and constitutively in epithelial tissues. in this study, we further explored the antimicrobial properties of cxcl14 against respiratory pathogens in vitro and in vivo. we found that cxcl14 potently killed  pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus pneumoniae in a dose-dependent manner in part through membrane depolarization and rupture. by performing structure-activity studies, we found that the activity against gram-negative bacteria was largely associated with the n-terminal peptide cxcl141-13. interestingly, the central part of the molecule representing the beta-sheet also maintained approximately 62% killing activity and was sufficient  to induce chemotaxis of thp-1 cells. the c-terminal alpha-helix of cxcl14 had neither antimicrobial nor chemotactic effect. to investigate a physiological function for cxcl14 in innate immunity in vivo, we infected cxcl14-deficient mice with lung pathogens and we found that cxcl14 contributed to enhanced clearance of streptococcus pneumoniae, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa. our comprehensive studies reflect the complex bactericidal mechanisms of cxcl14, and we propose that different structural features are relevant for the killing of gram-negative  and gram-positive bacteria. taken together, our studies show that evolutionary-conserved features of cxcl14 are important for constitutive antimicrobial defenses against pneumonia.

TI  == an observational study examining the relationship between respiratory symptoms, airway inflammation and bacteriology in children with severe neurodisability.
AB  == background: children with severe neurodisability (nd) commonly suffer from chronic respiratory symptoms that impact greatly on quality of life, and lead to  recurrent hospital admissions. this morbidity (and its causes) is poorly described, despite being well recognised by paediatricians. in this study, we characterised respiratory symptoms in children with nd at times of stability and  deterioration. we also assessed the relationship between respiratory symptoms, lower airway inflammatory markers and levels of infection/colonisation. methods:  nd children were recruited upon admission for elective surgery (elective-nd [n =  16]), or acutely upon admission to intensive care (picu-nd [n = 19]), and compared to healthy control children [n = 12]. parents completed a validated respiratory symptom questionnaire in which symptoms associated with activity were removed (total maximal score of 108). bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) was collected, and bal neutrophil counts, il-8 and tgfbeta-1 levels measured. bal microbial analysis was performed using a 16s/18s rrna gene based assay and pseudomonas aeruginosa pcr. results: all nd children had high levels of respiratory symptoms  (median [iqr] symptom score picu-nd, 55[38-64]; elective-nd, 26[7-45]; control, 4[0-7]: p<0.01), which affected their families, particularly at nighttime. elective-nd patients with a total respiratory symptom score >20 invariably had bal neutrophilia. elective patients with 16s/18s microbial rdna positive bal had  higher neutrophil counts (positive, 33[18-70]%; negative, 8[4-38]%: p<0.05) and generally higher symptom scores (positive, 17[5-32]; negative, 5[0-9]: p = 0.097). streptococcus mitis was commonly identified in bal from nd children; pseudomonas aeruginosa was not identified in any sample. conclusions: children with severe nd often have high levels of chronic respiratory symptoms, which may  relate to lower airway inflammation. bacterial airway colonisation, particularly  with oral commensals, may play a role in both symptom generation and inflammation.

TI  == antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. materials and methods. the growth of selected bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. the  content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with hplc-esi-ms. results. the spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with ph varying between 4.1-5.4. conclusions. the present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice ph explains bacterial in vitro growth. this may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.

TI  == environment and colonisation sequence are key parameters driving cooperation and  competition between pseudomonas aeruginosa cystic fibrosis strains and oral commensal streptococci.
AB  == cystic fibrosis (cf) patient airways harbour diverse microbial consortia that, in addition to the recognized principal pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa, include other bacteria commonly regarded as commensals. the latter include the oral (viridans) streptococci, which recent evidence indicates play an active role during infection of this environmentally diverse niche. as the interactions between inhabitants of the cf airway can potentially alter disease progression, it is important to identify key cooperators/competitors and environmental influences if therapeutic intervention is to be improved and pulmonary decline arrested. importantly, we recently showed that virulence of the p. aeruginosa liverpool epidemic strain (les) could be potentiated by the anginosus-group of streptococci (ags). in the present study we explored the relationships between other viridans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis) and the les and observed that co-culture outcome was dependent upon inoculation sequence and environment. all four streptococcal species were shown to potentiate les virulence factor production in co-culture biofilms. however, in the case of s. oralis interactions were environmentally determined; in air cooperation within a high cell density co-culture biofilm occurred together with stimulation of les virulence factor production, while in an atmosphere containing added co2 this species became a competitor antagonising les growth through hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) production, significantly altering biofilm population dynamics and appearance. streptococcus  mitis, s. gordonii and s. sanguinis were also capable of h2o2 mediated inhibition of p. aeruginosa growth, but this was only visible when inoculated as a primary coloniser prior to introduction of the les. therefore, these observations, which  are made in conditions relevant to the biology of cf disease pathogenesis, show that the pathogenic and colonisation potential of p. aeruginosa isolates can be modulated positively and negatively by the presence of oral commensal streptococci.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of the triterpene 3beta,6beta,16beta-trihydroxylup-20(29)-ene on planktonic cells and biofilms from gram positive and gram negative bacteria.
AB  == this study evaluated the antimicrobial effect of 3beta,6beta,16beta-trihydroxylup-20(29)-ene (clf1), a triterpene isolated from combretum leprosum mart., in inhibiting the planktonic growth and biofilms of gram positive bacteria streptococcus mutans and s. mitis. the antimicrobial activity was assessed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc). the antibiofilm potential was determined by quantifying total biomass and enumerating biofilm-entrapped viable  bacteria. in addition, the acute toxicity of clf1 on artemia sp. nauplii was also determined. the results showed that clf1 was able in inhibiting the growth of s.  mutans and s. mitis with mic and mbc of 7.8 mug/ml and 15.6 mug/ml, respectively. clf1 was highly effective on biofilms of both bacteria. only 7.8 mug/ml clf1 was  enough to inhibit by 97% and 90% biomass production of s. mutans and s. mitis, respectively. on the other hand, such effects were not evident on gram negative pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. the toxicity tests showed that the lc50 of clf1 was 98.19 mug/ml. therefore, clf1 isolated from c. leprosum may constitute an important natural agent for the development of new therapies for caries and other infectious diseases caused by s. mutans and s. mitis.

TI  == enzymatic treatment of specimens before dna extraction directly influences molecular detection of infectious agents.
AB  == introduction: biological samples, pharmaceuticals or food contain proteins, lipids, polymers, ammoniums and macromolecules that alter the detection of infectious agents by dna amplification techniques (pcr). moreover the targeted dna has to be released from the complex cell walls and the compact nucleoprotein  matrixes and cleared from potential inhibitors. the goal of the present work was  to assess the efficiency of enzymatic pretreatments on infectious agents to make  dna available for further extraction and amplification. methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and fusarium solani were mixed with an internal control virus and treated with: 1) proteinase k; 2) lyticase and 3) lyticase followed by proteinase k. dnas was manually extracted using the qiamp dna mini kit or the magna pure compact automate. dna extraction yields and the inhibitors were assessed with a phocid herpesvirus. bacterial detection was performed using taqman real-time pcr and yeasts and filamentous fungi with hrm (real-time pcr followed by high-resolution melting analysis). results: viral dna was released, extracted and detected using manual and automatic methods without pre enzymatic treatments. either the manual or the automatic dna extraction systems did not meet the sensitivity expectations if enzymatic treatments were not performed before: lyticase for fungi and proteinase k for bacteria. the addition of lyticase and proteinase k did not improve results. for fungi the detection after lyticase was higher than for proteinase k, for which melting analysis did not allow fungal specification. discussion: columns and magnetic beads allowed collecting dna and separate pcr inhibitors. detection rates cannot be related to dna-avidity of beads or to elution but to the lack of proteolysis.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == dielectrophoresis-based discrimination of bacteria at the strain level based on their surface properties.
AB  == insulator-based dielectrophoresis can be used to manipulate biological particles, but has thus far found limited practical applications due to low sensitivity. we  present linear sweep three-dimensional insulator-based dielectrophoresis as a considerably more sensitive approach for strain-level discrimination bacteria. in this work, linear sweep three-dimensional insulator-based dielectrophoresis was performed on pseudomonas aeruginosa pa14 along with six isogenic mutants as well  as streptococcus mitis sf100 and ps344. strain-level discrimination was achieved  between these clinically important pathogens with applied electric fields below 10 v/mm. this low voltage, high sensitivity technique has potential applications  in clinical diagnostics as well as microbial physiology research.

TI  == assessing the oral microbiota of healthy and alcohol-treated rats using whole-genome dna probes from human bacteria.
AB  == objective: this study aimed to evaluate the capacity of whole-genome dna probes prepared from human oral bacteria to cross-react with bacteria from the oral cavity of rats, and to assess the influence of alcohol ingestion on the animals'  oral biofilm. design: twenty four mature wistar rats were equally divided in two  groups. one group (control) was fed balanced diet of rat pellets and water. the alcohol-treated group (at) received the same diet and 20% ethanol solution. upon  euthanasia after 30 days, bacterial samples from the oral biofilm covering the animals' teeth were collected using microbrushes. bacteria identification and quantification were performed using the dna checkerboard hybridization method with 33 probes prepared from human oral bacteria. signals corresponding to bacterial genome counts and percentages were compared using a mann-whitney u test with a significance level <0.05. results: cross-reaction for all targeted species, except streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis-like species, occurred in the control group. escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, porphyromonas endodontalis, and veillonella parvula-like species only produced detectable signals in the at group. significantly more signals were detected in the control group compared to the at group (p=0.001). the percentage of e. coli-like species was highest in both groups. conclusions: whole-genome dna probes prepared from human oral bacteria can cross-react with rats' oral bacterial species. alcohol consumption is associated with lower levels and diversity of bacterial species in the oral cavity of rats.

TI  == viridans streptococcal (streptococcus mitis) biosynthetic aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis (pve) complicated by complete heart block and paravalvular abscess.
AB  == prosthetic valve endocarditis (pve) may be classified clinically as early (<60 days) or late (>60 days) post-valve replacement pve. the pathogens of early versus late pve differ in type and virulence. early pve pathogens are virulent, for example, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. late pve pathogens resemble those of subacute bacterial endocarditis and are due to relatively avirulent and noninvasive organisms, for example, viridans streptococci. viridans streptococci vary in their invasiveness and abscess potential. myocardial abscess and complete heart block are rare complications of late pve due to viridans streptococci. we present an unusual case of streptococcus mitis late aortic pve complicated by aortic root abscess, myocardial abscess, and complete heart block.

TI  == antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == there is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. how lipids interact with bacteria to achieve  a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. to begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases d-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four gram-negative bacteria and seven gram-positive bacteria. exact kruskal-wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (p < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d-sphingosine (mbc range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (mbc range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (mbc range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). sapienic acid (mbc range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium  jeikeium (mbc > 500 mug/ml). lauric acid (mbc range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except e. coli, s. marcescens, and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have  different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == [risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia in neonates and the changes of  isolated pathogens.]
AB  == objective: to study the risk factors for neonatal ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) and the changes of isolated pathogens in the last eight years. methods: the clinical data of 230 neonates who were admitted into the neonatal intensive care  unit (nicu) and received mechanical ventilation for equal to or longer than 48 hrs in 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. the isolated pathogens were compared with those of eight years ago. results: the incidence of vap (25.2%) in the year  2008 was lower than that of eight years ago (36.1%; p<0.05). the development of vap was negatively correlated with the gestational age and the birth weight, but  positively correlated with the duration of mechanical ventilation, intubation times, duration of hospitalization, presence of gastrointestinal bleeding and need for blood products transfusion. the main isolated pathogens were opportunistic antibiotics resistant bacteria, and the majority was gram negative  bacilli (77%). the most frequently detected gram negative bacilli were klebsiella (20%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (18%) and acinetobacter (13%). streptococcus  mitis was the most frequently detected gram positive bacilli (14%). the distribution pattern of pathogens isolated in the same nicu eight years ago was somewhat different: klebsiella (23%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (17%), acinetobacter (16%), streptococcus mitis (11%), fungi (1%) and candida albicans (1%). conclusions: the incidence of vap is correlated with gestational age, birth weight, duration of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization, intubation times, presence of gastrointestinal bleeding and need for blood products transfusion. the main isolated pathogens are usually antibiotic resistant opportunistic bacteria. the detection rate of stenotrophomonas maltophilia increased and that of pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased when compared with eight years ago.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of abrus precatorius (l) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. method: in this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, three clinical s. aureus isolates from different sources, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus anginosus (s.milleri), bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. to measure the mic values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. result: at the  different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an mic of 8 ug/ml for  the leaf extract. extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of  the gram-positive bacteria and candida albicans but not against s anginosus, e. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. the ph of the extracts ranged between ph5 and ph8. this study demonstrates that abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. conclusion: the results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of abrus precatorius for the treatment of  various bacteria-related diseases. topical application of abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == bacteremia in hematological and oncological children with febrile neutropenia: experience in a tertiary medical center in taiwan.
AB  == a retrospective study of bacteremia in children with febrile neutropenia admitted to a medical center in taiwan from january 1999 to december 1999 was performed. there were 190 episodes of febrile neutropenia during this period and 46 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 38 bacteremic episodes (7 mixed infections). pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%), staphylococcus aureus (10.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%), and enterobacter cloacae (10.9%) were the most common isolates. three of the 5 isolates of s. aureus were resistant to methicillin. twenty-three episodes of bacteremia (four mixed infections) were associated with recent antibiotic use. of the 23 bacteremic episodes with recent  antibiotic use, p. aeruginosa (20%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (10%), k. pneumoniae (10%), escherichia coli (10%), and e. cloacae (10%) were isolated most often. relapsed leukemia (odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval 1.4-6.5) and recent antibiotic therapy (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7-7.7) were  the independent risk factors of bacteremia. there were 9 mortality cases in patients with bacteremia, including 4 cases with mixed infections, and 5 cases with p. aeruginosa, e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, s. aureus, and streptococcus mitis, respectively. broad-spectrum antibiotics were necessary in febrile neutropenic children because of the high percentage of mixed infection.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial flora associated with chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses.
AB  == chronic maxillary sinusitis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the role of microbial infection remains undefined. bacteria have been isolated from chronically inflamed sinuses; however, their role in the chronicity of inflammation is unknown. the objective of this study was to determine whether bacteria are present in clinical samples from chronic maxillary sinusitis and to  assess the diversity of the flora present. washes and/or tissue samples from endoscopic sinus surgery on 11 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis were subjected to pcr amplification of bacterial 16s rdna using three universal primer pairs, followed by cloning and sequencing. the samples were also assessed for the presence of bacteria and fungi by conventional culture methods. viable bacteria and/or bacterial 16s rdna were detected from maxillary sinus samples of five of the 11 patients examined (45 %). three sinus samples were positive by both pcr and culture methods, one was positive only by pcr, and one only by culture. thirteen bacterial species were identified: abiotrophia defectiva, enterococcus avium, eubacterium sp., granulicatella elegans, neisseria sp., prevotella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sp. fungi were not detected. in one  patient streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis, and in another patient pseudomonas aeruginosa, were detected from both the sinus and the oral cavity using species-specific pcr primers. these results suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be detected in nearly half of chronic maxillary sinusitis  cases.

TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  == [utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  == the value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the fundacion favaloro, the fundacion para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurologicas de la infancia and the hospital de ninos ricardo gutierrez. a total  of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). bact-alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees c for 30 days in the bact-alert system. bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and sabouraud agar. a total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. the positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). the median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. the microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 18), acinetobacter spp (n = 9), candida spp (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), enterococcus faecalis, salmonella spp and capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, citrobacter diversus, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, chryseomonas luteola, serratia marcescens, abiotrophia spp, campylobacter jejuni, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella urethralis, neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group g streptococci, rhodococcus equi, micrococcus spp, cryptococcus neoformans  and streptococcus mitis (n = 1). in our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.

TI  == ib-367, a protegrin peptide with in vitro and in vivo activities against the microflora associated with oral mucositis.
AB  == although the microflora associated with oral mucositis initiated by cytotoxic therapy is not well characterized, several studies suggest that reduction of the  microbial load in the oral cavity has some clinical benefit. the mics of ib-367,  a synthetic protegrin analog, ranged from 0.13 to 64 microgram/ml for gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, and staphylococcus aureus) and from 0.06 to 8 microgram/ml for gram-negative species (klebsiella, escherichia, and pseudomonas). ib-367 exhibited rapid, microbicidal activity against both log- and stationary-phase cultures of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa. at concentrations near the mics for these two organisms (4 and 2 microgram/ml, respectively), ib-367 reduced viability by more than 3 logs in less than 16 min. similarly, ib-367 effected a 4-log reduction of the endogenous microflora in pooled human saliva within 2 min at 250 microgram/ml, a concentration readily attained by local delivery. after nine serial transfers at  0.5x the mic, the mic of ib-367 for mrsa and p. aeruginosa increased only two to  four times. in a phase i clinical study with healthy volunteers, ib-367 was well  tolerated, with no detectable systemic absorption. one hour after treatment with  9 mg of ib-367, the prevalence of gram-negative bacteria and yeast was reduced, and the density of the predominant gram-positive oral flora was decreased 1,000 times. ib-367's properties (speed of killing, breadth of spectrum, and lack of resistance) make the compound a strong candidate for the prophylaxis of oral mucositis. phase ii clinical trials with ib-367 are under way for this indication in immunocompromised subjects.

TI  == an evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: facultative aerobes-anaerobes: candida albicans atcc 10231; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212; escherichia coli atcc 25,922; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27,853; streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. microaerophiles: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522. obligate anaerobes: actinomyces odontolyticus atcc 17929; fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25,586; porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277; and prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845. each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the  experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic  and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.

TI  == pacemaker-related endocarditis. report of 7 cases and review of the literature.
AB  == we report on 7 patients with pacemaker endocarditis diagnosed during the workup of long-standing fever. persistent positive blood cultures and echocardiography led to the diagnosis in 6 patients whereas autopsy was diagnostic in another. causative microorganisms were staphylococcus epidermidis (3), staphylococcus lugdunensis (1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), streptococcus bovis (1), and streptococcus mitis-streptococcus sanguis (1). pulmonary embolism was present in  nearly 50% of the cases, a figure clearly higher than previously reported. in all but 1 case the initial medical approach was not successful, and thus the pacing system was finally removed. none of the cases relapsed after the removal. we have reviewed the literature regarding pacemaker endocarditis, particularly with respect to treatment.

TI  == bacteremic pneumonia in neutropenic patients with cancer: causes, empirical antibiotic therapy, and outcome.
AB  == background: bacteremic pneumonia is a major cause of death among neutropenic patients with cancer. methods: we analyzed the causes, empirical antibiotic therapy, and outcome of 40 consecutive cases of bacteremic pneumonia identified among 408 episodes of bacteremia in adult neutropenic patients with cancer, prospectively documented from 1986 to 1995. results: the most frequent causative  organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 cases), streptococcus pneumoniae (12 cases), escherichia coli (5 cases), and streptococcus mitis (3 cases). overall, p. aeruginosa and s. pneumoniae caused 72.5% of all episodes of bacteremic pneumonia, compared with 11.4% of bacteremic episodes from other sources (p< .001). thirty patients received ceftazidime and 10 patients received imipenem as  the beta-lactam component of the initial empirical treatment. all strains of p. aeruginosa were susceptible to both agents. forty-seven percent of streptococcal  strains were penicillin resistant and showed a decreased susceptibility to ceftazidime (minimum inhibitory concentration ranged from 1 to 64 microg/ml). five patients (12.5%) were considered to have received inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy. attributable mortality in patients with bacteremic pneumonia  was higher than in patients with bacteremia from other sources; 22 (55%) of the 40 patients with bacteremic pneumonia died, whereas 39 (10.6%) of the 368 patients with bacteremia from other sources died (p<.001). conclusions: our data  suggest that bacteremic pneumonia in neutropenic cancer patients is associated with a poor outcome and that empirical antibiotic therapy for neutropenic patients with pneumonia should include agents active against both p. aeruginosa and cephalosporin-resistant streptococci.

TI  == [antibacterial and cytotoxic effects of n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate used as a tissue  adhesive].
AB  == in this study, the antibacterial and cytotoxic effects of a synthetic tissue adhesive called n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (histoacryl) which provide rapid healing  in incision in oral surgical procedures were investigated. the antibacterial effects of histoacryl were tested by using standard reference strains of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mitis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus grown in mueller-hinton media (sheep blood supplemented mueller-hinton for streptococcus strains) by diffusion technique. the cytotoxic effects were also researched on continuous vero and primary gingival fibroblast cell cultures by using agar overlay method. in these methods, the inhibition zones produced by histoacryl were evaluated. as a result, histoacryl was found to have antibacterial effect on the tested bacteria and produce cytotoxic and cytopathic effects on the tested cell cultures.

TI  == in vitro studies on the microbicidal effectiveness of a xenon-based ultraviolet light device for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis connections.
AB  == mercury vapor sourced ultraviolet light has been used for several years to disinfect connections that are integral to peritoneal dialysis solution delivery  systems. this in vitro study evaluated the suitability of xenon flash sourced ultraviolet light as an effective alternative disinfecting agent. candida albicans was determined to be at least four times more resistant than staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mitis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa to ultraviolet radiation generated by both mercury vapor and xenon flash devices. both ultraviolet devices effectively disinfected transfer set spikes that were inoculated intraluminally with each of these five test microorganisms suspended in a pool of patient dialysis effluent. however, ultraviolet (254 nm) absorbance values of dialysis effluent was found to vary greatly between patients, with the most ultraviolet-opaque effluent significantly reducing the microbicidal effectiveness of the mercury vapor, but not the xenon flash system.

TI  == prophylactic co-trimoxazole versus norfloxacin in neutropenic children--perspective randomized study.
AB  == co-trimoxazole or norfloxacin were randomly administered to 44 granulocytopenic children with malignancies in order to prevent bacterial infections. although more patients in the co-trimoxazole group had febrile episodes (p less than 0.01), the mean of febrile days and the mean of days with systemic antibiotics did not differ significantly in the two groups. five patients in the co-trimoxazole group had a microbiologically documented infection (four with septicemia) due to escherichia coli (n = 2), klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sp. there were four septicemic episodes in the norfloxacin group due to p. aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus faecalis. compliance was good during administration of both drugs. no signs or symptoms of arthropathy were seen in the norfloxacin group. the number of gram-negative bacilli resistant to co-trimoxazole isolated from stools significantly increased during prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (p less than 0.001). norfloxacin did not select resistant strains and was very active in eradicating gram-negative bacilli from stools (27.5% of positive cultures).

TI  == interbacterial adhesion between pseudomonas aeruginosa and indigenous oral bacteria isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == interbacterial adhesion between strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and strains of  indigenous oral bacteria, both of which were isolated from the oral cavity of cystic fibrosis patients, was investigated by the phenomenon of the coaggregation reaction. a total of 22 strains of p. aeruginosa were isolated from the oral cavity of 17 patients and examined for their abilities to coaggregate with 5 strains each of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii. coaggregation reactions were common between these oral bacteria and both the mucoid and nonmucoid variants of p. aeruginosa. all strains of p. aeruginosa were also able to agglutinate neuraminidase-treated or untreated human erythrocytes of blood types a, b, and o. positive coaggregation reactions were further characterized by determining the effects of several sugars, and of heat and protease treatments of the bacteria. none of the coaggregtion reactions were inhibited by 0.05 m lactose, galactose, glucose, fucose, or mannose. all coaggregation reactions were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive components of the pseudomonas. thus, the interbacterial adhesions between p. aeruginosa and the oral bacteria studied appears to involve  adhesins on the pseudomonas cell, which bind to complementary receptors, on the cell surfaces of oral bacteria. the apparent prevalence and diversity of interbacterial adhesions between p. aeruginosa strains originating from the oral  cavity of cystic fibrosis patients and strains of the indigenous oral bacteria suggest that some of these reactions may affect the extent to which p. aeruginosa colonizes in the oral cavity of cystic fibrosis patients, and thereby, influence  susceptibility of the host to infection.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == meningitis--a complication of spinal anesthesia.
AB  == during a five-year period, 17 of 1429 patients admitted with meningitis had had recent spinal anesthesia in cairo, egypt. ten of the 17 had positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures: 8 were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 was staphylococcus aureus, and 1 was streptococcus mitis. these organisms were not cultured from patients who had not had spinal anesthesia. two patients with negative cultures had lumbar spine x-ray changes consistent with tuberculosis. antibiotic therapy was based upon the sensitivity of cultured organisms. four of the 17 patients died. these data strongly suggest that meningitis in patients with recent spinal  anesthesia is commonly due to unusual or nosocomial organisms. aggressive, meticulous bacteriologic evaluation of these patients is essential.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the alpha-hemolytic streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains  of serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium diphtheriae. however, strans of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. the mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
