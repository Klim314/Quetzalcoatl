bacteriocin pj4 active against enteric pathogen produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4 isolated from gut microflora of wistar rat (rattus norvegicus): partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin.
the increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the restriction on the use antibiotics due to its side effects have drawn attention to the search for possible alternatives. bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by numerous bacteria. much interest has been focused on bacteriocins because they exhibit inhibitory activity against pathogens. lactic acid bacteria possess the ability to synthesize antimicrobial compounds (like bacteriocin) during their growth. in this study, an antibacterial substance (bacteriocin pj4) produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4, isolated from rat gut microflora, was identified as bacteriocin. it was effective against wide assay of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria involved in various diseases, including escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. the antimicrobial peptide was relatively heat-resistant and also active over a wide ph range of 2-10. it has been partially purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation and size exclusion chromatography and checked on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of bacteriocin pj4 purified through size exclusion chromatography resolved ~6.5 kda protein with bacteriocin activity. the peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, and lipase but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, and pepsin. it showed a bactericidal mode of action against the indicator strains e. coli mtcc443, lactobacillus casei mtcc1423, and e. faecalis dt48. such characteristics indicate that this bacteriocin may be a potential candidate for alternative agents to control important pathogens.
characterization of four plasmids harboured in a lactobacillus brevis strain encoding a novel bacteriocin, brevicin 925a, and construction of a shuttle vector for lactic acid bacteria and escherichia coli.
in this study we isolated over 250 lactic acid bacteria (lab) candidates from fruit, flowers, vegetables and a fermented food to generate an lab library. one strain, designated 925a, isolated from kimchi (a traditional korean fermented dish made from chinese cabbage) produced a novel type of bacteriocin, brevicin 925a, which is effective against certain lab, including strains of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, bacillus and listeria. strain 925a, identified as lactobacillus brevis, harboured at least four plasmids and we determined the entire nucleotide sequence of each one. the four plasmids were designated plb925a01-04, and have molecular sizes of 1815, 3524, 8881 and 65 037 bp, respectively. we obtained bacteriocin non-producing derivatives by treatment of strain 925a with novobiocin. all of these derivatives, which were susceptible to their own antibacterial product, lost the largest plasmid, plb925a04, suggesting that the genes for bacteriocin biosynthesis (breb and brec) and immunity (bree) are located on plb925a04. the partial amino acid sequence of purified brevicin 925a and sequence analysis of plb925a04 showed that breb is the structural gene for brevicin 925a. we constructed a shuttle vector (ples003, 6134 bp) that can replicate in both escherichia coli and lab such as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus hilgardii and enterococcus hirae. to determine the function of gene bree, which displays no significant similarity to any other sequences in the blast search database, the gene was inserted into ples003. a plb925a04-cured derivative transformed with ples003 carrying bree acquired immunity to brevicin 925a, suggesting that bree encodes an immunity protein.
probiotics prevent enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7-mediated inhibition of interferon-gamma-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of stat-1.
enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) o157:h7 inhibits interferon (ifn)-gamma-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat)-1 in epithelial cells. we determined the effects of probiotics on ehec-mediated disruption of ifn-gamma-stimulated stat-1 activation in epithelial cell lines. confluent intestine 407, hep-2 and caco-2 epithelial cells were pre-treated (3 h) with either probiotics or surface-layer proteins derived from lactobacillus helveticus r0052 prior to infection with ehec o157:h7 strain cl56 (m.o.i. 100:1, 6 h, 37 degrees c in 5% co2). subsequently, cells were washed and stimulated with human recombinant ifn-gamma (50 ng ml(-1), 0.5 h, 37 degrees c) followed by whole-cell protein extraction and immunoblotting for tyrosine-phosphorylated stat-1. relative to uninfected cells, stat-1-activation was reduced after ehec o157:h7 infection. pre-incubation with the probiotic l. helveticus r0052 followed by ehec infection abrogated pathogen-mediated disruption of ifn-gamma-stat-1 signalling. as determined using transwell inserts, probiotic-mediated protection was independent of epithelial cell contact. in contrast, pre-incubation with boiled l. helveticus r0052, an equal concentration of viable lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011, or surface-layer proteins (0.14 mg ml(-1)) did not restore stat-1 signalling in ehec-infected cells. the viable probiotic agent l. helveticus r0052 prevented ehec o157:h7-mediated subversion of epithelial cell signal transduction responses.
surface-layer protein extracts from lactobacillus helveticus inhibit enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 adhesion to epithelial cells.
adherence of intestinal pathogens, including escherichia coli o157:h7, to human intestinal epithelial cells is a key step in pathogenesis. probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus helveticus r0052 inhibit the adhesion of e. coli o157:h7 to epithelial cells, a process which may be related to specific components of the bacterial surface. surface-layer proteins (slps) are located in a paracrystalline layer outside the bacterial cell wall and are thought to play a role in tissue adherence. however, the ability of s-layer protein extract derived from probiotic bacteria to block adherence of enteric pathogens has not been investigated. human epithelial (hep-2 and t84) cells were treated with s-layer protein extract alone, infected with e. coli o157:h7, or pretreated with s-layer protein extract prior to infection to determine their importance in the inhibition of pathogen adherence. the effects of s-layer protein extracts were characterized by phase-contrast and immunofluorescence microscopy and measurement of the transepithelial electrical resistance of polarized monolayers. pre-treatment of host epithelial cells with s-layer protein extracts prior to e. coli o157:h7 infection decreased pathogen adherence and attaching-effacing lesions in addition to preserving the barrier function of monolayers. these in vitro studies indicate that a non-viable constituent derived from a probiotic strain may prove effective in interrupting the infectious process of an intestinal pathogen.
in vitro antibacterial activity of lactobacillus helveticus strain ks300 against  diarrhoeagenic, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated bacteria.
aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate in vitro the antibacterial activity of the lactobacillus helveticus strain ks300 against vaginosis-associated bacteria including gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia, uropathogenic escherichia coli, and diarrhoeagenic salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. methods and results: the ks300 strain inhibited the growth of g. vaginalis, p. bivia, s. typhimurium, and pathogenic e. coli. after direct co-culture, data show that the lactobacillus strain decreased the viability of g. vaginalis, p. bivia, s. typhimurium, and pathogenic e. coli. the adhering ks300 strain inhibited the adhesion of g. vaginalis dsm 4944 and uropathogenic dr-positive e. coli ih11128 onto hela cells. moreover, the ks300 strain inhibited the internalization of uropathogenic dr-positive e. coli ih11128 within hela cells and s. typhimurium sl1344 within caco-2/tc7 cells. conclusions: the findings demonstrate that l. helveticus strain ks300 is adhesive onto cultured human cells and has antagonistic activities against vaginosis-associated, uropathogenic and diarrhoeagenic pathogens. significance and impact of the study: adhering l. helveticus strain ks300 is a potential probiotic strain displaying a strain-specific array of in vitro antibacterial activities.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
cloning, expression, and nucleotide sequence of the lactobacillus helveticus 481  gene encoding the bacteriocin helveticin j.
lactobacillus helveticus 481 produces a 37-kda bacteriocin called helveticin j. libraries of chromosomal dna from l. helveticus were prepared in lambda gt11 and probed for phage-producing fusion proteins that could react with polyclonal helveticin j antibody. two recombinant phage, hj1 and hj4, containing homologous inserts of 350 and 600 bp, respectively, produced proteins that reacted with antibody. these two phage clones specifically hybridized to l. helveticus 481 total genomic dna but not to dna from strains that did not produce helveticin j or strains producing unrelated bacteriocins. hj1 and hj4 lysogens produced beta-galactosidase fusion proteins that shared similar epitopes with each other and helveticin j. the intact helveticin j gene (hlv) was isolated by screening a library of l. helveticus chromosomal dna in lambda embl3 with the insert dna from phage hj4 as a probe. the dna sequence of a contiguous 3,364-bp region was determined. two complete open reading frames (orf), designated orf2 and orf3, were identified within the sequenced fragment. the 3' end of another open reading frame, orf1, was located upstream of orf2. a noncoding region and a putative promoter were located between orf1 and orf2. orf2 could encode an 11,808-da protein. the l. helveticus dna inserts of the hj1 and hj4 clones reside within orf3, which begins 30 bp downstream from the termination codon of orf2. orf3 could encode a 37,511-da protein. downstream from orf3, the 5' end of another orf (orf4) was found. a bg/ii fragment containing orf2 and orf3 was cloned into pgk12, and the recombinant plasmid, ptrk135, was transformed into lactobacillus acidophilus via electroporation. transformants carrying ptrk135 produced a bacteriocin that was heat labile and exhibited an acitivity spectrum that was the same as that of helveticin j.
