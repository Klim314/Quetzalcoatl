TI  == occurrence of polyhydroxyalkanoic acid granule-associated proteins related to the alcaligenes eutrophus h16 ga24 protein in other bacteria.
AB  == fifty different polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (pha)-accumulating bacterial strains were investigated for the occurrence of phasin proteins bound to pha granules and related to the ga24 protein of alcaligenes eutrophus h16, by isolating pha granules and western blot analysis of granule-associated proteins employing antibodies raised against the ga24 protein. it could be demonstrated that th pha  granules of many poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)-accumulating bacteria exhibited a similar protein pattern, and a predominant protein of 24 +/- 2 kda occurred in the granules of a. eutrophus strains a7, ch34, jmp222, n9a and tf93 exhibiting n-terminal amino acid sequences identical to that of the ga24 protein. proteins bound to the granules of a. latus, burkholderia caryophyli, b. cepacia, b. solanacearum, pseudomonas glathei, rhodobacter sphaeroides and telluria mixta also gave positive immunoreactions. granule-associated proteins of small size also occurred in various strains of the gram positive bacteria bacillus megaterium and r. ruber as well as in the gram-negative bacteria azotobacter sp., chromatium vinosum, comamonas acidovorans, methylobacterium sp., mycoplana rubra, paracoccus denitrificans, pseudomonas sp., rhodospirillum rubrum, rubrivivax gelatinosus and thiocystis violacea; however, they gave no immunoreaction. this study clearly demonstrated that phasins are wide-spread if not essential in pha-accumulating bacteria.

TI  == the gradostat: a bidirectional compound chemostat and its application in microbiological research.
AB  == a multistage continuous culture system is described in which solutes are transferred between vessels in opposite directions simultaneously. the system, called a gradostat, produces opposing solute gradients and is a good laboratory model of many natural microbial ecosystems in which solute gradients are important. theoretical predictions concerning solute transfer were confirmed under steady-state and non steady-state conditions, using a coloured dye. paracoccus denitrificans grew anaerobically in the gradostat at the intersection  between opposing gradients of succinate and nitrate. opposing gradients of glucose and oxygen separated the growth of a bacillus sp. (a facultative anaerobe) and clostridium butyricum (an obligate anaerobe). viable counts for both species fell exponentially away from their growth positions at the ends of the gradostat. the potential value of the gradostat and possible alternative conformations are discussed.
