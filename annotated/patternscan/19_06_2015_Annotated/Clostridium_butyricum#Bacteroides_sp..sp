TI  == bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and clostridium spp. in fecal samples from breast-fed and bottle-fed infants with and without iron supplement.
AB  == bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and clostridium spp. isolated from the feces of 23  neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with iron supplement (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without iron supplement (iron concentration, less than 0.5 mg/liter). the bifidobacterium spp. most frequently  isolated from the three groups of infants were b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, and b. bifidum. the bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were  b. fragilis and b. vulgatus. the most common clostridium sp. in the three groups  of infants was c. perfringens. the type of milk did not select for species of bifidobacterium, bacteroides, or clostridium, except for clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with iron supplement than from the other groups, and clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants. the species of the three anaerobic genera did not persist for a long period of time in the three groups of infants.
