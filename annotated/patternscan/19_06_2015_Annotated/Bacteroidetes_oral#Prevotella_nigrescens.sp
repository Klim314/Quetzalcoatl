TI  == combinatorial effects of amoxicillin and metronidazole on selected periodontal bacteria and whole plaque samples.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to analyze in vitro the combinatorial effects of the antibiotic combination of amoxicillin plus metronidazole on subgingival bacterial isolates. design: aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum  and eikenella corrodens from our strain collection and subgingival bacteria isolated from patients with periodontitis were tested for their susceptibility to amoxicillin and metronidazole using the etest. the fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici), which is commonly used to describe drug interactions, was calculated. results: synergy, i.e. fici values </= 0.5, between amoxicillin and metronidazole was shown for two a. actinomycetemcomitans (fici: 0.3), two f.  nucleatum (fici: 0.3 and 0.5, respectively) and one e. corrodens (fici: 0.4) isolates. indifference, i.e. fic indices of >0.5 but </=4, occurred for other isolates and the 14 p. intermedia/nigrescens strains tested. microorganisms resistant to either amoxicillin or metronidazole were detected in all samples by  etest. conclusion: combinatorial effects occur between amoxicillin and metronidazole on some strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and e. corrodens. synergy was shown for a few strains only.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == the influence of oral bacteria on epithelial cell migration in vitro.
AB  == oral ulcerations often arise as a side effect from chemo- and radiation therapy.  in a previous clinical study, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified as a positive predictor for oral ulcerations after hematopoetic stem cell transplantation, possibly incriminating p. gingivalis in delayed healing of the ulcerations. therefore, it was tested whether p. gingivalis and its secreted products could inhibit the migration of oral epithelial cells in an in vitro scratch assay. to compare, the oral bacteria prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and streptococcus mitis were included. a standardized scratch was made in a confluent layer of human oral epithelial cells. the epithelial cells were challenged with bacterial cells and with medium  containing secretions of these bacteria. closure of the scratch was measured after 17 h using a phase contrast microscope. p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and secretions of p. gingivalis strongly inhibited cell migration. a challenge with 1000 heat-killed bacteria versus 1 epithelial cell resulted in a relative closure of the scratch of 25% for p. gingivalis and 20% for p. nigrescens. weaker inhibitory effects were found for the other bacteria. the results confirmed our hypothesis that the oral bacteria may be involved in delayed wound healing.

TI  == efficacy of a new mouth rinse formulation based on 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride in the control of plaque and gingivitis: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == aim: to assess the efficacy of a 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) mouth rinse in the control of plaque and gingival inflammation during a 6-month period. material and methods: adult subjects with moderate gingivitis were selected [>/=40% bleeding on marginal probing (bomp)]. after retrieving microbiological samples and evaluating the clinical parameters (plaque, bomp and stain indexes),  a professional prophylaxis was performed and subjects were randomly assigned to the test (cpc mouth rinse) or to the placebo group. subjects were re-assessed after 3 and 6 months. results: a total of 67 patients (35 test, 32 placebo) were  included in the analysis. at 6 months, intra-group significant plaque reductions  were observed in the test group (0.691, p < 0.001), but not in the placebo (0.181, p = 0.653). at 6 months, the mean bomp values were lower in the test group (p = 0.052). changes between baseline and 6 months were significantly higher in the test group both for plaque (p = 0.002) and bomp (p = 0.037) when compared with the placebo. a microbiological impact was observed in the test group, especially for prevotella intermedia. conclusion: the evaluated 0.07% cpc-based mouth rinse, used three times per day adjunctively to mechanical tooth  cleaning, prevents plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation, as compared to  the placebo, for at least 6 months.

TI  == the association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in brazilian adults with hiv: a multilevel analysis.
AB  == background: this study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load (hvl) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with hiv. methods: thirty-seven individuals with hiv were divided into two groups: 1) detectable hvl (n = 15); and 2) undetectable hvl (n = 22). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, fisher exact test, and mann-whitney u test were used to compare groups. multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between hvl and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. results: of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable hvl group than undetectable hvl group (p <0.001). these species included actinomyces naeslundii  ii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter concisus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and candida  albicans. significant associations between detectable hvl and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for a. naeslundii i, actinomyces gerencseriae, c. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythia, and dialister pneumosintes. conclusion: detectable plasmatic hvl in individuals with hiv was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as p. nigrescens, t. forsythia, and e. corrodens, as well as c. concisus, c. gingivalis, and d. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == subgingival root brushing in deep human periodontal pockets.
AB  == objective: the short-term clinical and microbiological effects of patient-applied subgingival root brushing were assessed on untreated deep human periodontal pockets. methods: assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, total cultivable subgingival counts, and cultivable counts and proportions of six putative periodontal pathogens were carried out at baseline and after 14 days on  two contralateral > or = 6 mm bleeding interproximal posterior sites in each of 11 adults with untreated chronic periodontitis. one of the sites was randomly assigned to daily patient-applied subgingival root brushing for 14 days, and the  other to remain with the patient's pre-existing tooth brushing and flossing regimen. no other periodontal therapy was performed during the 14 test days. results: significant reductions in plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, total subgingival counts, and levels of putative periodontal pathogens were found after 14 days of subgingival root brushing. subgingival root brushing nearly eliminated bleeding on probing at test sites, reduced probing depths by a mean of 1.8 mm, and reduced cultivable subgingival proportions of six evaluated putative  periodontal pathogens from a cumulative total of 14.1% to 0.8%. in comparison, no significant clinical or microbiological changes were detected after 14 days where the patient's pre-existing oral hygiene regimen remained unaltered. conclusions:  subgingival root brushing over 14 days, in properly trained patients, induced favorable clinical and microbiological changes in deep periodontal pockets > or = 6 mm even in the absence of professional subgingival debridement.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == background: patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. this study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with cp.  methods: subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with cp in the united states. the samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/l, clindamycin at 4 mg/l, doxycycline at 4 mg/l, and metronidazole at 16 mg/l, with a post hoc combination of data for  amoxicillin and metronidazole. gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. results: overall, 74.2% of the patients with cp revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. one or more test species, most often prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, or aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with cp, respectively. fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either s. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). conclusions: patients with cp in the united states frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. the wide variability  found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with  cp.

TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in human periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: beta-lactam antibiotics prescribed in periodontal therapy are vulnerable to degradation by bacterial beta-lactamases. this study evaluated the occurrence of beta-lactamase-positive subgingival bacteria in chronic periodontitis subjects of usa origin, and assessed their in vitro resistance to metronidazole at a breakpoint concentration of 4 mug/ml. material and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from deep periodontal pockets with bleeding on probing were removed from 564 adults with severe chronic periodontitis before treatment. the samples were transported in vmga iii and then plated onto: (i) nonselective enriched brucella blood agar (ebba) and incubated anaerobically for 7 d; and (ii) selective trypticase soy-bacitracin-vancomycin (tsbv) and incubated for 3 d in air + 5% co2 . at the end of the incubation periods, the bacterial test species were identified and quantified. specimen dilutions were also plated onto ebba plates supplemented with 2 mug/ml of amoxicillin, a combination of 2 mug/ml of amoxicillin plus 2 mug/ml of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, or 4 mug/ml of metronidazole, followed  by anaerobic incubation for 7 d. bacterial test species presumptively positive for beta-lactamase production were identified by growth on ebba primary isolation plates supplemented with amoxicillin alone and no growth on ebba primary isolation plates containing both amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. a subset of such isolates was subjected to nitrocefin-based chromogenic disk testing to confirm the presence of beta-lactamase activity. in vitro resistance to 4 mug/ml  of metronidazole was noted when growth of test species occurred on metronidazole-supplemented ebba culture plates. results: two-hundred and ninety-four (52.1%) of the study subjects yielded beta-lactamase-producing subgingival bacterial test species, with prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum and other prevotella species most frequently identified as beta-lactamase-producing organisms. of the beta-lactamase-producing bacterial  test species strains recovered, 98.9% were susceptible in vitro to metronidazole  at 4 mug/ml. conclusion: the occurrence of beta-lactamase-positive subgingival bacterial species in more than half of the subjects with severe chronic periodontitis raises questions about the therapeutic potential of single-drug regimens with beta-lactam antibiotics in periodontal therapy. the in vitro effectiveness of metronidazole against nearly all recovered beta-lactamase-producing subgingival bacterial species further supports clinical  periodontitis treatment strategies involving the combination of systemic amoxicillin plus metronidazole.

TI  == genome-wide association study of periodontal pathogen colonization.
AB  == pathological shifts of the human microbiome are characteristic of many diseases,  including chronic periodontitis. to date, there is limited evidence on host genetic risk loci associated with periodontal pathogen colonization. we conducted a genome-wide association (gwa) study among 1,020 white participants of the atherosclerosis risk in communities study, whose periodontal diagnosis ranged from healthy to severe chronic periodontitis, and for whom "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization quantification of 8 periodontal pathogens was performed. we examined 3 traits: "high red" and "high orange" bacterial complexes, and "high" aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) colonization. genotyping was performed on the affymetrix 6.0 platform. imputation to 2.5 million markers was based on hapmap ii-ceu, and a multiple-test correction was applied (genome-wide threshold  of p < 5 x 10(-8)). we detected no genome-wide significant signals. however, 13 loci, including kcnk1, fbxo38, uhrf2, il33, runx2, trps1, camta1, and vamp3, provided suggestive evidence (p < 5 x 10(-6)) of association. all associations reported for "red" and "orange" complex microbiota, but not for aa, had the same  effect direction in a second sample of 123 african-american participants. none of these polymorphisms was associated with periodontitis diagnosis. investigations replicating these findings may lead to an improved understanding of the complex nature of host-microbiome interactions that characterizes states of health and disease.

TI  == comparison of endotoxin levels found in primary and secondary endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: this clinical study was conducted to compare the levels of endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides [lpss]) found in primary and secondary endodontic infections with apical periodontitis by correlating lps contents with clinical/radiographic findings. in addition, the presence of target gram-negative anaerobic bacteria was also investigated. methods: samples were taken from 15 root canals with primary infections and 15 with secondary infections by using paper points. the limulus amebocyte lysate assay was used to quantify endotoxins, and the polymerase chain reaction technique (16s rdna) was used for bacterial investigation. results: endotoxins were detected in 100% of the root canal samples collected from primary (15/15) and secondary (15/15) infections with median values of 7.49 eu/ml and 3.96 eu/ml, respectively (p < .05). the median value of endotoxins found in the presence of clinical symptoms was significantly  higher than in asymptomatic teeth with primary infections (p < .05). a positive correlation was found between endotoxin contents and a larger size of the radiolucent area (>3 mm) (p < .05). prevotella nigrescens (10/15, 4/15), fusobacterium nucleatum (5/15, 1/15), treponema denticola (3/15, 1/15), and treponema socranskii (5/15, 1/15) were detected in teeth with primary and secondary infections, respectively. p. endodontalis was present only in teeth with primary infections (5/15). conclusions: teeth with primary endodontic infections had higher contents of endotoxins and a more complex gram-negative bacterial community than teeth with secondary infections. moreover, the levels of endotoxins were related to the severity of bone destruction in periapical tissues as well as the development of clinical features in teeth with primary infections.

TI  == association of periodontitis with increased colonization by prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == aim: to estimate differences in the prevalence of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in the subgingival plaque of patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis) compared to healthy controls, and to search for significant associations with clinical status. methods: sixteen patients and 16 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. interproximal plaque index, oral hygiene index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were recorded. samples of subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual and immediately plated on appropriate supplemented columbia agar. black pigmented colonies were identified with the rapid id32 a system, and further differentiated using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of  flight mass spectrometry. for the statistical analysis, chi-squared test and the  mann-whitney u-test were used. results: prevotella nigrescens was isolated from 10 patients and three controls, while p. intermedia was isolated from only two patients. p. nigrescens was found more frequently in the subgingival plaque of patients (p = 0.029), and was significantly associated with high values of clinical indices (p </= 0.025). significant differences for p. intermedia were not found. conclusions: periodontitis seems to be associated with increased colonization with p. nigrescens. whether or not it is a major pathogen needs to be determined.

TI  == subgingival microbiota from cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  == this present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the tufted capuchin monkey procreation center (sao paulo state university - unesp) or free-ranging monkeys. for this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. the primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to vmga iii transport medium and ultrapure water. the microbiota was  cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial dna was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using pcr and real-time pcr. the actinomycetes, fusobacteria, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods, tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dialister pneumosintes and prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas treponema denticola was not found. populations of c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.

TI  == quantification of cultivable bacteria and endotoxin in post-treatment apical periodontitis before and after chemo-mechanical preparation.
AB  == this clinical study was conducted to quantify cultivable bacteria and endotoxin in root canals with post-treatment apical periodontitis by correlating their levels with clinical features and to evaluate the effect of chemo-mechanical preparation (cmp) with 2 % chlorhexidine gel + 17 % edta on bacterial and endotoxin removal/elimination. moreover, target strict gram-negative anaerobic bacteria were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). fifteen teeth with post-treatment apical periodontitis were sampled before (s1) and after (s2) cmp.  culture techniques determined the number of colony-forming units (cfu). pcr (16s  rdna) and limulus amebocyte lysate (lal) assay were used for bacterial and endotoxin detection, respectively. prevotella nigrescens (4/15), prevotella intermedia (2/15), and tannerella forsythia (2/15) were the most frequently detected species. endotoxin was recovered in 100 % of the samples. at s1, bacteria and endotoxin were detected at a median value of 5.14 x 10(3) cfu/ml and 3.96 eu/ml, respectively. higher levels of endotoxin were related to a larger size of radiolucent area (>5 mm) (p < 0.05). cmp was more effective in reducing bacteria (99.61 %) than endotoxin (60.6 %) (both p < 0.05). our findings indicated that the levels of endotoxin found in infected root canals were related to a larger size of radiolucent area in the periapical region. moreover, cmp was  effective in reducing both bacterial and endotoxin contents in post-treatment apical periodontitis.

TI  == butyric acid induces apoptosis in both human monocytes and lymphocytes equivalently.
AB  == short-chain fatty acids (scfas) are metabolites from anaerobic periodontopathic bacteria that induce apoptosis in immune cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages. however, it remains unclear if scfas from pathogens induce apoptosis in monocytes/macrophages similarly with lymphocytes. this study investigated whether scfas-induced apoptosis is equal among the immunoregulatory cells. cell apoptosis of the employed human cells was evaluated after treatment with culture  supernatants from various periodontopathic bacteria or sodium butyrate. apoptosis and viability were determined by detection of dna fragmentation and using an mts  assay kit, respectively. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum culture filtrates strongly induced apoptosis whereas prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia culture filtrates failed to induce apoptosis in the thp-1 and u937 human monocyte and macrophage cell lines. healthy gingival fibroblasts and oral epithelial cells were resistant to all the culture filtrates. gas-liquid chromatography detected butyric acid in p. gingivalis (21.0-34.0 mm) and f. nucleatum (36.0 mm) in culture filtrates, whereas, only trace levels were seen in p. nigrescens and p. intermedia. these results suggest that butyric acid produced by periodontopathic bacteria severely damages immunoregulatory cells in a consistent manner and, likewise, could be involved in mediating periodontal chronic inflammation.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from hiv- and hiv+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == objective: to compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from hiv-negative and hiv-positive subjects. materials and methods: root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 hiv- and 20 hiv+ subjects. pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (mda). then, checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. the percentage of dna probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the mann-whitney test and the chi-square analysis, respectively. results: the most prevalent taxa detected were dialister pneumosintes, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sobrinus, corynebacterium diphteriae, and helicobacter pylori among hiv- subjects and d. pneumosintes, prevotella tannerae, porphyromonas gingivalis, parvimonas micra, prevotella nigrescens, and  corynebacterium diphtheriae among hiv+ individuals. d. pneumosintes, c. diphtheria, and c. albicans were the most abundant species in the hiv- group, whereas the predominant taxa in hiv+ samples were p. tannerae, d. pneumosintes and olsenella uli. p. tannerae, o. uli, veilonella dispar, bacteroides fragilis,  and actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in hiv+ samples. conclusions: there were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between hiv- and hiv+ individuals. the root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in hiv+ individuals.

TI  == microbial profile of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: to define and compare the microbiologic profile of subgingival plaque  in german patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic  periodontitis) and healthy subjects and to determine significant association between isolates and clinical status. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are major periodontal pathogens, though it is recognized that other species may also contribute to the  pathogenesis of periodontal disease. method and materials: thirty-three patients  with clinical and radiologic proof of aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. clinical indices were recorded as six-point measurements on each tooth. samples of the subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. the samples were divided into two parts. one part was immediately cultivated, while the other one was stored at -20 degrees c until analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 284 anaerobic isolates (224 isolates from patients and 60 isolates from healthy controls) were identified. forty different anaerobic species were isolated, with a mean of 6.78  species per patient and 3 species per healthy control subject. significant differences in prevalence (after adjusting for multiple comparisons, p < .001) were found for prevotella intermedia and nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, t forsythia, treponema denticola, and veillonella parvula. the first four species were associated with the aggressive periodontitis group and v parvula with healthy subjects. conclusion: when compared with healthy controls, the microbial  profile of subgingival plaque from periodontitis was found to contain known periodontal pathogens with a different prevalence to that described in earlier studies. p intermedia/nigrescens, f nucleatum, t forsythia, and t denticola have  been found in lower proportions and small quantities in healthy subjects.

TI  == surface properties of titanium and zirconia dental implant materials and their effect on bacterial adhesion.
AB  == objectives: zirconia ceramic material has been widely used in implant dentistry.  in this in vitro study the physiochemical properties of titanium and zirconia materials were investigated and the affinity of different bacteria to different materials was compared. methods: disc samples with different surface states were  used: polished partially stabilized zirconia (pz), titanium blasted with zirconia (tbz), titanium blasted with zirconia then acid etched (tbza), and polished titanium (pt) as a control. surface topography was examined using scanning electron microscopy and profilometry. contact angle, surface free energy (sfe), surface microhardness and chemical composition were determined. disc samples were separately incubated with streptococcus mitis and prevotella nigrescens, either with or without pre-coating with human saliva, for 6h and the surface area covered by bacteria was calculated from fluorescence microscope images. results:  pz and tbz exhibited lower surface free energy and lesser surface wettability than pt. also, pz and tbz surfaces showed lower percentage of bacterial adhesion  compared with control pt surface. conclusions: the zirconia material and titanium blasted with zirconia surface (tbz surface) showed superior effect to titanium material in reducing the adhesion of the experimented bacteria especially after coating with saliva pellicle. modifying titanium with zirconia lead to have the same surface properties of pure zirconia material in reducing bacterial adhesion. sfe appears to be the most important factors that determine initial bacterial adhesion to smooth surface.

AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == early microbial succession in redeveloping dental biofilms in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  == background and objective: the development of dental biofilms after professional plaque removal is very rapid. however, it is not clear whether most bacterial species return at similar rates in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects or if there are differences in bacterial recolonization between supragingival and subgingival biofilms in periodontal health and disease. material and methods: supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects immediately  after professional cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d of no oral hygiene and analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage of dna probe counts were averaged within subjects at each time-point. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving-window analysis. results: succession in supragingival biofilms from subjects with periodontitis and from healthy individuals was similar. at 1 d, streptococcus mitis and neisseria mucosa showed increased proportions, followed by capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, veillonella parvula and streptococcus oralis at 1-4 d. at 4-7 d, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella nigrescens became elevated. subgingival plaque redevelopment was slower and very different from supragingival plaque redevelopment. increased proportions were first observed for s. mitis, followed by v. parvula and c. gingivalis and, at 7 d, by capnocytophaga sputigena and p. nigrescens. no significant increase in the proportions of periodontal pathogens was observed in any of the clinical groups or locations. conclusion: there is a defined order in bacterial species succession in early supragingival and subgingival biofilm redevelopment after professional cleaning.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque before and during the early period of orthodontic treatment.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes in subgingival microbiota before and during the leveling and alignment orthodontic stage using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (17 females and  13 males; aged 16.7 +/- 6.5 y) were included in this study. subgingival microbial samples were taken from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors, the left lower central incisors, the mesio-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper first molars, and the left lower first molars, at four  different times: at baseline, before placement of orthodontic appliances (t1), and 1 week (t2), 3 months (t3), and 6 months after placement of orthodontic appliances (t4). dna was extracted from the samples, and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobactor rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola, which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of t forsythia, c rectus, and p nigrescens significantly increased after placement of orthodontic appliances. for the other species, the frequency tended to increase but no statistically significant difference was noted. the frequency of the change, representing microorganisms not existing at t1 but newly developing at t2, t3, and t4, was higher at the molars than at the incisors. conclusion: the placement of orthodontic appliances affects the subgingival microbial composition even during  the early period of orthodontic treatment, increasing the prevalence of periodontopathogens, especially in the molar region.

TI  == prevotella nigrescens and porphyromonas gingivalis are associated with signs of carotid atherosclerosis in subjects with and without periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: oral microorganisms may be involved in the development  of cardiovascular diseases, and porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the periodontal microorganisms that has been found in carotid atheroma. the aim of this work was to study subgingival microorganisms and early carotid lesions in subjects with and without periodontitis. material and methods: eighty-eight subjects with periodontitis and 40 subjects without periodontitis underwent dental examinations in 2003. the presence of the periodontal microorganisms aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and tannerella forsythia was analyzed from subgingival plaque using pcr amplification. the common carotid artery was scanned using ultrasound and the calculated intima-media area (cima) was measured. the association between periodontitis, the cima value and the presence of periodontal microorganisms, together with several confounders, was studied in a multiple logistic regression model. results: smoking [odds ratio (or) = 5.64; p = 0.001),  level of education (or = 5.02; p < 0.05) and the presence of p. gingivalis (or =  6.50; p < 0.05) were associated with periodontitis. explanatory factors for the increased cima were periodontitis (or = 4.22; p < 0.05), hypertension (or = 4.81; p < 0.05), high body mass index (or = 5.78; p < 0.01), male gender (or = 3.30; p  < 0.05) and poor socioeconomic status (or = 4.34; p < 0.05). p. nigrescens (or 4.08; p < 0.05) and p. gingivalis (or 7.63; p < 0.01) also appeared as explanatory variables associated with increased cima values. conclusion: this cross-sectional study showed that p. nigrescens and p. gingivalis were significantly associated with increased cima values.

TI  == gingival tissue transcriptomes in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == aims: we investigated the sequential gene expression in the gingiva during the induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis. material and methods: twenty periodontally and systemically healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in a 3-week experimental gingivitis protocol, followed by debridement and 2-week regular plaque control. we recorded clinical indices and harvested gingival tissue samples from four interproximal palatal sites in half of the participants  at baseline, day 7, day 14 and day 21 (the "induction phase"), and at day 21, day 25, day 30 and day 35 in the other half (the "resolution phase"). rna was extracted, amplified, reversed transcribed, amplified, labelled and hybridized using affymetrix human genome u133plus2.0 microarrays. paired t-tests compared gene expression changes between consecutive time points. gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. results: the median gingival index was 0 at baseline, 2 at day 21 and 1 at day 35. differential gene regulation peaked during the third week of induction and the first 4 days of resolution. leucocyte transmigration, cell adhesion and antigen processing/presentation were the top differentially regulated pathways. conclusions: transcriptomic studies enhance our understanding of the pathobiology of the reversible inflammatory gingival lesion and provide a detailed account of  the dynamic tissue responses during the induction and resolution of experimental  gingivitis.

TI  == effect of teenage smoking on the prevalence of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the aim of our study was to investigate how teenage smoking affects the prevalence of periodontal bacteria and periodontal health with the hypothesis that smoking increases the prevalence of the bacteria. oral health of 264 adolescents (15- to 16-year-olds) was clinically examined, and their smoking history was recorded. the participants also filled in a structured questionnaire  recording their general health and health habits. pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. the prevalence of p.  intermedia (21% vs. 4%, p = 0.01) and t. forsythia and t. denticola (23% vs. 8%,  p < 0.05, for both) was higher among female smokers than among non-smokers. t. forsythia and t. denticola were more often associated with bleeding on probing (29% vs. 12%; 25% vs. 10%, respectively) and deep pockets (25% vs. 15%; 23% vs. 10%, respectively) with smokers than non-smokers. among the girls, a significant  association was found between pack-years and the prevalence of p. nigrescens (p < 0.007). in both genders, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were rare in  this study. to conclude, periodontal bacteria were associated with higher periodontal index scores among all teenage smokers. smoking girls harbored more frequently certain periodontal bacteria than non-smokers, but this was not seen in boys. hence, our study hypothesis was only partly confirmed.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens and severity of periodontitis in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.
AB  == objective: in this study of patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), the severity of the disease and the main periodontal pathogens identified in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) were compared with those detected in individuals without systemic disease. design: nineteen patients with cp without evidence of systemic disease (control group), 25 patients with cp and ckd who were in the pre-dialysis stages (pre-dialysis group), and 22 patients with cp and ckd who were on renal replacement therapy (rrt group) were examined. the severity of cp was based on the investigation of probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal). the definition and stage of ckd were based on the criteria proposed by the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative of the national kidney foundation. glomerular filtration rate (gfr) was estimated using  the equation of modification of diet in renal disease and the identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque was performed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: candida albicans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were more common in patients who were on rrt and pre-dialysis than in control subjects. cp was more severe in patients with ckd. a strong association was observed between the frequency of c. albicans (p =  0.056), p.gingivalis (p = 0.008), t. denticola (p = 0.013) and cal, when ckd patients were compared with the control group. conclusion: cp is more severe and  is associated with increased frequency of c. albicans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in patients with ckd.

TI  == photobleaching of red fluorescence in oral biofilms.
AB  == background and objective: many species of oral bacteria can be induced to fluoresce due to the presence of endogenous porphyrins, a phenomenon that can be  utilized to visualize and quantify dental plaque in the laboratory or clinical setting. however, an inevitable consequence of fluorescence is photobleaching, and the effects of this on longitudinal, quantitative analysis of dental plaque have yet to be ascertained. material and methods: filter membrane biofilms were grown from salivary inocula or single species (prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia). the mature biofilms were then examined in a custom-made lighting rig comprising 405 nm light-emitting diodes capable of delivering 220 w/m(2) at the sample, an appropriate filter and a digital camera; a set-up analogous to quantitative light-induced fluorescence digital. longitudinal sets of images were captured and processed to assess the degradation in red fluorescence over time. results: photobleaching was observed in all instances. the highest rates of photobleaching were observed immediately after initiation of illumination, specifically during the first minute. relative rates of photobleaching during the first minute of exposure were 19.17, 13.72 and 3.43 arbitrary units/min for p. nigrescens biofilms, microcosm biofilm and p. intermedia biofilms, respectively. conclusion: photobleaching could be problematic when making quantitative measurements of porphyrin fluorescence in situ. reducing both light levels and exposure time, in combination with increased camera sensitivity, should be the default approach when undertaking analyses by quantitative light-induced fluorescence digital.

TI  == development of prevotella nigrescens-specific pcr primers based on the nucleotide sequence of a pn23 dna probe.
AB  == a previous study reported the cloning of a putative prevotella nigrescens-specific dna probe, pn23, using random shotgun method. the present study evaluated the species-specificity of pn23 for p. nigrescens using the clinical strains of prevotella intermedia and p. nigrescens to develop p. nigrescens-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primers. southern blot analysis showed that the dna probe, pn23, detected only the genomic dna of p. nigrescens strains. pcr showed that the two sets of pcr primers, pn23-f1/pn23-r1  and pn23-f2/pn23-r2, had species-specificity for p. nigrescens. interestingly, the two sets of pcr primers, pn23-f6/pn23-r6 and pn23-f7/pn23-r7, had strain-specificity for p. nigrescens atcc 33563. the detection limits of the four primer sets were 40 or 4 pg of the purified genomic dna of p. nigrescens atcc 33563. these results suggest that the dna probe, pn23, and the two sets of pcr primers, pn23-f1/pn23-r1 and pn23-f2/pn23-r2, can be useful for the detection of  p. nigrescens in the molecular epidemiological studies of oral infectious diseases.

TI  == bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide as an endodontic irrigant in a polymicrobial biofilm tooth model system.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this study was to determine bactericidal efficacy of 0.04% stabilized chlorine dioxide, 3% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate, and sterile distilled water in a polymicrobial biofilm model. methods: roots of 35 permanent bovine incisors had pulps extirpated, and their apical size and root length were standardized. teeth were coated with mucin, inoculated with  standardized suspensions of streptococcus sanguinis, actinomyces viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and prevotella nigrescens and incubated anaerobically. teeth were randomly divided into four groups and rinsed  for 3 minutes with 15 ml of irrigant. biofilms were harvested and spiral-plated on selective media. numbers of bacteria in the harvested biofilms was determined  via the standard spiral-plating methodology. treatment groups were evaluated using the nonparametric kruskal-wallis procedure. pair-wise comparisons among the four groups and five organisms were made using the wilcoxon-mann-whitney procedure. adjustments for multiple comparisons were made using the holm method with p < 0.05. results: results provide strong evidence of a significant difference in levels of bactericidal activity associated with the type of irrigant for all five bacterial species tested. levels of bactericidal activity were significantly higher for the naocl group than for the stabilized chlorine dioxide (clo(2)) group for s. sanguinis, a. viscosus, and p. nigrescens. results  for f. nucleatum and p. micros were not significant after the adjustment for multiple comparisons. conclusions: the triple-inoculation bovine tooth model system is a robust, consistent, and reproducible model system to study polymicrobial biofilms. it should be used with the knowledge expansion of biofilm structure and function as well as the development of antimicrobial protocols.

TI  == prevalence of periodontal bacteria in saliva of kuwaiti children at different age groups.
AB  == aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis and porphyromonas gingivalis and to a lesser extent prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens, are gram-negative species that are associated with destructive periodontitis. studies from different parts of the world have shown variable detection rates of periodontal organisms. hardly any data exist on their carriage in children living in the middle east. this study was designed to determine the detection of these species in the oral cavity of 240 generally healthy kuwaiti children, divided into five age groups: <6 years (n=40), 6-9 years (n=60), 10-12 years (n=40), 13-15 years (n=40) and 16-18 years  (n=60). saliva was used as the microbiological specimen, and the samples were analyzed by molecular methods using multiplex pcr. a total of 185 (77.1%) of the  240 children were colonized by at least one of the target periodontal bacteria. in all age groups, p. nigrescens was the most prominent and detected in saliva of 15%, 32%, 63%, 50%, and 47% of the children at the five age groups, respectively. p. gingivalis was detected only occasionally. only few pathogens were found before the permanent dentition, i.e. at the age of <6 years. the highest carriage rates were from the groups between 6 and 15 years of age. the salivary carriage of the pathogens was essentially similar in the age groups of 10-12 years and 13-15 years. in conclusion, except for p. gingivalis, the examined periodontal pathogens are relatively common findings in kuwaiti children and colonize the oral cavity from childhood onwards.

TI  == a microbiological study in relation to the presence of caries and calculus.
AB  == objective: to examine whether oral microflora in individuals with caries differs  from that of individuals with calculus in thai adolescents with poor oral hygiene. material and methods: one hundred 13-year-old schoolchildren from southern thailand were examined for the presence of caries, calculus and plaque and saliva ph was also determined. saliva samples were analysed by culture and approximal supragingival plaque samples were analysed with the dna-dna hybridization method ('checkerboard'). results: among the 100 children, mean dmfs was 3.43 [standard deviation (sd) 2.82] and 90% had calculus. the correlation between dmfs and the calculus index was 0.064. a total of 36 children were caries-free and 56 had calculus including teeth other than those in the lower anterior region (calculus score > or =3). a total of 23 caries-free children with a high calculus score (> or =3) were compared with 22 children with the highest dmfs [mean 11.19 (sd 5.58)] and a calculus score < 3. no significant difference was obtained for saliva and plaque ph. the salivary levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were low. significantly more children in the caries group had high levels of glycolytic prevotella nigrescens and filifactor alocis in plaque compared with the calculus group. calculus cases had a significantly higher total viable count in saliva. conclusions: there was no inverse correlation between the presence of caries and calculus at a population level and a high calculus score only marginally reduced the individual likelihood of having caries. several glycolytic bacteria were related to caries, while no specific bacteria could be related to calculus formation. calculus seemed to be more closely related to poor oral hygiene.

TI  == periodontal disease in mothers indicates risk in their children.
AB  == introduction: it is well established that severe periodontitis clusters in families, but there are no data about the relationship between mothers with chronic periodontitis and their children's periodontal status. objective: to evaluate a risk for periodontal diseases in children of periodontally diseased and healthy mothers. methods: four study groups were included: (i) 20 female patients with untreated generalized severe chronic periodontitis, (ii) their children (34), (iii) 13 periodontally healthy mothers and (iv) their children (13). material was collected from years 2004-2006. the clinical examination included registration of visible plaque index, modified gingival index and, bleeding sites on probing. periodontal microbiological samples were obtained from all study subjects and the isolates were identified according to morphology and biochemical profiles; similar interfamilial pathogens were compared by pcr-technique. results: the children of diseased mothers more frequently had periodontal diseases, especially gingivitis. in addition, clinical parameters of  gingival inflammation were more expressed and oral hygiene was worse in this group of children. vpi and vpi% of the diseased and healthy mothers differed significantly. the most common oral pathogens were p. intermedia/nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans. the children of healthy mothers harboured pathogens less frequently than the children of diseased mothers. the sharing of p. intermedia/nigrescens was more frequent (5 families) than a. actinomycetemcomitans (2 families). conclusion: maternal indicators, such as periodontitis, hygiene habits, and periodontal microflora are risk factors for childhood periodontal diseases, and might be predictive of future childhood and adolescent periodontitis.

TI  == the identification of genes specific to prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens using genomic subtractive hybridization.
AB  == prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens, which are often isolated from periodontal sites, were once considered two different genotypes of p. intermedia. although the genomic sequence of p. intermedia was determined recently, little is known about the genetic differences between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. the  subtractive hybridization technique is a powerful method for generating a set of  dna fragments differing between two closely related bacterial strains or species. we used subtractive hybridization to identify the dna regions specific to p. intermedia atcc 25611 and p. nigrescens atcc 25261. using this method, four p. intermedia atcc 25611-specific and three p. nigrescens atcc 25261-specific regions were determined. from the species-specific regions, insertion sequence (is) elements were isolated for p. intermedia. is elements play an important role in the pathogenicity of bacteria. for the p. intermedia-specific regions, the genes adenine-specific dna-methyltransferase and 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase  were isolated. the p. nigrescens-specific region contained a flavobacterium psychrophilum spra homologue, a cell-surface protein involved in gliding motility, prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845 glutathione peroxide, and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 leucyl-trna synthetase. the results demonstrate that the subtractive hybridization technique was useful for distinguishing between the two closely related species. furthermore, this technique will contribute to our understanding of the virulence of these species.

TI  == hydrogen sulfide production from cysteine and homocysteine by periodontal and oral bacteria.
AB  == background: hydrogen sulfide is one of the predominant volatile sulfur compounds  (vscs) produced by oral bacteria. this study developed and evaluated a system for detecting hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria. methods: l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase (metase) and beta carbon-sulfur (beta c-s) lyase were used to degrade homocysteine and cysteine, respectively, to produce hydrogen sulfide. enzymatic reactions resulting in hydrogen sulfide production were assayed by reaction with bismuth trichloride, which forms a black precipitate when mixed with hydrogen sulfide. the enzymatic activities of various oral bacteria that result in hydrogen sulfide production and the capacity of bacteria from periodontal sites to form hydrogen sulfide in reaction mixtures containing l-cysteine or dl-homocysteine were assayed. results: with l-cysteine as the substrate, streptococcus anginosus fw73 produced the most  hydrogen sulfide, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis american type culture collection (atcc) 33277 and w83 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 produced approximately 35% of the amount produced by the p. gingivalis strains. finally, the hydrogen sulfide found in subgingival plaque was analyzed. using bismuth trichloride, the hydrogen sulfide produced by oral bacteria was visually detectable as a black precipitate. conclusions: hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria was easily analyzed using bismuth trichloride. however, further innovation is required for practical use.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes that occur in the subgingival microbiota after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (11 males and 19 females; aged 20 +/- 7.3 yr) were included in this study. subgingival plaque samplings were gathered from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors and the left lower central incisors, and from the mesio-buccal gingival  crevice of the left upper first molars and the left lower first molars, at two different times: 2 weeks before appliance removal (t1), and 3 months after appliance removal (t2). dna was extracted from the samples and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , tannerella forsythia , campylobacter rectus , eikenella corrodens , porphyromonas gingivalis , prevotella intermedia , prevotella nigrescens , and treponema denticola , which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of positive sites at t1 and t2 was 65% and 43.3% for c. rectus , and 53.3% and 30.8% for e. corrodens , respectively. for the other bacteria, the frequency tended to be reduced between  times. conclusion: periodontopathogens during orthodontic treatment were significantly reduced within 3 months of appliance removal. however, how long it  takes to return to the preorthodontic composition of the subgingival microbiota and whether it happens at all remain to be seen.

AB  == two anaerobic, pigmented, non-spore-forming, gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped strains isolated from the human oral cavity, oma31(t) and oma130, were characterized by determining their phenotypic and biochemical features, cellular  fatty acid profiles and phylogenetic positions based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that the new isolates belonged to a single species of the genus prevotella. the two isolates showed 100 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with each other and were most closely related to prevotella intermedia atcc 25611(t) with 96.4 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity; the next most closely related strains to the isolates were prevotella pallens ahn 10371(t) (96.1 %) and prevotella falsenii jcm 15124(t) (95.3 %). phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of the isolates were the same as those of p. intermedia jcm 12248(t), p. falsenii jcm 15124(t) and prevotella nigrescens jcm 12250(t). the isolates could be differentiated from p. pallens jcm 11140( t)  by mannose fermentation and alpha-fucosidase activity. conventional biochemical tests were unable to differentiate the new isolates from p. intermedia, p. falsenii and p. nigrescens. however, hsp60 gene sequence analysis suggested that  strain oma31(t) was not a representative of p. intermedia, p. pallens, p. falsenii or p. nigrescens. based on these data, a novel species of the genus prevotella, prevotella aurantiaca sp. nov., is proposed, with oma31(t) (=jcm 15754(t)=ccug 57723(t)) as the type strain.

TI  == prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 targets host cell lamellipodia in epithelial cell adhesion and invasion.
AB  == introduction: the prevotella intermedia group bacteria, namely p. intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella pallens, are phylogenetically closely related and potentially connected with oral and gastrointestinal tract disease pathogenesis. the aim of the present study was to examine whether these species differ in their capabilities of adhesion to and invasion of epithelial cells. methods: adhesion and invasion were assayed by standard antibiotic/culture assays and fluorescent microscopy techniques. the effect of prevotella strains on epithelial cell viability was measured using a commercial cell proliferation assay. results: the strains p. intermedia atcc 25611 and p. nigrescens atcc 33263 adhered to epithelial cells, the adhesion numbers of p. intermedia being twice as high as those of p. nigrescens. these strains invaded epithelial cells but invasion was weak. the adhesion of p. intermedia was specifically targeted to epithelial cell lamellipodia. the number of adhered p. intermedia cells increased or decreased when the formation of lamellipodia was stimulated or inhibited, respectively. none of the tested strains showed toxic effects on epithelial cells; a clinical p. intermedia strain even increased the number of viable cells  by about 20%. conclusion: the results suggest that among the p. intermedia group  bacteria, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens type strains can adhere to and invade epithelial cells, the capability of p. intermedia atcc 25611(t) being highest in  this context. this strain proved to have a special affinity in binding to epithelial cell lamellipodia.

TI  == does the frequency of prevotella intermedia increase during pregnancy?
AB  == introduction: the former bacteroides intermedius, currently including prevotella  intermedia and prevotella nigrescens, has been associated with hormone-induced pregnancy gingivitis. the aim of the present longitudinal study was to determine  whether only p. intermedia or p. nigrescens, or both species, are involved in the demonstrated microbial shift during pregnancy. methods: subgingival plaque and saliva samples, collected from 30 healthy pregnant women and 24 healthy non-pregnant women as their controls, were examined for the presence of pigmented gram-negative anaerobes. altogether 2628 isolates were preliminarily identified as p. intermedia sensu lato, based on phenotypic testing. their further identification was performed by using a 16s ribosomal dna-based polymerase chain  reaction (pcr). results: a mean of 8.3 p. intermedia sensu lato isolates from each subject/sampling was examined. during the second trimester, the mean number  of p. intermedia sensu lato in plaque increased along with increasing signs of pregnancy gingivitis, and then both decreased. after delivery, gingival inflammation still decreased while the number of p. intermedia sensu lato transiently increased both in plaque and saliva. in the present study, the vast majority of isolates (95.3%) proved to be p. nigrescens and 2.5% were p. intermedia. the remaining 2.2% of the isolates could not be identified with pcr as p. intermedia or p. nigrescens. the corresponding percentages in the control population were 94.2%, 5.5%, and 0.3%. conclusion: in the oral cavity of relatively young women without periodontitis, p. nigrescens, unlike p. intermedia, is a frequent finding. conceivably, pregnant women harbor increasing  numbers of p. nigrescens associated with pregnancy gingivitis.

TI  == fetal exposure to oral pathogens and subsequent risk for neonatal intensive care  admission.
AB  == background: maternal periodontal infection has been associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. in utero fetal exposure to oral pathogens was also recognized as deleterious to the fetus. the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between fetal exposure to oral pathogens and neonatal  intensive care unit (nicu) admission. methods: this was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of maternal oral health and pregnancy outcome. fetal immunoglobulin m against oral pathogens was detected in umbilical cord serum by immunoblot. the presence of at least one oral pathogen-specific antibody was considered seropositivity. the cord level of c-reactive protein was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and categorized as detectable versus undetectable. chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used to determine  the association between cord serum seropositivity or detectable c-reactive protein and nicu admission and length of stay. results: of 650 infants, 45 (6.9%) were admitted to the nicu. the admission rate was higher among seropositive infants compared to seronegative infants (11% versus 5%; p = 0.0019). seropositive infants were also more likely than seronegative infants to stay >3 or >7 days (8% versus 3% and 6% versus 2%; p = 0.004 and 0.003, respectively). adjusting for gestational age, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for nicu  admission was 2.14 (1.01 to 4.54); for a length of stay >3 or >7 days, it was 2.38 (1.01 to 5.60) and 3.29 (1.13 to 9.58), respectively. the nicu admission rate was not significantly higher for those with detectable versus undetectable umbilical cord serum c-reactive protein (8% versus 6%; p = 0.3). conclusions: in  utero fetal exposure to oral pathogens increases the risk for nicu admission and  the length of stay. interventions that interrupt fetal exposure to oral pathogens may reduce these risks.

TI  == anti-biofilm properties of satureja hortensis l. essential oil against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == essential oils of several plants are widely used in ethnomedicine for their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. however, very limited data exist  on their use in connection to periodontal diseases. the aim of the present study  was to investigate the bacterial growth inhibiting and anti-biofilm effects of satureja hortensis l. (summer savory), salvia fruticosa m. (sage), lavandula stoechas l. (lavender), myrtus communis l., and juniperus communis l. (juniper) essential oils. chemical compositions of the essential oils were analyzed by gas  chromatography-mass spectrometry, minimum inhibitor concentrations (mics) with the agar dilution method, and anti-biofilm effects by the microplate biofilm assay. the toxicity of each essential oil was tested on cultured keratinocytes. of the 5 essential oils, s. hortensis l. essential oil had the strongest growth inhibition effect. subinhibitory dose of s. hortensis l. essential oil had anti-biofilm effects only against prevotella nigrescens. essential oils did not inhibit keratinocyte viability at the concentrations of 1 and 5 microl/ml, however at the concentration of 5 microl/ml epithelial cells detached from the culture well bottom. the present findings suggest that s. hortensis l. essential  oil inhibits the growth of periodontal bacteria in the concentration that is safe on keratinocytes, however, in the subinhibitory concentration its anti-biofilm effect is limited.

TI  == prevotella falsenii sp. nov., a prevotella intermedia-like organism isolated from monkey dental plaque.
AB  == eight anaerobic, pigmented, non-spore-forming, gram-negative, rod-shaped strains  isolated from monkey oral cavities were characterized phenotypically and chemotaxonomically and their phylogenetic positions were determined using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that these isolates represent a single species of the genus prevotella. these strains  were most closely related to prevotella intermedia atcc 25611(t), with 95.0 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the next most closely related species were prevotella pallens and prevotella nigrescens (92.7 and 92.1 % similarity to the respective type strains). the phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of the isolates were the same as those of p. intermedia jcm 12248(t) and p. nigrescens jcm 12250(t). the isolates could be differentiated from p. pallens jcm 11140(t) on the basis of mannose fermentation and alpha-fucosidase activity. the isolates  could not be distinguished from p. intermedia or p. nigrescens using conventional biochemical tests. dna-dna hybridization experiments revealed the genomic distinctiveness of these eight strains with respect to p. pallens jcm 11140(t), p. intermedia jcm 12248(t) and p. nigrescens jcm 12250(t). on the basis of these  data, strains 04013, 04021, 04043, 04052(t), 0406, 04113, 04111 and 04161 represent a novel prevotella species, for which the name prevotella falsenii sp.  nov. is proposed. the type strain is 04052(t) (=jcm 15124(t) =ccug 56137(t)).

TI  == similarities in the subgingival microbiota assessed by a curet sampling method at sites with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the goal of this study was to determine whether site-specific differences in the subgingival microbiota could be detected by the checkerboard method in subjects with periodontitis. methods: subjects with at least six periodontal pockets with a probing depth (pd) between 5 and 7 mm were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque samples were collected with sterile curets by a single-stroke procedure at six selected periodontal sites from 161 subjects (966  subgingival sites). subgingival bacterial samples were assayed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method identifying 37 species. results: probing depths of 5, 6, and 7 mm were found at 50% (n = 483), 34% (n = 328), and  16% (n = 155) of sites, respectively. statistical analysis failed to demonstrate  differences in the sum of bacterial counts by tooth type (p = 0.18) or specific location of the sample (p = 0.78). with the exceptions of campylobacter gracilis  (p <0.001) and actinomyces naeslundii (p <0.001), analysis by general linear model multivariate regression failed to identify subject or sample location factors as explanatory to microbiologic results. a trend of difference in bacterial load by tooth type was found for prevotella nigrescens (p <0.01). at a  cutoff level of > or = 1.0 x 10(5), porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) were present at 48.0% to 56.3% and 46.0% to 51.2% of sampled sites, respectively. conclusions: given the similarities in the clinical evidence of periodontitis, the presence and levels of 37 species commonly studied in periodontitis are similar, with no differences between molar, premolar, and incisor/cuspid subgingival sites. this may facilitate microbiologic sampling strategies in subjects during periodontal therapy.

TI  == periodontal and microbiologic evaluation of 2 methods of archwire ligation: ligature wires and elastomeric rings.
AB  == introduction: prophylactic programs to prevent dental biofilm accumulation must be implemented to minimize the risk for periodontal diseases in orthodontic patients. therefore, we assessed the possible periodontal and microbiologic changes resulting from the use of 2 methods of orthodontic archwire ligation: elastomeric rings and steel ligatures. methods: the following parameters were measured: plaque index, gingival bleeding index, probing depth, and biofilm samples from the maxillary second premolars and the mandibular lateral incisors were evaluated in 14 subjects without clinical signs of gingival inflammation before orthodontic appliance placement and after 6 months of treatment. each orthodontic arch was fixed with elastomeric rings on 1 side of the midline, and steel ligatures were used on the opposite side. polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and p nigrescens. results: the elastomeric rings were associated with a higher score for plaque index and bleeding than steel ligatures, as well as many positive sites of t forsythia and p nigrescens (p <0.05). conclusions: elastomeric rings favored these 2 periodontopathogens and harmed gingival conditions.

TI  == rapid identification of oral anaerobic bacteria cultivated from subgingival biofilm by maldi-tof-ms.
AB  == introduction: to facilitate the identification of anaerobes cultivated from periodontal disease, whole cell bacterial identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) was evaluated. methods: a total of 84 strains (nine reference strains and 75 recent clinical isolates from 33 patients with aggressive periodontitis) previously identified with phenotypic methods were used. all the references and 10 clinical  isolates belonging to the same species as the reference strains were genotypically identified by sequence analysis of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. all  the strains were then analyzed using maldi-tof-ms. results: the reference strains of anaerobic bacteria used showed characteristic maldi-tof-ms spectra with peaks  between m/z 2000 and up to about m/z 13,000. on visual inspection, the similarity of spectra produced by strains of a single genus could be recognized. obvious differences between spectra produced by strains of different species were also easily noticed. the reproducibility of the method was proved by the similarity of spectra belonging to the same species. the spectra of the prevotella intermedia strains identified with maldi clustered together and clustered separately from the spectra of prevotella nigrescens, proving that maldi-tof-ms is an accurate method that is capable of separating these two species. the quality of clustering was characterized by calculating an inconsistency coefficient (mathworks:/matlab  reference manual v2007a/, statistical toolbox). conclusion: our results suggest that maldi-tof-ms might become a useful method for the identification of anaerobic bacteria, especially for those that cannot be readily identified by biochemical analysis. it may become an attractive system even for the routine identification of clinical isolates.

TI  == third molars and the efficacy of mechanical debridement in reducing pathogen levels in pregnant subjects: a pilot study.
AB  == purpose: to assess the impact of mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing), without adjunctive therapy, on reducing the numbers of periodontal pathogens detected in pregnant subjects with and without visible third molars. patients and methods: sixty-seven subjects in the second trimester of pregnancy were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved study. full mouth periodontal exams of all teeth were conducted at baseline and postpartum. presence or absence of third molars was noted. subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from the mesiobuccal of all first molars at enrollment and postpartum. subjects' total counts for periodontal pathogens in biofilm samples were determined by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization. we analyzed data from a subsample of 26 subjects. all subjects in the study were treated at enrollment by mechanical debridement of all teeth, including third molars. differences between  subjects' baseline and postpartum demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed by chi(2) and t tests by presence or absence of third molars. statistical significance for differences in pathogen levels was determined by rank analysis of covariance. significance was set at 0.05 without correction for  multiple comparisons. results: most of the 26 subjects were african american (61%), on medicaid (92%), and did not smoke during pregnancy (88%). the 15 subjects with visible third molars were significantly older (28.0 years [sd 6.4]  vs 23.7 years [sd 3.9]). in the 11 subjects with no third molars noted, all pathogen counts were reduced postpartum. in the 15 subjects with visible third molars, total counts for each pathogen analyzed were higher postpartum as compared with subjects with no visible third molars, and their bacterial counts were increased for 5 of the 8 pathogens, including all "red cluster" pathogens. differences between study groups were observed by the presence or absence of third molars for t. forsythia and p. nigrescens (p = .04), and for p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, total "orange cluster" bacteria, and total pathogens (p < .06). conclusion: the efficacy of mechanical debridement to lower periodontal pathogen  counts during pregnancy was limited by the presence of visible third molars and should be analyzed further in larger scale trials.

TI  == the relationship of prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and prevotella melaninogenica in the supragingival plaque of children, caries and oral malodor.
AB  == purpose: a relationship between the distribution of periodontal bacteria species  and malodor in children has not been sufficiently investigated. the present study was undertaken to determine the presence of 3 periodontopathic bacteria (prevotella spp. p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, p. melaninogenica) in the supragingival plaques of 3 to 16-year-old children with different oral health conditions and oral malodor. methods: the number of decayed and filled primary teeth (df) and decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth (dmf), papillary marginal and attached gingivitis (pma) index, oral hygiene index (ohi), and oral  malodor of each subject were determined prior to the collection of supragingival  plaques. three periodontopathic bacteria (p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, p. melaninogenica) in supragingival plaques were detected by using an immunoslot blot assay with monoclonal antibodies specific for each microorganism. findings:  the frequencies of periodontopathic bacteria in children with and without caries  were not significantly different from each other. positivity for p. intermedia, but not for p. nigrescens or p. melaninogenica was correlated with oral malodor.  oral malodor was also correlated with the debris index, a component of ohi. the group with the higher ohi showed a higher prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria. for the 3 periodontopathic bacteria in the subjects tested, plaques positive for any of them were not age related. however the frequencies of all 3 periodontopathic bacteria were the highest in the 3-6-year olds. conclusion: the  supragingival plaques in children can harbor 3 species of periodontopathic bacteria, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and p. melaninogenica.

TI  == microbiologic and immunologic characteristics of periodontal disease in hispanic  americans with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: the microbiology of periodontitis in type 1 diabetes has been reported, but less is known about type 2 diabetes. moreover, these data have not  linked microbial colonization, host response, and clinical presentation in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. the objectives of this study were to relate periodontal status, periodontal microorganisms, and host-response characteristics in hispanic americans with type 2 diabetes. methods: plaque and serum samples were obtained from 63 hispanic american subjects with and without type 2 diabetes. the microbiology of subgingival plaque samples was evaluated using dna checkerboard hybridization, and serum antibody to a battery of oral microorganisms was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: in general, similar pathogens were present in periodontitis sites from subjects with and without type 2 diabetes, although the periodontitis sites in diabetes showed a higher frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and campylobacter spp. serum antibody to campylobacter rectus was elevated in type 2  diabetes, whereas antibody to p. gingivalis and c. rectus were elevated in subjects with periodontitis, irrespective of diabetes status. stratification of the population based upon antibody to p. gingivalis or c. rectus suggested a linkage between elevated antibody to p. gingivalis, increased frequency of diabetes, and significantly worse periodontitis. conclusion: the increased severity of periodontal disease with type 2 diabetes may reflect an alteration of the pathogenic potential of periodontal bacteria and/or a modification of the characteristics of the host's inflammatory response that may contribute to a breakdown in the homeostasis of the periodontium.

TI  == activation of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 by gram-negative periodontal bacteria.
AB  == background/aims: periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease associated with a  gram-negative subgingival microflora. bacterial components stimulate, among other receptors, toll-like receptor (tlr) 2 and/or tlr4. accumulating evidence indicates that both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct immune responses result from the triggering of tlr2 as compared to tlr4 triggering. the aim was to study the interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum and veillonella parvula with tlr2 and tlr4. we investigated all known serotypes (k(-), k1-k6) of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a-e strains for their potency to stimulate cytokine production. methods: human embryonic kidney (hek) cells, stably transfected with cd14, cd14-tlr2, or cd14-tlr4 and whole blood were stimulated with bacterial sonicates. cytokine production (interleukin-6, -8, -10 and -12) was measured in the supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: all test bacteria stimulated hek-cd14-tlr2, but only a. actinomycetemcomitans and v. parvula stimulated hek-cd14-tlr4. no differences were found in the activation  of hek-cd14-tlr2/4, or cytokine production in whole blood between serotypes of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: gram-negative periodontal bacteria predominantly stimulated tlr2, which may be of importance for the th1/th2 cell orientation of the immune response in periodontitis.

TI  == persistently high levels of periodontal pathogens associated with preterm pregnancy outcome.
AB  == background: few studies examining the association between periodontal diseases and preterm birth have explored the underlying microbial and antibody responses associated with oral infection. methods: a nested case-control study was performed using data from a recent interventional trial following the delayed-treatment control group of 31 subjects with periodontal diseases. the levels of eight oral bacteria and the maternal immunoglobulin g (igg) responses in serum to these bacteria were measured at antepartum and postpartum visits to determine the relationship to cases (preterm delivery <37 weeks' gestation) and controls (term delivery). results: antepartum, the levels of periodontal pathogens tended to be higher in the preterm (case group) deliveries compared to  the term deliveries (control group). maternal anti-porphyromonas gingivalis igg was significantly lower in the preterm group compared to the term group (p = 0.028). postpartum, levels of p. gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were statistically significantly higher in  preterm births compared to term deliveries, adjusting for baseline levels. the joint effects of red and orange microbial clusters were significantly higher in the preterm group compared to the term group. conclusions: high levels of periodontal pathogens and low maternal igg antibody response to periodontal bacteria during pregnancy are associated with an increased risk for preterm delivery. further studies elucidating the role of the microbial load and maternal immune response as related to pregnancy outcome seem merited.

TI  == prevalence of four putative periodontopathic bacteria in saliva of a group of brazilian children with mixed dentition: 1-year longitudinal study.
AB  == aim: this study aimed at evaluating the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, treponema denticola) in saliva of children with mixed dentition at two different time points, correlating these findings with a clinical parameter of gingival health. design: polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection was used to determine the prevalence of these bacteria in saliva of 64  children in 2003 and 60 children in 2004. gingival health was assessed by gingival index. result: sixty-two (96.9%) and 50 (83.3%) children presented low gingival inflammation, whereas 2 (3.1%) and 10 (16.7%) had moderate scores in 2003 and 2004, respectively. majority of the children (81.3% in 2003 and 73.3% in 2004) had detectable levels of at least one of the bacteria. the prevalence found was of 4.7% and 1.7% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 6.3% and 8.3% for p. gingivalis, 23.4% and 48.3% for p. nigrescens (p < 0.05), and 71.9% and 50% for t. denticola (p < 0.05) in 2003 and 2004, respectively. no significant relationship between gingival index and presence of these bacteria and combination of different species was found. conclusion: a high percentage of children harboured at least one of the putative periodontal pathogens in saliva,  but presented periodontally healthy conditions.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the periodontal status and oral microbiological patterns of a population with end-stage renal disease (esrd), undergoing haemodialysis (hd). design: this was a cross-sectional study, involving 52 patients from the nephrology department and 52 matched control subjects. materials and methods: the subjects had a periodontal clinical  examination; subgingival plaque samples were taken and analysed using a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test to detect porphyromas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. subgingival plaque and saliva samples were studied for candida and enterobacteriaceae. main outcome measures: most of the 104 subjects had some degree of loss of periodontal attachment (lpa) > or =3  mm [11 (10.5%) had severe lpa; 16 (15.4%) moderate lpa; and 64 (61.5%) mild lpa]. only 13 subjects (12.5%) presented good periodontal health. results: no statistically significant differences were found between the hd patients and the  control group regarding bleeding index, number of teeth, or percentage of lpa > or =3 mm. however, a statistically significant difference was seen in the degree  of oral hygiene. conclusions: on the basis of the findings presented here, we cannot associate esrd with more severe periodontal destruction. although hd patients presented a higher number of periodontopathic microorganisms than the matched controls, a prolonged duration of hd did not bear a statistically significant relationship with the percentage of sites with lpa > or =3 mm, specific microbiota or composition of biofilm.

TI  == interleukin-1alpha stimulation in monocytes by periodontal bacteria: antagonistic effects of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == periodontal pathogenic bacteria are associated with elevated levels of interleukin-1alpha (il-1alpha) but it is unclear if all species can induce cytokine production equally. porphyromonas gingivalis may be able antagonize il-1alpha induced by other species through the activity of its proteases or lipopolysaccharide (lps). monomac-6 cells and primary human monocytes were treated with culture supernatants from porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedius, veillonella atypical and prevotella nigrescens. il-1alpha protein levels were measured after 6 h of incubation. in addition, monocytes were co-stimulated with supernatants from p. gingivalis and other bacteria. the role of p. gingivalis proteases was tested using arg-x and lys-x mutant strains. the role of lps was investigated using purified p. gingivalis lps and polymixin depletion. all species tested induced significant il-1alpha production, but p. gingivalis was the weakest. co-stimulation of monocytes with p. gingivalis antagonized the ability of other bacterial species to induce il-1alpha production. this effect was at its greatest with c. rectus (resulting in a 70% reduction). gingipain mutant strains and chemical inhibition of protease activity did not reduce antagonistic activity. however, 100 ng/ml of p. gingivalis lps can reproduce the antagonistic activity of p. gingivalis culture supernatants. periodontitis-associated bacterial species stimulate il-1alpha production by monocytes. p. gingivalis can antagonize this effect, and its lps appears to be the crucial component. this study highlights the importance of mixed infections in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease because reduction of pro-inflammatory  cytokine levels may impair the ability of the host to tackle infection.

TI  == detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens in chronic endodontic infection.
AB  == black-pigmented anaerobic rods such as prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp. are involved in the etiology and perpetuation of endodontic infections. the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of these species in chronic endodontic  infections by using culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) techniques. samples of 100 patients with root canals displaying chronic endodontic infections were obtained by sterilized paper points. bacterial identification was performed  by using culture and pcr techniques. by culture, in 33% of the samples, p. intermedia-p. nigrescens (75.8%), p. gingivalis (27.3%), and p. endodontalis (9.1%) were identified, and by pcr 60% of the samples harbored p. nigrescens (43.3%), p. gingivalis (43.3%), p. intermedia (31.7%), and p. endodontalis (23.3%). the presence of these black-pigmented anaerobic rods alone or in association in chronic endodontic infections seems to be frequent. pcr is a very  sensitive technique for detecting dna from bacterial cells. culturing is only able to reveal living bacteria and is less sensitive for the identification of low numbers of bacterial cells.

TI  == synovial inflammation in active rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis facilitates trapping of a variety of oral bacterial dnas.
AB  == objective: to investigate the presence of oral bacterial dnas in serum and synovial fluid (sf) of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and psoriatic arthritis (psa). methods: serum and sf samples from 16 ra patients, 14  psa patients, and 9 osteoarthritis (controls) patients were extracted for oral bacterial dna. this was used in a checkerboard dna-dna-hybridization set up, to identify 40 different bacteria. results: mean number +/- standard deviation (sd)  of oral bacterial species in sera were 6.2 (3.2) in the ra group (p = 0.004) and  5.4 (2.7) in the psa group (p = 0.009) compared to 2.1 (1.7) in the controls. periodontitis associated species porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella nigrescens were exclusively detected in ra and psa. mean number (+/- sd) of oral  bacterial species in sf were 14.0 (6.8) in the ra (p = 0.001) and 19.4 (7.1) in the psa group (p < 0.001) compared to 4.0 (1.7) in controls. p. gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis and prevotella intermedia were exclusively identified in  ra and psa sf. higher means of dnas were found in ra sf compared to ra serum (p < 0.001), and in psa sf compared to psa serum (p < 0.001). higher concentrations of bacterial dnas were found in ra and psa compared to controls. conclusion: higher  variety and concentrations of oral bacterial dnas were found in sf compared to serum of ra and psa patients. these findings indicate that synovial inflammation  in ra and psa may favor trapping of oral bacterial dnas, suggesting a perpetuating effect of oral pathogens in joint disease.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of periodontally untreated mexican subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and aim: specific microbial profiles that may distinguish between generalized aggressive-periodontitis (gagp) and generalized chronic-periodontitis (gcp) have, to date, not been described. the purpose of the present study was to  describe the subgingival microbial composition of mexican subjects with gagp and  compare it with that of individuals with gcp and periodontal health (ph). material and methods: seventy-seven subjects with gagp (n=19), gcp (n=39) and ph  (n=19) were selected. clinical measurements included plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment  level. up to 28 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each subject and analysed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: gagp and gcp subjects harboured significantly higher levels and/or proportion of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (levels: p<0.001, proportion: p<0.01), prevotella nigrescens (p<0.05 levels) and "red" complex species (p<0.001 proportion) than ph subjects. all gagp subjects were carriers of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens. no significant differences in any of the 40 microbial species  tested were detected between gagp and gcp subjects. conclusions: our results revealed that the microbial differences between gagp and gcp subjects were only discrete and none of the bacterial species tested seemed to specifically differentiate the subgingival microbial profile of either periodontitis group.

TI  == microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. methods: ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period  of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. subsequently, a period of 21 days of  washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella parvula. the mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and p. melaninogenica. conclusion: the tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a  role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.

TI  == influence of combinations of bacteria on the levels of prostaglandin e2, interleukin-1beta, and granulocyte elastase in gingival crevicular fluid and on the severity of periodontal disease.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to investigate the simultaneous presence of periodontal microbiota on inflammatory markers in gingival crevicular fluid from  individuals with periodontal diseases. methods: a total of 82 individuals with periodontal disease (mean age: 54.3 +/- 3.0 years) and 31 periodontally healthy individuals (mean age: 53.2 +/- 3.0 years) were randomly chosen and underwent clinical oral examinations in 2003 with the determination of the dental plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), and periodontal probing depth (pd). the simultaneous presence of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-assessed periodontal bacteria, levels of prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)), granulocyte elastase, interleukin 1-beta (il-1beta), and total protein concentration were determined from the pockets. marginal bone height percent was measured on x-rays. analysis of variance and chi(2) tests were used to analyze the results. results: in sites  with tannerella forsythensis, levels of pge(2) (pg/site), granulocyte elastase (monoclonal antibodies (mabs)/site), and total protein (mg/ml) were significantly higher than in sites without t. forsythensis (p <0.05, p <0.01, and p <0.05, respectively). those with periodontal disease with simultaneous presence of t. forsythensis and porphyromonas gingivalis, or t. forsythensis and prevotella nigrescens, showed significantly higher pi and gi, deeper pd, more loss of attachment, and more release of pge(2) and granulocyte elastase than did periodontitis patients without these bacteria. conclusion: the simultaneous presence of t. forsythensis and p. gingivalis, or t. forsythensis and p. nigrescens, seemed to promote the release of subgingival inflammatory mediators and seemed to be associated with more severe periodontal disease.

TI  == inhibitory effects of macrocarpals on the biological activity of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background/aims: macrocarpals, which are phloroglucinol derivatives contained in  eucalyptus leaves, exhibit antimicrobial activity against a variety of bacteria including oral bacteria. this study examined effects of macrocarpals a, b, and c  on periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis. methods: macrocarpals a, b, and c were purified from a 60% ethanol-extract of eucalyptus globules leaves. to investigate antibacterial activity, representative periodontopathic bacteria were cultured in media with or without various amounts  of macrocarpals; subsequently, the optical density at 660 nm was measured. macrocarpal inhibition of p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases was assessed by spectrofluorophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. the effect of macrocarpals on p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was examined with  (3)h-labeled p. gingivalis. results: growth of p. gingivalis was inhibited more strongly than growth of prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola by macrocarpals, however, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum were much more resistant. macrocarpals inhibited p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases in a dose-dependent manner. the enzyme-inhibitory effect of macrocarpals was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis in which hemoglobin degradation by p. gingivalis proteinase was inhibited by macrocarpals. p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was also strongly attenuated by macrocarpals. conclusions: macrocarpals a, b and c demonstrated antibacterial activity against periodontopathic bacteria. among tested bacteria,  p. gingivalis displayed the greatest sensitivity to macrocarpals; additionally, its trypsin-like proteinase activity and binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite  beads were inhibited by macrocarpals. these results indicate that eucalyptus leaf extracts may be useful as a potent preventative of periodontal disease.

TI  == proteinase activity of prevotella species associated with oral purulent infection.
AB  == prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens are often regarded as principal causes of acute dentoalveolar infection; however, other species within the genus  are also known to be associated with such infection. the aim of this study was to determine the in vitro proteolytic activity of these different prevotella species that have been implicated with dentoalveolar infection. a total of 234 strains were obtained from pus specimens from dentoalveolar infection and from the plaque of healthy volunteers. prevotella loescheii, prevotella oralis, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella buccae, and prevotella denticola were all shown to have a proteolytic activity (8.5-10.5 x 10(-8) a-units) lower than that of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens (21.1-23.5 x 10(-8) a-units). in the case of p. loescheii, p. melaninogenica, and p. intermedia, the level of proteolytic activity for clinical strains was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that recorded for commensal strains. proteolytic activity for all species of prevotella examined was inhibited by n-ethylmaleimide and phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride. this study suggests that prevotella species associated with oral purulent infection produce cysteine and serine proteinases and that in certain species of prevotella, the strains involved in infection exhibit higher proteolytic activity when compared with strains from healthy sites.

TI  == effect of calcium glycerophosphate on demineralization in an in vitro biofilm model.
AB  == the aim was to investigate the anti-caries properties of calcium glycerophosphate (cagp) using an in vitro bacterial flow cell model. four flow cells, inoculated from a chemostat containing a seven-organism bacterial consortium, were pulsed with sucrose twice daily, to provide an acidic challenge and ph-cycling conditions. blocks of enamel and dentine were mounted in each flow cell. in a study on the effect of cagp concentration, cagp was pulsed into three of the flow cells, at the same time as the sucrose, to give concentrations of 0.10, 0.25 and  0.50%. water was pulsed into the fourth flow cell with the sucrose. microradiography revealed a significant dose response of decreasing demineralization as cagp concentration increased. reductions at 0.25 and 0.5% were significant when compared to the control. a second study investigated the effect of timing of cagp pulsing, relative to sucrose, on enamel and dentine demineralization. cagp (flow cell concentration 0.2%), was pulsed 1 h before, during or 1 h after the sucrose pulse; a water control was employed. in enamel, pulsing cagp before the sucrose reduced demineralization significantly compared to concurrent pulsing, which in turn gave a significant reduction compared to pulsing after sucrose, which did not reduce demineralization significantly compared to the water control. in dentine, cagp reduced demineralization significantly only when pulsed before the sucrose. the findings suggest that in vivo, the anti-caries potential of cagp may be greater if it is applied before a  cariogenic challenge.

AB  == background: the role played by odontogenic infection in dental, oral, and maxillofacial surgery is not to be underestimated even at the present time. an extensive, standardized, prospective study was performed with the intention of verifying the bacterial spectrum of odontogenic infections to evaluate antibiotic sensitivity. material and methods: bacterial spectra and resistograms of 65 patients with an odontogenic infection were analyzed in a prospective study under standardized conditions for specimen collection and transport. results: a total of 226 bacterial strains were analyzed. the ratio between anaerobes and aerobes was approximately 2:1. the most frequent aerobes were members of the genera streptococcus (46 isolates), staphylococcus (10 isolates), and neisseria (9 isolates), respectively. the anaerobic gram-positive spectrum was dominated by members of the genera eubacterium (19 isolates), peptostreptococcus (16 isolates), and actinomyces (12 isolates). the most frequently isolated gram-negative anaerobes were prevotella (46 isolates), and fusobacterium (21 isolates). the overall resistance to antibiotics was very low: only 7.3% of all bacteria were resistant to penicillin g/v, and 8.8% showed resistance to ampicillin. the resistance rates to other beta-lactam antibiotics were 4.4% to piperacillin and 0.6% to imipenem, respectively. penicillin g presented the highest antimicrobial activity among aerobes: only 4.5% of anaerobic strains were resistant of penicillin g. the other resistance rates of anaerobic bacteria to antibiotics were as follows: ampicillin 24%, doxycycline 34%, erythromycin 18%, and clindamycin 9.3%. penicillin g was also highly antimicrobially active to anaerobes. the resistance rates were: penicillin g 8.1%, ampicillin 2.6%, doxycycline 9.2%, erythromycin 10.2%, and clindamycin 1.4%, respectively.

AB  == this study investigated the mechanism of protein attachment to the surface of the putative periodontal pathogens prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in artificial gingival crevicular fluid, and ways to increase protein attachment to  the bacterial cells. the effects of cations on protein attachment, bacterial adhesion, and hemagglutination were examined, and cation-binding components on both bacterial species were identified. the presence of cations, especially zinc, copper and cerium, increased attachment of human serum proteins to both bacterial species. in contrast, the presence of hydrophobic inhibitors or sugars had little effect. protein attachment was reduced by heat treatment of the bacterial cells.  pretreatment of bacteria with human serum proteins inhibited adhesion of both species to buccal epithelial cells and hemagglutination. these effects were enhanced by the presence of zinc and copper during pretreatment. using a chelating column, specific zinc- and copper-binding proteins were identified on the surfaces of both bacterial species.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in endodontic lesions detected by culture and by pcr.
AB  == he aim of this study was to investigate the presence of four black-pigmented bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens, in endodontic infections by culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analyses. microbial samples were obtained from 50 teeth with untreated necrotic pulps (primary infection) and from 50 teeth with failing endodontic treatment (secondary infection). microbiological strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation, and identification. for pcr detection, the samples were analyzed using species-specific primers of 16s rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region. culture and pcr detected the test species in 13/100 and 50/100 of the study teeth, respectively. the organisms were cultured from 11/50 (22%) of primarily infected root canal samples and from 2/50 (4%) of secondary root canal samples. pcr detection identified the target species in 32/50 (64%) and 18/50 (36%) of primary and secondary infections, respectively. p. gingivalis was rarely isolated by culture methods (1%), but was the most frequently identified test species by pcr (38%). similarly, p. endodontalis was not recovered by culture from any tooth studied, but was detected by pcr in 25% of the sampled teeth. pcr-based identification also showed higher detection rates of p. intermedia (33%) and p. nigrescens (22%) than culture (13%). in conclusion, p. gingivalis, p. endodontalis, p. intermedia, and p. nigrescens were identified more frequently in teeth with necrotic pulp than in teeth with failing endodontic treatment. also, a higher frequency of black-pigmented species was detected by pcr than by culture.

TI  == clinical consequences of il-1 genotype on early implant failures in patients under periodontal maintenance.
AB  == background: implant failure and biologic complications such as periimplantitis are not completely avoidable. are there any genetic and microbiologic parameters  that could be used to identify patients at risk for implant failure, preferably prior to treatment? this would result in improvement of the diagnostics, treatment decision, and risk assessment. purpose: the aims of this retrospective  study were to describe (1) the absolute failure rate of branemark system implants (nobel biocare ab, goteborg, sweden) consecutively installed over a 10-year period in partially edentulous patients treated for periodontal disease prior to  implant treatment and under regular professional maintenance, (2) the rate of interleukin-1 (il-1) polymorphism in those patients who experienced at least one  implant failure during the first year of function, and (3) the prevalence of periodontal pathogens in dental and periimplant sites with and without signs of inflammation. material and methods: of 766 patients, 81 encountered at least one  implant failure; 22 patients were clinically examined and were tested genetically for il-1 genotypes. the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella nigrescens was analyzed. results: the absolute implant survival rate for the whole population was 95.32%; 10.57% of the patients encountered an implant loss. implant loss in the examined group (n = 22) was 32 of 106 (30.1%); 10 (45%) of the 22 patients were smokers, and 6 (27%) of the 22 patients were il-1 genotype positive. patients positive for il-1 genotype  were not more prone to implant loss; however, a significant synergistic effect with smoking was demonstrated. between patients who were il-1 genotype positive and those who were il-1 genotype negative, the differences in regard to bleeding  on probing or periodontal pathogens did not reach statistical significance. conclusion: the overall implant failure rate in a population treated and maintained for periodontal disease is similar to that of healthy subjects. a synergistic effect found between smoking and a positive il-1 genotype resulted in a significantly higher implant loss. this indicates that further research with a  larger patient group should focus on multifactorial analysis for adequate risk assessment.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens in atherosclerotic vessels.
AB  == background: epidemiological studies have shown that periodontitis may be associated with presence of atherosclerosis. dna from periodontal pathogens has been detected in atherosclerotic lesions, but viable oral bacteria have not yet been isolated from atherosclerotic plaques. the purpose of the present study was  to determine if viable oral bacteria could be isolated from atherosclerotic lesions and if dna from periodontal pathogens could be detected by use of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) techniques. methods: seventy-nine specimens of atherosclerotic plaque removed from carotid or femoral arteries during surgery were immediately transferred to reduced transport fluid and brought to the laboratory. the calcified tissue was meticulously cut into fine pieces and used for cultivation of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, and oral streptococci. the material from 24 of the specimens was homogenized, dna was extracted, and pcr amplification of 16s rdna with universal and specific primers was carried out. finally, the pcr products were sequenced. results: none of the samples yielded growth of the oral bacteria  under investigation. in all the 24 specimens bacterial dna was detected and likewise dna of p. intermedia was found in the samples. p. nigrescens and p. gingivalis were found sporadically. conclusions: viable oral bacteria could not be isolated from the atheromas, but the data confirm that dna of periodontal pathogens can be detected in atherosclerotic plaques. however, the finding that dna from p. intermedia constantly occured in the examined samples was new. further studies may focus on the simultaneous occurrence of identical clones of this species in subgingival plaque and atherosclerotic plaques.

AB  == we have found that broadband light (380 to 520 nm) rapidly and selectively kills  oral black-pigmented bacteria (bpb) in pure cultures and in dental plaque samples obtained from human subjects with chronic periodontitis. we hypothesize that this killing effect is a result of light excitation of their endogenous porphyrins. cultures of prevotella intermedia and p. nigrescens were killed by 4.2 j/cm2, whereas p. melaninogenica required 21 j/cm2. exposure to light with a fluence of  42 j/cm2 produced 99% killing of p. gingivalis. high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated the presence of various amounts of different porphyrin molecules in bpb. the amounts of endogenous porphyrin in bpb were 267 (p. intermedia), 47 (p. nigrescens), 41 (p. melaninogenica), and 2.2 (p. gingivalis) ng/mg. analysis of bacteria in dental plaque samples by dna-dna hybridization for 40 taxa before and after phototherapy showed that the growth of the four bpb was decreased by 2 and 3 times after irradiation at energy fluences  of 4.2 and 21 j/cm2, respectively, whereas the growth of the remaining 36 microorganisms was decreased by 1.5 times at both energy fluences. the present study suggests that intraoral light exposure may be used to control bpb growth and possibly benefit patients with periodontal disease.

TI  == a novel exopolysaccharide from a clinical isolate of prevotella nigrescens: purification, chemical characterization and possible role in modifying human leukocyte phagocytosis.
AB  == prevotella nigrescens, a gram-negative black-pigmented anaerobic rod, has frequently been isolated from periodontitis and periapical periodontitis lesions. we have isolated an exopolysaccharide-producing p. nigrescens, strain 22, from a  chronic periodontitis lesion. the purpose of this study was to determine the chemical composition and function of the exopolysaccharide associated with this clinical isolate. the chemical composition and structure of the purified exopolysaccharide from strain 22 were determined by high performance liquid chromatography and methylation analysis. to define the biological function of this exopolysaccharide, a chemically induced exopolysaccharide nonproducing mutant, strain 328, which was derived from strain 22, was established. the biological effects of exopolysaccharide were determined by comparing the ability  of strain 22, strain 328 or heat-killed strain 22 to form abscesses in mice and to interfere with the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes. chemical analysis showed that isolated exopolysaccharide consisted of mannose (521.6 microg/mg), glucose (25.6 microg/mg), fructose (65.8 microg/mg), galactose (12.5 microg/mg), arabinose (6.2 microg/mg), xylose (3.2 microg/mg), rhamnose (6.1 microg/mg), and ribose (0.6 microg/mg). methylation analysis of exopolysaccharide indicated that the linkages of mannose were primarily (1-->2, 1-->6) (1-->2) (1-->6), and (1-->3). strain 22 and, to a lesser extent, its heat-killed counterpart induced greater abscess formation in mice than strain 328, even though the enzymatic profile of strain 22 was similar to that of strain 328. the ability of strain 328 to induce abscess formation was restored by adding the purified exopolysaccharide isolated from strain 22 to the cell suspension of  strain 328. exopolysaccharide alone failed to induce abscess formation in mice. further, strain 328 but not the untreated or heat-killed strain 22, was phagocytosed by polymorphonuclear leukocytes both in the presence and in the absence of opsonic factors. the results suggest that these polysaccharides isolated from strain 22, which primarily consisted of mannose, may play a key role in the development of the chronic inflammatory lesion from which this strain was isolated.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261.
AB  == aims: to characterize the antimicrobial activity produced by prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261, and to evaluate its safety on cultured gingival fibroblasts. methods and results: an antimicrobial activity was obtained from purifying the culture supernatant of pr. nigrescens atcc 25261. purification of the active compound was achieved with ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. as revealed by sds-page, the active fraction was relatively homogeneous, showing a protein with an approximate molecular weight of 41 kda. the antimicrobial compound, named nigrescin, exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and actinomyces spp. nigrescin was stable in a ph range between 6.5 and 9.5, at 100 degrees c for 10 min, and resistant to lyophilization. but its activity was lost after proteinase k treatment. despite at very high concentrations beyond the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), nigrescin was not toxic to the gingival fibroblasts. conclusion: nigrescin is a novel bacteriocin produced by pr. nigrescens atcc 25261. it exhibits antimicrobial activity against species that are implicated in  periodontal diseases. the absence of toxicity on the gingival fibroblasts suggests the possibility in using of nigrescin for an application in periodontal  treatment. significance and impact of the study: novel evidence on nigrescin would make pr. nigrescens atcc 25261 attractive in biotechnological applications  as an antimicrobial agent in clinical dentistry.

TI  == contribution of periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa analyzed with real-time pcr to oral malodor.
AB  == oral malodor is considered to originate primarily from tongue microbiota populations. however, the relationship between oral malodor and tongue microbiota remains unclear. in this study, tongue periodontal pathogens were analyzed via real-time pcr, and the association between oral malodor and tongue periodontal pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola, was examined. the subject population consisted of 29 individuals with and 10 healthy persons without oral malodor. oral malodor was assessed by organoleptic test and volatile sulfur compound (vsc) levels as measured by gas chromatography. real-time pcr was conducted for anaerobes in tongue biofilm samples employing a lightcycler system; furthermore, bacterial proportion served as a quantitative parameter. among the five anaerobes, only t. forsythia displayed higher proportions in malodor subjects than corresponding values in healthy controls. proportions of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens correlated strongly with hydrogen sulfide concentration. proportions of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens also exhibited strong correlation with methyl mercaptan concentration. the correlation coefficient between the proportion of the total of the five anaerobes and total vsc level (r = 0.88) was greater than that between bacterial proportion and organoleptic score (r = 0.29). when a linear regression analysis was performed utilizing the proportion of each of the five periodontal pathogens as an independent variable, the explanatory power of these independent variables revealed 81% for total vsc level and 16% for organoleptic score. these results suggest that these five periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa may contribute greatly to vsc production.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic changes after removal of orthodontic appliances.
AB  == the goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological factors associated with orthodontic appliances during an episode of gingival inflammation and the impact of appliance removal on periodontal health. this prospective study included 10 patients, aged 12 to 20 years, with clinical signs of gingival inflammation at the final phase of orthodontic treatment (appliance removal). plaque index, gingival index, and probing depth were evaluated, and microbiological samples were collected from teeth 16, 11, and 26 at 2 times: during the gingival inflammation (baseline) and 30 days after the removal of the  appliance and professional prophylaxis. polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. a statistically significant improvement of the plaque and gingival indexes was seen, as well as a reduction in probing depth (p <.05). periodontal pathogens were associated with gingival inflammation during orthodontic treatment. the improvement in periodontal health at 30 days was concomitant with a reduction of  sites positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans and b. forsythus (p <.05). periodontal pathogens associated with gingival inflammation during orthodontic treatment can be significantly reduced by orthodontic appliance removal and professional prophylaxis.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbial outcome in patients with recurrent periodontal disease following treatment with 25% metronidazole gel using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). twenty subjects in a maintenance care  program but with recurrent periodontal disease participated. three months after scaling and root planing a total of 40 sites, 2 in each patient, with pocket probing depth of > or = 5 mm were selected. one site randomly selected was treated with 25% metronidazole gel (test) and the other site with a placebo gel (control). a bacterial sample was collected on paperpoint from each test and control site at baseline and 12 weeks after treatment. the following pathogens were analysed and detected with pcr:actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.),  porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.) and prevotella nigrescens (p.n.). at baseline, a.a., p.g. and p.n. were detected in 30, 60 and 70% of all test sites and in 32,  58 and 21% of all control sites. there was a statistically significant difference between the test and control sites for p.n. at baseline. the major difference after treatment with 25% metronidazole gel was the increase of positive control sites for p.g. and p.n. however, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence rate of a.a., p.g. and p.n. at test and control sites after treatment. this study has shown that 25% metronidazole gel treatment  did not seem to influence the microbial outcome, when pcr was used to analyse the presence/absence of a.a., p.g. and p.n. in this group of subjects with recurrent  periodontal disease.

TI  == effect of supragingival plaque control on subgingival microflora and gingivo-periodontal tissues.
AB  == the aim of this study was to carry out a short term evaluation of the effect of supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microflora and gingivoperiodontal tissues in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis. a total of 92 sites from 23 patients were studied; patients ranged between 35 and 60 years of age (x  46.4 +/- 1.71). plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), bleeding on probing (bp), probing depth (pd), and attachment level (al) were measured. subgingival microflora of the same sites was studied by dark field microscopy, and cultures in non-selective and selective media for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (pi/n), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and  fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). the patients were included in a supragingival plaque control program which included oral hygiene training and assessment, and professional control of supragingival plaque and calculus. after 28 days, measurement of clinical parameters and the microbiological study were repeated. the sites were divided according to baseline pd values into: group 1 (5 mm), group 2 (6 mm) and group 3 (> or = 7 mm). results revealed a significant reduction in pi scores, gi scores, pb and pd in groups 2 and 3. no significant difference in al was observed in any of the three groups. pi scores were found to decrease significantly in group 1, and gi scores, bp and pd tended to decrease. a significant increase in coccoid cells and a significant decrease in motile rods and spirochetes, both small and total, was observed in groups 2 and 3. group 1 showed a significant decrease in medium and total spirochetes. at the end of the  study, a significant decrease in pi/n was found in all three groups. significant  decreases were found in pg and fn in groups 3 and 2 respectively. although it holds true that supragingival plaque control reduced a potentially pathogenic subgingival microbiota, this effect was not sufficient to be compatible with healthy gingivoperiodontal tissues.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain  reaction with taqman probes.
AB  == quantitative analysis, with identification of periodontopathic bacteria, is important for the diagnosis, therapeutic evaluation and risk assessment of periodontal disease. we developed a highly sensitive and specific method using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect and quantify six periodontal  bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. species-specific taqman probe/primer sets were designed according to  16s ribosomal rna gene sequences. plaque and tongue debris specimens were collected from 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and 10 periodontal healthy individuals and analyzed. all species, except for p. nigrescens, were detected in samples from diseased sites in significantly greater numbers than in those from healthy sites, whereas greater numbers of p. nigrescens were found in the controls. these results suggest that the present real-time pcr method with the designed probe/primer sets enabled sensitive detection of the six periodontal bacteria, and may also assist future microbial studies of periodontal diseases.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal bacteria in healthy children: a 2-year longitudinal study.
AB  == objectives: to examine the occurrence of specific periodontal bacteria in children and adolescents. methods: ten putative periodontal bacteria were longitudinally examined in plaque and saliva samples from 119 periodontally healthy children (2-15 years old) using a polymerase chain reaction method. results: capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently found in saliva, and tended to persist in saliva for the remainder of the study, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia were rarely detected. p. nigrescens was more frequently detected in plaque and its prevalence increased with age. eikenella corrodens and campylobacter rectus were sometimes detected in both plaque and saliva, while tannerella forsythensis was occasionally detected in saliva. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, p. nigrescens, c. rectus, and e. corrodens are common members of the oral microbial  flora of healthy children, whereas p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola appear to be transient organisms.

TI  == microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between  anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were  found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

TI  == in vitro activation of the hemolysin in prevotella nigrescens atcc 33563 and prevotella intermedia atcc 25611.
AB  == hemolytic activity was evaluated in the putative periodontopathogens prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. whole cells of both species present weak hemolytic activity evidenced only by solid media assays after 48 h of bacterial growth or after 5 h of interaction with erythrocytes at 37 degrees c in liquid assays. in this work we show that the use of crude extract allowed the detection  of a higher hemolytic activity for p. intermedia, but surprisingly not for p. nigrescens. incubation at 37 degrees c for 9 h, or treatment with trypsin or proteinase k, increased or exposed the hemolytic activity of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens crude extract, respectively. the activation process was inhibited by tlck and pmsf but not by edta, e-64 or pepstatin a, indicating the serino-protease nature of the factor involved in activation of p. intermedia and  p. nigrescens hemolysins. both the buffer and the ph employed for cell fractionation influenced the activation of hemolysin, and the best results were obtained with universal buffer at ph 8.0. the activated hemolysins acted optimally at ph 6.5 at 37 degrees c and the maximum hemolytic activity was detected at the early log phase of growth. the results of this study show for the first time a strong hemolytic activity for p. nigrescens and evidence of proteolytic activation of hemolysins produced by periodontopathogens.

TI  == the cell extract of porphyromonas gingivalis promotes attachment of prevotella nigrescens cells to hydroxyapatite.
AB  == large quantities of prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261 (p. nigrescens) cells adhere to hydroxyapatite (ha) treated with extract from porphyromonas gingivalis 381 (pg-ext), but not to ha coated with human serum albumin (hsa) or human serum globulin (hsg). the duration of ha treatment with pg-ext and several other conditions were tested to determine the factors causing pg-ext to promote p. nigrescens cell adhesion. pg-ext adsorbed rapidly to ha in less than 5 min. the maximum adherence of p. nigrescens cells to ha was observed after treatment of hsa and hsg and then retreatment of ha with pg-ext. it was found that pg-ext heated at 80 degrees c for 30 min did not lose its propensity to promote attachment of p. nigrescens to ha and that it also remained stable at 4 degrees c for at least 6 days. the trypsin-like enzyme activity of pg-ext was also measured, with bapna as the substrate and commercially purchased trypsin as the standard, and was approximately 0.12 units/mg. these data suggest that the presence of pg-ext is one of the essential factors responsible for p. nigrescens  cell attachment to apatitic surfaces, and that with its trypsin-like activity, pg-ext may be considered an extremely important substance for the establishment of p. nigrescens in the periodontal pocket and the development of periodontal disease.

TI  == the haem pigment of the oral anaerobes prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia is composed of iron(iii) protoporphyrin ix in the monomeric form.
AB  == the haem pigment of porphyromonas gingivalis is composed of micro -oxo bishaem, [fe(iii)ppix](2)o, but the nature of that generated by prevotella species has not been established. mossbauer, raman and uv-visible spectrophotometry were used to  characterize the haem pigment of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. mossbauer and raman spectroscopy revealed the major haem species to be monomeric  iron protoporphyrin ix, fe(iii)ppix.oh (haematin). the terminal growth ph of both species on blood agar was between 5.8 and 6.0, which favours the formation and maintenance of monomeric fe(iii)ppix.oh. incubation of pr. nigrescens and pr. intermedia with oxyhaemoglobin at ph 6.5 resulted in formation of aquomethaemoglobin which was degraded to generate fe(iii)ppix.oh which in turn became cell-associated, whilst incubation at ph 7.5 resulted in formation of [fe(iii)ppix](2)o. it is concluded that both prevotella species degrade oxyhaemoglobin to form [fe(iii)ppix](2)o as an intermediate, which is converted to fe(iii)ppix.oh through a depression in ph. the low ph encourages cell-surface  deposition of insoluble fe(iii)ppix.oh which would act as a barrier against oxygen and reactive oxygen species, and also protect against h(2)o(2) through its inherent catalase activity.

AB  == this pilot study evaluated, by culture testing, the effectiveness of lethal photosensitization for the microbiological treatment of peri-implantitis in dogs. experimental peri-implantitis was induced by ligature placement for 2 months. following ligature removal, plaque control was instituted by scrubbing with 0.12% chlorhexidine daily for 12 months. subsequently, mucoperiosteal flaps were elevated for scaling the implant surface. microbial samples were obtained with paper points before and after treatment of implant surfaces by means of 100 microg/ml toluidine blue o (tbo,) and were exposed, for 80 s, to light with a wavelength of 685 nm from a 50 mw gaalas diode laser. the mean initial and final  bacterial counts were 7.22 +/- 0.20 and 6.84 +/- 0.44 cfu/ml, respectively for tvc (p < 0.0001); 6.19 +/- 0.45 and 3.14 +/- 3.29 cfu/ml for p. intermedia/nigrescens (p = 0.001); 5.98 +/- 0.38 and 1.69 +/- 2.90 cfu/ml for fusobacterium spp. (p = 0.001); and 6.07 +/- 0.22 to 1.69 +/- 2.94 cfu/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococcus (p = 0.0039). it may be concluded that lethal photosensitization resulted in a reduction of the bacterial count. complete elimination of bacteria was achieved in some samples.

AB  == prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261 cells adhere well to protein-blocking hydroxyapatite (ha) which mimics a root surface in the periodontal pocket treated with proteases such as trypsin, proteinase k, chymotrypsin and papain. this study was done to clarify the inhibitory effect of alpha- and beta- serum globulins on  the adhesion of p. nigrescens atcc 25261 cells to trypsin-treated ha. the inhibitory effect was found to be caused by the alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1-at) of alpha-globulin and the low-density lipoprotein (ldl) of beta-globulin under experimental conditions. the most effective inhibition of alpha1-at on p. nigrescens atcc 25261 cell attachment to ha was achieved when alpha1-at-treated trypsin was used. the most effective inhibition of ldl occurred when trypsin-treated ha was treated with ldl. apo-transferrin (tf) and holo-tf, which  are beta-globulins, did not affect the attachment of p. nigrescens atcc 25261 cells to trypsin-treated ha.

AB  == purpose: the goal of this study was to evaluate microbiota and radiographic peri-implant bone loss associated with ligature-induced peri-implantitis. materials and methods: thirty-six dental implants with 4 different surfaces (9 commercially pure titanium, 9 titanium plasma-sprayed, 9 hydroxyapatite, and 9 acid-etched) were placed in the edentulous mandibles of 6 dogs. after 3 months with optimal plaque control, abutment connection was performed. on days 0, 20, 40, and 60 after placement of cotton ligatures, both microbiologic samples and periapical radiographs were obtained. the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, campylobacter spp, capnocytophaga spp, fusobacterium spp,  beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and candida spp were evaluated culturally. results: p intermedia/nigrescens was detected in 13.89% of implants at baseline and 100% of implants at other periods. p gingivalis was not detected at baseline, but after 20 and 40 days it was detected in 33.34% of implants and at 60 days it was  detected in 29.03% of dental implants. fusobacterium spp was detected in all periods. streptococci were detected in 16.67% of implants at baseline and in 83.34%, 72.22%, and 77.42% of implants at 20, 40, and 60 days, respectively. campylobacter spp and candida spp were detected in low proportions. the total viable count analysis showed no significant differences among surfaces (p = .831), although a significant difference was observed after ligature placement (p < .0014). however, there was no significant qualitative difference, in spite of the difference among the periods. the peri-implant bone loss was not significantly different between all the dental implant surfaces (p = .908). discussion and conclusions: these data suggest that with ligature-induced peri-implantitis, both time and periodontal pathogens affect all surfaces equally after 60 days.

AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of tetracycline fibres (tcf) as an adjunct to scaling in the treatment of generalised aggressive  periodontitis and to compare the effects with mechanical treatment only. ten patients, 24-39 years old referred for treatment to the department of preventive  dentistry, periodontology and implant biology, aristotle university of thessaloniki took part in the study. a split-mouth experimental design was used.  measurements referring to bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal) were performed at 12 sites randomly selected. clinical recordings were made at baseline, 2 and 6 months, after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken for microbiological analysis using the 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridisation technique at baseline, immediately after treatment and at 2 and 6 months. full-mouth scaling and root planing were performed, with the exception of 2 pre-selected sites, which served as controls.  tetracycline fibres were applied in 5 pockets located in the same half mouth. analysis of clinical findings showed that mechanical instrumentation in combination with tcf application led to a greater improvement in clinical parameters than scaling and root planing only. microbial analysis showed a statistically significant greater reduction in the percentages of detection for b. forsythus, p. nigrescens and a. naeslundii genospecies ii in pockets where tetracycline fibres were applied. in conclusion, the clinical and microbiological data of the present study suggest that the adjunctive use of tcf improves the clinical response of scaling and root planing in aggressive periodontitis patients.

AB  == prolyltripeptidyl amino peptidase activity was found in a crude extract of prevotella nigrescens and this enzyme was purified by procedures including concentration with ammonium sulfate, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and isoelectric focusing. this peptidase hydrolyzed ala-ala-pro-p-nitroanilide as well as ala-phe-pro-p-nitroanilide. furthermore, several p-nitroanilide derivatives of dipeptides with a proline residue in the second position from the  amino-terminal end (xaa-pro) were also cleaved detectably. the molecular mass of  this tripeptidase was calculated as 56 kda and its isoelectric point was 5.8. the enzyme was inactivated completely by heating at 60 degrees c for 5 min and inhibited significantly by specific serine enzyme inhibitors.

TI  == hemolytic activity of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens strains: influence of abiotic factors in solid and liquid assays.
AB  == the influence of growth medium, hemin and menadione, blood source and atmosphere  of incubation on the expression of hemolytic activity of 25 strains of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens was evaluated. the best hemolytic activity was observed for samples of both species growing in brain heart infusion agar and incubated in brewer-like anaerobic jars for 48 h. hemolysis was less intense and  occurred later in the presence of hemin and menadione in solid media. beta-hemolysis was detected for medium supplemented with horse or human blood and alpha-hemolysis was observed when sheep blood was used. these results suggesting  some specificity for the hemolytic activity were also observed in liquid assays in which sheep erythrocytes were found to be resistant to hemolysis while horse and human cells where lysed. in liquid assays, the hemolytic activity of all studied strains remained stable in the ph range of 6.0 to 8.5 and was not altered by iron-scavenging compounds or atmosphere of incubation. the phenomenon of hot/cold hemolysis was ruled out as the mechanism of action of p. intermedia and  p. nigrescens hemolysin.

TI  == bacterial concentrations determine the ability to implant in the root canal system and translocate to lymph nodes in germ-free mice.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of the infecting dose on  bacterial colonization in root canal systems (rcs) and translocation to the submandibular lymph node (sml) of gnotobiotic (germ-free) mice. rcs were inoculated with 10(2) and 10(1) colony-forming units (cfu) of enterococcus faecalis (atcc 4083) or 10(5), 10(4), 10(3), and 10(2) cfu of prevotella nigrescens (atcc 33563). e. faecalis implanted in 83.3% of the cases, for both inocula. translocation was detected in 58.3% of lymph nodes for the 10(2) cfu inoculum and in 33.3% of lymph nodes for the 10(1) cfu inoculum. p. nigrescens implanted in 25%, 16.7%, 8.3%, and 0%, for the 10(5), 10(4), 10(3), and 10(2) cfu inocula, respectively, and did not translocate at any of the concentrations used. these results indicate that e. faecalis was able to implant in the rcs and translocate to the sml, whereas p. nigrescens implanted in lower percentages in the rcs and did not translocate to the sml.

TI  == presence and antibiotic resistance of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens in children.
AB  == background/aims: only limited information exists about the prevalence in children of pathogens associated with periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to determine by culture whether 8-11-year-old children carry porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and/or p. nigrescens in samples from the gingiva and/or the buccal mucosa taken before, and after caries treatment and oral hygiene instruction. a second aim was to assess the proportion of subjects who had gram-negative anaerobes carrying the tet(q) and erm(f) genes, suggesting  antibiotic resistance to tetracycline or erythromycin. method: a total of 150 children provided gingival and buccal swab bacterial samples that were cultured for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and p. nigrescens. the species was verified using dna-dna hybridization with species-specific probes made from the variable region of the 16s rrna sequences. antibiotic-resistant genes, tet(q) and erm(f),  were identified using specific dna-dna hybridization with specific dna probes. results: a total of 116 isolates of black-pigmented bacteria were cultured from 47 (31%) of 150 children. five isolates were identified as p. gingivalis, 29 as p. intermedia, 33 as p. nigrescens, and 49 as other species. in general, the bacteria were not culturable at more than one time period. we found that 55% of these 47 children harbored black pigmented bacteria that carried either one or both of the two antibiotic-resistant genes studied (tet(q), and erm(f)). conclusion: the present study demonstrated that children not exposed to regular dental treatment carry bacteria outside the gingival sulcus that have been associated with periodontitis, and that standard treatment procedures may not clear the presence of the putative pathogens. in addition, antibiotic-resistant genes are common in identifiable gram-negative anaerobes, including putative pathogens.

TI  == frequency of reactivity for porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella spp. in supra- and subgingival plaques, and periodontal clinical parameters according to  subject age.
AB  == background: the present study was conducted to assess the association between selected clinical parameters and the distribution of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), prevotella nigrescens (pn), and prevotella melaninogenica (pm) in supra- and subgingival plaque samples measured by an immunoslot blot assay (iba) using their monoclonal antibodies. methods: plaque samples from 299 patients aged 6 to 69 randomly chosen from a group of dental outpatients were examined. plaque index, gingival index, and probing depths were  evaluated according to the criteria of positive (cell number > or = 10(6)) or negative (<106) reactivity to the 4 different monoclonal antibodies. results: an  increase in probing depth in subjects exhibiting either a positive or negative reaction for the 4 test bacteria was associated with increasing age. comparing bacteria-positive subgingival plaque samples to their corresponding bacteria-negative counterparts, we found an increased plaque index in children positive for any of the 4 bacteria; in addition, that for pg and pi was increased in subjects 40 to 49 years old. the gingival index increased with increasing amount of pi and pn, but not with pg and pm in those 20 to 29 years of age. the frequency of pg reactivity in subgingival plaque was markedly enhanced in subjects older than 30 to 39 years of age, and was significantly higher than that in supragingival plaque. the frequency of pi and pn reactivity was significantly  increased in adults aged 20 to 29 and plateaued at older ages. the frequency of pm reactivity was relatively low and independent of subject age. conclusions: the increase in probing depth with increasing age was not affected by the occurrence  of periodontopathic bacteria. the high rate of occurrence of pg, together with pi and pn, in subgingival plaque of the adult age groups was suggested to be associated with the high frequency of periodontal disease in the older age groups (above 30 to 49 years of age). the iba appears to be useful for the efficient and rapid detection of periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis clinical strains reveals a clear species clustering.
AB  == prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis are oral pathogens from the family bacteroidaceae, regularly isolated from cases of gingivitis and periodontitis. in this study, the phylogenetic variability of these three bacterial species was investigated by means of 16s rrna (rrs) gene sequence comparisons of a set of epidemiologically and geographically diverse isolates. for each of the three species, the rrs gene sequences of 11 clinical isolates as well as the corresponding type strains was determined. comparison of  all rrs sequences obtained with those of closely related species revealed a clear clustering of species, with only a little intraspecies variability but a clear difference in the rrs gene with respect to the next related taxon. the results indicate that the three species form stable, homogeneous genetic groups, which favours an rrs-based species identification of these oral pathogens. this is especially useful given the 7% sequence divergence between prevotella intermedia  and prevotella nigrescens, since phenotypic distinction between the two prevotella species is inconsistent or involves techniques not applicable in routine identification.

TI  == scanning electron microscopy study of the adhesion of prevotella nigrescens to the dentin of prepared root canals.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the presence or absence of amorphous, irregular smear layers on the adhesion of prevotella nigrescens, to the dentin of the root canal by using scanning electron microscopy (sem). human incisors extracted within 7 days, with no cavities, no fractures, and no evidence of calcification of the canal, were selected. after cutting the crown portion at  the cej, root canal preparation was undertaken by using a modified crown-down technique with profile and gates glidden drills. ten milliliters of physiologic saline solution (groups 1 and 4), 10 ml of 3.5% naocl (groups 2 and 5), or 10 ml  of naocl and 10 ml of 0.5 m edta (groups 3 and 6) were used as irrigation solution while preparing the canal. after vertical sectioning and ethylene oxide  gas sterilization, samples (groups 1, 2, and 3) were immersed in brain-heart infusion broth with yeast extract, hemin, and menadione, inoculated with p. nigrescens (atcc 33563), and incubated for 3 h at 37 degrees c. all samples were  prepared for and observed with sem. the data were analyzed by using t test and one-way anova. smear layer was observed to cover the entire root canal surface after root canal preparation. smear layer was removed and the entrances of dentinal tubules opened widely after applying 3.5% naocl and 0.5 m edta. a significantly greater number of bacteria were found to adhere to those teeth in which a smear layer was present (p < 0.05). given that the smear layer produced during root canal preparation promoted adhesion and colonization of p. nigrescens to the dentin matrix, it might also increase the likelihood of canal reinfection.

TI  == characterization of binding and utilization of hemoglobin by prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the ability of prevotella nigrescens to utilize and bind to hemoglobin was investigated. growth studies showed that p. nigrescens was able to utilize hemoglobin efficiently as an iron source. binding of p. nigrescens to hemoglobin  was demonstrated by dot blot assay. heat and trypsin treatments of the bacteria led to a decrease in activity. globin gave nearly complete inhibition of activity. additionally, lactoferrin partially inhibited activity. in contrast, transferrin, cytochrome c and catalase exerted little or no inhibitory effect. although the sugars tested did not affect activity, several of the amino acids tested, including arginine, cysteine, histidine and lysine, inhibited activity. in a solid phase assay, 41-, 56- and 59-kda proteins of p. nigrescens reacted with hemoglobin. these results suggest that p. nigrescens utilizes hemoglobin for growth and 41-, 56- and 59-kda proteins may be involved in hemoglobin binding.

TI  == parotid salivary s-iga antibodies during experimental gingivitis in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

TI  == direct quantitative differentiation between prevotella intermedia and prevotella  nigrescens in clinical specimens.
AB  == this paper describes a quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) assay for the differential identification of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in clinical samples, and compares its performance with less discriminatory culture and quantitative immunofluorescence (if) assays. fluorescence-labelled oligonucleotide probes directed to specific 16s rrna sequences of p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, prevotella pallens and prevotella denticola were hybridized under stringent conditions with cultured reference strains or plaque samples from deep periodontal pockets. probe specificity was defined with strains from multiple oral prevotella species. the lower detection level of the assays was approximately 3x10(3) target cells per ml of plaque-sample suspension. p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, p. pallens and p. denticola were detected in plaques with prevalences of 69, 67, 0 and 28%, respectively. on average, 3.9 x 10(6) p. intermedia, 3.1 x 10(6) p. nigrescens and 5.6 x 10(5) p. denticola cells were counted per positive sample. all three species were found almost exclusively in dense mixed aggregates. quantitative fish data agreed satisfactorily with corresponding if data (r=0.711). both fish and if enumerations of the sum of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens markedly exceeded the c.f.u. counts of black-pigmented colonies in porphyromonas gingivalis-free cultured subgingival plaques. the results demonstrate the validity of this new assay. unlike established if, culture, pcr or checkerboard dna hybridization assays, this fish assay differentiates quantitatively between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens, provides visual accuracy control, and offers insights into the spatial distribution of the target cells within a clinical sample.

TI  == [identification of periodontopathic bacteria dna from periodontitis-involved gingival tissue using a pcr method].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the presence of periodontopathic bacteria dna in the granulation tissue of periodontally involved gingival tissue. forty periodontitis patients were examined. subgingival plaque and saliva samples were collected from the patients before surgery. then, granulation tissue was also collected during surgery. another 20 patients, who had more than 4 mm in probing pocket depth, were also examined as a control. they received only initial treatment without periodontal surgery. plaque and saliva samples were also collected from them. seven periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, toreponema denticola, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens, were detected by a pcr method from these samples of all patients. as clinical parameters, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and bleeding on probing were recorded. one year after surgery, sampling of subgingival plaque and saliva, and measurement of clinical parameters were performed on the patients. the dna of periodontopathic bacteria was detected in the granulation tissue of 29 out of 40 patients. p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, t. denticola, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens were detected in 23, 11, 12, 9, 3, 2 and 1 subject(s) respectively. the sites with undetectable level of any periodontal pathogens at one year after surgery showed a clinical attachment  gain of 2.44 mm, while those that showed detectable pathogen levels had only a 0.77 mm gain. our results indicated that the removal of granulation tissue contributed to eliminating periodontal pathogens and to avoiding re-infection by  those bacteria. complete eradication of periodontopathic bacteria would be necessary for successful periodontal treatment.

AB  == background, aims: conventional mechanical treatment of papillon-lefevre syndrome  periodontitis has a poor prognosis. this report describes an effective antimicrobial treatment of rapidly progressing periodontitis in an 11-year old girl having papillon-lefevre syndrome. method: clinical examination included conventional periodontal measurements and radiographic analysis. occurrence of major suspected periodontopathic bacteria was determined by selective and non-selective culture and by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) identification. presence of cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus was determined by a nested-pcr detection method. therapy included scaling and root planing, oral hygiene instruction, and systemic amoxicillin-metronidazole therapy (250 mg of each/3 times daily/10 days) which, based on follow-up microbiological testing, was repeated after 4 months. supportive periodontal therapy took place at 2 visits during a 16-month period. results: at baseline, 10 of 22 available teeth demonstrated severe periodontal breakdown. at 16 months, probing and radiographic measurements revealed no teeth with additional attachment loss, and several teeth exhibited significant reduction in gingivitis and pocket depth, increase in radiographic alveolar bone height and clinical attachment level, and radiographic evidence of crestal lamina dura. baseline subgingival microbiota included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3.4% of total isolates), prevotella nigrescens (16.4%), fusobacteriumnucleatum (14.3%) and peptostreptococcus micros  (10.6%), as well as cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus. at termination of the study, culture and pcr examinations showed absence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. micros and herpesviruses, and p. nigrescens and f.nucleatum each comprised less than 0.1 % of subgingival isolates. conclusion: this study suggests that controlling the periodontopathic microbiota by appropriate antibiotic and conventional periodontal therapy can arrest papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.

TI  == distribution of erm(f) and tet(q) genes in 4 oral bacterial species and genotypic variation between resistant and susceptible isolates.
AB  == background: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia are gram-negative anaerobic bacteria that are currently considered potential periopathogens. prevotella nigrescens has recently been separated from  p. intermedia and its role in periodontitis is unknown. the erm(f) gene codes for an rrna methylase, conferring resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b (mlsb), and the tet(q) gene for a ribosomal protection protein, conferring resistance to tetracycline. the presence of these resistance genes could impair the use of antibiotics for therapy. purpose: the aim of this study was to determine the carriage of erm(f) and tet(q), and genetic variability of 12 porphyromonas gingivalis, 10 prevotella intermedia, 25 prevotella nigrescens and  17 bacteroides forsythus isolates from 9 different patient samples. methods: we used polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for detecting antibiotic resistance genes, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) for detecting genetic variability among the isolates. results: thirty-one (48%) isolates were resistant to both erythromycin and tetracycline and carried the erm(f) and tet(q) genes, eight (13%) were tetracycline resistant and carried the tet(q) gene, 9 (14%) were erythromycin resistant and carried the erm(f) gene, and 12 (19%) isolates did not carry antibiotic resistance genes. pfge was used to compare isolates from the same patient and isolates from different patient samples digested with xbai. no association was found between antibiotic resistance gene carriage and pfge patterns in any species examined. all isolates of the same species from the same  patient had highly related or identical pfge patterns. isolates of same species from different patients had unique pfge pattern for each species tested. conclusion: all isolates of the same species from any one patient were genetically related to each other but distinct from isolates from other patients, and 66% of the patients carried antibiotic resistant isolates, which could impair antibiotic therapy.

TI  == maternal periodontitis and prematurity. part ii: maternal infection and fetal exposure.
AB  == clinical data from the first 812 deliveries from a cohort study of pregnant mothers entitled oral conditions and pregnancy (ocap) demonstrate that both antepartum maternal periodontal disease and incidence/progression of periodontal  disease are associated with preterm birth and growth restriction after adjusting  for traditional obstetric risk factors. in the current study we present measures  of maternal periodontal infection using whole chromosomal dna probes to identify  15 periodontal organisms within maternal periodontal plaque sampled at delivery.  in addition, maternal postpartum igg antibody and fetal exposure, as indexed by fetal cord blood igm level to these 15 maternal oral pathogens, was measured by whole bacterial immunoblots. the potential role of maternal infection with specific organisms within 2 bacterial complexes most often associated with periodontitis, conventionally termed "orange" (campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella intermedia) and "red" (porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola) complexes, respectively, to prematurity was investigated by relating the presence of oral infection, maternal igg, and fetal  cord igm, comparing full-term to preterm (gestational age < 37 weeks). the prevalence of 8 periodontal pathogens was similar among term and preterm mothers  at postpartum. there was a 2.9-fold higher prevalence of igm seropositivity for one or more organisms of the orange or red complex among preterm babies, as compared to term babies (19.9% versus 6.9%, respectively, p = 0.0015, chi square). specifically, the prevalence of positive fetal igm to c. rectus was significantly higher for preterm as compared to full-term neonates (20.0% versus  6.3%, p = 0.0002, as well as p. intermedia (8.8% versus 1.1%, p = 0.0003). a lack of maternal igg antibody to organisms of the red complex was associated with an increased rate of prematurity with an odds ratio (or) = 2.2; confidence interval  (ci) 1.48 to 3.79), consistent with the concept that maternal antibody protects the fetus from exposure and resultant prematurity. the highest rate of prematurity (66.7%) was observed among those mothers without a protective red complex igg response coupled with a fetal igm response to orange complex microbes (combined or 10.3; p < 0.0001). these data support the concept that maternal periodontal infection in the absence of a protective maternal antibody response is associated with systemic dissemination of oral organisms that translocate to the fetus resulting in prematurity. the high prevalence of elevated fetal igm to  c. rectus among premature infants raises the possibility that this specific maternal oral pathogen may serve as a primary fetal infectious agent eliciting prematurity.

TI  == dipeptide utilization by the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum, which can frequently be isolated from periodontal pockets, preferentially utilize proteins and peptides as growth substrates. in this study, we determined the size of peptide that is preferentially utilized as  a source of energy and material for cell growth by p. gingivalis, p. intermedia,  p. nigrescens and f. nucleatum using various sizes of poly amino acids consisting of two to approximately 100 molecules of aspartate or glutamate. resting cells of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens utilized aspartylaspartate, while  cells of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum utilized glutamylglutamate. the addition  of aspartylaspartate to the culture medium increased the growth of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens, while the addition of glutamylglutamate promoted the growth of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. these results clearly indicate that dipeptides such as aspartylaspartate and glutamylglutamate can be utilized as growth substrates for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and f. nucleatum.

TI  == periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  == background: little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. we assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. methods: plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. using species-specific primers of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola, pcr amplification was performed with bacterial genomic dna from plaque samples. results: the results indicated that c. rectus, e. corrodens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, and c. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while b. forsythus and p. intermedia were detected less frequently, and p. gingivalis and t. denticola were not found. in contrast, the percentage of p.  nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. subject-based analyses suggested that the  number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. conclusions: the colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. however, colonization by p. gingivalis and t. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.

TI  == effects of glucose on formation of cytotoxic end-products and proteolytic activity of prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == black-pigmented bacteria which produce cytotoxic metabolic end-products and cell  membrane-associated proteases have been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. these bacterial virulence factors can be modified by the environmental conditions including nutrients supplied variously into the oral cavity. although glucose is one of the most essential nutrients for oral bacteria, the exogenous supply of glucose may be discontinuous and the glucose concentration in a periodontal pocket may be influenced by the depth of the periodontal pocket. therefore, effects of glucose as an environmental factor  on the virulence factors of prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and porphyromonas in the presence o glucose.,bo t p. intermedia and p. nigrescens markedly decreased the production of cytotoxic end-products including succinate.,isobutyrate,isovalerate and ammonia, although their growth was increased. furthermore, the proteolytic activities such as immunoglobulin- albumin- and casein-degrading activities of these bacteria were decreased in the  presence of glucose. on the other hand, no effect of glucose on the metabolic activity of p gingivalis was observed. these results suggest that pathogenicity of p. intermedia p. nigrescens may be decreased by the presence of glucose.

TI  == lactoferrin, amylase and mucin muc5b and their relation to the oral microflora in hyposalivation of different origins.
AB  == there are several reasons for hyposalivation, each affecting the salivary composition in different ways. the aim of this study was to analyze and compare lactoferrin, amylase and mucin muc5b in stimulated whole saliva collected from subjects with hyposalivation of different origins and to relate the results to the presence of some microbial species associated with oral disorders. albumin was determined as a marker of serum leakage. the characteristic feature for subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation was a large increase in lactoferrin, probably due to leakage through inflamed mucosal tissues, while it was a high albumin content for the group with primary sjogren's syndrome, probably due to disruption of the fragile mucosa. the saliva composition in subjects with hyposalivation of unknown origin or due to medicines was close to that in the healthy controls. all three hyposalivation groups tended to display a decrease in the concentrations of muc5b and amylase. none of the microbial species analyzed (streptococci, mutans streptococci, lactobacillus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus and enterics) correlated with concentration of muc5b in saliva. the rt group, having the highest concentration of lactoferrin, had the lowest median number of f. nucleatum and was the only group in which median number of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens was zero.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles in children with chronic neutropenia under supervised oral hygiene.
AB  == background: this is the first known case report that used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method to help identify the oral microflora in patients with chronic neutropenia. in this study, we report clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles of 2 children, 1 with severe congenital neutropenia (scn, kostmann type) and 1 with cyclic neutropenia (cn). methods: the scn patient had severe gingivitis, whereas the patient with cn had mild gingivitis in the gingival margins. monthly oral cleaning instruction and review were performed without subsequent periodontal therapy. oral hygiene conditions remained satisfactory and visible plaque was scarce, despite the persistence of mild gingivitis. under supervised oral hygiene, we examined the presence of periodontal pathogens from patient plaque samples. results: by a pcr-based method, prevotella nigrescens, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in the scn patient and p. intermedia, c.  rectus, c. gingivalis, and c. sputigena in the cn patient, suggesting the existence of periodontal pathogens. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and c. ochracea were not found in  either patient. conclusions: use of 1% povidone iodine solution and local antibiotic application under supervised oral hygiene were helpful to improve gingival conditions in patients with chronic neutropenia.

TI  == clinical and microbiological evaluation of ligature-induced peri-implantitis and  periodontitis in dogs.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the attachment loss around teeth and implants by clinical and microbiological analysis. the mandibular premolars were  extracted in 5 mongrel dogs and, 3 months later, two titanium implants were installed on each side of the mandible and, after another 3 months, abutment connection was performed. plaque control in the implants and maxillary premolars  was maintained for two weeks prior to the start of the main experiment. on day 0  and 30 days after ligature placement, microbiological samples were obtained and relative attachment level was measured for the teeth and implants. the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction technique on day 0 and 30 days after ligature placement. none of the above bacteria were detected on day 0. thirty days after ligature placement, p. gingivalis was present in 95% and 85% and b. forsythus was present in 80% and 85% of the implants and teeth sites, respectively. statistical analysis (one-way rm-anova) showed a significant difference (p<0.01) between pre- and post-induction measurements around teeth and implants. however, there was no significant difference (p=0.41) in the rate of attachment loss, between periodontitis and peri-implantitis. it can be concluded  that: (1) p. gingivalis and b. forsythus were strongly associated with induced peri-implantitis and periodontitis, and (2) induced peri-implantitis and periodontitis presented a similar rate of attachment loss.

TI  == a comparative evaluation of three root-end filling materials: an in vitro leakage study using prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == this study used prevotella nigrescens to evaluate the sealing ability of geristore, super-eba, and proroot when used as root-end filling materials. one hundred single-canal, extracted, human teeth were cleaned and shaped with gates-glidden burs and .04 taper (profile series 29) rotary instruments. the root-ends were resected, and a 3-mm deep root-end preparation was made with ultrasonic tips. after steam sterilization, the teeth were randomly divided into  three groups of 30. each group was root-end-filled with a different material. five root-end cavities were left open and served as positive controls; another five root-end cavities filled with sticky wax and covered with two layers of nail polish acted as negative controls. the teeth were attached to presterilized snap-on plastic caps; the root-ends submerged into 12-ml vials of chopped meat carbohydrate broth and placed in an anaerobic chamber. twice a week, a sterile micropipette was used to inoculate 0.1 ml of a broth culture of prevotella nigrescens into the root canal of each tooth. results after 47 days indicated there were no significant differences between the three root-end filling materials against penetration of prevotella nigrescens.

TI  == detection of putative oral pathogens in acute periradicular abscesses by 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == a 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction method was used to assess the occurrence of four black-pigmented anaerobic rods, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in acute periradicular abscesses. pus was collected by aspiration from 10 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic  origin. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed using a polymerase chain  reaction-based identification assay. the method allowed detecting black-pigmented anaerobes in 80% of the examined abscesses. porphyromonas endodontalis was found  in 70%, t. denticola in 50%, porphyromonas gingivalis in 40%, and prevotella intermedia in 10% of the cases. p. gingivalis was always found associated with p. endodontalis. prevotella nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not found in any pus sample. the high prevalence of p. endodontalis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis suggests that they can play an important role in the etiology of acute periradicular abscesses.

TI  == distribution of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetq gene in oral isolates of black-pigmented anaerobes in japan.
AB  == we investigated the distribution of tetracycline resistance determinant tetq in oral black-pigmented anaerobes using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method: a  total of 185 healthy subjects were divided into 3 groups based on subject age: young (6 to 10 years, n=58), middle (11 to 40 years, n=96), and elder (exactly 70 years, n=31). the prevalence of black-pigmented anaerobes in the gingival sulcus  among these groups was 29.3%, 28.2%, and 64.5%, respectively. the prevalence of prevotella nigrescens among these groups was 22.4%, 15.6%, and 32.3%, respectively, whereas the prevalence of prevotella intermedia was 1.7%, 4.2%, and 35.5%, respectively. porphyromonas gingivalis was found only in the elder group (16.1%). the prevalence of the tetq gene in the black-pigmented anaerobes-positive subjects was almost the same among the 3 groups (approximately 30%). the tetq gene was found in 27.5% (46 of 167) of p. nigrescens isolates, whereas it was found in only 6.4% (3 of 47) of p. intermedia isolates and in none of the 19 p. gingivalis isolates. restriction endonuclease digestion patterns of  the pcr products revealed 83.6% of 49 tetq-positive isolates were of subtype a2h2 (alui type 2, hpaii type 2).

TI  == change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == smoking affects the subgingival microflora in periodontitis.
AB  == background: tobacco smoking has been identified as one major risk factor for destructive periodontal disease. scaling and root planing have been shown to be less effective in smokers with periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to compare the subgingival microbial flora of treated and untreated smokers and non-smokers. methods: four independent adult patient groups with periodontitis were included in this investigation: 88 untreated smokers (u-s); 90 untreated non-smokers (u-ns); 119 treated non-smokers (t-ns); and 171 treated smokers (t-s). clinical variables included cumulative plaque index (cpi), probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), cumulative bleeding index (cbi), and cumulative suppuration index (csi). paper point samples from the deepest bleeding pocket in each quadrant of the dentition were analyzed for the presence and levels of 6 periodontal bacterial pathogens using anaerobic culture techniques. results: u-s showed a higher mean cumulative plaque index than u-ns (3.5 versus 2.7). mean pd and mean cal were higher in the t-s in comparison to the t-ns group (7.0 versus 6.6 mm and 5.6 versus 4.7 mm, respectively). microbiological characteristics of u-s were a higher prevalence of prevotella intermedia/nigrescens and higher mean levels of peptostreptococcus micros (pm) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). t-s patients were characterized by higher prevalence of bacteroides forsythus (bf), pm, and campylobacter rectus (cr) and higher mean levels of pm and fn. the mean percentage of b. forsythus tended to be higher in the t-s group than in the t-ns group (6.9% versus 5.6%). the relative risk to be infected with bf, pm, and cr was statistically higher in smokers (odds ratios: 1.9, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively). the chance to find > or =10% of bf, pm, and/or fn was 3.3 higher in smokers when a. actinomycetemcomitans and p gingivalis were absent. detection of > or =20% pm/fn in treated patients was strongly associated with smoking (odds ratio 13.8, p= 0.002). conclusions: smoking is a determining factor for the composition of the subgingival microflora in adult patients with periodontitis and may select for a specific cluster of periodontal pathogens, notably bf, pm, fn, and cr. on the basis of these observations, smoking, among other criteria, may be one parameter to use in deciding to treat refractory periodontitis in smokers with a systemic antibiotic  therapy directed against smoking-associated periodontal bacteria.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in primary sjogren's syndrome.
AB  == objective: knowledge of the effect of primary sjogren's syndrome (pss) on the microbial flora in the different predilection sites for oral disorders is needed  for planning preventive treatment. we carried out microbial analysis of samples from the dorsum of the tongue, smooth mucosa, supragingival tooth surfaces, and the gingival crevice region of 20 patients with pss. methods: a clinical oral examination was performed and whole unstimulated and stimulated secretion rates were measured. results: compared with healthy controls, subjects with pss harbored higher numbers and frequencies of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., and candida albicans in the supragingival plaque. on the smooth mucosa and  tongue, the pss subjects displayed an increased frequency of c. albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterics, and enterococci. c. albicans was detected about  twice as frequently in the supragingival plaque as it was on the tongue. in the gingival crevice region, the pss group harbored slightly lower proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens than controls. the clinical and microbial differences were mainly due to the pss subjects with a stimulated secretion rate of < 0.5 ml/min. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any subject with pss. conclusion: the microbial flora in the different ecosystems reflected the status of oral disorders in the subjects with pss. specific site sampling and analysis in subjects with pss revealed further differences compared  with controls, and is therefore preferable to saliva sampling for oral treatment  planning and for the evaluation of the effect of oral treatment and of preventive measures implemented in individuals with pss.

TI  == pcr detection of 5 putative periodontal pathogens in dental plaque samples from children 2 to 12 years of age.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of this study was to detect the presence of prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, and campylobacter rectus in plaque samples from 119 children, collected from their toothbrushes using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr). method: the subjects  were 24, 83, and 12 children with healthy gingiva, gingivitis, and periodontitis, respectively, ranging in age from 2-12 years old. plaque samples were collected from all erupted teeth sites using a sterile toothbrush. the mean concentration of dna recovered from the plaque samples was approximately 640 microg/ml, which was deemed sufficient for performing a pcr-based survey. results: the prevalence  by pcr in healthy, gingivitis, and periodontitis subjects was 0.0%, 6.0% and 25.0% for p. intermedia, 45.8%, 79.5% and 50.0% for p. nigrescens, 33.3%, 63.9% and 58.3% for b. forsythus, 0.0%, 18.1% and 16.7% for t. denticola, and 100% in duplicate for c. rectus, respectively. conclusion: our survey indicated that p. intermedia and t. denticola were more associated with periodontal diseases, b. forsythus and p. nigrescens had a moderate prevalence in all clinical groups, while c. rectus were the most commonly detected species in the oral cavities of children suggesting establishment in their early years.

TI  == relationship of cigarette smoking to the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background: the relationship of cigarette smoking to the composition of the subgingival microbiota is not clear. some studies indicated higher levels of certain species in smokers, while other studies failed to detect differences in the microbiota between subjects with different smoking histories. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the prevalence, proportions and levels of the subgingival species in adult subjects who were current, past or never smokers. method: 272 adult subjects ranging in age from 20-86 years with at least 20 teeth were recruited for study. smoking history was obtained using a questionnaire. clinical measures were taken at 6 sites per tooth at all teeth excluding third molars at a baseline visit. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth excluding third molars in each subject at baseline and assayed individually for counts of 29 subgingival species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. subjects were subset according to smoking history into never (n=124), past (n=98) and current smokers (n=50). uni-variate and multi-variate analyses were used to seek associations between smoking category and the counts, proportions and prevalence of subgingival species. results: greater differences were observed for the prevalence (% of sites colonized) of the test species in the 3 smoking groups than were observed for counts or proportions of total counts. members of the orange and red complexes including e. nodatum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, p. intermedia, p. micros, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly more  prevalent in current smokers than in the other 2 groups. the difference in prevalence between smokers and non-smokers was due to greater colonization at sites with pocket depth <4 mm. stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that combinations of the prevalence of 5 microbial species and pack years accounted for 44% of the variance for mean pocket depth (p<0.000001), while the prevalence of 3 microbial taxa along with age, pack years, current smoking and gender accounted for 31% of the variance in mean attachment level (p<0.000001). the difference in prevalence between current and never smokers of all members of the red complex and 8 of 12 members of the orange complex was significantly greater in the maxilla than in the mandible. conclusions: the major difference between the subgingival microbiota in subjects with different smoking  history was in the prevalence of species rather than counts or proportions. the greater extent of colonization in smokers appeared to be due to greater colonization at pocket depths <4 mm. differences in colonization patterns between current and never smokers were greater in the maxilla than in the mandible.

TI  == move of adults with mental retardation from institutions to community-based living: changes in the oral microbiological flora.
AB  == in the western world, the policy of deinstitutionalization and integration of individuals with mental retardation is generally accepted. we tested the hypothesis that de-institutionalization may lead to changes of habits with a potential to influence oral health. when 57 adults with mental retardation moved  from an institution to community-based living, their oral hygiene habits, gingival bleeding, and a three-day food record were registered one month before and 9 and 21 months after the move. mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in saliva, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, and a. actinomycetemcomitans  in supragingival plaque, and c. albicans on mucous membranes were analyzed. after 21 months of community-based living, fewer persons showed high classes of mutans  streptococci, growth of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, and high frequency of sucrose intake, and more subjects showed growth of c. albicans. in a short perspective, the indicators of oral diseases suggest an unchanged or lower risk of oral diseases after the de-institutionalization of individuals with moderate or severe mental retardation.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

AB  == background: down's syndrome (ds) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of ds periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 ds young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (md). the prevalence of 10 possible  periodontopathic bacterial species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. the detection of p. gingivalis fima genotypes was also performed in p. gingivalis-positive samples. results: although ds subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with md, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. the profiles of  subjects with periodontitis were significant in ds, but not in md. the prevalence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. intermedia were significant in the ds periodontitis group, compared to ds gingivitis group. moreover, the occurrence of p. gingivalis with the type ii fima gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both ds and md, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. conclusions: these results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in ds is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including p. gingivalis with type ii fima.

TI  == smoking and subgingival microflora in periodontal disease.
AB  == aim: the present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. the population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. the checker-board dna-dna hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, p. micros, c. rectus, e. corrodens, s. noxia and s. intermedius. results: using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. using score 4 as cutoff,  contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. no significant differences in detection rates were observed between  smokers and non-smokers. logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. the lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported  the indication of a limited influence of smoking. conclusion: smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == studies on oral health in mentally retarded adults.
AB  == during the last decades, a new policy involving normalisation, integration, equality and deinstitutionalisation of mentally retarded (mr) individuals has been accepted in sweden. consequently, many institutions have been closed and an  increased number of people with mr are now integrated into the swedish community. the general aim of this thesis was to investigate if a greater degree of independence for mr adults influenced the prevalence of oral diseases. material and methods: the caries incidence and prevalence, number of remaining teeth, incidence of tooth mortality and interproximal bone loss were investigated in a group of mr adults, aged 21-40 years, all with protracted, regular preventive dental care. the studied variables were related to living arrangements and degree of mr, and were followed during 8.5 years (papers i, ii and vi). incidence and reasons for tooth mortality were studied during 10 years in institutionalised mr  individuals (paper iii). in connection with the closing-down of an institution for mr adults, the changes of oral hygiene habits, sucrose intake and oral microbiological flora were studied in the new integrated living (papers iv and v). results: less restrictive living arrangements and mild forms of mr were correlated to a high caries prevalence in persons with mr. after 8.5 years, the caries incidence had decreased in all subjects, but persons with mild mr and those who lived integrated still had a higher caries prevalence than other mr adults. with the exception of subjects with down syndrome, the interproximal bone loss during 8.5 years was similar or lower compared to normal swedish populations. institutionalised mr subjects had lost an average of 3.72 teeth during 10 years. periodontitis was the main reason for tooth mortality. persons who cooperated well with dental treatment and those who used neuroleptics lost fewer teeth during the 10-year period compared to other mr individuals. the proportion of subjects with high levels of mutans streptococci and subjects who showed growth of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens decreased after deinstitutionalisation, and less subjects consumed sucrose frequently. the oral hygiene routines, and the levels of lactobacilli, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not influenced by the change in living arrangements. a simplified saliva sampling method, involving licking directly on the bacteria culture, was developed to count lactobacilli in saliva when delivering whole saliva was impossible. conclusions: less restrictive living and a mild degree of  mr were correlated to a high caries prevalence. subjects with poor ability to cooperate with dental treatment and those with down syndrome have an obvious risk of deteriorated oral health. however, compared to normal swedish populations, the mr subjects studied in this thesis had, after several years of regular dental care, satisfactory oral health.

AB  == aim: the occurrence of prevotella intermedia (pi) and prevotella nigrescens (pn)  in relation to natural gingivitis, gingival health and 14-day experimental gingivitis was investigated in 25 non-dental students. materials and methods: samples were taken from the dorsum of the tongue, the tonsils (or tonsillar area), and the supra- and subgingival plaque. results: the microbiological results show that 73% of the samples were positive for the bacterial species presumed to be pi and/or pn. in natural gingivitis, gingival health and in experimental gingivitis 25, 23 and 25 subjects were found to be positive for pi and/or pn, respectively. the results of the 889 isolates that were successfully purified and differentiated, show that almost all subjects were colonized with pn whereas approximately half of the study population harboured pi. these 2 species  were isolated from both dental plaque and mucosal sites and were found to colonize the oral cavity simultaneously. conclusion: in natural gingivitis, at the start and after 14 days of experimental gingivitis, pn was the predominant micro-organism.

TI  == pathways for amino acid metabolism by prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == pathways for amino acid metabolism by prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens were investigated. prevotella strains grew anaerobically in tryptone-based medium and their growth increased upon the addition of aspartate to the medium. washed cells of tryptone-grown strains metabolized aspartate to succinate, acetate, fumarate, malate, formate and ammonia, while from tryptone they produced isobutyrate and isovalerate in addition to the end products from aspartate. cell extracts obtained from the tryptone-grown cells had aspartate ammonia-lyase for the conversion of aspartate to fumarate. methylviologen-dependent fumarate reductase was found to reduce fumarate to succinate. a series of enzymatic activities, including fumarase, nad-dependent malate dehydrogenase, oxaloacetate decarboxylase, methylviologen-dependent pyruvate oxidoreductase, phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase, was detected for the oxidative conversion of fumarate to acetate. pyruvate formate-lyase and nad-dependent formate dehydrogenase were also found for the production and consumption of formate, respectively. methylviologen: nad(p) oxidoreductase was found to be responsible for linkage between these reductive and oxidative pathways. furthermore, the cell extracts had branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase and methylviologen-dependent branched-chain 2-oxoacid oxidoreductase, concomitantly with nad-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase. valine  and leucine could be converted to isobutyryl coa and isovaleryl coa, respectively, through the sequential catalyses of these enzymes, and consequently to isobutyrate and isovalerate, respectively.

TI  == genetic heterogeneity in prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella corporis and related species isolated from oral and nonoral sites.
AB  == prevotella intermedia (43 isolates), prevotella nigrescens (55) and prevotella corporis (8) from oral and nonoral sites were distinguished by species-specific dna fragments, after hybridization of dna fragments with ribosomal rna (ribotyping). eight strains previously identified as p. intermedia did not have these specific fragments. p. nigrescens, p. intermedia and p. corporis formed separate clusters in dendrograms constructed using clustering with an unweighted  pair group method with arithmetic averages of similarity values derived from ribotype patterns, with 10 subclusters in p. intermedia isolates and 26 in p. nigrescens. nine groups of p. intermedia isolates and 6 of p. nigrescens shared identical patterns. specific ribotypes or species were not associated with particular diseases when all isolates were analyzed. however, results from organisms isolated by one laboratory using consistent clinical reporting indicated that p. intermedia was associated with more severe forms of periodontitis and p. nigrescens with mild to moderate disease.

TI  == inhibition of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxicity by bacteria from the subgingival flora.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans produces a pore-forming leukotoxin that lyses human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes. certain proteolytic bacteria may coexist with a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets. we aimed therefore to examine whether oral bacteria can modify the leukotoxicity of  a. actinomycetemcomitans. a total of 55 strains representing 45 bacterial species of the subgingival flora were tested. each strain was incubated with the highly toxic strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans hk 1519 and the leukotoxic activity of the suspension against human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was determined from the activity of the lactate dehydrogenase released upon lysis of the leukocytes. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella loeschii inhibited the leukotoxicity of  a. actinomycetemcomitans cells as well as the activity of leukotoxin purified from the same strain. the bacterial strains without the ability to block leukotoxic activity also failed to destroy pure leukotoxin even after 5 h of incubation. the proteolytic degradation of leukotoxin by p. gingivalis was mainly dependent on the activity of the enzymes r- and k-gingipains. p. intermedia and p. nigrescens also degraded the leukotoxin by enzymes. the results imply a role of the periodontal microflora in modifying the virulence of a. actinomycetemcomitans by destroying its leukotoxin.

TI  == glucose metabolism by prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == glucose metabolism by prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens were investigated. glucose increased the anaerobic growth of these bacteria and promoted the accumulation of intracellular polysaccharide. the polysaccharide was confirmed to be glycogen-like glucan by the absorption spectrum of iodinepolysaccharide complex and the sugar composition. the washed cells consumed glucose anaerobically and converted a part of glucose into the metabolic end-products acetate, formate and succinate. the rest of glucose was confirmed to be accumulated as intracellular polysaccharide. the cells grown in the presence of glucose produced acetate, formate and succinate without exogenous glucose along with the consumption of intracellular polysaccharide. the metabolism of glucose and intracellular polysaccharide required bicarbonate. prevotella cells had hexokinase and a set of the usual enzymes of the embden-meyerhof-parnas pathway except that phosphofructokinase was pyrophosphate-dependent. a series of  enzymes, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase and fumarate reductase, was found for succinate formation. another series of enzymes, pyruvate oxidoreductase, pyruvate formate-lyase, phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase was found for acetate and formate formation. glucose 1,6-bisphosphate-dependent phosphoglucomutase and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-activated udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase were detected for glycogen synthesis, while glycogen phosphorylase was for glycogen degradation. the capacity of intracellular polysaccharide formation in addition to glucose fermentation could be advantageous for survival in the supragingival area as well as in the subgingival area.

TI  == inhibitory effect of lactoferrin on the adhesion of prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261 to hydroxyapatite.
AB  == prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261 (p. nigrescens) cells adhere well to hydroxyapatite treated with citrate (cha), but the attachment is drastically inhibited by lactoferrin (lf). to determine the nature of the iron-free lf responsible for inhibiting p. nigrescens cell attachment, this study tested the duration and frequency of lf treatment of cha and the effects of divalent and trivalent ferric ions. the inhibitory effect on the attachment of p. nigrescens was somewhat higher with bovine lf than human lf. apo lf effectively inhibited p. nigrescens cell attachment to cha, and almost abolished attachment at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. fe3+ saturated lf was unable to inhibit attachment, whereas fe2+ showed a slight effect under the same conditions. the lf absorbed rapidly to cha in less than 10 min. with a lower concentration (0.1 mg/ml) of lf, only three treatments of cha were required for the maximum inhibition of p. nigrescens cell attachment. the quantity of lf adsorbed to the hydroxyapatite (ha) and to p. nigrescens cells was determined by use of [3h]-lf. approximately 25 micrograms of lf protein adsorbed to 5 mg of ha at saturation, and approximately 0.25 microgram of lf did so to the 6 x 10(8) cells.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == automated immunofluorescence for enumeration of selected taxa in supragingival dental plaque.
AB  == the present study investigated a recently developed automated image analysis technique for its applicability to the enumeration of selected bacteria in supragingival dental plaque. following initial calibration, the system is capable to count fluorescence-labeled target cells in up to 48 samples without user interference. test samples contained a characteristic mixture of planktonic bacteria, small almost planar bacterial aggregates, and large, virtually indisruptable clumps with cells from multiple species. due to their complex composition, these samples provided a challenging validation step for the image analysis system. automated enumeration of target bacteria was compared with visual counting of the fluorescence-labeled bacteria. results are shown for six taxa (actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prev. nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii/strep. oralis/strep. sanguis, strep. sobrinus, and veillonella dispar/ v. parvula) with characteristic differences in abundance, cell morphology and aggregation behavior. results revealed good correspondence between the two enumeration techniques (correlation  coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) provided that the portion of target bacteria exceeded 0.05% of the total bacterial cell number. this work demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of fully automated immunofluorescence to analyze such complex ecosystems as supragingival dental plaque.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == coptidis rhizoma inhibits growth and proteases of oral bacteria.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of coptidis rhizoma (cr), a traditional medicinal plant, on oral bacteria. materials and methods: cr extract was prepared by boiling cr in water for 2 h. alkaloids contained in cr extract were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). antibacterial activity of cr extract was estimated from the lowest concentration that did not permit bacterial growth (minimum inhibitory concentration, mic) and the concentrations that inhibited 50% of bacterial proteolytic activity (ic50). results: cr extract inhibited the growth of actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans at mic of 0.031-0.25 mg ml(-1), whereas it had less inhibitory effect (mic: 0.5-2 mg ml(-1)) on the growth of streptococcus and lactobacillus. the major active component of cr extract was berberine (ber), an alkaloid, and its inhibiting specificity to bacterial growth was similar to that of cr extract. cr extract and ber were bacteriostatic at the mics against most of the bacteria, and bacteriocidal at the concentrations higher than the mics. ber inhibited the activities of collagenase from p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: cr extract and ber had an inhibitory effect on periodontopathogenic bacteria. these results suggest the possibility of their clinical application for the treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == survey for collagenase gene prtc in porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas endodontalis isolated from endodontic infections.
AB  == collagenase is a potential virulence factor shown to be expressed by porphyromonas gingivalis associated with periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to use the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect the presence of the collagenase gene (prtc) in 21 strains of porphyromonas species isolated from  endodontic infections. type strains for p. gingivalis (atcc 33277), p. endodontalis (atcc 35406), prevotella intermedia (atcc 25611), and prevotella nigrescens (atcc 33563) were used as controls. when pcr primers specific for the  16s ribosomal rna gene of p. gingivalis or p. endodontalis were used, 16 of the strains were identified as p. gingivalis, and five strains were identified as p.  endodontalis. the presence of the prtc gene for collagenase was detected using pcr. amplicons were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, with an 815 bp amplicon representing the presence of the collagenase gene. type strain atcc 33277 and all 16 clinical isolates of p. gingivalis produced the collagenase gene amplicon. neither type strain atcc 35406 nor the five strains from clinical isolates of p. endodontalis produced the collagenase gene amplicon. these results indicate that p. gingivalis from endodontic infections possesses the prtc gene. p. endodontalis does not seem to exhibit prtc. the virulence of p. gingivalis may be related to its production of collagenase.

TI  == identifying clinically important gram-negative anaerobes from the oral cavity.
AB  == gram-negative oral anaerobes have frequently been associated with periodontal disease, some species more frequently than others. the confusing classification of these organisms has often obscured the association with disease of particular  species within this group of organisms. this investigation aimed to compare different identification methods that could be applied in clinical research. clinical isolates were collected and identified by three different methods: screening with phenotypic tests, commercial identification kits, and a 16s rrna-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. forty-three reference strains  of 19 prevotella and porphyromonas species were also included in the investigation. the phenotypic screen easily differentiated porph. gingivalis from the other pigmented species. the screen also gave a good indication of separation of the lactose-fermenting species from the lactose non-fermenting species, although diversity can be seen in beta-galactosidase activity. commercial identification kits did not add much to identification achieved with the phenotypic screen, only 20% of porph. gingivalis isolates could be identified to  species level with the kits. neither the kits nor the phenotypic screen could differentiate pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens. with the pcr method, pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens were easily separated, and porph. gingivalis was readily identified. because of 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, pr. melaninogenica and pr. veroralis could not be separated by the pcr method.

TI  == possible potentiation of toxins from prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and porphyromonas gingivalis by cotinine.
AB  == background: smoking is a recognized risk factor for the initiation and progression of periodontitis. however, the mechanism by which smoking induces its negative effects on the periodontium is not clear. this study aimed to test the hypothesis that synergy may occur between cotinine and bacterial products isolated from 3 putative periodontopathogens. methods: a chick embryo toxin assay was used to investigate bacterial toxins (cell-free extracellular toxins and cell-free cell lysates) from 5 species with and without cotinine. a total of 9 putative periodontopathogens (3 species) and 2 non-oral controls (2 species) were studied. the periodontal species were: prevotella intermedia (n = 4), prevotella  nigrescens (n = 4), and porphyromonas gingivalis (n = 1). the control species tested were: staphylococcus aureus (n = 1) and escherichia coli (n = 1). results: the toxicity kill was significantly greater than expected by simple addition alone (p <0.05, fisher's exact test) between cotinine (800 ng/ml) and 1) the cell-free extracellular toxins of p. nigrescens mh1 and 2) the cell-free cell lysates of p. intermedia mh2. synergy occurred with cotinine plus the cell-free extracellular toxins in all but 3 periodontal isolates, and the cell-free cell lysates in all but 2 periodontal isolates. cotinine significantly (p <0.05, fisher's exact test) enhanced the effects of cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates from one control species (e. coli), but not the other (s. aureus). conclusions: these findings indicate that synergy in an in vitro assay can occur  between cotinine and toxins from putative periodontopathogens. this may be one important mechanism by which smoking increases the severity of periodontitis.

TI  == microbial findings at failing implants.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate qualitative differences in the subgingival  microbiota at titanium implants, ad modum branemark, demonstrating clinical and radiographic signs of loss of supporting tissues (peri-implantitis) as compared to implants surrounded by healthy tissues. a total of 37 patients demonstrating 1 or more implants with bone loss > or = 3 threads, bleeding on probing and/or suppuration and 51 patients with clinically healthy mucosa and no bone loss were  recruited for the study. in each patient subgingival bacterial samples were obtained using paper-points, and subjected to microbiological analysis by culture. the two types of clinical conditions showed distinct bacterial profiles. for implants with peri-implantitis putative periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, were found in 60% of the cases and microorganisms primarily not associated with periodontitis, such as staphylococcus spp., enterics and candida spp., were found in 55% of the peri-imaplant lesions. in contrast, implants surrounded by healthy tissue demonstrated a microbiota associated with periodontal health. the results indicate that the microbiota of the healthy peri-implant sulci is similar to that from corresponding conditions around teeth. however, in peri-implant areas staphylococci, enterics and yeasts were found almost as frequently as periopathogens indicating differences as compared to the microbiota around periodontitis affected teeth. a microbiological diagnosis may therefore be of guidance for the choice of antimicrobial treatment in patients with peri-implant  infection.

TI  == direct detection of prevotella intermedia and p. nigrescens in suppurative oral infection by amplification of 16s rrna gene.
AB  == a specific 16s rdna pcr and subsequent hybridisation reaction was designed to discriminate between strains of prevotella intermedia (n = 15) and p. nigrescens  (n = 15). this technique was then used to detect the presence of these two bacterial species in acute suppurative oral infection. a total of 36 pus samples  aspirated from 26 peri-apical abscesses, three root canals, three periodontal abscesses, two cases of refractory periodontitis, one cyst and one haematoma was  examined. a portion of the pus sample was processed by pcr and the remainder of the specimen was subjected to routine culture. the pcr-based technique gave an identical pattern of detection of p. intermedia or p. nigrescens to that obtained by culture for 30 of the 36 specimens. either p. intermedia or p. nigrescens was  present in 14 samples and neither species was detected in 16 samples. in the remaining six samples the pcr method indicated the presence of one (n = 3) or both (n = 3) of the prevotella species but neither or only one species was isolated by culture. it is concluded that the presence of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens in pus can be detected rapidly and specifically by direct pcr amplification of 16s rdna. p. nigrescens was detected more frequently than p. intermedia in suppurative peri-apical infection both by culture and pcr.

AB  == aim: this study determined the frequency of porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in 20 closed periapical lesions associated with symptomatic and asymptomatic refractory endodontic disease. methodology: to deliniate possible oral sources of p. endodontalis, the presence of the organism was assessed in selected subgingival sites and saliva in the same study patients. periapical samples were obtained by  paper points during surgical endodontic procedures using methods designed to minimize contamination by non-endodontic microorganisms. subgingival plaque samples were obtained by paper points from three periodontal pockets and from the pocket of the tooth associated with the closed periapical lesion. unstimulated saliva was collected from the surface of the soft palate. bacterial identification was performed using a species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection method. results: p. endodontalis was not identified in any periapical lesion, even though subgingival samples from eight patients (40%) revealed the p. endodontalis-specific amplicon. p. gingivalis occurred in one periapical lesion that was associated with moderate pain. p. nigrescens, p. endodontalis and p. intermedia were not detected in any periapical lesion studied. conclusions: black-pigmented anaerobic rods appear to be infrequent inhabitants of the closed periapical lesion.

TI  == beta-lactamase production in prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella pallens genotypes and in vitro susceptibilities to selected antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the present study investigated the beta-lactamase production of 73 prevotella intermedia, 84 prevotella nigrescens, and 14 prevotella pallens isolates and their in vitro susceptibilities to six antimicrobial agents. the p. intermedia and p. nigrescens isolates were recovered from oral and extraoral samples obtained from subjects in two geographic locations from 1985 to 1995. the clonality of the beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative isolates and the clustering of the genotypes were studied by arbitrarily primed-pcr fingerprinting. beta-lactamase production was detected in 29% of p. intermedia isolates, 29% of p. nigrescens isolates, and 57% of p. pallens isolates. no difference in the frequencies of beta-lactamase production by p. intermedia and p. nigrescens between isolates from oral and extraoral sites, between isolates obtained at different time periods, or between p. intermedia isolates from different geographic locations was observed. however, the p. nigrescens isolates  from the united states were significantly more frequently (p = 0.015) beta-lactamase positive than those from finland. no association between the genotypes and beta-lactamase production or between the genotypes and the sources  of the isolates was found. the penicillin g mics at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were 8 microg/ml for p. intermedia, 8 microg/ml for p. nigrescens, and 16 microg/ml for p. pallens. for the beta-lactamase-negative isolates, the corresponding values were 0.031, 0.031, and 0.125 microg/ml, and for the beta-lactamase-positive isolates, the corresponding values were 16, 8, and 32 microg/ml. all isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, metronidazole, azithromycin, and trovafloxacin. the mics of amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefoxitin were relatively higher for the beta-lactamase-positive population than for the beta-lactamase-negative population.

AB  == a total of 91 isolates of prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens from subgingival sites were identified by pcr using primers specific for sequences of  16s rrna. the hemolytic and hemagglutinating activities of the p. intermedia isolates exhibited significantly higher levels compared to those of the p. nigrescens isolates by quantitative analysis. the hemagglutinin gene (phg) was found in 23 of 26 p. intermedia isolates (88.5%), whereas it was found in only two of 44 isolates (4.5%) of p. nigrescens. the high hemolytic and hemagglutinating activities of p. intermedia may be involved in the pathogenicity of p. intermedia in the progression of periodontal disease.

TI  == incidence of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens carriage among family members with subclinical periodontal disease.
AB  == we established a typing system for prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens using the combination of pcr ribotyping and arbitrarily primed pcr (ap-pcr) fingerprinting and applied this system to the study of intrafamilial incidence of these species in the oral cavity. pcr ribotyping followed by subtyping by ap-pcr fingerprinting was applied to each type strain of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens and 54 isolates (32 isolates of p. intermedia and 24 isolates of p. nigrescens) from extraoral infections, resulting in an excellent discriminatory power (discrimination index, 0.99) for both species. a total of 18 subjects from six families, with the subjects from each family comprising the mother, the father, and a child who had subclinical early-stage to moderate adult periodontitis or simple gingivitis and who carried p. intermedia or p. nigrescens, or both, were enrolled in the study of intrafamilial carriage. when 20 colonies per specimen of subgingival plaque, if available, were picked from primary culture, 115 p. intermedia and 178 p. nigrescens isolates were recovered  from the 18 subjects. among the subjects studied, family members shared the same  subtype strain(s) but non-family members did not. multiple subtypes were found in 8 (57%) of the 14 p. nigrescens-positive subjects but in only 3 (27%) of the 11 p. intermedia-positive subjects; the difference was, however, not statistically significant (p = 0.14). these results suggest that the combination of pcr ribotyping and ap-pcr fingerprinting is well suited for the epidemiological study of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens and that each family seems to carry a distinct subtype(s) of these species.

TI  == oral microflora in subjects with reduced salivary secretion.
AB  == it is generally assumed that a decreased salivary secretion rate will promote plaque accumulation and increase the risk for caries, gingival inflammation, and  mucosal infections. in this study, the effect of hyposalivation on the oral microflora was examined. the following micro-organisms were analyzed in rinsing samples from 14 subjects with hyposalivation: the total number of anaerobically growing micro-organisms, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and enterics. the study group, age 53 +/- 7 years, had no history of radiation therapy and showed no signs of inflammation in their salivary glands on biopsy. all were dentate with a mean of 24 +/- 3 teeth. their salivary secretion rates were 0.03 +/- 0.02 ml/min  (unstimulated) and 0.84 +/- 0.65 ml/min (stimulated). the control group was matched to the hyposalivation group according to age, sex, and number of teeth. there was a significantly increased number of lactobacilli, and a tendency, not statistically significant and with large variations within the groups, toward a higher proportion of mutans streptococci and a lower proportion of alpha-hemolytic streptococci in the hyposalivation group. the presence of micro-organisms associated with gingival inflammation and mucosal infections was  comparable with that in the healthy controls. the results indicated that a low salivary secretion rate mainly promotes a flora associated with the development of caries.

TI  == periodontitis associated bacteria in supragingival plaque of dental hygienists: stability of carrier state and clinical development.
AB  == the purpose of this study was the clinical and microbiological re-examination of  dental hygienists, who, 30 months before, had shown remarkably high supragingival levels of periodontitis-associated micro-organisms. interdental plaque was collected from the same molar sites and investigated by the same immunofluorescence assay with taxa-specific monoclonal antibodies as at the initial examination. on average, the 15 re-examined subjects showed slightly increased plaque levels but unchanged bleeding on probing scores (0.3-1.4). pocket formation was restricted to a single subject. prevotella intermedia/p. nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros were present in every plaque sample. prevalences of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and campylobacter rectus were again between 20-40%, but some fluctuation within subjects was noted. the data confirm supragingival plaque as a natural habitat for periodontitis-associated bacteria in periodontially healthy persons, and indicate that colonization with a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus or c. rectus is mostly stable in spite of better than average personal plaque control.

TI  == flow cytometry to monitor phagocytosis and oxidative burst of anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == the reduced susceptibility to phagocytosis found among some periodontopathogenic  anaerobes may account for the differences between invasive and non-invasive strains. we applied flow cytometry as a powerful tool to analyze and quantify phagocytosis using standardized cultures of oral anaerobes (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros) and heparinized whole blood. bacteria were labeled by a fluorescein-methylester and their esterase activity, resulting in green fluorescence. ingested bacteria could be detected easily and quantified by a shift towards green fluorescence in  the pmnl population involved and a concomitant decrease in the bacterial population. furthermore, the oxidative burst of pmnls was detected in parallel assays using the dye dhr123 which becomes fluorescent upon oxidation during the oxidative burst process. we found a great diversity in phagocytosis susceptibility determined by estimating the portion of phagocytosing pmnls, ranging from 10.6% (strain w83) to > 99.4% (e.g. atcc 33277t) in p. gingivalis and from 15.9% (strain mh5) to > 95% (atcc 33563t) in p. nigrescens. in contrast, almost all p. intermedia strains as well as the representatives of the other anaerobic, putative periodontopathic species tested showed no or only moderate resistance in the phagocytosis assay. comparison of clinical data of patients and the extent of phagocytosis resistance of the corresponding p. gingivalis strains  suggests that this virulence factor may contribute to the clinical outcome.

AB  == this study investigated the ability of anaerobic periodontal bacteria to inactivate and resist killing by antimicrobial peptides through production of extracellular proteases. antibacterial activities of peptides were assessed in a  double-layer agarose diffusion assay, and mics and mbcs were determined in broth  microdilution assays. culture supernates of porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella spp. inactivated mastoparan, magainin ii and cecropin b whilst gram-positive oral supragingival bacteria had no effect. inactivation was prevented by protease inhibitors and was unaffected by 45% human serum. purified  proteases from the periodontopathogen porph. gingivalis inactivated peptides [cecropin b, brevinin, camel (cecropin a 1-7 + melittin 2-9), mastoparan] as would be predicted from the amino acid sequences of the peptides and the known bond specificities of these arg-x and lys-x enzymes. maldi-tof ms revealed that inactivation of cecropin b by porph. gingivalis protease was due to specific cleavage of the molecule. inactivation of cecropin b by proteases took 10-15 min. paradoxically, mics of cecropin b against porph. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia were low, while prevotella nigrescens was resistant, suggesting that production of proteases alone is insufficient to protect porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia from the action of antimicrobial peptides. thus, antimicrobial peptides could be developed as therapeutic agents targeted against specific periodontal pathogens.

TI  == microbiota of successful osseointegrated dental implants.
AB  == background: the long-term survival of dental implants depends, in part, on control of bacterial infection in the peri-implant region. periodontal pathogens  colonized implants symptomatic through infection, whereas the microbiota of successful implants was similar to that of periodontal health. this study examined the impact on the peri-implant microbiota of crown restorations; implant type; length of time of loading; history of implant or periodontal infections; and whether implants replaced single or multiple teeth. it was of particular interest to evaluate implant colonization by species in a newly described red complex of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus. methods: this study sampled 43 partially edentulous subjects with successfully osseointegrated titanium root-form dental implants. eighty-one (81)  non-submerged and 20 submerged asymptomatic implants, 83 crowned, and 36 uncrowned teeth were sampled from peri-implant or subgingival sites. the microbiota of samples was evaluated using whole genomic dna probes in a checkerboard assay to 23 subgingival species. results: implants were colonized principally by oral streptococci, capnocytophagae, veillonella parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the periodontal species,  p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and campylobacter rectus were detected in a few subjects. the microbiota around crowned implants and crowned teeth was similar. streptococcus oralis, p. intermedia, and selenomonas noxia were elevated in samples from uncrowned teeth compared to crowned teeth and implants. microbial complexity increased as loading time increased, but colonization by periodontal pathogens, including red complex  species, was higher in subjects with previous periodontal disease. no differences were observed in the microbiota of 1- and 2-stage implants, or between implants supporting single or multiple restorations. conclusions: while presence of crowns had only a minor impact on the peri-implant microbiota, microbial changes were observed the longer the implants had been in function and in those patients with  a history of periodontal or peri-implant infections. a history of periodontitis had a greater impact on the peri-implant microbiota than implant loading time. the major influence on the peri-implant microbiota was, however, the microbiota on remaining teeth. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, red complex periodontal pathogens, colonized several implants, although all implants were successfully osseointegrated.

TI  == use of pcr and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis techniques for differentiation of prevotella intermedia sensu stricto and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == primers were designed from 16s rrna sequences of prevotella intermedia sensu stricto and prevotella nigrescens and were used to discriminate these two species by pcr. the results were compared with those from the pcr technique using primers designed from arbitrarily primed pcr products by guillot and mouton (e. guillot and c. mouton, j. clin. microbiol. 35:1876-1882, 1997). the specificities of both assays were studied by using p. intermedia atcc 25611, p. nigrescens atcc 33563,  174 clinical isolates of p. intermedia sensu lato, and 59 reference strains and 58 clinical isolates of other prevotella species and/or common oral flora. in addition, the usefulness and reliability of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) in the differentiation of the two species were examined by comparing the results with those from pcr assays. the controversial lipase test for distinguishing these species was also carried out. unambiguous differentiation was made by both pcr assays, and the results matched each other.  the sds-page assay was found to misidentify a few strains tested, compared with the results of pcr assays. the lipase test was positive for both species, including the reference strains of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. we conclude that both pcr assays are simple, rapid, reliable, and specific methods which could be used in clinical studies and that the lipase test is not valuable in the differentiation. the reliable discrimination of the two species by sds-page is questionable.

TI  == pathogenicity of peptostreptococcus micros morphotypes and prevotella species in  pure and mixed culture.
AB  == recently, an atypical rough colony morphotype of peptostreptococcus micros, a species which is found in ulcerating infections, including periodontitis, was isolated. the virulence of morphotypes alone and in combination with prevotella intermedia and p. nigrescens was investigated both in vivo and in vitro. all strains tested induced abscesses containing fluid pus in a mouse skin model, and  lesions caused by monocultures of the rough morphotype strains of p. micros were  statistically significantly larger than those induced by the smooth morphotype strains. inocula containing both morphotypes produced similar sized abscesses compared to mono-inocula containing the same bacterial load. both prevotella species induced small abscesses when inoculated alone, and when pr. nigrescens was inoculated with one of the other strains, the abscesses were not significantly different from the abscesses induced by the mono-infections of this strain. synergy, in terms of higher numbers of colony forming units (cfu) in the  mixed inocula, was found for all combinations of the rough morphotypes of p. micros and both prevotella spp. pus from abscesses caused by combinations of peptostreptococcus and prevotella spp. transmitted the infection to other mice, but no abscesses were formed in mice inoculated with pus induced by mono-inocula. these results demonstrated synergic activity between both rough and smooth p. micros strains and oral prevotella strains. the in-vitro co-culture experiments produced no evidence of growth stimulation. the effect of p. micros strains on the immune system was investigated by testing their ability to initiate luminol-dependent chemiluminescence of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in the presence and absence of human serum. in the latter, the rough morphotype strains  initiated higher counts than the smooth morphotype strains. further work is needed to elucidate the difference in virulence between the smooth and the rough  morphotype cells of p. micros and the nature of the interaction with the prevotella spp.

TI  == proficiencies of three anaerobic culture systems for recovering periodontal pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobic culture is employed routinely in the primary isolation of periodontal pathogenic bacteria. however, little or no data exist on the relative abilities of the coy anaerobic chamber (coy laboratory products, grass lake, mich.), the gaspak (becton dickinson microbiology systems, cockeysville, md.), and the anaeropack (mitsubishi gas chemical america, inc., new york, n.y.) systems to grow important periodontal species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, bacteroides forsythus, eubacterium species, campylobacter species, fusobacterium species, and peptostreptococcus micros. a total of 78 specimens from advanced periodontitis lesions were collected anaerobically, plated on enriched blood agar medium, and incubated at 35 degrees  c for 5 to 7 days in each anaerobic culture system. the three culture systems were equally efficient in isolating porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia/nigrescens. the coy anaerobic chamber yielded the highest proportional recoveries of campylobacter (p = 0.0001; nonparametric analysis of variance) and  eubacterium (p = 0.009). the coy anaerobic chamber and the gaspak system demonstrated higher proportional recoveries of bacteroides forsythus (p = 0.0006) and peptostreptococcus micros (p = 0.0001) than the anaeropack system. the anaeropack system was most efficient in growing fusobacterium species (p = 0.0001). overall, the coy anaerobic chamber and the gaspak system showed the highest proportional recoveries of putative periodontal pathogens, but the recoveries by the various anaerobic test systems varied considerably from sample  to sample.

TI  == risk indicators for harboring periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the risk for harboring 6 putative periodontal pathogens in 4 selected periodontal pockets, in whole saliva, or in either site (i.e., orally) was determined in 52 caucasians, 49 african-americans, 48 asian-americans, and 50 hispanics living in  los angeles. 16s rrna pcr analysis assessed the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. step-wise  regression analysis determined the relationship between the occurrence of each organism and various explanatory variables (risk indicators). periodontal probing depth or disease severity was positively associated with all 6 study organisms. african-americans carried an increased risk for harboring p. gingivalis in saliva (odds ratio [or] 2.95) and orally (or 2.66), and a reduced risk for harboring t.  denticola orally (or 0.34). asian-americans showed an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 6.63) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 5.39), in saliva (or 5.74), and orally (or  5.81). hispanics demonstrated an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 12.27) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 6.07), in saliva (or 8.72), and orally (or 7.98). age was positively associated with the prevalence of p. gingivalis in saliva (or 1.20) and orally (or 1.20), and of a. actinomycetemcomitans orally (or 1.18). the male  gender was a risk factor for harboring p. intermedia in periodontal pockets (or 2.40), in saliva (or 3.31), and orally (or 4.25), and for harboring p. nigrescens in saliva (or 2.85). the longer the subjects resided in the united states, the less likely a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected orally (or 0.82). former smokers demonstrated a decreased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in saliva (or 0.23). current smokers displayed an increased risk for harboring t. denticola in periodontal pockets (or 4.61). the number of dental visits in the past 10 years was inversely related to the prevalence of p. intermedia orally (or 0.96). the prevalence of p. intermedia in saliva was positively associated with the length of time from the last dental visit (or 1.01). this study suggests that genetic and/or environmental factors predispose subjects to oral colonization by  putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == incidence of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in periodontal health and disease.
AB  == the incidence of black-pigmented rods (bprs), especially prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens, in periodontal health and disease were examined. furthermore, the degradative enzyme activities of p. intermedia were compared among the strains from periodontal health and disease. microbiological specimens  were collected from subgingival crevice or periodontal pocket by paper point. the bprs were found in 71.1% of periodontally healthy subjects (n=45), and in 47.1% of healthy sites (n=34) and 87.8% of active sites (n=41) among periodontally diseased patients. porphyromonas gingivalis was detected only in active sites of  periodontally diseased patients (17.8% of 180 strains). p. intermedia was the predominant bpr in both healthy and active sites (37.3 and 41.7%, respectively) of the patients. however, p. nigrescens was the predominant bpr (70.5% of 173 strains) in periodontally healthy subjects. the enzyme activities of esterase, esterase-lipase, acid-phosphatase and alpha-fucosidase of p. intermedia strains isolated from active sites in patients were significantly higher (p<0.05) than those of healthy subjects. the results suggest that p. intermedia might increase  the activity of degradative enzymes under a certain condition and support the progression of periodontitis.

TI  == analysis of ph-driven disruption of oral microbial communities in vitro.
AB  == previously, a mixed culture chemostat system was used to demonstrate that the ph  generated from carbohydrate metabolism, rather than carbohydrate availability per se, was responsible for the shifts observed in the oral microflora which are associated with high carbohydrate diets and the development of dental caries. the aim of this study was to determine more accurately the microbially generated ph at which such shifts occurred. nine oral bacteria were grown in three independent chemostats, and pulsed with glucose on 10 consecutive days. in one chemostat, ph  control was discontinued for 6 h, and the ph fall was restricted to a minimum value of ph 5.5; the ph fall was arrested in the other two chemostats at either ph 5. 0, or at ph 4.5. when the ph was allowed to fall, the numbers and proportions of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus rhamnosus increased; this increase was directly related to the magnitude of the ph fall. veillonella dispar was the most numerous organism following all glucose pulsing regimes, especially  at low ph. the increase in proportions of acidogenic bacteria was accompanied by  a fall in the proportions of acid-sensitive species (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis). the counts of these species were relatively stable between ph 5.5 and 4.5, but were markedly reduced when the ph fell below ph 4.5; neisseria subflava could not persist in the culture at ph 4.5 or below. the data suggest that the disruption of communities associated with glucose metabolism and low ph can be explained in  terms of a two-stage process. a fall in ph to a value between ph 5.5 and 4.5 may  allow the enrichment of potentially cariogenic species, whilst permitting species associated with health to remain relatively unaffected. a further reduction in ph (<ph 4.5) may not only enhance the competitiveness of odontopathogens, but inhibit the growth and metabolism of non-caries-associated species. the results also indicate that species other that mutans streptococci or lactobacilli are competitive at ph values low enough to demineralise enamel, and thus suggest that a broader range of micro-organisms may be associated with caries initiation.

TI  == role of fusobacterium nucleatum and coaggregation in anaerobe survival in planktonic and biofilm oral microbial communities during aeration.
AB  == coaggregation is a well-characterized phenomenon by which specific pairs of oral  bacteria interact physically. the aim of this study was to examine the patterns of coaggregation between obligately anaerobic and oxygen-tolerant species that coexist in a model oral microbial community. obligate anaerobes other than fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregated only poorly with oxygen-tolerant species. in contrast, f. nucleatum was able to coaggregate not only with both oxygen-tolerant and other obligately anaerobic species but also with otherwise-noncoaggregating obligate anaerobe-oxygen-tolerant species pairs. the effects of the presence or absence of f. nucleatum on anaerobe survival in both the biofilm and planktonic phases of a complex community of oral bacteria grown in an aerated (gas phase, 200 ml of 5% co2 in air x min-1) chemostat system were then investigated. in the  presence of f. nucleatum, anaerobes persisted in high numbers (>10(7) x ml-1 in the planktonic phase and >10(7) x cm-2 in 4-day biofilms). in an equivalent culture in the absence of f. nucleatum, the numbers of black-pigmented anaerobes  (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella nigrescens) were significantly reduced (p </= 0.001) in both the planktonic phase and in 4-day biofilms, while the numbers of facultatively anaerobic bacteria increased in these communities. coaggregation-mediated interactions between f. nucleatum and other species facilitated the survival of obligate anaerobes in aerated environments.

AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == the utility of whole saliva to detect the oral presence of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study compared the presence of 6 periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva and subgingival plaque of 202 subjects. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. each study subject contributed a whole saliva sample and a paper point sample pooled from the deepest periodontal pocket in each quadrant of the dentition. the kappa test revealed a fair agreement between the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola in whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples (kappa > 0.4). the mcnemar test showed that the differences between sample types were due to a more frequent detection of the 3 organisms in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01). prevotella nigrescens also was detected more frequently in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01; mcnemar  test). although little agreement between samples was found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus (kappa < or = 0.4), neither whole saliva nor pocket samples showed better detection for these 2 species (p < 0.01,  mcnemar test). the results indicate that whole saliva is superior to pooled periodontal pocket samples to detect p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola in the oral cavity. the detection of oral a. actinomycetemcomitans and b. forsythus with reasonably good accuracy may require  both whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples.

AB  == large quantities of prevotella nigrescens (intermedia) atcc 25261 (p. nigrescens) cells adhere to hydroxyapatite (ha) treated with citrate, but do not adhere experimental pellicle prepared from human whole saliva. to determine the nature of the citrate responsible for promoting p. nigrescens cell adhesion, the duration and frequency of citrate treatment of ha and the inhibitory effect of other carboxylates were tested. the citrate rapidly adhered to ha beads in less than 15 min. with a lower concentration (0.4 mm) of citrate, four treatments of ha were required to promote the maximum adherence to p. nigrescens cells. citrate-enhanced p. nigrescens cell adherence to ha beads was also inhibited in the presence of cis-aconitate, oxaloacetate and oxalsuccinate. it was also found  that p. nigrescens cells heated to 65 degrees c or higher for 5 min could no longer become attached to citrate-treated ha. these data suggest that citrate is  one of the essential factors responsible for p. nigrescens cell attachment to apatitic surfaces, and that p. nigrescens' adhesion to citrate is extremely heat-sensitive.

TI  == evaluation of the antimicrobial effect of lactoferrin on porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the antimicrobial effect of lactoferrin (apolf) on the oral, black-pigmented anaerobes porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and p. nitrescens has been studied. apolf did not kill any of these species but it did inhibit the growth of p. gingivalis, while iron-saturated lf (felf) had no effect. the other  two species were unaffected by apolf. this growth inhibitory effect of apolf could not be explained on the basis of chelation of inorganic iron, since growth  of p. gingivalis occurred in the presence of ethylenediamine di-o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid provided haemin was added. both apolf and felf reduced haemin uptake by all three species and caused the release of cell-bound haemin in a dose-dependent manner. in addition, haemin reduced the binding of both apolf and felf to p. intermedia and p. nigrescens but stimulated the binding of lf by p. gingivalis. these data suggest that lf forms complexes with haemin in solution and competes for the binding of haemin to certain cell receptors, possibly lipopolysaccharides, but this is not sufficient to inhibit growth of the bacteria. p. gingivalis appears to bind lf-haemin complexes, as well as haemin alone, which may facilitate access of the lf to the outer and cytoplasmic membranes of p. gingivalis, so disrupting function.

TI  == in vitro adhesion of two strains of prevotella nigrescens to the dentin of the root canal: the part played by different irrigation solutions.
AB  == blocks of bovine incisor dentin, on the root canal surface of which a smear layer had been formed, were inoculated in vitro with two strains of prevotella nigrescens, a wild sampled strain and a reference one (nctc 9336). half the blocks were pretreated with irrigating solutions: 6% citric acid for 5 min + 6.25% sodium hypochlorite for 10 min. they were compared with the other blocks simply rinsed in distilled water (i.e. the control samples). the bacteria adhering to the dentin surface after an incubation time of 3 h were counted by direct examination using a scanning electron microscope. the adhesion of p. nigrescens was less marked on all of the samples treated with irrigating solutions. adherence was particularly significant in the case of the wild strain  (f = 10.22). the latter was far more active than the reference strain (f = 35.82). the use of a chelating agent at the end of root canal preparation served  to remove the smear layer and limited the attachment of p. nigrescens to the dentin.

TI  == supernatant cytotoxicity and proteolytic activity of selected oral bacteria against human gingival fibroblasts in vitro.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine if endodontic bacterial act in vitro on human gingival fibroblast functions via extracellular products. the bacteria used were prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, peptostreptoccocus micros and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. supernatants were collected from bacterial cultures at the beginning of the stationary phase when their density was similar. toxins that inhibited fibroblast proliferation were found in all culture supernatants of gram-positive or gram-negative bacterial strains, except  for prev. nigrescens. the cytotoxicity of a. actinomycetemcomitans supernatant was about 1000 fold higher than the others. this supernatant diluted to 1/1000 led to total fibroblast growth inhibition whereas only 25% growth inhibition was  obtained with capn. ochracea and pept. micros diluted to 1/10. bacterial supernatant proteolytic activity was investigated in confluent fibroblast cultures that were incubated for 48 hr with each of the supernatants diluted to 1/2 except for a. actinomycetemcomitans supernatant diluted to 1/20. indirect immunofluorescence studies of extracellular-matrix molecules, followed by immunoelectrophoretic analysis of extracts of whole-cell layers, demonstrated that only conditioned medium of prev. nigrescens had a proteolytic activity capable of degrading the greater part of type i collagen and fibronectin fibres in the extracellular matrix.

AB  == 28 patients, 13 smokers and 15 non-smokers with untreated advanced periodontal disease, were subjected to a series of oral hygiene instructions and treated with non-surgical periodontal therapy. baseline values regarding clinical data did not differ significantly between the groups. 6 months following therapy the full-mouth bleeding score among smokers was 36.5% as compared to 22.7% for non-smokers (p < 0.05). probing depth was reduced by 1.9 mm for smokers and by 2.5 mm for non-smokers. this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). the level of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia/nigrescens was reduced in both groups as compared to baseline. a. actinonmycetemcomitans, however demonstrated a slight increase in mean values at 6 months. this was especially notable for smokers in which a. actinomycetemcomitans were more difficult to eradicate. conclusively, the microbiological response found in this study seems to be in conformity with the clinical response with little influence of the smoking habits.

TI  == salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque as related to periodontal and hiv infection status.
AB  == levels of total iga and specific iga reactive with streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by elisa in parotid saliva from hiv+ and hiv- persons with healthy gingiva (hg), chronic gingivitis, chronic marginal periodontitis (cmp), or necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (nup). when the hiv+ group was compared with the hiv- group regardless of periodontal status, total salivary iga concentration was higher in hiv+ patients, but no such difference was observed for total iga output. hiv+ cmp displayed higher total iga concentration as compared with hiv- cmp. no significant differences in specific iga outputs and ratios were detected  between hiv+ and hiv- subgroups with similar periodontal status. hiv+ nup displayed increased specific iga output towards s. mutans and increased specific  iga ratio values towards s. mutans, p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ cmp, and increased specific iga ratio values towards s. mutans and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ hg. no such differences were observed between the hiv- subgroups. in sum, salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque seem not to be related to chronic periodontal disease and hiv infection, but are  possibly influenced by acute periodontal infection.

TI  == oral food consumption and subgingival microorganisms: subgingival microbiota of gastrostomy tube-fed children and healthy controls.
AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == reduced serum igg reactivities with bacteria from dental plaque in hiv-infected persons with periodontitis.
AB  == serum samples were obtained from 44 hiv-seropositive (hiv+) and 37 hiv-seronegative (hiv-) persons that were grouped according to periodontal status. serum igg and iga reactivities towards streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis. prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by means of elisa. hiv+ persons with chronic marginal periodontitis showed significantly lower igg reactivities to the periodontal pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum as compared  with their hiv- counterparts (p < 0.05). specific serum iga reactivities were similar in the two periodontitis groups, except for p. nigrescens where the hiv+  group with chronic marginal periodontitis had lower values than their systemically healthy counterparts (p < 0.05). the results indicate that hiv infection affects the humoral serum immune responses against bacteria in dental plaque; the depressed antibody responses may contribute to the increased susceptibility for periodontal infections in hiv-infected patients.

TI  == "checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the present study compared the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect  to the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled dna probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial  test panels. we found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data.  if the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. the use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87.  the checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. it was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.

TI  == characterization of the lactoferrin-dependent inhibition of the adhesion of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens to fibroblasts and to a reconstituted basement membrane.
AB  == lactoferrin was previously shown to inhibit the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens to human cells. lactoferrin was also shown to competitively inhibit the binding of these bacteria to the basement membrane protein laminin. the present study aimed to determine the type of interactions inhibited by lactoferrin. lactoferrin binds to fibroblast monolayers and matrigel, a reconstituted basement membrane, through ionic interactions. the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans to these substrata was mainly dependent on the ionic strength of the environment. p. intermedia and  p. nigrescens also adhere to fibroblasts mainly by ionic interactions, while their adhesion to matrigel seems to be mediated by specific mechanisms. lectin-type interactions were not found to be involved in the binding of these bacteria to the substrata. treatment of either a. actinomycetemcomitans or fibroblasts with lactoferrin decreased the adhesion in a dose-dependent manner, while lactoferrin treatment of matrigel alone had no adhesion-counteracting effect. adhesion of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens to matrigel was not significantly affected by the ionic strength, but the presence of lactoferrin inhibited the adhesion. lactoferrin bound to matrigel, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens was rapidly released, while lactoferrin bound to a. actinomycetemcomitans and fibroblasts was retained. these findings indicate that  lactoferrin-dependent inhibition of the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p.  intermedia and p. nigrescens to fibroblasts and matrigel can involve binding of lactoferrin to both the bacteria and substrata. the decreased adhesion may be due to blocking of both specific adhesin-ligand as well as non-specific charge-dependent interactions.

TI  == beta-lactamase production by oral pigmented prevotella species isolated from young children.
AB  == the frequency of beta-lactamase production by oral pigmented prevotella species isolated from 23 healthy young children and the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for 186 available beta-lactamase-positive isolates were examined by using  the chromogenic cephalosporin disk test (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and the etest (ab biodisk) and/or the agar dilution method of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (villanova, pa, usa), respectively. beta-lactamase-positive prevotella melaninogenica strains were isolated from all  children, and more than two-thirds of the prevotella denticola and prevotella loescheii strains isolated from the children were beta-lactamase-positive. the beta-lactamase-producing prevotella intermedia group consisted of prevotella nigrescens and the p. intermedia/ p. nigrescens-like organism (pinlo); p. intermedia was not found. only two p. nigrescens isolates but most of the pinlo isolates produced beta-lactamase. the mics for beta-lactamase-producing strains varied between 0.38 and 64 micrograms/ml. beta-lactamase production by oral pigmented prevotella species colonizing young children is already frequent. the phenomenon should be taken into account in the treatment of pediatric anaerobic infections of oral origin.

TI  == pathogenicity of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens isolates in a wound chamber model in rabbits.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 14 isolates identified as prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens by serogrouping using monoclonal antibodies was compared in a tissue cage model in rabbits. seven strains from periodontal abscesses, 5 strains from deep periodontal pockets and 2 strains from gingivitis were tested in the animal model comprising 6 teflon tissue cages implanted on the back each of 34 rabbits. a total of 10(5)-10(8) cells of p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains were inoculated alone or together with either actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or streptococcus mitis. five strains of porphyromonas gingivalis were used as a reference. the infectivity was recorded as pus formation and log viable count in aspirated material for 3, 7 and 14 days. none of the prevotella strains inoculated in monoculture survived more than 3 days, and they had no capacity to produce abscess. p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains in combination with a. actinomycetemcomitans produced abscesses in 33-100% and with s. mitis in 42-100%. no difference in abscess formation or log viable count in samples after 14 days was recorded between serogroup i (p. intermedia) and serogroup ii and iii (p. nigrescens). the infectivity of p. intermedia or p. nigresceas strains did not differ whether they were isolated from periodontal abscess, periodontal pocket or gingivitis. p. intermedia and p.  nigrescens strains produced abscesses in combination with a facultative anaerobic strain and appears to have a similar pathogenicity in the wound chamber model in  rabbits.

TI  == intra-familial transmission and distribution of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the periodontal bacteria prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens have been recently separated from each other. the purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution and routes of transmission of these bacteria among family members. seven patients with moderate to severe periodontitis were selected. these probands, their spouses and 14 of their children were investigated. the presence of pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens was determined by culture techniques in pooled subgingival plaque samples, in the saliva, on the tongue, tonsils and buccal mucosa. differentiation of pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens was performed by enzyme electrophoretic mobility. from all 7 patients, as well as 4 spouses and 3 of the children, pr. intermedia could be isolated. pr. nigrescens was found in 2 of the 7 patients, in 5 of the spouses and in 5 of the  6 children aged 5-10 yr. in the 8 children aged 0-4 yr both species were seldom isolated. these data are in accordance with earlier findings that pr. intermedia  is associated with periodontitis and pr. nigrescens with a relatively healthy periodontal condition. ribotyping of bacteria was performed by hybridization of hindiii restriction endonuclease digests of chromosomal dna with ribosomal dna. isolates from unrelated individuals always had distinct ribotypes. indistinguishable ribotypes of pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens were found both  among married couples and among parents and children. this indicates that intrafamilial transmission of pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens is possible both  between adults and between parents and children.

TI  == protein degradation by prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri supports the  growth of non-protein-cleaving oral bacteria in serum.
AB  == the proteolytic activities of oral bacteria are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of dental abscesses. bacteria-derived proteases may contribute to tissue destruction, and are likely to impair host defence by degrading immunoglobulins and complement. degraded periodontal tissue and tissue fluid are  likely to constitute essential sources of nutrients in the abscess. tissue fluid, which is derived from serum, is rich in protein and poor in carbohydrate, suggesting that breakdown of protein and fermentation of amino acids is a crucial step to generate energy for growth of the microflora. the number of oral bacterial species that perform hydrolytic cleavage of protein into polypeptides,  the first step in protein degradation, is relatively small compared to the large  majority of peptidase-producing species. in this study, we therefore investigated the growth-promoting effect of proteinase-producing species like prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri on the growth of some non-proteinase producing  bacteria in mixed cultures. we used serum as a substitute for the supposed natural substrate of the abscess microflora. the breakdown of serum proteins was  investigated using capillary electrophoresis. poor growth was found in mono- and  mixed cultures of non-proteinase producing species eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum. peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius. the presence of p. intermedia in mixed cultures strongly enhanced growth of these 4 species, according to the hypothesis that the growth of the mixed cultures was peptide-limited. the enhanced growth of p. intermedia in pronase-digested serum indicated peptide-limited growth of this organism in serum, despite its production of proteinase. we found that growth of monocultures of actinomyces meyeri was poor. in contrast, a. meyeri grew well in mixed cultures and its presence stimulated growth of f. nucleatum and p. micros, suggesting a synergistic relationship. the growth of mono- and mixed cultures was investigated using one representative strain of each species. thus, there is a small risk of having selected unique strains. proteinase inhibitors reduced the growth of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, and p. intermedia in trypticase peptone-yeast extract medium with, and without, igg. our study indicated that proteinase-producing organisms play a key role in mixed cultures of oral bacteria in human serum by providing polypeptides for growth. this may explain their association with dental abscesses.

TI  == optimized oligonucleotides for the differentiation of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the gram-negative, anaerobic bacterium prevotella intermedia plays an important role in the progression of periodontitis, whereas the etiological role of the closely related but phenotypically indistinguishable species prevotella nigrescens is controversial. to differentiate between these species properly, 16s rdna/rna directed, computer-optimized oligonucleotides were designed and tested with 26 p. intermedia, 26 p. nigrescens and a number of closely and more distantly related strains. the oligonucleotides were used as primers in a polymerase chain reaction and could be demonstrated to be species specific with a detection limit of 50 bacterial cells, which could also be detected when diluted  1:10(5) with different plaque bacteria. in addition, the described oligonucleotides were digoxigenin-labeled at the 3' end and used as dna probes in a dot blot hybridization assay. this assay, although slightly less sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction-based method, gave species-specific reactions and also allowed (semi-)quantification of bacterial cells in clinical specimens.

TI  == the clinical, microbial, and host response characteristics of the failing implant.
AB  == the goal of this study was to provide new data regarding levels of inflammatory and growth factor mediators and bacterial pathogens associated with failing implants, as compared to healthy implants. twenty-one patients with failing implant sites (group 1) and 8 patients with only healthy implants (group 2) were  included. fifteen of the 21 failing implant patients (group 1) also presented with at least one stable nondiseased implant. plaque samples were examined, using dna oligonucleotide probes for 40 different microbes. gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected for the analyses of catabolic bone resorbing agonists prostaglandin e2 (pge2), interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta) and il-6 and anabolic bone-forming growth factors transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta) and platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf). although positive trends were noted, there were no significant differences in any of the microbial, inflammatory, or growth  factors mediators comparing failing to stable implants in group 1. this study found greater detection frequencies of p. nigrescens, p. micros, f. nucleatum ss  vincentii, and f. nucleatum ss nucleatum, as well as significant elevations in gcf levels of pge2, il-1 beta, and pdgf in mouths with failing implant sites as compared to mouths with healthy control implants. risk appears to be primarily at a patient level and secondarily at a site or implant level from a clinical, microbial (p. micros and p. nigrescens), and biochemical (pge2 and il-1 beta) perspective. furthermore, the counts of p. nigrescens and p. micros were found to correlate with concentrations of pge2 at a site level.

TI  == similarity of salivary and subgingival prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens isolates by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the distribution and the genetic similarity of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in saliva and in subgingival samples recovered from the same subject were studied in 16 subjects with different periodontal status. the isolates (4 salivary and 4 subgingival p. intermedia/nigrescens group isolates per subject) were identified to species level by hybridization with species-specific oligonucleotide probes, and the clonal analysis was performed using arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (ap-pcr) (all isolates) and ribotyping (isolates from 5 subjects). in addition, the applicability of ap-pcr in differentiating between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens species was tested using 18 p. intermedia and 20 p. nigrescens isolates from 34 subjects. p. intermedia was detected in 7 and p. nigrescens in 14 of the 16 subjects. in all subjects the same species was found both in saliva and in subgingival plaque. in  15 of the 16 subjects, similar ap-pcr types of p. intermedia and/or p. nigrescens between salivary and subgingival samples were found. the salivary and subgingival isolates that were similar by ap-pcr were indistinguishable also by ribotyping. the ap-pcr analysis revealed a p. intermedia or p. nigrescens species-specific ap-pcr product in most isolates. this study indicates that both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens were found both in salivary and in subgingival samples, and both sampling sites within the same individual were usually colonized with identical ap-pcr types of the species. thus, in addition to a subgingival sample a salivary sample seems to be suitable for detection and clonal analysis of these species. the ap-pcr method proved to be a simple method applicable for differentiation and clonal analysis of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens.

TI  == hydrolytic and depolymerising enzyme activity of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == objective: prevotella intermedia has been reported to be associated with periodontal disease whilst p. nigrescens has predominantly been isolated from more specific conditions and healthy sites. the aim of the present study was to compare the enzyme activity of these species. materials and methods: nine strains of p. intermedia and 12 strains of p. nigrescens were studied. lipolytic, saccharolytic, nucleolytic and proteolytic activity was determined by traditional microbiological and chromogenic substrate methods. results: all strains hydrolysed gelatine, casein, dna and rna. lipase activity was produced by all strains except p. nigrescens atcc 33563t. lipolytic activity of p. nigrescens strains decreased as the environmental glucose concentration was increased. only  two strains, both p. intermedia, hydrolysed benzyl-arg-rho-nitroanilide. all strains hydrolysed alkaline rho-nitrophenolphosphate (except p. intermedia dal100), produced glycylprolyl dipeptidase activity and demonstrated elastase-like activity. all but three strains (2 p. intermedia and i p. nigrescens) hydrolysed suc-ala-ala-pro-phe-rho-nitroanilide. overall, no qualitatively analysed enzyme activity was exclusive to all strains of either species. quantitatively analysed activity exhibited a high degree of variability  both within and between species. conclusions: p. intermedia and p. nigrescens degrade natural and synthetic substrates, but intra- and interspecies activity is variable.

TI  == degradation of lactoferrin by periodontitis-associated bacteria.
AB  == the degradation of human lactoferrin by putative periodontopathogenic bacteria was examined. fragments of lactoferrin were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measured by densitometry. the degradation of lactoferrin was more extensive by porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga sputigena, slow by capnocytophaga ochracea, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia, and very slow or absent by prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and peptostreptococcus micros. all strains of p. gingivalis tested degraded lactoferrin. the degradation was sensitive to protease inhibitors, cystatin c and albumin. the degradation by c. sputigena was not affected by the protease inhibitors and the detected lactoferrin fragments exhibited electrophoretic mobilities similar to those ascribed to deglycosylated forms of lactoferrin. furthermore a weak or absent reactivity of these fragments with sialic acid-specific lectin suggested that they are desialylated. the present data indicate that certain bacteria colonizing the periodontal pocket can degrade lactoferrin. the presence of other human proteins as specific inhibitors and/or as substrate competitors may counteract this degradation process.

TI  == tetracycline resistance in prevotella isolates from periodontally diseased patients is due to the tet(q) gene.
AB  == tetracycline-resistance in gram-negative periodontal bacteria is often due to the presence of the tet(q) gene. in the present study the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to examine 54 isolates of gram-negative anaerobic rods (prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and related or bacteroides-like species) for the presence of the tet(q) gene. the isolates were recovered from 42 patients with periodontal disease living in northern europe and north america. an 814 base-pair segment of the tet(q) gene was amplified from all 41 isolates resistant to tetracycline with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 4 micrograms/ml and above. the presence of the tet(q) gene was verified using hybridization with a specific oligonucleotide internal to the amplified region and restriction endonuclease digestion with ddei. a pcr product of the same size was also amplified from one tetracycline susceptible isolate (minimal inhibitory concentration = 0.5 microgram/ml). however, this isolate and the one isolate that was resistant to tetracycline at 4 micrograms/ml showed a weaker signal than the  remaining isolates when hybridized with the internal probe. typing of the pcr products using restriction endonuclease digests with alui and hpaii revealed two  clusters of distinct electrophoresis patterns, indicating that two different subtypes of the tet(q) gene were present in this material. a control strain containing the tet(q) gene from bacteroides thetaiotaomicron had a different electrophoresis pattern for alui. this study indicated that subtypes of the tet(q) gene in tetracycline-resistant gram-negative periodontal bacteria exist both within the same patient and within the same species.

TI  == clonality of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens isolated from periodontally diseased and healthy sites.
AB  == black-pigmented anaerobes have been implicated as major pathogens in the aetiology of adult periodontitis but these organisms are also found in healthy sites. this study aimed to examine the relationship between genotypes of black-pigmented anaerobes and disease status of periodontal sites using restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) and ribotyping. the main black-pigmented  species recovered from sites were porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. each of the 58 subjects investigated harboured distinct genotypes of these three species. most subjects appeared to be colonized by a single genotype of p. gingivalis and pr. intermedia, whereas multiple types  of pr. nigrescens colonized many individuals. plasmids were only found in a few pr. nigrescens strains. no association was found between the disease status of sites and any specific or group of genotypes of either species or presence of a plasmid. since the same genotypes of p. gingivalis, pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens were found at both diseased and non-diseased sites in a subject, adult periodontitis is not explained by the presence of specially virulent clones of these organisms. their role in periodontitis, therefore, is likely to be opportunistic.

AB  == restriction endonuclease analysis, rrna gene restriction analysis (ribotyping), multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and lipase production were investigated for their potential to differentiate isolates belonging to the closely-related species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. of 122 strains identified originally as p. intermedia, 52 were assigned to p. intermedia and 68  to p. nigrescens using multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. all 39 p. intermedia and 52 out of 53 p. nigrescens tested produced lipase. restriction endonuclease analysis identified clonal variants, but did not facilitate the differentiation of strains into species. taq i ribotyping of 99 strains revealed that all p. intermedia demonstrated a species-specific fragment of 0.40 kbp, which was always associated with a second fragment of 0.57 kbp, and all p. nigrescens tested shared a species-specific fragment of 2.21 kbp. two strains atypical by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis had none of the above species-specific fragments. thus, lipase production and restriction endonuclease analysis did not  distinguish between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens, but taq i ribotyping did and also allowed the characterization of individual strains.

TI  == source of suspected periodontal pathogens re-emerging after periodontal treatment.
AB  == to clarify the source of re-emerging periodontal pathogens after treatment, we compared the ribotypes of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens group and campylobacter rectus before and after treatment in 7 periodontitis patients and in 6 of the spouses. the patients harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens group or c. rectus in their subgingival or salivary samples before treatment. the respective bacterial species were not detected 1 month after treatment, but reappeared by 6 months later. when available, 4 random colonies of each of the 4 species were isolated from both subgingival and salivary samples at each sampling occasion, the isolates were subcultured, identified and typed applying pheno- and genotypic intraspecies characterization  methods. altogether 90 strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens group and c. rectus were available from 2, 3, 2 and 4 patients, respectively. the pre- and post-treatment ribotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans-, p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia/p. nigrescens group-isolates were identical in all respective patients. the pre- and post-treatment ribotypes of c. rectus were identical in 1 of 4 patients, whereas  2 patients harbored a previously not detected post-treatment ribotype and 1 patient harbored the initial and a previously not detected post-treatment ribotype. to study the possibility that periodontitis patients may acquire strains from the spouse after treatment, isolates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens group and c. rectus (n = 95) from the patients' spouses were ribotyped and compared with those of the patients. the patient exhibited his own post-treatment ribotypes, different from those of the spouse, of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis in 1 couple and of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens group and c. rectus in 1 couple. in the 2 patients who harbored a previously not detected post-treatment ribotype of c. rectus, one patient shared the new ribotype with the spouse, whereas the other one did not. although an exogenous source cannot be fully ruled out, the patient's own oral flora seems to be the main source of re-emerging periodontal pathogens after treatment.

TI  == binding and degradation of lactoferrin by porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the ability of laboratory and clinical strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens to bind and to degrade lactoferrin (lf) has been assessed. lf bound readily to whole cells of each species apparently via high-affinity site and one or more low-affinity sites. p.  gingivalis showed a lower affinity for lf than the other two species (p < 0.001). virtually all strains of p. gingivalis completely degraded lf under the conditions employed, whereas p. intermedia and p. nigrescens showed only partial  degradation. these data suggest that lf binds to a high-affinity receptor on all  these bacteria and, particularly in the case of p. gingivalis, is then degraded by cell-associated proteases. this property may provide protection to the cell against the effects of lf in periodontal sites and so is a possible virulence factor in disease. there was no association between the ability to degrade lf and whether the strains had originated from healthy or diseased oral sites.

AB  == the analytical performance of a membrane-based immunoassay for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia (including prevotella nigrescens) was investigated. positive reactions were observed for 71 of 71 reference strains and recent oral isolates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia. no cross-reactivity was observed with 39 other common oral and environmental species. the specificity of the test was unaffected by the presence of potential oral interferents including whole blood, white blood cells, mucin, saliva, toothpastes, and oral rinses. a proficiency test by dental  professionals using a standardized set of unknown simulated samples yielded a sensitivity of 97% (116/120) and a 100% specificity (240/ 240). an additional group including dental professionals and high school students was shown to be 99% proficient (1385/1397) in distinguishing proper from improper test function when  processing control samples with normal test devices and devices with simulated error conditions. comparisons to a culture standard for 104 subgingival plaque samples collected from 26 adult periodontitis patients yielded > 98% specificity  for each of the test bacteria. in addition, the detection threshold for the test  was determined to be equivalent to 10(4) cultivable test bacteria when compared to the culture standard. the data indicate that this membrane immunoassay is a valid and easy-to-use method for the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia in subgingival plaque, at levels above the detection threshold of the test.

TI  == prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens serotypes, ribotypes and binding  characteristics.
AB  == type strains and 62 clinical isolates of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens were typed with the use of genomic dna fingerprints and rrna gene probes. the strains were further serotyped with monoclonal antibodies and characterized with sds-page, enzymatic activities, hemolysis and hemagglutination and coaggregation with streptococcus and actinomyces spp. p. intermedia and p. nigrescens were found to have distinct ribotype patterns which correspond to previously defined serotyupes i and ii/iii, respectively. no clear phenotypic difference related to hemolysis, hemagglutination and coaggregation with streptococcus and actinomyces species, or expression of aminopeptides and lipase  was found between p. intermedia and p. migrescens.

TI  == proteolytic artifacts in sds-page analysis of selected periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the aim of the study was to examine whether proteolytic artifacts, which result in a loss and poor resolution of protein bands, occur during sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of cellular proteins from selected proteolytic (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola) and non-proteolytic (fusobacterium nucleatum) bacteria. conditions to limit or prevent proteolysis were also investigated. bacterial cells were incubated in solubilizing buffer (sds+ beta mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for various periods of time before boiling. a control assay consisted of trichloroacetic acid-treated bacterial cells. cellular proteins were separated by electrophoresis and stained with coomassie blue. proteolysis occurred very rapidly in the case of p. gingivalis (< 30 s), whereas a longer incubation time (> 1 h) was required to observe similar effects in p. nigrescens and t. denticola. no proteolysis was observed for f. nucleatum. in all cases, heat (100  degrees c) and low ph (< 4) treatments of bacterial cells could avoid production  of proteolytic artifacts. incorporation of specific protease inhibitors before solubilization of bacteria could also prevent proteolysis. more particularly, n-alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (tlck), iodoacetamide and diisopropylfluorophosphate (50 mm) were highly efficient for p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens and t. denticola, respectively. when outer membranes of p. gingivalis  were prepared in the presence of tlck, numerous additional protein brands, not seen in the absence of tlck, were detected. the present study suggests that specific protease inhibitors, effective in preventing proteolysis, should be identified and added during cell fractionation and protein purification procedures.

TI  == distribution and genetic analysis of oral prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == a total of 344 prevotella intermedia and nigrescens group isolates from 59 subjects were identified by hybridization with nonradioactively labeled species-specific oligonucleotide probes. identification of 20 p. intermedia and 46 p. nigrescens isolates was confirmed by analyzing the electrophoretic mobilities of malate and glutamate dehydrogenase enzymes. a total of 111 isolates (32%) were identified as p. intermedia and 233 isolates (68%) as p. nigrescens. identification performed with oligonucleotide probes and with malate and glutamate dehydrogenase electrophoresis matched perfectly. the distribution of oral p. intermedia and p. nigrescens in various periodontal status groups was investigated in periodontally healthy or diseased individuals. to reveal intra- and interindividual genetic diversity and possible intrafamilial transmission, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens isolates from 16 to 59 subjects, representing 8 married couples, were ribotyped. the stability of colonization was examined in 12 of the 59 subjects, of whom 6 received periodontal treatment and 6 were untreated. all children and periodontally healthy adults and most subjects with initial periodontitis (13/21) harbored only p. nigrescens. of the 20 subjects with advanced periodontitis, 7 harbored both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens, 7 only p. intermedia and 6 only p. nigrescens. one or two ribotypes of p. intermedia and/or p. nigrescens were found intraindividually. the spouses in 5 of the 8 married couples shared an identical ribotype of p. intermedia or p. nigrescens, whereas ribotypes from unrelated subjects were mostly unique. colonization was stable, since the same ribotypes were found 1-6 months apart in  both periodontally treated and untreated subjects. in conclusion, the study indicates that p. intermedia and p. nigrescens may occur simultaneously in the oral cavity, the colonization is stable and p. intermedia is associated with periodontal diseases. ribotyping revealed considerable genetic heterogeneity in unrelated subjects, whereas isolates obtained from spouses could represent the same ribotype, which suggests transmission of these species.

TI  == degradation of host protease inhibitors and activation of plasminogen by proteolytic enzymes from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. in the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. the activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin iii, antiplasmin and cystatin c) was evaluated by sds-page. the 80 kda trypsin-like protease of p. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kda chymotrypsin-like protease of  t. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin c. when whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and capnocytophaga spp. peptostreptococcus micros and propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and fusobacterium nucleatum, had no  effect on the protease inhibitors. the 80 kda protease of p. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kda protease of t. denticola. this study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. this may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.

TI  == an investigation into the use of sds-page of cell surface extracts and proteolytic activity to differentiate prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia.
AB  == by comparison of the cell surface proteins derived from the outer membrane and fibrils from 14 prevotella intermedia and 19 prevotella nigrescens strains using  sds and analysed by sds-page, it was possible to distinguish the two species. a polypeptide of approx. 21 kda distinguished p. intermedia strains, whereas two polypeptides of approx. 18 and 22 kda could be used to identify p. nigrescens strains. four other human oral black pigmented bacterial species (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella denticola, prevotella loescheii and prevotella melaninogenica) did not have the 18-, 21- or 22-kda polypeptides shown by p. intermedia or p. nigrescens. the cell-associated proteolytic activity of eight strains of p. intermedia, 14 strains of p. nigrescens and one strain of p. gingivalis (w50) was assessed using four chromogenic substrates. the hydrolysis of the substrate gppna (indicative of dipeptidyl peptidase iv-like activity) and  saappna (elastase-like activity) by p. intermedia strains varied from 32 to 114 units and 0.5 to 12.6 units of activity respectively, where one unit was defined  as the amount of protease enzyme catalysing the formation of 1 nmol of p-nitroaniline under experimental conditions. 37.5% (3 of 8) of p. intermedia strains hydrolysed saappna (chymotrypsin-like enzyme activity) with activities of between 7 and 12 units. the hydrolysis of gppna and saaapna by p. nigrescens strains was 32-149 and 3-16 units, respectively. 57% (8 of 14) of p. nigrescens strains hydrolysed saapppna with activities ranging from 3 to 8 units. none of the p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains examined were found to have trypsin-like enzyme activity (bapna hydrolysis). the gppna and saaapna hydrolytic activity associated with the proteases from porphyromonas gingivalis w50 was at least twice that of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens strains. the similar peptidase activities of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens against chromogenic substrates cannot be used to differentiate the species, but sds-page of cell surface protein extracts allowed unambiguous speciation between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. this simple technique of cell surface protein analysis can be performed in most laboratories and offers a convenient way by which to differentiate the two species.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide increases cell surface-associated fibronectin in fibroblasts in vitro.
AB  == this study assessed the fibronectin expression by fibroblasts derived from noninflamed and inflamed gingiva by measuring the amount of cell surface-associated fibronectin and fibronectin released into the medium. the effects of added lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens and escherichia coli on both types of fibroblasts were also studied. in the absence of lipopolysaccharide, the amounts of the two types of fibronectin were significantly larger in the fibroblasts from inflamed than from noninflamed  gingiva. the specific lipopolysaccharide had no effect on the amount of fibronectin released into the medium by either fibroblast type. the amount of cell surface-associated fibronectin increased significantly when lipopolysaccharide (0.1 and 1 microgram/ml) was added to the cells from the noninflamed gingiva (the effect was evident in the order: p. gingivalis>p.nigrescens>e. coli). lipopolysaccharide from p. gingivalis significantly increased the cell surface-associated fibronectin even at a low concentration of lipopolysaccharide (0.01 microgram/ml). in fibroblasts from the  inflamed gingiva, only the lipopolysaccharide from p. gingivalis was effective in increasing the amount of cell surface-associated fibronectin. our findings showed that the fibronectin expression was increased in the fibroblasts from inflamed gingiva and that lipopolysaccharide from p. gingivalis increased the cell surface-associated fibronectin.

TI  == rapid differentiation of prevotella intermedia and p. nigrescens by 16s rdna pcr-rflp.
AB  == prevotella intermedia and the newly described p. nigrescens cannot be reliably distinguished by phenotypic tests. in this study, restriction endonuclease digestion of amplified 16s rdna (16s rdna pcr-rflp) was used to generate restriction profiles of the type strains of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens and 43 fresh isolates identified as belonging to one of the two species. whole-cell protein profiles were obtained by sds-page for comparative purposes. the type strains of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens were easily distinguished by 16s rdna  pcr-rflp and the fresh isolates were assigned to either species on the basis of their restriction profiles. the identifications obtained were identical to those  obtained by protein profiles. 16s rdna pcr-rflp is a rapid and reliable method for the differentiation of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens.

TI  == confirmation of the species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the elevation of the two genotypes of prevotella intermedia to species rank as p. intermedia and prevotella nigrescens has increased the need for reliable differentiation between the two taxa. in this study, 53 strains, including strains whose species affiliations were known as well as fresh dental plaque isolates, were subjected to a multilocus enzyme electrophoretic analysis, dna analyses in which we used whole genomic dna, rrna sequences, and an oligonucleotide specific for the former p. intermedia genotype ii (p. nigrescens) as probes, and a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of soluble cellular proteins. all of these tests consistently separated  the strains into the same two distinct groups corresponding to p. intermedia and  p. nigrescens, confirming that the two species constitute two distinct populations of bacteria. each of the tests used independently provided reliable identification to the species level. a previously reported heterogeneity in the pattern of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) degradation was not confirmed. no differences between species were observed. all of the strains induced total degradation of iga1 within 48 h, a property that may be a virulence factor in periodontal disease development. the enzymes responsible for iga1 degradation were not inactivated by the physiological proteinase inhibitors alpha 2-macroglobulin and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor.

TI  == characterisation of black-pigmented anaerobes isolated from diseased and healthy  periodontal sites.
AB  == prevotella intermedia has recently been re-defined and a new species, prevotella  nigrescens has been proposed. however, there is little data available on the incidence of these new species in periodontal health or disease. black-pigmented  anaerobes isolated from diseased and healthy subgingival sites were identified by serotyping, sds-page and physiological tests. in adult periodontitis subjects, 64% of active sites, 35.7% of inactive sites and 38.5% of healthy sites yielded black-pigmented anaerobes. of these, porphyromonas gingivalis was found in 11% of active and 5% of healthy sites in diseased patients, prevotella intermedia in 15.5% of active and 20.5% of healthy sites, prevotella nigrescens in 37.7% of active and 11.5% of healthy sites and prevotella denticola in 3% of active and 1% of healthy sites. in healthy subjects, 50% of sites yielded black-pigmented anaerobes. p. gingivalis was not found in healthy subjects but p. intermedia was  found in 18% and p. nigrescens in 31% of sites. sds-page proved to be a useful method for routinely differentiating p. intermedia and p. nigrescens and two sub-types of the latter species were detected on the basis of band pattern. only  one p. nigrescens sub-type was found in any given individual and one type, typified by atcc 25261, was more commonly found in deep pockets. however, overall both p. nigrescens and p. intermedia as species were just as frequently found at  healthy sites as diseased sites. thus, these species, in contrast to p. gingivalis, appear to be common commensals but they may act as opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == characterization of immunoglobulin g-degrading proteases of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == degradation of immunoglobulins is thought to be an important factor in the causation of periodontal diseases by hindering local host defenses and by providing nutrients to the periodontal microflora. in this study, we characterized the proteolytic activity against human immunoglobulin g (igg) of 20 strains of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens isolated from periodontal pockets and oral abscesses. igg degradation was studied by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. all strains degraded igg within 48 h after growth in trypticase-yeast extract medium (ty) supplemented with 0.3% igg. incorporating igg in ty broth enhanced bacterial growth. protease  profiles (zymography), which revealed the presence of 1-4 igg-degrading proteolytic bands in bacterial cell extracts, became more complex after growth in the presence of igg. a 38-kda protease capable of degrading igg nonspecifically was present in almost all strains. the proteolytic activity was mainly located on the surface of the cell envelope. two strains of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens  atcc 33563 were selected for further studies. bacterial cell suspensions in phosphate-buffered saline completely degraded human igg, iga and igm within 24 h. this activity depended on reducing conditions and was inhibited at temperatures above 50 degrees c. the ph optimum of immunoglobulin degradation was at ph 7. strains cultured at 42 degrees c showed a markedly reduced capacity to degrade igg. inhibition studies revealed that breakdown of igg was caused by a cysteine protease(s). the capacity of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens to degrade immunoglobulins may explain their association with polymicrobial oral diseases.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes to the 16s ribosomal rna: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to dna-dna hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated i bi-2 to  i bi-6 (for p. intermedia) and 2bi-2 (for p. nigrescens) with the 16s rrna suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. a 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated bi) reliably detected both species. because of the high degree of concordance between the 16s rrnas of  both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. thus probe i bi-i recognised p. intermedia while i bi-i detected both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens at low stringency. however, under conditions of high stringency only p. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2bi-i. these probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with dna from the  closely related p. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as prevotella melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. loescheii, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, py. endodontalis, py. gingivalis, py. levii, and py. macacae.

TI  == effects of cytokines and periodontopathic bacteria on the leukocyte function-associated antigen 1/intercellular adhesion molecule 1 pathway in gingival fibroblasts in adult periodontitis.
AB  == we investigated the effects of inflammatory cytokines and periodontopathic bacteria on expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and e-selectin (endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1) in cultured human gingival fibroblasts (hgf). cell surface icam-1 was upregulated on hgf under transcriptional control by exposure not only to interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and gamma interferon but also to sonic extracts prepared from porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia (nigrescens) and lipopolysaccharides from escherichia coli. however, these stimuli induced only minimal expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and  e-selectin on hgf. binding assays using hgf and molt 4, the human t-cell leukemia cell line, showed induced icam-1 to be functional, and the increased binding was  blocked by a combination of monoclonal antibodies against icam-1 and leukocyte function-associated antigen 1. furthermore, gingival tissues from adult periodontitis patients showed increased mrna expression of icam-1 compared with that in tissues from normal healthy donors. in immunohistological analysis, we also observed in vivo that the expression of icam-1 on fibroblasts in adult periodontitis tissues was greater than that in normal gingiva. thus, the overexpression of icam-1 on gingival fibroblasts induced by cytokines and periodontopathic bacteria is speculated to be deeply involved in the accumulation and retention of leukocyte function-associated antigen 1-bearing leukocytes in adult periodontitis lesions.

TI  == interdental supragingival plaque--a natural habitat of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that suspected periodontal pathogens form a minor component of the supragingival plaque of individuals without periodontal diseases. twenty-one dental hygienist trainees with a mean age of 23.5 years were twice sampled for interdental plaque between 1st and 2nd molars in all quadrants. the samples were assessed for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and the prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens group of organisms. bacteria of this group were predominantly p. nigrescens and showed both the highest prevalence (100%) and the highest colonization density of the investigated species. seven of 21 samples harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans. serotypes a, b, and c were found in three samples each, while serotype e was present in one sample. three subjects had two different a. actinomycetemcomitans  serotypes. bacteroides forsythus and c. rectus were detected in 10 (48%) and nine (43%) subjects, respectively. the detected cell numbers accounted for approximately 0.01% to 1% of the sampled flora. in contrast, p. gingivalis was found only in a single sample, which in addition harbored b. forsythus, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes b and e), and p. intermedia. these results suggest that the investigated periodontal bacteria are not "exogenous pathogens", but amphibiotic, opportunistic microorganisms which may have a natural habitat in the supragingival plaque of the interproximal area of molars.

AB  == twenty-two tetracycline-resistant (tetr) anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria isolated from periodontal pockets of 12 patients with refractory periodontitis were examined for the presence of the tet q determinant by dna-dna  hybridization. dot blots of bacterial dna were tested with an intragenic digoxigenin-labelled tet(q) probe consisting of a 1.45 kb ecori/pvuii fragment from plasmid pnfd13-2. southern blots of chromosomal dna digested with the restriction enzyme ecori were also examined. the tet(q) probe hybridized with dna from 8 of the 22 tetr strains, including 2 prevotella intermedia strains and one  strain each of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella loescheii, prevotella veroralis  and prevotella melaninogenica. the tetr strains of mitsuokella dentalis and capnocytophaga ochracea also hybridized with the probe. the lack of discernible plasmid dna in all the probe-positive isolates suggests that these tetracycline-resistance genes were chromosomally encoded. the probe hybridized with a different size fragment in all the isolates. this study extends the number of species that carry the tet(q) gene to include several outside the genera prevotella and bacteroides.

TI  == phylogeny of bacteroides, prevotella, and porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  == the phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (cfb) phylum was examined by 16s rrna sequence  comparative analysis. approximately 95% of the 16s rrna sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of prevotella, bacteroides, and porphyromonas and related species by a modified sanger sequencing method. a phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. the bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. the first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of prevotella, including p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and the ruminal species p. ruminicola. two oral species, p. zoogleoformans and p. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. these two species and six species of bacteroides, including the type species b. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. the third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. the first contained porphyromonas gingivalis, p. endodontalis, p. asaccharolytica, p. circumdentaria, p. salivosa,  [bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [bacteroides] forsythus and [bacteroides] distasonis. [bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. with few exceptions, the 16 s rrna data were in overall agreement with  previously proposed reclassifications of species of bacteroides, prevotella, and  porphyromonas. suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.

TI  == characterization of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens isolates from periodontic and endodontic infections.
AB  == the occurrence and surface properties of prevotella intermedia and p. nigrescens  in healthy sites and in periodontic and endodontic infections were studied among  73 strains, tentatively identified as p. intermedia. fifteen strains were from necrotic root canal infections, 41 were from periodontal samples, and 17 isolates were obtained from healthy gingival sites. identification of isolates as either p. intermedia or p. nigrescens was based on differences in malate and glutamate dehydrogenase electrophoretic mobilities which allowed unambiguous separation of  p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. the majority of strains from periodontal samples were p. intermedia (29 of 41 strains). in endodontic samples only 4 out of 15 isolates were p. intermedia, while all except 1 of 17 strains from healthy gingival sites were identified as p. nigrescens. sds-page of whole cell proteins  revealed 31 and 38 kda proteins in p. nigrescens which were not detected in p. intermedia. surface biotinylation of cells, followed by western blotting and detection by alkaline phosphatase conjugated extravidin, showed strong staining of the 31 kda protein in p. nigrescens indicating that this protein is located on the surface of the cell. corresponding staining was not seen in p. intermedia. fimbria-like projections were observed using electron microscopy of negatively-stained cells of p. nigrescens. the results show that p. intermedia and p. nigrescens may have different site specificities and surface properties and thus emphasize the need for accurate identification of these two species for  the evaluation of their role in the pathogenesis of oral infections.

AB  == a total of 31 strains of prevotella intermedia were subjected to dna-dna hybridization and were characterized by performing physiological tests and by performing a multilocus enzyme analysis, using malate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase. all of the strains assigned to p. intermedia fermented glucose and sucrose, hydrolyzed starch but not esculin, and produced indole, acetic, isobutyric, isovaleric, and succinic acids as metabolic end products. the results of dna reassociation experiments performed with the reference probe permitted separation of the strains into two well-defined homology groups. in addition, strains with dnas that hybridized with dna from strain atcc 25611t (t = type strain) had high levels of peptidase activity and cleaved lipid substrates (4-methylumbelliferyl laurate and 4-methylumbellifelyl elaidate). multilocus enzyme electrophoresis revealed two electromorphic profiles, one characteristic of strain atcc 25611t and the other characteristic of strain atcc 33563t. we propose that a new species, prevotella nigrescens, should be created for the genetically distinct group of strains that hybridized with strain atcc 33563t. strain atcc 33563 is designated the type strain of p. nigrescens.
