TI  == serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

TI  == microaerophilic streptococci as a significant pathogen: a twelve-year review.
AB  == one hundred twenty three microaerophilic streptococci (ms) were isolated from 4,603 specimens submitted for the identification of anaerobic bacteria over the course of 12 years. the ms included 16 streptococcus constellatus, 43 streptococcus intermedius and 21 gemella morbillorum. a total of 81 ms isolates (66%) identified from 75 patients were considered to cause infection. predisposing or underlying conditions were noted in 48 (64%) patients. the most common conditions were previous surgery (15 instances), trauma (10), diabetes (9), immunodeficiency (6), malignancy, and prosthetic device (5 each). ms were the only bacterial isolates in 23 instances. mixed infection was encountered in 52 (69%) patients, where the number of isolates varied between two and five (average 2.7). the organisms most commonly isolated with ms were anaerobic cocci, bacteroides sp. and enterobacteriaceae; their recovery varied at different sites. significant infections caused by ms were associated with abscess (29 instances),  sinuses (7), obstetrical and gynecological (obg), chest and wounds (6 each), abdominal (5), and biliary infection (4). antimicrobial therapy as administered to 71 patients; for 43 patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage or correction. surgical drainage alone was performed in three patients. four patients (5%) died. these data illustrate that ms can occasionally be associated  with serious infection.
