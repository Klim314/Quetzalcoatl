TI  - A novel arabinose-inducible genetic operation system developed for Clostridium cellulolyticum.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium cellulolyticum and other cellulolytic Clostridium strains are natural producers of lignocellulosic biofuels and chemicals via the consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) route, and systems metabolic engineering is indispensable to meet the cost-efficient demands of industry. Several genetic tools have been developed for Clostridium strains, and an efficient and stringent inducible genetic operation system is still required for the precise regulation of the target gene function. RESULTS: Here, we provide a stringent arabinose-inducible genetic operation (ARAi) system for C. cellulolyticum, including an effective gene expression platform with an oxygen-independent fluorescent reporter, a sensitive MazF-based counterselection genetic marker, and a precise gene knock-out method based on an inducible ClosTron system. A novel arabinose-inducible promoter derived from Clostridium acetobutylicum is employed in the ARAi system to control the expression of the target gene, and the gene expression can be up-regulated over 800-fold with highly induced stringency. The inducible ClosTron method of the ARAi system decreases the off-target frequency from 100% to 0, which shows the precise gene targeting in C. cellulolyticum. The inducible effect of the ARAi system is specific to a universal carbon source L-arabinose, implying that the system could be used widely for clostridial strains with various natural substrates. CONCLUSIONS: The inducible genetic operation system ARAi developed in this study, containing both controllable gene expression and disruption tools, has the highest inducing activity and stringency in Clostridium by far. Thus, the ARAi system will greatly support the efficient metabolic engineering of C. cellulolyticum and other mesophilic Clostridium strains for lignocellulose bioconversion.
TI  - Characterizing metabolic interactions in a clostridial co-culture for consolidated bioprocessing.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridial co-culture containing cellulolytic and solventogenic species is a potential consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) approach for producing biochemicals and biofuels from cellulosic biomass. It has been demonstrated that the rate of cellulose utilization in the co-culture of Clostridium acetobutylicum and Clostridium cellulolyticum is improved compared to the mono-culture of C. cellulolyticum (BL 5:119-124, 1983). However, the metabolic interactions in this co-culture are not well understood. To investigate the metabolic interactions in this co-culture we dynamically characterized the physiology and microbial composition using qPCR. RESULTS: The qPCR data suggested a higher growth rate of C. cellulolyticum in the co-culture compared to its mono-culture. Our results also showed that in contrast to the mono-culture of C. cellulolyticum, which did not show any cellulolytic activity under conditions similar to those of co-culture, the co-culture did show cellulolytic activity even superior to the C. cellulolyticum mono-culture at its optimal pH of 7.2. Moreover, experiments indicated that the co-culture cellulolytic activity depends on the concentration of C. acetobutylicum in the co-culture, as no cellulolytic activity was observed at low concentration of C. acetobutylicum, and thus confirming the essential role of C. acetobutylicum in improving C. cellulolyticum growth in the co-culture. Furthermore, butanol concentration of 350 mg/L was detected in the co-culture batch experiments. CONCLUSION: These results suggest the presence of synergism between these two species, while C. acetobutylicum metabolic activity significantly improves the cellulolytic activity in the co-culture, and allows C. cellulolyticum to survive under harsh co-culture conditions, which do not allow C. cellulolyticum to grow and metabolize cellulose independently. It is likely that C. acetobutylicum improves the cellulolytic activity of C. cellulolyticum in the co-culture through exchange of metabolites such as pyruvate, enabling it to grow and metabolize cellulose under harsh co-culture conditions.
TI  - Secretion and assembly of functional mini-cellulosomes from synthetic chromosomal operons in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) is reliant on the simultaneous enzyme production, saccharification of biomass, and fermentation of released sugars into valuable products such as butanol. Clostridial species that produce butanol are, however, unable to grow on crystalline cellulose. In contrast, those saccharolytic species that produce predominantly ethanol, such as Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium cellulolyticum, degrade crystalline cellulose with high efficiency due to their possession of a multienzyme complex termed the cellulosome. This has led to studies directed at endowing butanol-producing species with the genetic potential to produce a cellulosome, albeit by localising the necessary transgenes to unstable autonomous plasmids. Here we have explored the potential of our previously described Allele-Coupled Exchange (ACE) technology for creating strains of the butanol producing species Clostridium acetobutylicum in which the genes encoding the various cellulosome components are stably integrated into the genome. RESULTS: We used BioBrick2 (BB2) standardised parts to assemble a range of synthetic genes encoding C. thermocellum cellulosomal scaffoldin proteins (CipA variants) and glycoside hydrolases (GHs, Cel8A, Cel9B, Cel48S and Cel9K) as well as synthetic cellulosomal operons that direct the synthesis of Cel8A, Cel9B and a truncated form of CipA. All synthetic genes and operons were integrated into the C. acetobutylicum genome using the recently developed ACE technology. Heterologous protein expression levels and mini-cellulosome self-assembly were assayed by western blot and native PAGE analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the successful expression, secretion and self-assembly of cellulosomal subunits by the recombinant C. acetobutylicum strains, providing a platform for the construction of novel cellulosomes.
TI  - Scaffoldin modules serving as "cargo" domains to promote the secretion of heterologous cellulosomal cellulases by Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The secretion of large heterologous cellulases by Clostridium acetobutylicum was  formerly shown to be deleterious. To circumvent this issue, various scaffoldins' modules were grafted at their N termini. Family 3a cellulose binding module combined with an X2 module(s) was found to trigger the secretion of Clostridium cellulolyticum cellulases by the solventogenic bacterium.
TI  - The issue of secretion in heterologous expression of Clostridium cellulolyticum cellulase-encoding genes in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - The genes encoding the cellulases Cel5A, Cel8C, Cel9E, Cel48F, Cel9G, and Cel9M from Clostridium cellulolyticum were cloned in the C. acetobutylicum expression vector pSOS952 under the control of a Gram-positive constitutive promoter. The DNA encoding the native leader peptide of the heterologous cellulases was maintained. The transformation of the solventogenic bacterium with the corresponding vectors generated clones in the cases of Cel5A, Cel8C, and Cel9M. Analyses of the recombinant strains indicated that the three cellulases are secreted in an active form to the medium. A large fraction of the secreted cellulases, however, lost the C-terminal dockerin module. In contrast, with the plasmids pSOS952-cel9E, pSOS952-cel48F, and pSOS952-cel9G no colonies were obtained, suggesting that the expression of these genes has an inhibitory effect on growth. The deletion of the DNA encoding the leader peptide of Cel48F in pSOS952-cel48F, however, generated strains of C. acetobutylicum in which mature Cel48F accumulates in the cytoplasm. Thus, the growth inhibition observed when the wild-type cel48F gene is expressed seems related to the secretion of the cellulase. The weakening of the promoter, the coexpression of miniscaffoldin-encoding genes, or the replacement of the native signal sequence of Cel48F by that of secreted heterologous or endogenous proteins failed to generate strains secreting Cel48F. Taken together, our data suggest that a specific chaperone(s) involved in the secretion of the key family 48 cellulase, and probably Cel9G and Cel9E, is missing or insufficiently synthesized in C. acetobutylicum.
TI  - Small RNAs in the genus Clostridium.
AB  - The genus Clostridium includes major human pathogens and species important to cellulose degradation, the carbon cycle, and biotechnology. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are emerging as crucial regulatory molecules in all organisms, but they have not been investigated in clostridia. Research on sRNAs in clostridia is hindered by the absence of a systematic method to identify sRNA candidates, thus delegating clostridial sRNA research to a hit-and-miss process. Thus, we wanted to develop a method to identify potential sRNAs in the Clostridium genus to open up the field of sRNA research in clostridia. Using comparative genomics analyses combined with predictions of rho-independent terminators and promoters, we predicted sRNAs in 21 clostridial genomes: Clostridium acetobutylicum, C. beijerinckii, C. botulinum (eight strains), C. cellulolyticum, C. difficile, C. kluyveri (two strains), C. novyi, C. perfringens (three strains), C. phytofermentans, C. tetani, and C. thermocellum. Although more than one-third of predicted sRNAs have Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences, only one-sixth have a start codon downstream of SD sequences; thus, most of the predicted sRNAs are noncoding RNAs. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) and Northern analysis were employed to test the presence of a randomly chosen set of sRNAs in C. acetobutylicum and several C. botulinum strains, leading to the confirmation of a large fraction of the tested sRNAs. We identified a conserved, novel sRNA which, together with the downstream gene coding for an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene, responds to the antibiotic clindamycin. The number of predicted sRNAs correlated with the physiological function of the species (high for pathogens, low for cellulolytic, and intermediate for solventogenic), but not with 16S rRNA-based phylogeny.
TI  - Genome-scale metabolic modeling of a clostridial co-culture for consolidated bioprocessing.
AB  - An alternative consolidated bioprocessing approach is the use of a co-culture containing cellulolytic and solventogenic clostridia. It has been demonstrated that the rate of cellulose utilization in the co-culture of Clostridium acetobutylicum and Clostridium cellulolyticum is improved compared to the mono-culture of C. cellulolyticum, suggesting the presence of syntrophy between these two species. However, the metabolic interactions in the co-culture are not well understood. To understand the metabolic interactions in the co-culture, we developed a genome-scale metabolic model of C. cellulolyticum comprising of 431 genes, 621 reactions, and 603 metabolites. The C. cellulolyticum model can successfully predict the chemostat growth and byproduct secretion with cellulose as the substrate. However, a growth arrest phenomenon, which occurs in batch cultures of C. cellulolyticum at cellulose concentrations higher than 6.7 g/L, cannot be predicted by dynamic flux balance analysis due to the lack of understanding of the underlying mechanism. These genome-scale metabolic models of the pure cultures have also been integrated using a community modeling framework to develop a dynamic model of metabolic interactions in the co-culture. Co-culture simulations suggest that cellobiose inhibition cannot be the main factor that is responsible for improved cellulose utilization relative to mono-culture of C. cellulolyticum.
TI  - Characterization of the cellulolytic and hydrogen-producing activities of six mesophilic Clostridium species.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize cellulolytic, hydrogen-producing clostridia on a comparable basis. METHODS AND RESULTS: H(2) production from cellulose by six mesophilic clostridia was characterized in standardized batch experiments using MN301 cellulose, Avicel and cellobiose. Daily H(2) production, substrate degradation, biomass production and the end-point distribution of soluble fermentation products varied with species and substrates. All species produced a significant amount of H(2) from cellobiose, with Clostridium acetobutylicum achieving the highest H(2) yield of 2.3 mol H(2) mol(-1) hexose, but it did not degrade cellulose. Clostridium cellulolyticum and Clostridium populeti catalysed the highest H(2) production from cellulose, with yields of 1.7 and 1.6 mol H(2 )mol(-1) hexose from MN301 and 1.6 and 1.4 mol H(2) mol(-1) hexose from Avicel, respectively. These species also achieved 25-100% higher H(2) production rates from cellulose than the other species. CONCLUSIONS: These cellulolytic, hydrogen-producing clostridia varied in H(2) production, with Cl. cellulolyticum and Cl. populeti achieving the highest H(2) yields and cellulose degradation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The fermentation of cellulosic materials presents a means of H(2) production from renewable resources. This standardized comparison provides a quantitative baseline for improving H(2) production from cellulose through medium and process optimization and metabolic engineering.
TI  - Heterologous production, assembly, and secretion of a minicellulosome by Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - The gene man5K encoding the mannanase Man5K from Clostridium cellulolyticum was cloned alone or as an operon with the gene cipC1 encoding a truncated scaffoldin (miniCipC1) of the same origin in the solventogenic Clostridium acetobutylicum. The expression of the heterologous gene(s) was under the control of a weakened thiolase promoter Pthl. The recombinant strains of the solventogenic bacterium were both found to secrete active Man5K in the range of milligrams per liter. In the case of the strain expressing only man5K, a large fraction of the recombinant enzyme was truncated and lost the N-terminal dockerin domain, but it remained active towards galactomannan. When man5K was coexpressed with cipC1 in C. acetobutylicum, the recombinant strain secreted almost exclusively full-length mannanase, which bound to the scaffoldin miniCipC1, thus showing that complexation to the scaffoldin stabilized the enzyme. The secreted heterologous complex was found to be functional: it binds to crystalline cellulose via the carbohydrate binding module of the miniscaffoldin, and the complexed mannanase is active towards galactomannan. Taken together, these data show that C. acetobutylicum is a suitable host for the production, assembly, and secretion of heterologous minicellulosomes.
TI  - Production of heterologous and chimeric scaffoldins by Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 converts sugars and various polysaccharides into acids and solvents. This bacterium, however, is unable to utilize cellulosic substrates, since it is able to secrete very small amounts of cellulosomes. To promote the utilization of crystalline cellulose, the strategy we chose aims at producing heterologous minicellulosomes, containing two different cellulases bound to a miniscaffoldin, in C. acetobutylicum. A first step toward this goal describes the production of miniCipC1, a truncated form of CipC from Clostridium cellulolyticum, and the hybrid scaffoldin Scaf 3, which bears an additional cohesin domain derived from CipA from Clostridium thermocellum. Both proteins were correctly matured and secreted in the medium, and their various domains were found to be functional.
TI  - Characterization of the cellulolytic complex (cellulosome) of Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - A large cellulosomal gene cluster was identified in the recently sequenced genome of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Sequence analysis revealed that this cluster contains the genes for the scaffolding protein CipA, the processive endocellulase Cel48A, several endoglucanases of families 5 and 9, the mannanase Man5G, and a hydrophobic protein, OrfXp. Surprisingly, genetic organization of this large cluster is very similar to that of Clostridium cellulolyticum, the model of mesophilic clostridial cellulosomes. As C. acetobutylicum is unable to grow on cellulosic substrates, the existence of a cellulosomal gene cluster in the genome raises questions about its expression, function and evolution. Biochemical evidence for the expression of a cellulosomal protein complex was investigated. The results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, N-terminal sequencing and Western blotting with antibodies against specific components of the C. cellulolyticum cellulosome suggest that at least four major cellulosomal proteins are present. In addition, despite the fact that no cellulolytic activities were detected, we report here the evidence for the production of a high molecular mass cellulosomal complex in C. acetobutylicum.
TI  - Identification of the gene encoding NADH-rubredoxin oxidoreductase in Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - NADH-rubredoxin oxidoreductase (NROR), a flavoprotein from the obligately anaerobe Clostridium acetobutylicum is encoded by an ORF (nror) of 1140 nucleotides. Whereas primary structure analysis reveals that NROR has amino acid sequence patterns homologous with those involved in FAD and NAD-binding, the enzyme is distantly related to other flavoproteins in the databank. NROR is highly active for reducing clostridial rubredoxin (Rd) especially against C. acetobutylicum Rd with an efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of 400,000 mM(-1)s(-1). These results suggest that Rd from C. acetobutylicum, C. pasteurianum, C. butyricum, and C. cellulolyticum can be interchanged with each other. Since C. acetobutylicum is the sole Clostridium strain that possesses such an enzyme, possible functions are discussed with regard to Desulfovibrio gigas and Pyrococcus furiosus, the only two other anaerobic systems for which a similar activity was reported, but no gene isolated.
TI  - Spo0A directly controls the switch from acid to solvent production in solvent-forming clostridia.
AB  - The spo0A genes of Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 and Clostridium cellulolyticum ATCC 35319 were isolated and characterized. The C-terminal DNA-binding domains of the predicted products of spo0A from these two organisms, as well as 16 other taxonomically diverse species of Bacillus and Clostridium, show extensive amino acid sequence conservation (56% identity, 65% similarity over 104 residues). A 12-amino-acid motif (SRVERAIRHAIE) that forms the putative DNA recognition helix is particularly highly conserved, suggesting a common DNA target. Insertional inactivation of spo0A in C. beijerinckii blocked the formation of solvents (as well as spores and granulose). Sequences resembling Spo0A-binding motifs (TGNCGAA) are found in the promoter regions of several of the genes whose expression is modulated at the onset of solventogenesis in Clostridium acetobutylicum and C. beijerinckii. These include the upregulated adc gene, encoding acetoacetate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1. 4), and the downregulated ptb gene, encoding phosphotransbutyrylase (EC 2.3.1.c). In vitro gel retardation experiments using C. acetobutylicum adc and C. beijerinckii ptb promoter fragments and recombinant Bacillus subtilis and C. beijerinckii Spo0A suggested that adc and ptb are directly controlled by Spo0A. The binding affinity was reduced when the 0A boxes were destroyed, and enhanced when they were modified to conform precisely to the consensus sequence. In vivo analysis of wild-type and mutagenized promoters transcriptionally fused to the gusA reporter gene in C. beijerinckii validated this hypothesis. Post-exponential phase expression from the mutagenized adc promoter was substantially reduced, whereas expression from the mutagenized ptb promoter was not shut down at the end of exponential growth.
