TI  == influence of complement on neutrophil extracellular trap release induced by bacteria.
AB  == background and objectives: neutrophil extracellular trap (net) release has generally been studied in the absence of serum, or at low concentrations of untreated or heat-inactivated serum. the influence of serum complement on net release therefore remains unclear. we examined the dna release induced by staphylococcus aureus and three oral bacteria: actinomyces viscosus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincettii. material and methods: bacteria-stimulated net release from the neutrophils of healthy donors was measured fluorometrically. various complement containing and complement blocking conditions were used, including heat inactivation of the serum and antibody blockade of complement receptors 1 (cr1, cd35) and 3 (cr3, cd11b/cd18). results: while the presence of serum markedly enhanced net release induced by s. aureus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and to a lesser extent by a. viscosus, there was no enhancement of net release induced by  f. nucleatum. the serum-mediated enhancement of net release by a. actinomycetemcomitans was neutralized by heat inactivation of serum complement, while this was not the case for s. aureus. blockade of cr1, significantly reduced net release induced by s. aureus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and a. viscosus, while blockade of cr3, had no effect. however, opsonization of s. aureus with antibodies may also have contributed to the enhancing effect of serum, independently of complement, in that purified igg promoted net release. conclusions: in conclusion, complement opsonization promotes net release induced  by a variety of bacteria, including a. actinomycetemcomitans, and cr1 plays a dominant role in the process. complement consumption or deficiency may compromise netosis induced by some bacterial species, including a. actinomycetemcomitans. within biofilms, the complement-inactivating abilities of some bacteria may protect other species against netosis, while these are more vulnerable when adopting a planktonic lifestyle.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == bactericidal activity and mechanism of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  == the bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans) and gram-negative bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/ml polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to led light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mw/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity  followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. it was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial dna, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. the present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.

TI  == integration of non-oral bacteria into in vitro oral biofilms.
AB  == biofilms are polymicrobial communities that grow on surfaces in nature. oral bacteria can spontaneously form biofilms on the surface of teeth, which may compromise the health of the teeth, or their surrounding (periodontal) tissues. while the oral bacteria exhibit high tropism for their specialized ecological niche, it is not clear if bacteria that are not part of the normal oral microbiota can efficiently colonize and grow within oral biofilms. by using an in vitro "supragingival" biofilm model of 6 oral species, this study aimed to investigate if 3 individual bacterial species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota (eschericia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecails) and one not previously tested oral species (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) can be incorporated into this established supragingival biofilm model. staphylococcus aureus and a. actinomycetemcomitans were able to grow efficiently in the biofilm, without disrupting the growth of the remaining species. they localized in sparse small aggregates within the biofilm mass. enterococcus faecalis and e. coli were both able to populate the biofilm at high  numbers, and suppressed the growth of a. oris and s. mutants. enterococcus faecalis was arranged in a chain-like conformation, whereas e. coli was densely and evenly spread throughout the biofilm mass. in conclusion, it is possible for  selected species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota to be introduced into an oral biofilm, under the given experimental micro-environmental conditions. moreover, the equilibrated incorporation of a. actinomycetemcomitans  and s. aureus in this oral biofilm model could be a useful tool in the study of aggressive periodontitis and peri-implantitis, in which these organisms are involved, respectively.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == periodontal and peri-implant microbiota in patients with healthy and inflamed periodontal and peri-implant tissues.
AB  == objective: to compare the prevalence and levels of six bacterial pathogens within the subgingival/submucosal microbiota at teeth versus implants with various clinical conditions. material and methods: twenty-two chinese were included. four subgingival/submucosal sites were selected for microbiological sampling within each subject, that is, (1) healthy peri-implant tissues; (2) peri-implantitis [ppd >/= 5 mm, presence of bleeding on probing (bop) and confirmed radiographic bone loss]; (3) healthy gingiva; and (4) periodontitis (ppd >/=4 mm). subgingival/submucosal plaque was sampled using paper points. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-pcr) was used to quantify six pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), treponema denticola (t.d.), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), and staphylococcus aureus (s.a.). counts were log10-transformed. results: the most commonly detected species were s. a. and f.  n., while a. a. and. p. i. had the lowest detection frequency. the detection frequencies of diseased tooth or implant sites for each of the six target species were either equal to or higher than the respective frequencies at the corresponding healthy sites. there were no statistically significant differences  for any of the species or clinical sites (p > 0.05, cochran's q test). no statistically significant differences in the bacterial loads were found among the four clinical sites; with the exception of f. nucleatum. this was more abundant in periodontitis sites (p = 0.023, friedman's 2-way anova). both periodontal and  peri-implant sites, irrespective of their health status, were revealed to harbor  s. aureus cells. the log10-transformed loads of s. aureus were approximately 3.5  within each of the clinical sites (p = 0.232). this was the highest of the six species analyzed. conclusions: within the same subjects, putative periodontal pathogens were common to both periodontal and peri-implant sites irrespective of  health status. the prevalence and levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were significantly associated with periodontitis, but not with peri-implantitis. a. actinomycetemcomitans was associated with both disease conditions, periodontitis  and peri-implantitis, but not with either gingival or mucosal health.

TI  == assessment of periodontal and opportunistic flora in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB  == aim: to assess the presence of periodontal and opportunistic organisms in patients with peri-implantitis. material and methods: thirty-three partially edentulous subjects (22 women, 11 men), aged 32-90 years, who had one or more implants with peri-implantitis were included. peri-implantitis was defined as: (i) the presence of bleeding on probing and/or suppuration and (ii) radiographic  images showed marginal bone loss >1.8 mm after 1 year in function. criteria for inclusion were: (i) partially edentulous patients having at least one implant diagnosed with peri-implantitis; (ii) no antibiotic therapy for 6 months prior to clinical examination. following this definition, a total of 48 implants were diagnosed with peri-implantitis. subgingival bacterial samples were obtained with sterile paper points from infected implants and selected teeth of each individual. periodontopathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) were detected by multiplex pcr targeting 16s rdna. samples were placed in reduced transport medium and cultured for opportunistic pathogens  (staphylococcus aureus, enteric bacteria, pseudomonas and yeasts). results: twenty-two patients yielded positive results for p. gingivalis, 25 for t. forsythia, eight for p. intermedia and 13 for t. denticola. none of the patients  yielded a positive result for a. actinomycetemcomitans. non-periodontal species were found in five patients (15% of total). p. aeruginosa was found in four (12%) patients, and c. albicans (3%) and s. aureus in one patient (3%) each. in two cases of peri-implantitis, none of the periodontal or opportunistic microorganisms studied were detected in either implant or tooth samples. when results of the periodontopathic bacteria from the implant and tooth samples of the same patient were compared, 18 patients (54%) showed the same results for both samples and 15 (45%) patients different results. conclusions: the implant surface may be colonized with pathogens different from periodontal bacteria. opportunistic pathogens such as p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and c. albicans may be associated with implant failure.

TI  == adhesion and biofilm formation by periodontopathogenic bacteria on different commercial brackets.
AB  == aim: to compare early bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation of common and uncommon periodontal pathogens on a variety of commercial brackets in vitro. materials and methods: in vitro adhesion and biofilm formation of 4 bacterial strains on 15 different commercial brackets, in standard culture mediums with and without addition of either serum or human saliva was evaluated by quantitative real time pcr after extraction of bacterial dna. results: materials significantly influenced bacterial adhesiveness in a species-specific way. titanium and gold brackets constantly yielded the lowest values with all tested bacteria and in all tested conditions. bracket materials and medium of growth significantly influenced biofilm formation. conclusion: materials and environmental conditions  significantly influence biofilm formation by periodontal pathogens at the surface of brackets. whenever possible brackets should be kept far from the gingival margin and if this is not possible, brackets made of gold, titanium, and ceramic  should be preferentially used.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish (armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and clostridium perfringens. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method.  the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the itcs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative  anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a mbc of 1.25 mg/ml, against c. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against f. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. these results suggest that the itcs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of dispersinb on methicillin-resistant staphylococcus pseudintermedius biofilm.
AB  == methicillin resistant staphylococcus pseudintermedius (mrsp) is an important canine pathogen that has been shown to produce biofilm in vitro. biofilm production may be an important virulence factor and methods to eliminate biofilm-associated infections are required. an enzyme of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dispersinb, has been shown to degrade the extracellular matrix in the biofilm of a variety of bacteria including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the objective of this study was to determine the  effect of dispersinb on mrsp biofilm production and eradication in vitro. a quantitative microtitre plate assay was used to assess the impact of dispersinb on 30 mrsp isolates from dogs. while dispersinb did not have any effect on mrsp growth (p=0.98), it reduced biofilm formation (p=0.0002) and degraded established biofilm (p=0.0001). these data indicate that in vivo study of the effect of this  enzyme in indicated to determine if it may be a useful treatment option for mrsp  biofilm-associated infections.

TI  == antibiofilm activity of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 capsular polysaccharide.
AB  == cell-free extracts isolated from colony biofilms of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 were found to inhibit biofilm formation by staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  but not by a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 itself, in a 96-well microtiter plate assay. physical and chemical analyses indicated that the antibiofilm activity in  the extract was due to high-molecular-weight polysaccharide. extracts isolated from a mutant strain deficient in the production of serotype 5 capsular polysaccharide did not exhibit antibiofilm activity. a plasmid harboring the serotype 5 capsule genes restored the antibiofilm activity in the mutant extract. purified serotype 5 capsular polysaccharide also exhibited antibiofilm activity against s. aureus. a. pleuropneumoniae wild-type extracts did not inhibit s. aureus growth, but did inhibit s. aureus intercellular adhesion and binding of s. aureus cells to stainless steel surfaces. furthermore, polystyrene surfaces coated with a. pleuropneumoniae wild-type extracts, but not with capsule-mutant extracts, resisted s. aureus biofilm formation. our findings suggest that the a.  pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 capsule inhibits cell-to-cell and cell-to-surface interactions of other bacteria. a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 capsular polysaccharide is one of a growing number of bacterial polysaccharides that exhibit broad-spectrum, nonbiocidal antibiofilm activity. future studies on these antibiofilm polysaccharides may uncover novel functions for bacterial polysaccharides in nature, and may lead to the development of new classes of antibiofilm agents for industrial and clinical applications.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == background: patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. this study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with cp.  methods: subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with cp in the united states. the samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/l, clindamycin at 4 mg/l, doxycycline at 4 mg/l, and metronidazole at 16 mg/l, with a post hoc combination of data for  amoxicillin and metronidazole. gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. results: overall, 74.2% of the patients with cp revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. one or more test species, most often prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, or aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with cp, respectively. fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either s. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). conclusions: patients with cp in the united states frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. the wide variability  found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with  cp.

TI  == cluster of bacteria associated with peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: information on the microbiota in peri-implantitis is limited. we hypothesized that neither gender nor a history of periodontitis/smoking or the microbiota at implants differ by implant status. materials and methods: baseline  microbiological samples collected at one implant in each of 166 participants with peri-implantitis and from 47 individuals with a healthy implant were collected and analyzed by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization (78 species). clinical and radiographic data defined implant status. results: nineteen bacterial species were found at higher counts from implants with peri-implantitis including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, helicobacter pylori, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus anaerobius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii (p < .001). receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. socranskii, staph. aureus, staph. anaerobius, strep. intermedius, and strep. mitis in peri-implantitis comprising 30% of the total microbiota. when adjusted for gender (not significant [ns]), smoking status (ns), older age (p = .003), periodontitis  history (p < .01), and t. forsythia (likelihood ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4, 9.1, p = .007) were associated with peri-implantitis. conclusion: a cluster of bacteria including t. forsythia and staph. aureus are associated with  peri-implantitis.

TI  == p2x receptor stimulation amplifies complement-induced haemolysis.
AB  == activation of the complement system evokes cell damage by insertion of membrane attack complexes, which constitute the basis of the pathogenesis of various haemolytic disorders. recently, we found that haemolysis caused by other types of membrane pore-forming proteins such as alpha-haemolysin (hlya) from escherichia coli, alpha-toxin from staphylococcus aureus and leukotoxin from aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans inflict their cytotoxic effects through p2 receptor activation. here we show that similar to haemolysis induced by hlya, leukotoxin and alpha-toxin, complement-induced haemolysis is amplified through atp release and subsequent p2 receptor activation. similar results were found both in murine, sensitised ovine and human erythrocytes, with either human plasma or guinea pig serum as complement donors. non-selective p2 antagonists (ppads and suramin) concentration-dependently inhibited complement-induced haemolysis. more specific  p2 receptor antagonists imply that p2x1 and p2x7 are the main receptors involved  in this response. moreover, complement activation produces a sustained increase in [ca(2+)]i, which initially triggers significant erythrocyte shrinkage, most likely mediated by kca3.1-dependent k(+) efflux. these results indicate that complement, similar to hlya and alpha-toxin, requires purinergic signalling for full haemolysis and that activation of erythrocyte volume regulation protracts the process. this finding points to several new pathways to interfere with haemolytic diseases and implies that p2 receptor antagonists potentially can be used to prevent intravascular haemolysis.

TI  == gram-positive bacteria as an antigen topically applied into gingival sulcus of immunized rat accelerates periodontal destruction.
AB  == background and objective: periodontitis is generally accepted to relate to gram-negative bacteria, and the host defense system influences its onset and progression. however, little is known about the relation between gram-positive bacteria and periodontitis. in this study, we topically applied gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial suspensions to the gingival sulcus in rats after immunization, and then histopathologically examined their influence on periodontal destruction. materials and methods: rats previously immunized with heat-treated and sonicated staphylococcus aureus or aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were used as immunized groups. the non-immunized group received only sterile phosphate-buffered saline. in each animal, s. aureus or a.  actinomycetemcomitans suspension was applied topically to the palatal gingival sulcus of first molars every 24 h for 10 d. blood samples were collected and the  serum level of anti-s. aureus or anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the first molar regions were resected and observed histopathologically. osteoclasts were stained with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (trap). the formation of immune  complexes was confirmed by immunohistological staining of c1qb. results: serum levels of anti-s. aureus and anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans igg antibodies in the  immunized groups were significantly higher than those in the non-immunized groups were. the loss of attachment, increase in apical migration of the junctional epithelium, and decreases in alveolar bone level and number of trap-positive multinuclear cells in each immunized group were significantly greater than in each non-immunized group. the presence of c1qb was observed in the junctional epithelium and adjacent connective tissue in the immunized groups. conclusions: heat-treated and sonicated s. aureus and a. actinomycetemcomitans induced attachment loss in rats immunized with their suspensions. our results suggest that not only gram-negative but also gram-positive bacteria are able to induce periodontal destruction.

TI  == broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition by kingella kingae exopolysaccharide.
AB  == cell-free extracts prepared from kingella kingae colony biofilms were found to inhibit biofilm formation by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, candida albicans,  and k. kingae. the extracts evidently inhibited biofilm formation by modifying the physicochemical properties of the cell surface, the biofilm matrix, and the substrate. chemical and biochemical analyses indicated that the biofilm inhibition activity in the k. kingae extract was due to polysaccharide. structural analyses showed that the extract contained two major polysaccharides.  one was a linear polysaccharide with the structure -->6)-alpha-d-glcnacp-(1-->5)-beta-d-oclap-(2-->, which was identical to a capsular polysaccharide produced by actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5. the second was a novel linear polysaccharide, designated pam galactan, with the structure -->3)-beta-d-galf-(1-->6)-beta-d-galf-(1-->. purified pam galactan exhibited broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition activity. a cluster of three k. kingae genes encoding udp-galactopyranose mutase (ugm) and two putative galactofuranosyl transferases was sufficient for the synthesis of pam galactan in escherichia coli. pam galactan is one of a growing number of bacterial polysaccharides that exhibit antibiofilm activity. the biological roles and potential technological applications of these molecules remain unknown.

TI  == microbiologic results after non-surgical erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet laser or air-abrasive treatment of peri-implantitis: a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study is to assess clinical and microbiologic effects of the non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis lesions using either an erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet (er:yag) laser or an air-abrasive subgingival polishing method. methods: in a 6-month clinical trial, 42 patients with peri-implantitis were treated at one time with an er:yag laser or an air-abrasive device. routine clinical methods were used to monitor clinical conditions. baseline and 6-month intraoral radiographs were assessed with a software program. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method was used to assess 74 bacterial species from the site with the deepest probing depth (pd) at  the implant. non-parametric tests were applied to microbiology data. results: pd  reductions (mean +/- sd) were 0.9 +/- 0.8 mm and 0.8 +/- 0.5 mm in the laser and  air-abrasive groups, respectively (not significant). no baseline differences in bacterial counts between groups were found. in the air-abrasive group, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus anaerobius were found at lower counts at 1 month after therapy (p <0.001) and with lower counts in the laser group for fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme (p = 0.002), and fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum (p = 0.002). both treatments failed to reduce bacterial counts at 6 months. porphyromonas gingivalis counts were higher in cases with progressive peri-implantitis (p <0.001). conclusions: at 1 month, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, and s. anaerobius were reduced in the air-abrasive group,  and fusobacterium spp. were reduced in the laser group. six-month data demonstrated that both methods failed to reduce bacterial counts. clinical improvements were limited.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == photolysis of hydrogen peroxide, an effective disinfection system via hydroxyl radical formation.
AB  == the relationship between the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis  of h(2)o(2) and bactericidal activity was examined. h(2)o(2) (1 m) was irradiated with laser light at a wavelength of 405 nm to generate hydroxyl radicals. electron spin resonance spin trapping analysis showed that the amount of hydroxyl radicals produced increased with the irradiation time. four species of pathogenic oral bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis, were used in the bactericidal assay. s. mutans in a model biofilm was also examined. laser irradiation of suspensions in 1 m h(2)o(2) resulted in a >99.99% reduction of the viable counts  of each of the test species within 3 min of treatment. treatment of s. mutans in  a biofilm resulted in a >99.999% reduction of viable counts within 3 min. other results demonstrated that the bactericidal activity was dependent on the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated. treatment of bacteria with 200 to 300 mum hydroxyl radicals would result in reductions of viable counts of >99.99%.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of tetracycline hydrochloride adsorbed onto bio-oss bone graft.
AB  == local delivery of antibiotics may provide the advantage of reducing the potential side effects associated with their systemic administration. this study assessed,  in vitro, the antimicrobial efficacy of tetracycline hydrochloride (tch) adsorbed onto bio-oss bone grafts against a range of pathogenic bacteria. various levels of tch were adsorbed onto bio-oss granules by immersing in tch aqueous solutions  of different initial concentrations for 48 h at room temperature. tch release was assessed in phosphate buffered saline at 37 degrees c, and its antimicrobial efficacy, up to 96 h, was tested against two gram-negative bacteria associated with periodontal diseases: aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, and one gram-positive bacterium associated with soft-tissue and bone infections: staphylococcus aureus. the range of tch concentrations studied was also assessed for cytotoxicity against osteoblast-like human osteosarcoma cell lines. the amount of tch adsorbed and released from bio-oss was concentration dependent. all tch adsorbed bio-oss resulted in a reduction of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and s. aureus and higher concentrations were generally more effective in reducing or eliminating bacterial growth. the proliferation of hos cells was not substantially reduced except for the maximum concentration of tch. in addition to its osteoconductive role, tch adsorbed bio-oss could also be functional in negating systemically antibiotic prophylactic treatment in the prevention of implant or biomaterial related infections.

TI  == staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms: functional molecules, relation to virulence, and vaccine potential.
AB  == medical device-associated infections, most frequently caused by staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, are of increasing importance in modern medicine. the formation of adherent, multilayered bacterial biofilms is crucial in the pathogenesis of these infections. polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (pia), a homoglycan of beta-1,6-linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d: -glucopyranosyl residues, of which about 15% are non-n-acetylated, is central to biofilm accumulation in staphylococci. it transpires that polysaccharides - structurally  very similar to pia - are also key to biofilm formation in a number of other organisms including the important human pathogens escherichia coli, aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, yersinia pestis, and bordetella spp. apparently, synthesis of pia and related polysaccharides is a general feature important for biofilm formation in diverse bacterial genera. current knowledge about the structure and biosynthesis of pia and related polysaccharides is reviewed. additionally, information on their role in pathogenesis of biomaterial-related and other type of infections and the potential use of pia and related compounds for prevention of infection is evaluated.

TI  == influence of the menstrual cycle on the oral microbial flora in women: a case-control study including men as control subjects.
AB  == changes in the levels of female sex hormones during the menstrual cycle may cause cyclic differences in subgingival bacterial colonization patterns. the purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle cause changes in the oral microbiota. methods: bacterial plaque samples were collected in 20 systemically and periodontally healthy women using no hormonal contraceptives (test group) over a period of 6 weeks. twenty age-matched systemically and periodontally healthy men were assigned to the control group. samples were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay, and 74 species were analyzed. results: no cyclic pattern of bacterial colonization was identified for any of the 74 species studied in women not using  hormonal contraceptives. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (y4) was common at the beginning of menstruation (mean: 32%) and increased during the following 2 weeks (36%) in women (p <0.05). no cyclic differences in bacterial presence were found among the men (p values varied between 0.14 and 0.98). men presented with significantly higher bacterial counts for 40 of 74 species (p <0.001), including staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa but not porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.15) or  tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.42). conclusions: during a menstruation period, cyclic variation in the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy women of child-bearing age who were not using oral hormonal contraceptives could not be confirmed. male control subjects presented with higher levels of many species but also without a cyclic pattern.

TI  == bacteriostatic effects of hyaluronic acid.
AB  == background: this investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (ha) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. the rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that ha can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. methods: in this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant ha (low, 141 kd; medium, 757 kd; and high, 1,300 kd) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. three concentrations of each ha formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. results: recombinant ha exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (mw) and concentration. the high concentrations of the medium mw ha had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella oris, staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes strains. the 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high mw ha had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. among the bacterial strains studied, ha was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that ha in the mw range of 1,300 kd may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds  when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.

TI  == the microbiota of periodontal pockets with different depths in therapy-resistant  periodontitis.
AB  == this study presents the composition of the cultivable microbiota colonising periodontal pockets of different depths among 2 patient-groups classified as non-responsive (nr-group; 11 participants) or responsive (r-group; 10 participants) to periodontal treatment. microbiological samples from three types  of pocket (< 4 mm deep a-samples; 4-5 mm b-samples; > 5 mm c-samples) were analysed by cultural methods for putative periodontitis pathogens, microbial groups constituting > or = 5% of the total cultivable flora and opportunistic pathogens. actinomyces naeslundii, a. israelii, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, anaerobic streptococci and facultative anaerobic streptococci were most prevalent. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, staphylococcus aureus, enteric rods and yeasts were less prevalent. the periodontitis pathogens bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and peptostreptococcus micros constituted together (on average) < or = 23% of the viable counts in the a- and b-samples of  both patient groups and in the c-samples of the r-group. in the c-samples of the  nr-group their mean counts were 45%. correlations were found between smoking habits and the five pathogens in the c-samples and in pooled pocket depth samples. the results show that groups of periodontopathogens should be considered a causal factor in therapy-resistant periodontitis. further, smoking and deep pockets can enhance a shift in the balance of the subgingival microflora predisposing a site to disease and a susceptible host may be the pre-requisite to therapy-resistant periodontitis.

AB  == objective: this study was designed to examine human b cell responses to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa). the general hypothesis to be tested was that epstein-barr virus (ebv) immortalized b cells could be used to investigate variations in b cell responsiveness of periodontitis patients to periodontal pathogens, and that b cells derived from the peripheral blood of periodontal disease patients infected with aa demonstrate differences in in vitro activities compared to periodontally healthy subjects. design: ebv-transformed b  cell lines were used to analyze immunoglobulin and aa-specific antibody responses, as well as to determine the frequencies of cells producing immunoglobulin (ig) of a specific isotype and detect clones secreting antibodies  specific for aa. lymphoblastoid cells lines (lcl) were derived by clonal transformation of peripheral blood lymphocytes from 10 aa-infected patients with  adult periodontitis (aa-ap) and seven normal subjects. methods: the b cells were  incubated in aa-coated polystyrene plates to separate adherent and non-adherent cells, and stimulate the cells with the whole bacteria. in addition, the b cells  were stimulated with aa lps, e. coli lps, or the polyclonal b cell activators (pbas), pokeweed mitogen (pwm) and staphylococcus aureus protein a (spa). both adherent and non-adherent cell populations were cultured for up to 15 days. main  outcome measure: total immunoglobulins (igs) and antibody (igg, iga, igm) levels  to aa in the culture supernatants were assessed using an elisa. the distribution  of igg, iga, igm and aa-specific antibody producing cells was analyzed by a double immunoenzymatic staining technique. results: igm levels produced by the lcls were significantly increased vs igg and iga (p < 0.001). three days after aa stimulation, a marked increase in the level of total igs and aa-specific antibody was observed in adherent cells from aa-ap (p < 0.05-0.03). aa-specific antibody levels were significantly higher in the supernatants from aa-ap vs normals throughout the culture interval (p < 0.03). there was also a significant increase in aa-specific antibody levels after stimulation with aa lps or e. coli lps (p <  0.05), whereas pwm and spa had no significant effect on antibody to aa. there was a predominance of igm cells compared to igg and iga isotypes (p < 0.04) in lcls from aa-infected patients. after stimulation with aa, a significant increase in the number of iga (111%) and igg (48%) secreting cells was observed, concomitant  with a 74% decrease in the ig-negative cell population. total aa+ cells increased significantly after stimulation (p < 0.001), predominated by aa-specific igg and  igm antibody producing cells. conclusions: these results showed that lcls from aa-infected patients were polyclonal with respect to isotype distribution. further stimulation with aa revealed a shift to cytoplasmic igg and iga expression, as well as increases in the aa-specific b cell population. in contrast, the pbas stimulated the lcls to synthesize primarily igm. additionally, the findings indicated that: (1) without t cells, polyclonal activation of b cells may lead to elevated aa-specific b cell populations; and (2) the presence of previously sensitized b cells is required to exert an antigen specific antibody response in the lcl. we conclude that secondary activation of primed b cells by oral bacteria or their products in advanced periodontal lesions may contribute to the local accumulation of significant numbers of ig-producing cells. this report also suggested that ebv-mediated transformation can be used to probe b cell-bacterial interactions in studies of periodontitis.

TI  == extracts of periodontopathic microorganisms lack functional superantigenic activity for murine t cells.
AB  == products of periodontopathic bacteria exert immunomodulatory effects on various lymphoid cell populations, some of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. it has recently been suggested that some of these bacterial products may possess superantigenic (sag) activity. sag bind simultaneously to the v beta chain of t cell receptors and to class ii major histocompatibility complex molecules, thereby activating as many as 35% of t cells to proliferate and produce cytokines. in order to examine this question, the proliferation of splenic and thymic t cells from immunologically naive, 3-6-wk-old balb/c (h-2d),  c57bl/6 (h-2b) and c3h/hej (h-2k) mice was assessed in response to sonic extracts of periodontopathogens. laboratory and/or reference strains of a.o. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens were used as stimulants. staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb), a known superantigen, was utilized as a positive control. unfractionated spleen cells responded to several of the tested preparations of the different bacteria, as well as to seb, con a and escherichia coli lps. thymocytes responded to con a and seb, but not to lps or to any sonic extract. spleen cells depleted of b cells by panning responded to seb and con a, but not to lps and showed a reduced response to sonicates. the residual response of b cell-depleted spleen cells was reduced essentially to background by treatment with anti-thy 1.2 + c'. similar results were obtained in the presence of 5% added mitomycin-treated antigen presenting cells, indicating that these cells were not  limiting. these results demonstrate that extracts of periodontopathic bacteria do not stimulate murine t cells in a manner consistent with superantigenic activation.

TI  == the interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. the reference bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (gf) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (e) from 2 such persons, hela cells (hela), and an amnion cell line (amnion). the cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a bioscreen robot analyzer (labsystems, finland). results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line  of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == occurrence of enteric rods, staphylococci and candida in subgingival samples.
AB  == the frequency and percentage of enteric rods, staphylococci and candida were determined in 973 subgingival samples collected from 535 patients subjected to different periodontal treatment procedures. the analysis was performed with culture technique using selective and nonselective media. one or more organisms were detected in 65.5% of the samples and in 76.7% of the patients. in most samples enteric rods, staphylococci and/or candida constituted a small amount of  the total microbial viable count. enteric rods exceeded 10% of the total viable count in 30 samples. staphylococci occurred in more than 10% in only 3 samples. in these 3 samples, enterics constituted more than 10% of the total viable count. candida was not found to exceed 10% of the total viable count in any of the samples. no statistically significant correlation was found between the presence  of any of the target microorganisms and kind of periodontal treatment procedure received, antibiotic administration or sample transport time.

TI  == cytotoxicity in bacterial cultures: interaction and cell-specificity, possible factors in periodontal disease.
AB  == cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. interaction studies were made by adding each of the different uv-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. the reference oral bacterial strains were: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria staphylococcus aureus 209 and staphylococcus epidermidis. the target cells were:  gingival fibroblasts (gf), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (pmf), pulpal fibroblasts (pf), hela-cells (hela), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (ln). synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. the  cytotoxicity of a. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of p. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of s. aureus it was increased. bacterial interactions with f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. the  cytotoxicity of f. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with a. actinomycetemcomitans. each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the  supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.

TI  == microbial identification and antibiotic sensitivity testing, an aid for patients  refractory to periodontal therapy. a report of 3 cases.
AB  == the importance of microbial surveillance is illustrated in 3 clinical cases. each case demonstrated a continued lack of response to conventional periodontal treatment. repeated bouts of periodontal abscess formation and bone loss occurred over a 3- to 4-year period, despite numerous surgeries supplemented with antibiotics. as a result, patients were termed refractory to treatment and extensive microbiological analysis and sensitivity testing was performed. following institution of the appropriate antibiotic and conservative therapy consisting of several sessions of scaling and root planning, each of these cases  demonstrated a dramatic remission of disease progression. no further breakdown has been seen for a minimum of 2 1/2 years. while anecdotal in nature, these cases support the usefulness of microbial identification coupled with antibiotic  sensitivity as an adjunct to conventional conservative periodontal therapy.

TI  == role of suspected periodontopathogens in microbiological monitoring of periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal disease is the clinical result of a complex interaction between the host and plaque bacteria. although a specificity to some degree is found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), it has been difficult to obtain evidence for a specific etiological role of the bacteria associated with periodontal disease in adults. what we see is the net result of host-parasite interactions which in an unpredictable moment accumulate  and exceed the threshold of tissue integrity. this hypothesis is concomitant with the view of periodontal disease as a polymicrobial infection, predominantly anaerobic, which occurs commonly in the oral cavity or elsewhere in the body. some micro-organisms (risk markers) occur more frequently than others and may significantly determine the outcome of this host-parasite interaction. microbiological sampling and analysis seem to be of limited value in risk assessment; however, they can be used as tools in diagnosis in ljp patients and acute infections, and in treatment decision and therapy control in "refractory" patients. suspected pathogens (risk markers) are actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and some species of spirochetes, while the roles of prevotella intermedia, bacteroidesforsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and peptostreptococcus micros are more uncertain. the presence of periodontopathogens as well as enterics, staphylococcus aureus and candida especially, should be considered in patients with systemic individual disorders--e.g., diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and aids--or with implants.

TI  == expression of fc-gamma-riii and fibronectin in peripheral polymorphonuclear neutrophils with increased response to fc stimulation in patients with juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == the nature of increased luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (cl) in peripheral polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) in juvenile periodontitis is of pathophysiological interest and may serve as a model for tissue damage caused by  granulocytes. activation of pmns by opsonized staphylococcus aureus was compared  with that of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides gingivalis, regarded as being more specific for juvenile periodontitis. the cl was higher in  the pmns from the patients, independently of bacteria and mode of opsonization (autologous serum or gamma-globulin). fc-gamma-riii assessed on the washed fragments from peripheral pmns was significantly (p < or = 0.005) lower in the patients with juvenile periodontitis than in their pair-matched healthy controls, while the content of fibronectin was higher (p < or = 0.032). however, when fc-gamma-riii and fibronectin were studied in fresh pmns by flow cytometry no difference could be found between the two groups. the increased generation of cl  of peripheral pmns found in patients with juvenile periodontitis seems to be independent of humoral factors and of bacterial species and may be related to the properties of the pmn cell membranes.
