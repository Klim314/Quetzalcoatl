TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Bacterial species-characteristic profiles of molecular species, and the antigenicity of phospholipids and glycolipids in symbiotic Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species.
AB  - Human symbiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri (LR) in the intestines, Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) in skin and Streptococcus salivalis (SS) in the oral cavity, contain dihexaosyl diglycerides (DH-DG) in concentrations equivalent to those of phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), together with mono- to tetrahexaosyl DGs. The molecular species, as the combination of fatty acids in the DG moiety, were revealed to be bacterial species-characteristic, but to be similar between glycolipids and phospholipids in individual bacteria, the major ones being 16:0 and cy19:0 for LR, ai15:0 and ai17:0 for SE, and 16:0 and 18:1 for SS, respectively. The carbohydrate structures of DH-DGs were also bacterial species-characteristic, being Galalpha1-2Glcalpha for LR, Glcbeta1-6Glcbeta for SE, and Glcalpha1-2Glcalpha for SS, respectively. Also, bacterial glycolipids were revealed to provide antigenic determinants characteristic of bacterial species on immunization of rabbits with the respective bacteria. Anti-L. johnsonii antiserum intensely reacted with tri- and tetrahexaosyl DGs, in which Galalpha was bound to DH-DG through an alpha1-6 linkage, as well as with DH-DG from LR. Although anti-SE antiserum preferentially reacted with DH-DG from SE, anti-SS antiserum reacted with DH-DG from SS and, to a lesser extent, with DH-DGs from LR and SE. But, both anti-SE and anti-SS antiserum did not react at all with monohexaosyl DG or glycosphingolipids with the same carbohydrates at the nonreducing terminals. In addition, 75 % of human sera, irrespective of the ABO blood group, were found to contain IgM to tri- and tetrahexaosyl DGs from LR, but not to DH-DGs from LR, SE and SS.
TI  - Characterization of novel glycolipid antigens with an alpha-galactose epitope in  lactobacilli detected with rabbit anti-Lactobacillus antisera and occurrence of antibodies against them in human sera.
AB  - Anti-Lactobacillus johnsonii (LJ) antisera generated by immunization of rabbits with LJ reacted with glyceroglycolipids in LJ, i.e. dihexaosyl diacylglycerol (DH-DG), trihexaosyl DG (TH-DG) and tetrahexaosyl DG (TetH-DG), whose reactivities with antisera increased proportionally with longer carbohydrate chains of glycolipids. Structural analyses of glycolipids from LJ revealed that DH-DG was Galalpha1-2Glcalpha1-3'DG, and TH-DG and TetH-DG were novel derivatives of it with alpha-Gal at the non-reducing terminal, i.e. Galalpha1-6Galalpha1-2Glcalpha1-3'DG and Galalpha1-6Galalpha1-6Galalpha1-2Glcalpha1-3'DG, respectively. DH-DG was commonly present in several lactobacilli examined, but TetH-DG was restricted to LJ, L. intestinalis and L. reuteri, while the TH-DGs from L. casei were Glc1-6Galalpha1-2Glcalpha1-3'DG and an esterified derivative of it, Glc1-6Galalpha1-2Glc(6-fatty acid)alpha1-3'DG, as reported in the literature. Anti-LJ antisera reacted with TH-DG and esterified TH-DG from L. casei to lesser extents, but not at all with gentibiosyl DG from Staphylococcus epidermidis or kojibiosyl DG from Streptococcus salivalis or sphingoglycolipids containing alpha-Gal residues. The major molecular species of glycolipids obtained from lactobacilli were 11-octadecenoic and 11,12-methylene-octadecanoic acids-containing ones. Also, human IgM antibodies against TH-DG and TetH-DG from LJ were detected in human sera, with various antibody titres, indicating that an immune reaction to symbiotic lactobacilli occurs against their glycolipid antigens, TH-DG and TetH-DG.
TI  - Identification of rhesus macaque genital microbiota by 16S pyrosequencing shows similarities to human bacterial vaginosis: implications for use as an animal model for HIV vaginal infection.
AB  - The composition of the lower genital tract microbiota in women is believed to affect the risk of sexually acquiring HIV. Since macaque genital microbiota could similarly impact vaginal infection with SIV we identified microbiota in 11 rhesus macaques using multitag pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The microbiota was polymicrobial with a median of nine distinct bacterial taxa per macaque (range 3-16 taxa, each constituting 1% or more of the sequences). Taxa frequently found included Peptoniphilus, Sneathia, Porphyromonas, Mobiluncus, Atopobacter, Dialister, Thioreductor, Prevotella, and Streptococcus, many of which are also frequently found in women with bacterial vaginosis. Lactobacillus sequences (mostly L. johnsonii) were found in only four macaques but were not predominant in any (median of 0% of sequences, range 0-39%). All macaques were resampled 6 months after the first time point to determine the stability of the microbiota. The microbiota remained polymicrobial with a median of 10 taxa (range 6-18). Microbial patterns remained similar for six of the macaques, changed substantially in two, and had a mixed pattern in three. Significant sialidase enzyme activity, a marker of bacteria vaginosis in women, was detected in genital fluid from 9/11 and 8/11 macaques from the first and second time points, respectively. These results show that the macaque lower genital microbiota resembled a bacteria vaginosis-type microbiota in women and suggest that the microbiota of macaques in captivity promote rather than protect against vaginal infection with SIV. These results also suggest macaques could be used as an animal model to study some aspects of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Enhancement of survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid bacteria by yeasts in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions.
AB  - The effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (LAB) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees C) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live LAB. Five yeasts tested (Saccharomyces bayanus, Williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, Yarrowia lipolytica, Candida kefyr and Kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of Lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not Streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. Seven yeasts examined (Candida krusei, Geotrichum candidum, Pichia subpelliculosa, Kloeckera apiculata, Pichia membranifaciens, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Y. lipolytica) improved the survival of Lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. W. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus (probiotic) and Lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of Lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus in fermented milk. These results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on LAB and that the specific effects of yeasts on LAB stability vary with yeasts as well as with LAB. However, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with LAB remains to be found.
TI  - spr1630 is responsible for the lethality of clpX mutations in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The Clp protease ATPase subunit and chaperone ClpX is dispensable in some bacteria, but it is thought to be essential in others, including streptococci and lactococci. We confirm that clpX is essential in the Rx strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae but show that the requirement for clpX can be relieved by point mutations, frame shifts, or deletion of the gene spr1630, which is found in many isolates of S. pneumoniae. Homologs occur frequently in Staphylococcus aureus as well as in a few strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus johnsonii, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. In each case, the spr1630 homolog is accompanied by a putative transcriptional regulator with an HTH DNA binding motif. In S. pneumoniae, the spr1630-spr1629 gene pair, accompanied by a RUP element, occurs as an island inserted between the trpA and cclA genes in 15 of 22 sequenced genomes.
TI  - Change of intestinal microbiota with elemental diet and its impact on therapeutic effects in a murine model of chronic colitis.
AB  - Elemental diet (ED) has been used as an enteral nutritional therapy for Crohn's disease. However, the precise mechanisms of ED remain unclear. In interleukin-10 (IL-10)-deficient cell-transferred mice, we investigated the change of intestinal microbiota with ED using molecular terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and culture method, and evaluated its influence on therapeutic effects of ED. ED significantly suppressed intestinal inflammation. The total amount of bacteria in colitis mice fed the regular diet was higher than in normal mice but decreased in colitis mice fed ED. T-RFLP profiles of the ED group markedly differed from those of the regular diet groups. The diversity of bacterial species in the ED group decreased to 60% of that found in the regular diet groups. Among the cultivated bacteria, the change in lactic acid bacteria composition was remarkable. Lactobacillus reuteri and L. johnsonii decreased and Enterococcus faecalis and E. durans increased in the ED group. The culture supernatant of L. reuteri isolates induced significant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-6 activity in RAW 264 cells, while the culture supernatant of E. faecalis and E. durans barely induced their activity. These data suggested that reduction in amount and diversity of intestinal microbiota and decrease of proinflammatory cytokines via a change in composition of lactic acid bacteria by ED seem to contribute to reduction of bowel inflammation in this model.
TI  - Prediction of surface exposed proteins in Streptococcus pyogenes, with a potential application to other Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in silico prediction of bacterial surface exposed proteins is of growing interest for the rational development of vaccines and in the study of bacteria-host relationships, whether pathogenic or host beneficial. This interest is driven by the increase in the use of DNA sequencing as a major tool in the early characterization of pathogenic bacteria and, more recently, even of complex ecosystems at the host-environment interface in metagenomics approaches. Current protein localization protocols are not suited to this prediction task as they ignore the potential surface exposition of many membrane-associated proteins. Therefore, we developed a new flow scheme, SurfG+, for the processing of protein sequence data with the particular aim of identification of potentially surface exposed (PSE) proteins from Gram-positive bacteria, which was validated for Streptococcus pyogenes. The results of an exploratory case study on closely related lactobacilli of the acidophilus group suggest that the yogurt bacterium Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) dedicates a relatively important fraction of its coding capacity to secreted proteins, while the probiotic gastrointestinal (GI) tract bacteria L. johnsonii and L. gasseri appear to encode a larger variety of PSE proteins, that may play a role in the interaction with the host.
TI  - Characterization of the amylovorin locus of Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471, producer of a bacteriocin active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in combination with colistin and pyocins.
AB  - Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471 produces amylovorin L, a bacteriocin with an antibacterial activity against some strains of the Lactobacillus lineage. Based on the sequence of one active peptide, a gene encoding active amylovorin L was cloned and sequenced. Genome walking allowed us to sequence a larger fragment of 7577 bp of genomic DNA, with 12 predicted ORFs. The previously characterized amylovorin L peptide-encoding gene is preceded by another gene encoding a small polypeptide with a typical bacteriocin-processing double-glycine site, suggesting that amylovorin L is a two-component class IIb bacteriocin (amylovorin Lalpha/beta). Lalpha and Lbeta show the highest similarity to gassericin T from Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 and BlpN from Streptococcus pneumoniae R6, respectively, and to LafA and LafX, which form the lactacin F bacteriocin of Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533. As for other lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins, amylovorin L showed no activity against the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa on its own, but showed synergistic inhibitory activity when used in combination with the peptide antibiotic colistin, and, remarkably, with the P. aeruginosa soluble bacteriocins, pyocins S1 and S2.
TI  - Yoghurts containing probiotics reduce disruption of the small intestinal barrier  in methotrexate-treated rats.
AB  - Small intestinal permeability was employed to assess the efficacy of commercially available yoghurts containing probiotics in a rat model of methotrexate (MTX)-induced mucositis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to four groups (n = 8): MTX + water, MTX + cow's milk yoghurt (CY; fermented with Lactobacillus johnsonii), MTX + sheep's milk yoghurt (SY; containing Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus), and saline. Treatment gavage occurred twice daily for 7 days pre-MTX and 5 days post-MTX. Intestinal permeability was assessed on days -7, -1, 2, and 5 of the trial. Intestinal sections were collected at sacrifice for histological and biochemical analyses. Histology revealed that rats receiving CY and SY did not have a significantly damaged duodenum compared to controls. However, an improved small intestinal barrier function was evident, determined by a decreased lactulose/mannitol ratio. Probiotics containing SY and CY may be useful in preventing disruption to intestinal barrier function in MTX-induced mucositis.
TI  - Bacterial biodiversity of traditional Zabady fermented milk.
AB  - The aim of this work was to identify the bacterial biodiversity of traditional Zabady fermented milk using PCR-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE) and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Most of the identified bacterial species in Zabady samples belonged to lactic acid bacteria (LAB), e.g., Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus johnsonii. Using the culture-dependent and independent methods, the streptococcal and lactococcal groups appeared to be the major bacterial species in Zabady fermented milk, whereas the lactobacilli were the minor ones. The main dominant species was St. thermophilus followed by Lc. garvieae. Other molecular tools, e.g., species-specific PCR assay and cloning and sequencing strategy were used to confirm the TTGE and DGGE results. Lc. garvieae, Lc. raffinolactis, Ln. citreum, and Lb. johnsonii were identified for the first time in this type of Egyptian fermented milk.
TI  - Biological and genetic classification of canine intestinal lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - To investigate the distribution of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) inhabiting canine intestines, a total of 374 gram-positive LAB and bifidobacteria (BF) isolated from large intestinal contents in 36 dogs were classified and identified by phenotypic and genetic analyses. Based on cell morphological sizes, these isolates were divided into seven biotypes containing the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus. The LAB and BF isolates were classified into 38 chemotypes based on SDS-PAGE protein profile analysis of whole cells. Furthermore, partial 16S rDNA sequencing analysis demonstrated the presence of 24 bacterial species in the 38 chemotypes from 36 dogs. The identified species consisted of ten species belonging to the genus Lactobacillus (78.8%), seven species to the genus Bifidobacterium (6.8%), five species to the genus Enterococcus (11.6%), one species of Streptococcus bovis (2.0%), and one species of Pediococcus acidilactici (0.8%). In particular, the most predominant species in canine intestines were L. reuteri, L. animalis, and L. johnsonii and were found in the high frequency of occurrence of 77.8, 80.6, and 86.1%, respectively. Besides these, Enterococcus faecalis, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Streptococcus bovis were also isolated in the present study. The sequences of the isolates also showed high levels of similarity to those of the reference strains registered previously in the DDBJ and the similarity was above 97.2%. Their partial 16S rRNA genes were registered in the DDBJ.
TI  - Enolases from Gram-positive bacterial pathogens and commensal lactobacilli share  functional similarity in virulence-associated traits.
AB  - Enolase occurs as a cytoplasmic and a surface-associated protein in bacteria. Enolases of the bacterial pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as of the commensal lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus johnsonii, were purified as His(6)-fusion proteins from recombinant Escherichia coli. The fusion proteins were compared for putative virulence-associated functions, i.e., binding of human plasminogen, enhancement of plasminogen activation by human plasminogen activators, as well as binding to immobilized laminin, fibronectin and collagens. The individual enolases showed varying efficiencies in these functions. In particular, highly and equally effective interactions with plasminogen and laminin were seen with lactobacillar and staphylococcal enolases.
TI  - Molecular profiling of Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Bifidobacterium species  in feces of active racehorses.
AB  - Diversity and compositions of the Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Bifidobacterium group in the feces of six healthy, actively racing horses (Thoroughbreds) were analyzed by using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR with primer sets specific for each group. PCR-DGGE analysis of the feces showed that Lactobacillus equi, Lactobacillus johnsonii, a phylogenetic relative of Lactobacillus salivarius, a phylogenetic relative of Lactobacillus gastricus, and Weissella confusa were predominant in almost all of the feces tested, and Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus was predominant in the Streptococcus group. The Bifidobacterium group was not detected by single-PCR but atypical species of the group were found in three of the six Thoroughbreds tested by nested-PCR. Calculation and estimation of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria revealed that lactic acid bacteria were predominant in the feces and bifidobacteria were minor. These results indicate that the community of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in horse feces are unique because of the presence of specific species for horse feces and a minority of the Bifidobacterium group. Repeated tests of the feces from the same horse over 3 months showed that the diversity and composition of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the feces was basically stable throughout the test period.
TI  - Influence of the dairy environment on gene expression and substrate utilization in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used for the industrial production of fermented dairy products and form a group of related low-GC-content gram-positive bacteria. The major species used in dairy manufacturing are Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Leuconostoc. Traditionally most are applied as starter cultures for dairy fermentations or used as probiotic cultures, delivered in dairy vehicles. The appearance of the genomes of Lactococcus lactis, Bidifobacterium longum, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, 2 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, and pending completion of many draft genomic sequences, is now promoting in-depth investigation into the comparative genetic content of LAB. Moreover, whole-genome transcriptional arrays are quickly revealing critical genes/operons that are coordinately expressed and the impact of environmental factors on expression of multiple gene sets. Comparative genomics between multiple genomes is providing insights into genes that are important in metabolic, physiological, and functional roles for different LAB in the environments they inhabit, ranging from the gastrointestinal tract to milk and acidified dairy products.
TI  - Molecular quantification of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milk products using real-time quantitative PCR.
AB  - Real-time quantitative PCR assays were developed for the absolute quantification  of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, L. casei, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii) in fermented milk products. The results of molecular quantification and classic bacterial enumeration did not differ significantly with respect to S. thermophilus and the species of the L. casei group which were detected in the six commercial fermented products tested, thus showing that DNA extraction was efficient and that genomic DNA solutions were free of PCR inhibitors. For L. delbrueckii, the results of bacterial enumeration were generally lower by a factor 10 to 100 than those of PCR quantification, suggesting a loss of viability during storage of the dairy products at 1-8 degrees C for most of the strains in this species. Real-time quantitative assays enabled identification of the species of lactic acid bacterial strains initially present in commercial fermented milk products and their accurate quantification with a detection threshold of 10(3) cells per ml of product.
TI  - Identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11.
AB  - Screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kDa protein. Analysis of the 3010-bp DNA insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (ORFs). One ORF encodes LysA, a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages Lj928 and Lj965 from Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lp1 and Lp2 from Lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of Lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage Phiadh. The immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated ORF downstream of lysA which has similarity to glutamyl-tRNA synthetases. The N-terminus of LysA has sequence similarity with N-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the C-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial SH3b domains. C-terminal bacterial SH3b domains were identified in the majority of Lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. LysA was expressed in Escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different Lactobacillus species and against Lactococcus lactis, streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. It was found that LysA is 2 and 8000 times more active against L. fermentum than L. lactis and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.
TI  - Expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  - In living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. A widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutases (SODs) and hydroperoxidases. Generally, these enzymes are not present in Lactobacillus spp. In this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous SOD to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. Thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing SOD (sodA) was cloned from Streptococcus thermophilus AO54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. A 1.2-kb PCR product containing the sodA gene was cloned into the shuttle vector pTRK563, to yield pSodA, which was functionally expressed and complemented an Escherichia coli strain deficient in Mn and FeSODs. The plasmid, pSodA, was subsequently introduced and expressed in Lactobacillus gasseri NCK334, Lactobacillus johnsonii NCK89, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCK56, and Lactobacillus reuteri NCK932. Molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the gene (sodA) and the expression of an active gene product (MnSOD) in these strains of lactobacilli. The specific activities of MnSOD were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 U/mg of protein for L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, and L. reuteri, respectively. The expression of S. thermophilus MnSOD in L. gasseri and L. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. The data show that MnSOD protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing O(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of a sodA from S. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the microflora associated with dental caries.
AB  - Molecular techniques have revealed many novel, presumed unculturable, taxa in oral infections. The aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial community of the middle and advancing front of carious dental lesions by cultural and molecular analyses. Samples were collected with a hand excavator from five teeth with carious lesions involving dentine. Samples were cultured on blood agar and Rogosa agar incubated in air plus 5% CO(2) and on fastidious anaerobe agar anaerobically. DNA was also extracted directly from the samples and 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR with universal primers. PCR products were singularized by cloning, and the cloned inserts and cultured isolates were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. We identified 95 taxa among the 496 isolates and 1,577 clones sequenced; 44 taxa were detected by the molecular method alone; 31 taxa were previously undescribed. Only three taxa, Streptococcus mutans, Rothia dentocariosa, and an unnamed Propionibacterium sp., were found in all five samples. The predominant taxa by anaerobic cultivation were the novel Propionibacterium sp. (18%), Olsenella profusa (14%), and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). The predominant taxa in the molecular analysis were Streptococcus mutans (16%), Lactobacillus gasseri/johnsonii (13%), and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). There was no significant difference between the compositions of the microflora in the middle and advancing front samples (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon matched pairs, signed ranks test). In conclusion, combined cultural and molecular analyses have shown that a diverse bacterial community is found in dentinal caries and that numerous novel taxa are present.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the novel LysM domain-containing surface protein Sep from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in Lactobacillus and Lactococcus.
AB  - Examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kDa protein termed Sep. The amino-terminal sequence of Sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. Sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Lactobacillus plantarum. The carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of Sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (APF) surface proteins of Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii. The mature amino terminus of Sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding LysM domain, thereby making it distinct from APF proteins. We have identified a common motif within LysM domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding YG motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. Sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in L. fermentum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. Modified Sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, and L. lactis hosts. Sep as well as the previously described surface protein BspA were used to express and secrete in L. fermentum or L. rhamnosus a fragment of human E-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for Listeria monocytogenes. This study demonstrates that Sep has potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Bifidobacterium lactis DSM 10140: identification of the atp (atpBEFHAGDC) operon  and analysis of its genetic structure, characteristics, and phylogeny.
AB  - The atp operon is highly conserved among eubacteria, and it has been considered a molecular marker as an alternative to the 16S rRNA gene. PCR primers were designed from the consensus sequences of the atpD gene to amplify partial atpD sequences from 12 Bifidobacterium species and nine Lactobacillus species. All PCR products were sequenced and aligned with other atpD sequences retrieved from public databases. Genes encoding the subunits of the F(1)F(0)-ATPase of Bifidobacterium lactis DSM 10140 (atpBEFHAGDC) were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences of these subunits showed significant homology with the sequences of other organisms. We identified specific sequence signatures for the genus Bifidobacterium and for the closely related taxa Bifidobacterium lactis and Bifidobacterium animalis and Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii, which could provide an alternative to current methods for identification of lactic acid bacterial species. Northern blot analysis showed that there was a transcript at approximately 7.3 kb, which corresponded to the size of the atp operon, and a transcript at 4.5 kb, which corresponded to the atpC, atpD, atpG, and atpA genes. The transcription initiation sites of these two mRNAs were mapped by primer extension, and the results revealed no consensus promoter sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the atpD genes demonstrated that the Lactobacillus atpD gene clustered with the genera Listeria, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus and that the higher G+C content and highly biased codon usage with respect to the genome average support the hypothesis that there was probably horizontal gene transfer. The acid inducibility of the atp operon of B. lactis DSM 10140 was verified by slot blot hybridization by using RNA isolated from acid-treated cultures of B. lactis DSM 10140. The rapid increase in the level of atp operon transcripts upon exposure to low pH suggested that the ATPase complex of B. lactis DSM 10140 was regulated at the level of transcription and not at the enzyme assembly step.
TI  - The prophages of Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533: comparative genomics and transcription analysis.
AB  - Two non-inducible, but apparently complete prophages were identified in the genome of the sequenced Lactobacillus johnsonii strain NCC 533. The 38- and 40-kb-long prophages Lj928 and Lj965 represent distinct lineages of Sfi11-like pac-site Siphoviridae unrelated at the DNA sequence level. The deduced structural proteins from Lj928 demonstrated aa sequence identity with Lactococcus lactis phage TP901-1, while Lj965 shared sequence links with Streptococcus thermophilus phage O1205. With the exception of tRNA genes, inserted between DNA replication and DNA packaging genes, the transcription of the prophage was restricted to the genome segments near both attachment sites. Transcribed genes unrelated to phage functions were inserted between the phage repressor and integrase genes; one group of genes shared sequence relatedness with a mobile DNA element in Staphylococcus aureus. A short, but highly transcribed region was located between the phage lysin and right attachment site; it lacked a protein-encoding function in one prophage.
TI  - Lactobacillus agilis is an important component of the pigeon crop flora.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB: enterococci, streptococci and lactobacilli) in the pigeon crop. METHODS AND RESULTS: The crops of 10 pigeons were sampled and inoculated on agar plates for isolation of streptococci, enterococci and lactobacilli. The isolates were identified using tDNA-PCR. Lactobacillus agilis, a species described in 1981 from municipal sewage, was the dominant component in eight of these pigeon crop sacs. A Lactobacillus species related to L. fermentum and L. mucosae but probably not belonging to one of these species was isolated from five birds. Three pigeons carried Enterococcus cecorum. Minor species found were E. columbae, E. faecalis, E. hirae, L. johnsonii, L. salivarius, and Streptococcus gallolyticus. A description is given of the phenotypic characteristics of the L. agilis pigeon strains. CONCLUSIONS, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: L. agilis is found to be the main component of the LAB flora in the pigeon crop.
TI  - Modulation of nonspecific mechanisms of defense by lactic acid bacteria: effective dose.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a fermented milk product containing Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 (formerly known as Lactobacillus acidophilus La1) on the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy adult volunteers. Furthermore, we sought to define the effective doses of the bacteria, examine the effect on respiratory burst activity, and, finally, examine the contribution made by the starter culture to the biological effects. Volunteers were randomly distributed among three groups; each subject received one pot (150 ml) of fermented milk each day for 3 wk. The first two groups received a freshly prepared product fermented by Streptococcus thermophilus (group A) alone or S. thermophilus and 10(7) cfu/ml L. johnsonii La1 (group B). Group C received a product stored for a period of 21 to 28 d and that contained S. thermophilus and 10(6) cfu/ml of L. johnsonii La1. Ingestion of L. johnsonii La1 did not significantly increase fecal lactobacilli counts. However, L. johnsonii La1 was able to survive intestinal transit and was only recovered from the feces of the volunteers of groups B and C. The fermented base alone showed a weak effect on respiratory burst but not on phagocytic activity. However, the product containing 10(7) cfu/ml L. johnsonii La1 significantly enhanced both functions. The product containing 10(6) cfu/ml of L. johnsonii La1 had no significant effect on either function. These results suggest that fecal persistence may not necessarily reflect in vivo colonization and may not be a prerequisite for all forms of immune reactivity.
