TI  == cell wall-anchored nuclease of streptococcus sanguinis contributes to escape from neutrophil extracellular trap-mediated bacteriocidal activity.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis, a member of the commensal mitis group of streptococci, is a primary colonizer of the tooth surface, and has been implicated in infectious complications including bacteremia and infective endocarditis. during  disease progression, s. sanguinis may utilize various cell surface molecules to evade the host immune system to survive in blood. in the present study, we discovered a novel cell surface nuclease with a cell-wall anchor domain, termed swan (streptococcal wall-anchored nuclease), and investigated its contribution to bacterial resistance against the bacteriocidal activity of neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). recombinant swan protein (rswan) digested multiple forms of dna including net dna and human rna, which required both mg(2+) and ca(2+) for optimum activity. furthermore, dnase activity of s. sanguinis was detected around growing colonies on agar plates containing dna. in-frame deletion of the swan gene mostly reduced that activity. these findings indicated that swan is a major nuclease displayed on the surface, which was further confirmed by immuno-detection of swan in the cell wall fraction. the sensitivity of s. sanguinis to net killing was reduced by swan gene deletion. moreover, heterologous expression of the swan gene rendered a lactococcus lactis strain more resistant to net killing. our results suggest that the swan nuclease on the  bacterial surface contributes to survival in the potential situation of s. sanguinis encountering nets during the course of disease progression.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in serum and ascitic fluid of asymptomatic outpatients with cirrhosis and non-neutrocytic ascites.
AB  == background and aims: bacterial dna (bactdna) has been found in serum and ascitic  fluid (af) of 30-40% of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and non-neutrocytic  ascites, but its prevalence in outpatients is unknown. the aim of this prospective study was to investigate the presence of bactdna in af and serum among cirrhotic outpatients with non-neutrocytic ascites. methods: thirty-one consecutive patients with cirrhosis and non-neutrocytic ascites, who underwent therapeutic paracentesis in our outpatient clinic, were enrolled over a 13-week period. of these patients, 13 had a single paracentesis and 18 patients had several consecutive paracenteses (2-10) over the study period. overall, 98 serum  and non-neutrocytic af specimens were obtained and tested for the presence of bactdna by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. results: the main causes of cirrhosis were alcohol (53.5%) and hepatitis c (30%). the median meld score was 16 and there were 54.8% child-pugh c patients. bactdna  was negative in all samples from 28 of the 31 patients, including 15 patients with several paracentesis. one patient had a single af sample culture positive and bactdna positive for streptococcus mitis, whereas the simultaneous blood sample was negative. for each of the last two patients, dna from lactococcus lactis was detected in a single blood sample but not in the simultaneous af sample. conclusions: in contrast to that reported previously in hospitalized patients, bactdna is rarely detected in serum and af of outpatients with cirrhosis and non-neutrocytic ascites.

TI  == comparative genomics and transduction potential of enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.
AB  == to determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin c, norfloxacin, and uv radiation. thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and  restriction mapping. from these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. three groups of phages, phifl1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with phifl1a to c and  phifl2a and b sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while phifl3a and b share 37 to 41% identity with phifl1 and 2. phifl4a shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages phifl1 to 3. the phifl3a and b phages possess a high dna sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. homologs of the streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, pbla and pblb, are encoded on each sequenced e. faecalis phage. few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. e. faecalis jh2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in galleria mellonella. several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of g. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. the eight phages were tested for their ability to package host dna, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains og1rf and jh2-2.

TI  == a lacticin 3147 enriched food ingredient reduces streptococcus mutans isolated from the human oral cavity in saliva.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterise streptococcus mutans from irish saliva samples  and to assess their sensitivity to a food-grade preparation of the lantibiotic, lacticin 3147, produced by lactococcus lactis dpc3147. methods and results: saliva samples collected from children with varying oral health status were screened on mitis salivarius agar for the presence of pathogenic streptococci. following selective plating, 16s rdna sequencing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), 15 distinct strains of strep. mutans were identified. these were grouped according to their relative sensitivity to lacticin 3147 which ranged from 0.78 to 6.25%; relative to a sensitive indicator strain, lactococcus  lactis ssp. lactis hp. inhibition of indicator strep. mutans strains from sensitive, intermediate and tolerant groupings were assessed in microtitre plate  assays with increasing concentrations of lacticin 3147. the concentration of lacticin 3147 required to give 50% growth inhibition correlated with their relative sensitivities (as assayed by well diffusion methodology) and ranged from 1280 to 5120 au ml(-1). concentrated preparations of lacticin 3147 caused a rapid killing of strep. mutans strains in broth. moreover, in human saliva deliberately spiked with strep. mutans, the pathogen was eliminated (initial inoculum of 10(5)) in the presence of 40,000 au ml(-1) of lacticin 3147. furthermore, a food-grade lacticin 3147 spray dried powder ingredient was assessed for the inhibition of strep. mutans in human saliva, spiked with a strain of intermediate sensitivity, resulting in up to a 4-log reduction in counts after 20 min. conclusion: a food grade preparation of lacticin 3147 was effective in the inhibition of oral strep. mutans. significance and impact of the study: the inhibition of oral streptococci by food grade preparations of lacticin 3147 may offer novel opportunities for the development of lacticin 3147 as an anti-cariogenic agent particularly in the area of functional foods for the improvement of oral health.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == genomic organization and molecular characterization of sm1, a temperate bacteriophage of streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the direct binding of streptococcus mitis to human platelets is mediated in part  by two proteins (pbla and pblb) encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage (sm1). since sm1 is the first prophage of s. mitis that has been identified and because of the possible role of these phage-encoded proteins in virulence, we sought to characterize sm1 in greater detail. sequencing of the sm1 genome revealed that it consisted of 34,692 bp, with an overall g+c content of 39 mol%. fifty-six genes encoding proteins of 40 or more amino acids were identified. the genes of sm1 appear to be arranged in a modular, life cycle-specific organization. blast analysis also revealed that the proteins of sm1 have homologies to proteins from  a wide variety of lambdoid phages. bioinformatic analyses, in addition to n-terminal sequencing of the proteins, led to the assignment of possible functions to a number of proteins, including the integrase, the terminase, and two major structural proteins. examination of the phage structural components indicates that the phage head may assemble using stable multimers of the major capsid protein, in a process similar to that of phage r1t. these findings indicate that sm1 may be part of a discrete subfamily of the siphoviridae that includes at least phages r1t of lactococcus lactis and sf370.3 of streptococcus pyogenes.

TI  == effect of acidic ph on expression of surface-associated proteins of streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis, a member of the mitis group of oral streptococci, is implicated in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and is the predominant aciduric non-mutans-group streptococcus in dental plaque. we undertook to identify the most abundant surface-associated proteins of s. oralis and to investigate changes in protein expression when the organism was grown under acidic culture conditions. surface-associated proteins were extracted from cells  grown in batch culture, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption  ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. putative functions were assigned by homology to a translated genomic database of streptococcus pneumoniae. a total of 27 proteins were identified; these included a lipoprotein, a ribosome recycling factor, and the glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enolase. the most abundant protein, phosphocarrier protein hpr, was present as three isoforms. neither lactate dehydrogenase nor pyruvate oxidase, dominant intracellular proteins, were present among the proteins on the gels, demonstrating that proteins in the surface-associated pool did not arise as a result of cell lysis. eleven of the proteins identified were differentially expressed when cells were grown at ph 5.2 versus ph 7.0, and these included superoxide dismutase, a homologue of dipeptidase v from lactococcus lactis, and the protein translation elongation factors g, tu, and ts. this study has extended the range of streptococcal proteins known to be expressed at the cell surface. further investigations are required to ascertain their functions at this extracellular location and determine how their expression is influenced by other environmental conditions.

TI  == genetic loci of streptococcus mitis that mediate binding to human platelets.
AB  == the direct binding of bacteria to platelets is a postulated major interaction in  the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. to identify bacterial components that mediate platelet binding by streptococcus mitis, we screened a tn916deltae-derived mutant library of s. mitis strain sf100 for reduced binding to human platelets in vitro. two distinct loci were found to affect platelet binding. the first contains a gene (pblt) encoding a highly hydrophobic, 43-kda protein with 12 potential membrane-spanning segments. this protein resembles members of the major facilitator superfamily of small-molecule transporters. the  second platelet binding locus consists of an apparent polycistronic operon. this  region includes genes that are highly similar to those of lactococcus lactis phage r1t and streptococcus thermophilus phage 01205. two genes (pbla and pblb) encoding large surface proteins are also present. the former encodes a 107-kda protein containing tryptophan-rich repeats, which may serve to anchor the protein within the cell wall. the latter encodes a 121-kda protein most similar to a tail fiber protein from phage 01205. functional mapping by insertion-duplication mutagenesis and gene complementation indicates that pblb may be a platelet adhesin and that expression of pblb may be linked to that of pbla. the combined data indicate that at least two genomic regions contribute to platelet binding by s. mitis. one encodes a probable transmembrane transporter, while the second encodes two large surface proteins resembling structural components of lysogenic  phages.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
