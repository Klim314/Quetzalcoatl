antimicrobial evaluation of plants used for the treatment of diarrhoea in a rural community in northern maputaland, kwazulu-natal, south africa.
background: zulu people living in the rural area of maputaland (kwazulu-natal, south africa) rely heavily on medicinal plants for the treatment of diarrhoea. abundant availability of medicinal plants in the study area offers low cost health care, but scientific validation is needed in order to lend credibility to the traditional use against many ailments including diarrhoeal infections. with this in mind a study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of 23 plant species which are used for the treatment of diarrhoea in rural maputaland. four 1:1 plant combinations were also evaluated to determine their interactive effects against seven diarrhoea-related bacterial pathogens. methods: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assays were undertaken on dichloromethane-methanol (ch2cl2: meoh) and aqueous crude extracts. the following micro-organisms were selected for this study and were tested based on their association with stomach ailments and diarrhoea; bacillus cereus (atcc 11778), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), escherichia coli (atcc 8739), proteus vulgaris (atcc 33420), salmonella typhimurium (atcc 14028), shigella flexneri (atcc 25875) and staphylococcus aureus (atcc 12600). the fractional inhibitory concentration index (sigmafic) was determined for plants traditionally used in combination. results: shigella flexneri proved to be the most susceptible pathogen, where the organic extract of terminalia sericea showed the most prominent noteworthy antibacterial activity (mean mic value of 0.04 mg/ml). the aqueous extracts generally showed poorer antimicrobial activity with some exceptions i.e. acacia burkei, brachylaena transvaalensis against b. cereus and b. transvaalensis against s. flexneri. in the combination studies, synergy was predominant with mean (across all pathogens) sigmafic values of 0.30 for acanthospermum glabratum with krauseola mosambicina; sigmafic values of 0.46 for a. glabratum with psidium guajava; sigmafic values of 0.39 for b. transvaalensis with p. guajava and sigmafic values of 0.88 (additive) for the combination of b. transvaalensis with sclerocarya birrea. conclusion: this study provided some insight into the bacterial in vitro efficacies of plants traditionally used to treat diarrhoea by the people of northern maputaland. very little connection was observed between frequency of use and efficacy. plant combinations demonstrated favourable efficacy with mostly synergistic effects noted, lending some credibility to their use in combination.
cerecidins, novel lantibiotics from bacillus cereus with potent antimicrobial activity.
lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides that are widely produced by gram-positive bacteria, including many species of the bacillus group. in the present study, one novel gene cluster coding lantibiotic cerecidins was unveiled in bacillus cereus strain as 1.1846 through genomic mining and pcr screening. the designated cer locus is different from that of conventional class ii lantibiotics in that it included seven tandem precursor cera genes, one modification gene (cerm), two processing genes (cert and cerp), one orphan regulator gene (cerr), and two immunity genes (cerf and cere). in addition, one unprecedented quorum sensing component, comqxpa, was inserted between cerm and cerr. the expression of cerecidins was not detected in this strain of b. cereus, which might be due to repressed transcription of cerm. we constitutively coexpressed cera genes and cerm in escherichia coli, and purified precerecidins were proteolytically processed with the endoproteinase gluc and a truncated version of putative serine protease cerp. thus, two natural variants of cerecidins a1 and a7 were obtained which contained two terminal nonoverlapping thioether rings rarely found in lantibiotics. both cerecidins a1 and a7 were active against a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria. cerecidin a7, especially its mutant dhb13a, showed remarkable efficacy against multidrug-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mdrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), and even streptomyces.
antimicrobial activity of amazon astrocaryum aculeatum extracts and its association to oxidative metabolism.
several compounds present in fruits as polyphenols are able to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms. these proprieties are relevant mainly in tropical areas, as amazonian region where infectious are highly prevalent. therefore, this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of tucuma amazonian fruit against 37 microorganisms. the potential role of oxidative metabolism imbalance was also studied as causal mechanism of antimicrobial activity. the results showed antibacterial effect of pulp and peel tucuma hydro-alcoholic extracts on three gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes) and antifungal effect against candida albicans. the antimicrobial contribution of main chemical compounds (quercetin, rutin, beta-carotene and gallic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids) found in tucuma extracts was also investigated showing an inhibitory effect depending of the organism mainly by quercetin in bacteria and rutin in c. albicans. analysis of kinetic of dna releasing in extracellular medium by fluorescence using dna pico green assay((r)) and reactive oxygen species production (ros) showed potential oxidative imbalance contribution on tucuma inhibitory effect. in b. cereus and c. albicans this effect was clear since after 24h the ros levels were higher when compared to negative control group. in conclusion, tucuma extracts present antimicrobial activity to four microorganisms that have large problems of drug resistance, and the possible mechanism of action of this amazon fruit is related to redox imbalance.
antibacterial activity of actinomycetes isolated from different soil samples of sheopur (a city of central india).
the main objective of the present study was isolation, purification, and characterization of actinomycetes from soil samples, having antimicrobial activity against 12 selected pathogenic strains. soils samples were taken from different niche habitats of sheopur district, madhya pradesh, india. these samples were serially diluted and plated on actinomycete isolation agar media. potential colonies were screened, purified, and stored in glycerol stock. isolates were morphologically and biochemically characterized. these isolates were subjected to extraction for production of the antibacterial compound. antibacterial activity and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the purified extract of isolates were evaluated. totally 31 actinomycete isolates were tested for antagonistic activity against 12 pathogenic microorganisms. isolates as14, as27, and as28 were highly active, while as1 showed less activity against the pathogenic microorganisms. isolate as7 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity against bacillus cereus (24 mm) and as16 showed the highest activity against enterococcus faecalis (21 mm). mic was also determined for actinomycete isolates against all the tested microorganisms. mic of actinomycete isolates was found to be 2.5 mg/ml against shigella dysenteriae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and klebsiella pneumoniae, and was 1.25 mg/ml for staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus xylosus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. all actinomycetes isolates showed antibacterial activity against s. aureus, while they showed less activity against s. dysenteriae. these isolates had antibacterial activity and could be used in the development of new antibiotics for pharmaceutical or agricultural purposes.
synthesis and characterization of a series of transition metal complexes with a new symmetrical polyoxaaza macroacyclic schiff base ligand: x-ray crystal structure of cobalt(ii) and nickel(ii) complexes and their antibacterial properties.
a new symmetrical [n4o2] hexadentate schiff base ligand, (e)-n-(pyridin-2-ylmethylene)-2-(3-(2-((e)-pyridin-2-lmethyleneamino)phenoxy)naph thalen-2-yloxy)benzenamine, abbreviated to l, and its complexes of ni(ii), cu(ii), zn(ii), co(ii), cd(ii) and mn(ii) have been synthesized in the presence of metal ions. the complexes were structurally characterized by elemental analyses, ir, uv-vis, nmr and molar conductivity. the crystal structures of two complexes, [nil(ono2)2].2h2o and [colcl2]ch3oh.0.5h2o, have been determined by a single crystal x-ray diffraction study. in these complexes, the ligand is coordinated in a neutral form via pyridine and azomethine nitrogen atoms. the metal ions complete their six coordination with two coordinated nitrate or chloride ions, forming a distorted octahedral geometry. the synthesized compounds have antibacterial activity against the three gram-positive bacteria: enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus epid and also against the three gram-negative bacteria: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and salmonella typhi. the activity data show that the complexes are more potent antibacterials than the parent schiff base.

(11 mm) while the benzene extracts of h. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and s. aureus (12 mm). conclusions: it is hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.
spectral, thermal and in vitro antimicrobial studies of cyclohexylamine-n-dithiocarbamate transition metal complexes.
transition metal complexes of the type [m(l)(2)] and those containing monodentate phosphines of the type [m(l)(2)(pph(3))] {m=ni, co, cu and zn; l=cyclohexylamine-n-dithiocarbamate; pph(3)=triphenylphosphine} have been synthesized. the complexes were characterized using ir, uv-vis, nmr spectroscopy, and thermal analysis (tga). the (1)h nmr, (13)c nmr and (31)p nmr showed the expected signals for the dithiocarbamate and triphenylphosphine moieties. the spectral studies in all compounds revealed that the coordination of metals occurs via the sulphur atom of the dithiocarbamate ligand in a bidentate fashion. thermal behavior of the complexes showed that the complexes were more stable than their parent ligands. the ligand moiety is lost in the first step and the rest of the organic moiety decomposes in the subsequent steps. furthermore, the ligand and their metal complexes were screened in vitro for their antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus and antifungal activities against aspergillus flavus, aspergillus carbonarius, aspergillus niger and aspergillus fumigatus. the metal complexes exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than the parent ligands. generally, the zinc complexes were effective against the growth of bacteria with zn(l)(2) displaying broad spectrum bacteriocidal activity at concentrations of 50microg/ml; and ni(l)(2) was more effective against the growth of fungi at concentrations of 100-400microg/ml under laboratory conditions.

the chemical composition of the essential oils of senecio othonnae, s. racemosus, and s. nemorensis obtained by hydrodistillation of fresh flowers were analysed by gc-fid and gc-ms. a total of seventy-six compounds were identified, constituting over 83.1%, 97.7% and 86.8% of the total oil composition of the flowers of s. othonnae, s. racemosus, and s. nemorensis. the main components of the oils were caryophyllene oxide (18.6%), (e)-beta-farnesene (21.6%), and gamma-curcumene (42.8%), respectively. sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were the main group of constituents of all three species, forming 34.6%, 73.2%, and 81.8% of the oils, respectively. the oils of s. othonnae, and s. nemorensis showed antimicrobial activity against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and candida tropicalis, but that of s. racemosus was only active against candida tropicalis.
chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of kefe cumin (laser trilobum l.) fruits from different regions.
structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of kefe cumin (laser trilobum l.) obtained from different regions (germany, india, and turkey). the main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. it was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. the highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from germany and india was higher than that of kefe cumin fruits obtained from turkey. the fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris (fmc 1), proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus (fmc 19), aeromonas hydrophila (atcc 7965), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 15753), klebsiella pneumoniae (fmc 5), salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes (ccm 2531) and escherichia coli (atcc 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.
assay of enterocin as-48 for inhibition of foodborne pathogens in desserts.
enterocin as-48 was tested against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and listeria monocytogenes in different kinds of desserts. the highest activity against s. aureus was detected in baker cream. however, in yogurt-type soy-based desserts and in gelatin pudding, as-48 (175 arbitrary units [au]/g) reduced viable cell counts of s. aureus by only 1.5 to 1.8 log units at most. the efficacy of as-48 in puddings greatly depended on inoculum size, and viable s. aureus counts decreased below detection levels within 24 h for inocula lower than 4 to 5.5 log cfu/g. for l. monocytogenes, bacteriocin concentrations of 52.5 to 87.5 au/g reduced viable counts below detection levels and avoided regrowth of survivors. the lowest activity was detected in yogurt-type desserts. for b. cereus, viable cell counts were reduced below detection levels for bacteriocin concentrations of 52.5 au/g in instant pudding without soy or by 175 au/g in the soy pudding. in gelatin pudding, as-48 (175 au/g) reduced viable cell counts of b. cereus below detection levels after 8 h at 10 degrees c or after 48 h at 22 degrees c. bacteriocin addition also inhibited gelatin liquefaction caused by the proteolytic activity of b. cereus.
antiplasmid activity of 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate from alpinia galanga against multi-drug resistant bacteria.
ethnopharmacological relevance: alpinia galanga (l.) swartz is traditionally used in the treatment of various ailments across india, china, and southeast asian countries. in india it is a reputed drug in indigenous system of medicine and largely used as antibacterial and antiseptic. in southern india the rhizomes has been used as a domestic remedy against bacterial infections. aim of the study: to identify a potential antiplasmid compound from alpinia galanga against multi-drug resistant bacteria. materials and methods: the crude rhizome extract of alpinia galanga was prepared in acetone. antibacterial activity was checked by mic and antiplasmid activity was checked by sic. the principal compound responsible for the antiplasmid activity, in the crude extract, was identified by bioassay guided fractionation using hexane-acetone. antibiotic resistance profile of plasmid harboring strains and plasmid cured strains was determined by disc diffusion method. results: the crude acetone extract of the rhizomes of alpinia galanga exhibited antiplasmid activity against salmonella typhi, escherichia coli and vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis with an efficiency of 92%, 82% and 8% respectively at 400 microg/ml sic. the principal compound responsible for the activity was identified as 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate. 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate demonstrated the ability to cure plasmid encoded antibiotic resistance in various multi-drug resistant bacterial strains of clinical isolates such as enterococcus faecalis, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and bacillus cereus with curing efficiency of 66%, 75%, 70%, 32% and 6% respectively at sic of 400-800 microg/ml. conclusion: 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate mediated r-plasmid curing significantly reduced the minimal inhibitory concentration of antibiotics required to inhibit growth of bacteria, thus making the antibiotic treatment more effective.
antibacterial protection by enterocin as-48 in sport and energy drinks with less  acidic ph values.
the low ph and acid content found in sports and energy drinks are a matter of concern in dental health. raising the ph may solve this problem, but at the same time increase the risks of spoilage or presence of pathogenic bacteria. in the present study, commercial energy drinks were adjusted to ph 5.0 and challenged with listeria monocytogenes (drinks a to f), staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and bacillus licheniformis (drink a) during storage at 37 degrees c. l. monocytogenes was able to grow in drink a and survived in drinks d and f for at least 2 days. addition of enterocin as-48 (1 microg/ml final concentration) rapidly inactivated l. monocytogenes in all drinks tested. s. aureus and b. cereus also survived quite well in drink a, and were completely inactivated by 12.5 microg/ml enterocin as-48 after 2 days of storage or by 25 microg/ml bacteriocin after 1 day. b. licheniformis was able to multiply in drink a, but it was completely inactivated by 5 microg/ml enterocin as-48 after 2 days of storage or by 12.5 microg/ml bacteriocin after 1 day. results from the present study suggest that enterocin as-48 could be used as a natural preservative against these target bacteria in less acidic sport and energy drinks.
mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
inhibition of bacillus cereus and bacillus weihenstephanensis in raw vegetables by application of washing solutions containing enterocin as-48 alone and in combination with other antimicrobials.
enterocin as-48 is a broad-spectrum cyclic antimicrobial peptide produced by enterococcus faecalis. in the present study, the bacteriocin was tested alone and in combination with other antimicrobials for decontamination of bacillus inoculated on alfalfa, soybean sprouts and green asparagus. washing with enterocin as-48 solutions reduced viable cell counts of bacillus cereus and bacillus weihenstephanensis by 1.0-1.5 and by 1.5-2.38 log units right after application of treatment, respectively. in both cases, the bacteriocin was effective in reducing the remaining viable population below detection levels during further storage of the samples at 6 degrees c, but failed to prevent regrowth in samples stored at 15 or 22 degrees c. application of washing treatments containing enterocin as-48 in combination with several other antimicrobials and sanitizers (cinnamic and hydrocinnamic acids, carvacrol, polyphosphoric acid, peracetic acid, hexadecylpyridinium chloride and sodium hypochlorite) greatly enhanced the bactericidal effects. the combinations of as-48 and sodium hypochlorite, peracetic acid or hexadecylpyridinium chloride provided the best results. after application of the combined treatments on alfalfa sprouts contaminated with b. cereus or with b. weihenstephanensis, viable bacilli were not detected or remained at very low concentrations in the treated samples during a 1-week storage period at 15 degrees c. inhibition of b. cereus by in situ produced bacteriocin was tested by cocultivation with the as-48 producer strain e. faecalis a-48-32 inoculated on soybean sprouts. strain a-48-32 was able to grow and produce bacteriocin on sprouts both at 15 and 22 degrees c. at 15 degrees c, growth of b. cereus was completely inhibited in the cocultures, while a much more limited effect was observed at 22 degrees c. the results obtained for washing treatments are very encouraging for the application of enterocin as-48 in the decontamination of sprouts. application of washing treatments containing as-48 alone can serve to reduce viable cell counts of bacilli in samples stored under refrigeration, while application of combined treatments should be recommended to avoid proliferation of the surviving bacilli under temperature-abuse conditions.
succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a pcr-based approach.
the goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using pcr. in a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, pcr enabled detection of leuconostoc and lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. subsequently, lactobacillus and pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. pcr also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin a producers and accounted for the lab succession in the fermenting samples. a total of 328 lab isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which pcr could identify an overwhelming 186 lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 pediococcus and 29 leuconostoc isolates, respectively. based on antimicrobial assay against target strain leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b640, 28% of the lab were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin a and mesentericin producers. the bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of gram-positive target lab strains and pathogenic bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus.
efficacy of enterocin as-48 against bacilli in ready-to-eat vegetable soups and purees.
the broad-spectrum bacteriocin enterocin as-48 was tested for biopreservation of  ready-to-eat vegetable foods (soups and purees) against aerobic mesophilic endospore-forming bacteria. by adding as-48 (10 microg/ml), bacillus cereus lwl1 was completely inhibited in all six vegetable products tested (natural vegetable cream, asparagus cream, traditional soup, homemade-style traditional soup, vegetable soup, and vichyssoise) for up to 30 days at 6, 15, and 22 degrees c. a collection of strains isolated from spoiled purees showed slightly higher resistance to as-48 in the order paenibacillus sp. > bacillus macroides > b. cereus, although they were also completely inhibited in natural vegetable cream by as-48 at 10 microg/ml. however, cocktails of five or eight strains composed of b. cereus (three strains), b. macroides (two strains), and paenibacillus sp., paenibacillus polymyxa, and paenibacillus amylolyticus showed higher bacteriocin resistance with as-48 of up to 50 microg/ml required for complete inactivation in natural vegetable cream stored at 22 degrees c. repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) analysis showed that paenibacilli (along with some b. cereus) was the predominant survivor in the cocktails after bacteriocin treatment. to increase the effectiveness of enterocin as-48, the bacteriocin was tested (at 20 microg/ml) against the eight-strain cocktail in natural vegetable cream in combination with other antimicrobials. the combination of as-48 and nisin had a slight but significant additive effect. bactericidal activity was greatly enhanced by phenolic compounds (carvacrol, eugenol, geraniol, and hydrocinnamic acid), achieving a rapid and complete inactivation of bacilli in the tested puree at 22 degrees c.
evaluation of the hygienic quality and associated public health hazards of raw milk marketed by smallholder dairy producers in the dar es salaam region, tanzania.
a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (msps) in dar es salaam region. total bacterial count (tbc) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the california mastitis test (cmt) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. moreover, a water sample at each msp was taken for bacteriological culturing. finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the msps to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. a total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in dar es salaam region. the mean tbc was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were escherichia coli (6.3%), bacillus cereus (6.3%), staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) and streptococcus agalactiae (6.3%), enterobacter aerogenes (5.6%) and enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). in most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. of milk samples, 79.0% were positive to the cmt and 7.0% were positive for antimicrobial residues. tbc was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of tbc were identified by fitting two linear regression models. in a random effect model, water microbial quality, frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the mean log tbc. in a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with log tbc. it was concluded that the milk sold in dar es salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.
genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in enterococcus isolates from batzos, a raw goat milk cheese.
this study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as enterococcus durans. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling and pfge were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. species recognition by means of rapd-pcr was in agreement with the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. one strain was characterized as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by rapd-pcr and four strains were grouped with the enterococcus faecium reference strain. all strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. all strains exhibited antagonistic activity against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited enterococcus faecalis. isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. however, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.
inhibition of toxicogenic bacillus cereus in rice-based foods by enterocin as-48.
the antimicrobial effect of the broad-spectrum bacteriocin enterocin as-48 against the toxicogenic psychrotrophic strain bacillus cereus lwl1 has been investigated in a model food system consisting of boiled rice and in a commercial infant rice-based gruel dissolved in whole milk stored at temperatures of 37 degrees c, 15 degrees c and 6 degrees c. in food samples supplemented with enterocin as-48 (in a concentration range of 20-35 mug/ml), viable cell counts decreased rapidly over incubation time, depending on the bacteriocin concentration, the temperature of incubation and the food sample. enterotoxin production at 37 degrees c was also inhibited. heat sensitivity of endospores increased markedly in food samples supplemented with enterocin as-48: inactivation of endospores was achieved by heating for 1 min at 90 degrees c in boiled rice or at 95 degrees c in rice-based gruel. activity of enterocin as-48 in rice gruel was potentiated by sodium lactate in a concentration-dependent way.
purification of bovine milk lactoperoxidase and investigation of antibacterial properties at different thiocyanate mediated.
bovine lactoperoxidase (lpo) was purified with amberlite cg 50 h+ resin, cm sephadex c-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and sephadex g-100 gel filtration chromatography from skim milk. the activity of lactoperoxidase was measured by using 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (abts) as a choromogenic substrate at ph 6.0. purification degree for the purified enzyme was controlled with sds-page and rz value (a412/a280). rz value for the purified lpo was 0.8. km value at ph 6.0 at 20 degrees c for the lpo was 0.20 mm. vmax value was 7.87 micromol/ml min at ph 6.0 at 20 degrees c. bovine lpo showed high antibacterial activity in 100 mm thiocyanate--100 mm h2o2 medium for some pathogenic bacteria, such as aeromonas hydrophila atcc 7966, micrococcus luteus la 2971, mycobacterium smegmatis rut, bacillus subtilis img 22, pseudomonas pyocyanea, bacillus subtilis var. niger atcc 10, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, enterococcus faecalis atcc 15753, bacillus brevis fmc3, klebsiella pneumoniae fmc 5, corynebacterium xerosis uc 9165, bacillus cereus eu, bacillus megaterium nrs, yersinia enterocolytica, listeria monocytogenes scoot a, bacillus megaterium eu, bacillus megaterium dsm32, klebsiella oxytocica, staphylococcus aerogenes, streptococcus faecalis, mycobacterium smegmatis ccm 2067 and compared with well known antibacterial substances such as penicilline, ampicilline, amoxicillin-clavulanate and ceftriaxon. the lpo--100 mm thiocyanate--100 mm h2o2 system was purposed as an effective agent against many of the diseases causing organisms in human and animals.
characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
enterocin as-48rj: a variant of enterocin as-48 chromosomally encoded by enterococcus faecium rj16 isolated from food.
the bacteriocinogenic strain rj16 isolated from goat cheese has been identified as enterococcusfaecium by species-specific pcr, dna-rrna hybridization and rdna sequencing. purified bacteriocin from strain rj16 is a carboxypeptidase a-resistant peptide with a molecular mass (7125 da) very close to the cyclic peptide enterocin as-48. bacteriocin from strain rj16 and as-48 show identical antibacterial spectra, although the former is slightly less active on strains of listeria monocytogenes and bacillus cereus. producer strains show cross-immunity. pcr amplification of total dna from strain rj16 with primers for the as-48 structural gene and sequencing of the amplified fragment revealed an almost identical sequence (99.5%), except for a single mutation that predicts the change of glu residue at position 20 of as-48 to val. therefore, bacteriocin produced by e. faecium rj16 should be considered a variant of as-48, which we call as-48rj. pcr amplification revealed that strain rj16 contains the complete as-48. gene cluster. hybridization with probes for as-48 gene cluster revealed a chromosomal location of as-48 genes in strain rj16, being the first example of a chromosomal location of this bacteriocin trait. strain rj16 produced enzymes of interest in food processing (esterase, esterase lipase and phytase activities), and did not decarboxylate amino acids precursors for biogenic amines. strain rj16 did not exhibit haemolytic or gelatinase activities, and pcr amplification revealed the lack of genes encoding for known virulence determinants (aggregation substance, collagen adhesin, enterococcal surface protein, endocarditis antigens, as well as haemolysin and gelatinase production). strain rj16 was resistant to ciprofloxacin (mic > 2 mgl(-1)) and levofloxacin (mic > 4 mgl(-1)) and showed intermediate resistance to nitrofurantoin and erythromycin, but was sensitive to ampicillin, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, rifampicin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin, vancomycin and teicoplanin. altogether, results from this study suggest that this broad-spectrum bacteriocin-producing strain may have a potential use in food preservation.
biocontrol of psychrotrophic enterotoxigenic bacillus cereus in a nonfat hard cheese by an enterococcal strain-producing enterocin as-48.
bacillus cereus is a food poisoning bacterium of great concern, especially in milk products. in this study, we describe the efficient control of the psychrotrophic and toxigenic strain b. cereus lwl1 in milk and in a nonfat hard cow's cheese by the enterocin as-48 producer strain enterococcus faecalis a-48-32 (bac+). no viable b. cereus cells were detected after 72 h incubation in milk coinoculated with the as-48-producing strain and b. cereus. diarrheic toxin production was also markedly inhibited by the bac+ strain to eightfold lower levels compared with control cultures of b. cereus. in cheeses manufactured by inoculation with a commercial starter (about 6.8 log cfu/ml) and b. cereus (about 4 log cfu/ml), the latter reached 6.27 log cfu/g after 5 days of maturation, and approximately 8 log cfu/g after 15 days. however, in cheeses made from milk inoculated with the starter along with a mixture of e. faecalis-b. cereus (2/1 ratio), counts of b. cereus decreased by approximately 1.0, 2.0, 4.32, and 5.6 log units with respect to control cheeses after 5, 10, 15, and 30 days of ripening, respectively. growth of e. faecalis a-48-32 was associated with enterocin as-48 production and persistence in cheese. interestingly, growth of starter cultures was not affected by the bac+ strain, and neither was lactic acid production. these results clearly indicate that e. faecalis a-48-32 produced satisfactory amounts of bacteriocin in cheese and support the potential use of as-48-producing strains as culture adjuncts to inhibit b. cereus during cheese manufacture and ripening.
antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts and flavonoids from eucalyptus maculata.
aims: we investigated the antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts to find effective antibacterial agents. methods and results: the antimicrobial activities of leaf extracts from 26 species of eucalyptus were measured. extracts of eucalyptus globulus, e. maculata and e. viminalis significantly inhibited the growth of six gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, propionibacterium acnes), and of a fungus (trichophyton mentagrophytes), but they did not show strong antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida). 2',6'-dihydroxy-3'-methyl-4'-methoxy-dihydrochalcone, eucalyptin and 8-desmethyl-eucalyptin, isolated from e. maculata extracts, exhibited potent antimicrobial activities against seven micro-organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.0 to 31 mg l(-1). conclusions: the eucalyptus extracts and three compounds from e. maculata were found to be effective against micro-organisms that cause food poisoning, acne and athlete's foot. significance and impact of the study: this study shows potential uses of extracts from e. globulus, e. maculata and e. viminalis, and antimicrobial compounds isolated from e. maculata.
sensitization of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to jenseniin g by sublethal injury.
jenseniin g, a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium thoenii p126, is active  against related propionibacteria and some lactic acid bacteria and is sporostatic to botulinal spores. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sublethal stress on jenseniin g activity. bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica were subjected to temperature, acid, and osmotic stresses in the presence of jenseniin g. the bacteriocin reduced the viability of sublethally injured cultures, although the extent of reduction varied with strain and treatment. e. faecalis was the most sensitive to temperature stress; no reduction of viable counts occurred in the absence of jenseniin g, and a 1.5-log reduction occurred in the presence of jenseniin g. b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. aureus were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to heat stress than when exposed to cold stress, whereas e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and s. flexneri were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to cold stress than when exposed to heat stress. when comparing an acid stress test alone to a combination of acid stress and jenseniin g, e. faecalis and l. monocytogenes showed the greatest sensitivities with 4.87- and 2.82-log reductions, respectively, after 7 days. all cultures except for s. aureus were adversely affected by the combination of salt stress and jenseniin g. salmonella typhimurium showed the greatest sensitivity to salt stress with jenseniin g (a 1.54-log reduction at day 7) when compared to salt stress alone (a 0.55-log reduction at day 7). jenseniin g, like bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive species, has broader activity against stressed organisms.
chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of lantana  xenica.
the aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. the oil from the aerial parts of lantana xenica mold. (verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. the major constituent of the oil was (e)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene d (6.6 %). the antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of l. xenica inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus and proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (e)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus showed a lower inhibition. the bacteria micrococcus luteus, klebsiella sp., escherichia coli and the yeast candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (e)-caryophyllene.
inhibition of bacterial growth, enterotoxin production, and spore outgrowth in strains of bacillus cereus by bacteriocin as-48.
bacteriocin as-48 showed high bactericidal activity for mesophilic and psychrotrophic strains of bacillus cereus over a broad ph range. as-48 inhibition of the enterotoxin-producing strain lwl1 was enhanced by sodium nitrite, sodium lactate, and sodium chloride. the latter also enhanced as-48 activity against strain cect 131. bacterial growth and enterotoxin production by strain lwl1 were completely inhibited at bacteriocin concentrations of 7.5 microg/ml. at subinhibitory bacteriocin concentrations, enterotoxin production decreased markedly and sporulation was delayed. intact spores were resistant to as-48 but became gradually sensitive to as-48 during the course of germination.
antibacterial activity of traditional australian medicinal plants.
fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional australian aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) and four gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. in a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. b. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. extracts from the leaves of eremophila species (myoporaceae) were the most active, with eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against gram-positive bacteria). the antibacterial effects of e. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for b. cereus, e. faecalis and s. aureus and 2 h for s. pyogenes.
uptake kinetics of nucleic acid targeting dyes in s. aureus, e. faecalis and b. cereus: a flow cytometric study.
for flow cytometry-based detection as well as susceptibility testing and counting, staining of the bacterial cells is essential. in an attempt to develop rapid preparatory procedures for nucleic acid staining of wild type gram positive bacteria, the uptake of fluorescent dyes in viable s. aureus, e. faecalis, and b. cereus cells was studied by flow cytometry under conditions intended to block probe efflux and increase cell wall permeability. the aim of the study was to develop procedures which allow rapid nucleic acid staining independent of fixation, since ethanol fixation is time-consuming and may mask phenomena associated with viability and lead to uncontrolled loss and aggregation of cells. the dye uptake was measured repeatedly after treating cells with metabolic inhibitors in order to block probe efflux, or cold shock (0 degree c) to increase permeability. the probes used were mithramycin (mi), ethidium bromide (eb), dapi, hoechst 33342 and hoechst 33258. none of the procedures facilitated uptake of the dyes to a level similar to that obtained in fixed control cells in all of the species. after metabolic inhibition of b. cereus cells, dapi and hoechst fluorescence increased to a level similar to or above that found in fixed cells, indicating that the uptake of these dyes is limited by energy-dependent efflux. a similar increase of dapi fluorescence was observed after cold shock suggesting the uptake of this dye to be limited also by permeability in b. cereus. the mi and eb fluorescence increased to the level of the fixed control cells under all conditions tested, suggesting free probe influx in this species. generally, probe uptake in s. aureus and e. faecalis was lower than in b. cereus cells, and no permeabilizing effect of cold shock was observed. in some experiments the fluorescence exceeded that of ethanol fixed control cells, indicating that the fixation may cause conformational changes in dna.
isolation, purification and partial characterization of plantaricin 423, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum.
lactobacillus plantarum 423, isolated from sorghum beer, produces a bacteriocin (plantaricin 423) which is inhibitory to several food spoilage bacteria and food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, clostridium sporogenes, enterococcus faecalis, listeria spp. and staphylococcus spp. plantaricin 423 is resistant to treatment at 80 degrees c, but loses 50% of its activity after 60 min at 100 degrees c and 75% of its activity after autoclaving (121 degrees c, 15 min). plantaricin 423 remains active after incubation at ph 1-10 and is inactivated when treated with pepsin, papain, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and proteinase k. plantaricin 423 was partially purified and its size estimated at 3.5 kda, as determined by tricine-sds-page. the mechanism of activity of plantaricin 423 is weakly bactericidal, as determined against oenococcus oeni (previously leuconostoc oenos). high dna homology was obtained between the plasmid dna of strain 423 and the pediocin pa-1 operon of pediococcus acidilactici pac 1.0, suggesting that plantaricin 423 is plasmid-encoded and related to the pediocin gene cluster.
in-vitro photobactericidal activity of aminoacridines.
the toxicities of several aminoacridines were measured against pathogenic strains of both gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) organisms. in several cases, illumination at a light dose of 6.3 j/cm2 resulted in considerable decreases in the minimum lethal drug concentrations required, giving up to 50-fold increases in bactericidal activity. derivatives of 9-aminoacridine (aminacrine) exhibited phototoxicity against one or more of the test organisms, but the established photosensitizing acridines proflavine and acridine orange were photobactericidal against all strains.
antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli: preliminary characterization and optimization of production of acidocin b, a novel bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus m46.
approximately 1000 lactobacillus strains were isolated and screened for the production of antimicrobial activity, using a target panel of spoilage organisms and pathogens. only eight positive strains were found; two of these were studied in more detail. lactobacillus salivarius m7 produces the new broad spectrum bacteriocin salivaricin b which inhibits the growth of listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, brochothrix thermosphacta, enterococcus faecalis and many lactobacilli. a new atypical bacteriocin produced by lact. acidophilus m46, acidocin b, combines the inhibition of clostridium sporogenes with a very narrow activity spectrum within the genus lactobacillus and was selected for further characterization. acidocin b is sensitive to trypsin, heat-stable (80 degrees c for 20 min) and can be extracted from the culture supernatant fluid with butanol. native acidocin b occurs as a large molecular weight complex (100 kda), while with sds-page the partly purified activity migrates as a peptide of 2.4 kda. optimization of the cultivation conditions resulted in an eightfold increase of the amount of acidocin b produced during growth. growth is not necessary for acidocin b production; washed producer cells can synthesize the bacteriocin in a chemically defined production medium. the application potential of acidocin b is discussed.
effects of local anesthetics on bacterial cells.
the membrane effects of chlorpromazine, nupercain, tetracain, and procain were studied using bacillus cereus, b. megaterium, b. subtilis, and streptococcus faecalis, protoplasts from s. faecalis, and isolated membranes from b. subtilis. chlorpromazin, nupercain, and tetracain produced characteristic micromorphological alterations after treatment for 5 to 30 min at ph 7.0 and 20 degrees c; the membrane staining pattern changed from asymmetric to symmetric, complex mesosome-like structures appeared, and membrane fractures and solubilization occurred. procain at concentrations up to 100 mm did not induce detectable alterations. protoplasts were quickly lysed by 10 mm tetracain. a rapid and extensive leakage of k+ was induced by chlorpromazin, nupercain, and tetracain. procain (100 mm) induced a slight k+ leakage. the membrane respiratory activity of intact b. cereus cells (as measured by the triphenyl tetrazolium reduction) and the succinic dehydrogenase activity of b. subtilis isolated membranes were found to be inhibited by the four local anesthetics. the concentrations that produced 50% inhibition of those activities are correlated with the hydrophobicities of the anesthetic molecules.
characteristics of a bacteriocin derived from streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes antagonistic to diplococcus peumoniae.
a bacteriocin-producing strain of streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes (e-1) was isolated from clinical material (conjunctiva). the active substance differed from bacteriocins described by other investigators primarily in its spectrum of antibacterial activity, especially by its marked inhibition of diplococcus pneumoniae. the e-1 bacteriocin also inhibited nonhemolytic strains of enterococci as well as one-third of the viridans group of streptococcal strains investigated. the degree of inhibition, however, as indicated by the size of the zones against the latter organisms, was significantly reduced. no activity was detected against any of the strains belonging to the following groups of bacteria: hemolytic enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, nonhemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, and various gram-negative species. similarly, three strains each of bacillus cereus and listeria monocytogenes and one strain of erysipelothrix insidiosa were not inhibited. the bacteriocin was able to diffuse through bacterial membranes as well as cellulose dialyzer tubing. it was inactivated by heating to 80 c for 20 min but resisted inactivation by either trypsin or chloroform.
