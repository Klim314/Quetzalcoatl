TI  == differences in the phagocytosis of four bacteria by channel catfish neutrophils.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to compare the phagocytosis of aeromonas hydrophila, edwardsiella ictaluri, edwardsiella tarda and micrococcus luteus by channel catfish neutrophils. various aspects of opsonization effect and bactericidal ability of channel catfish neutrophils were investigated. percent phagocytosis ranged from a low of 1% to a high of 91%. the highest percent phagocytosis and phagocytic indices routinely occurred with normal serum and were highest for m. luteus (91.78%, 55.25) and a. hydrophila (87.52%, 43.60). in all cases, the percent phagocytosis and phagocytic index was lowest in assays without serum. channel catfish neutrophils displayed a bactericidal/static ability for each bacterium tested except e. tarda. neutrophils exhibited a greater inhibitory capacity for a. hydrophila and m. luteus than for the other bacteria when in the  presence of normal or inactivated catfish serum.
