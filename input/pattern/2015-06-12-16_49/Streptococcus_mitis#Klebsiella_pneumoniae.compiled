TI  - Clinical and microbiological differences between pyriform sinus fistulae in pediatric and non-pediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review our 15-year experience with pyriform sinus fistula (PSF) in  a single institution for a better understanding of the disease, pertaining especially to symptom onset at different ages. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for all 21 PSF patients presenting between 1998 and 2012. Patients were then divided into pediatric (</= 15 years old) and non-pediatric (>15 years old) groups according to the age at symptom onset. Clinical and microbiological features of both groups were compared. RESULTS: There were 12 (57.1%) pediatric and 9 (42.9%) non-pediatric patients. It took an average of 13.1 months for the diagnosis of PSF to be confirmed in pediatric patients from the time of symptom onset, whereas the same interval was only 0.7 month in the non-pediatric group. The sensitivity of computed tomography was more than 90% in both age groups, whereas that of barium esophagography was higher in non-pediatric (50.0%) than in pediatric (28.6%) patients. Recurrence occurred after initial treatment in only three patients, all of whom were in the pediatric age group. Bacteriological studies showed that Streptococcus mitis was the most common species isolated from pediatric patients, while Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common pathogen in the non-pediatric group. CONCLUSION: Non-pediatric PSF with late onset of symptoms is more common than expected or reported in the literature so far. This form of PSF present different clinical and microbiological characteristics compared to pediatric PSF. Therefore, diagnostic and therapeutic counseling for PSF should be tailored according to the age of symptom onset.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in meconium of preterm neonates and evolution of their fecal  microbiota during the first month of life.
AB  - The establishment and succession of bacterial communities in infants may have a profound impact in their health, but information about the composition of meconium microbiota and its evolution in hospitalized preterm infants is scarce. In this context, the objective of this work was to characterize the microbiota of meconium and fecal samples obtained during the first 3 weeks of life from 14 donors using culture and molecular techniques, including DGGE and the Human Intestinal Tract Chip (HITChip) analysis of 16S rRNA amplicons. Culture techniques offer a quantification of cultivable bacteria and allow further study of the isolate, while molecular techniques provide deeper information on bacterial diversity. Culture and HITChip results were very similar but the former showed lower sensitivity. Inter-individual differences were detected in the microbiota profiles although the meconium microbiota was peculiar and distinct from that of fecal samples. Bacilli and other Firmicutes were the main bacteria groups detected in meconium while Proteobacteria dominated in the fecal samples. Culture technique showed that Staphylococcus predominated in meconium and that Enterococcus, together with Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Escherichia fergusonii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens, was more abundant in fecal samples. In addition, HITChip results showed the prevalence of bacteria related to Lactobacillus plantarum and Streptococcus mitis in meconium samples whereas those related to Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Yersinia predominated in the 3(rd) week feces. This study highlights that spontaneously-released meconium of preterm neonates contains a specific microbiota that differs from that of feces obtained after the first week of life. Our findings indicate that the presence of Serratia was strongly associated with a higher degree of immaturity and other hospital-related parameters, including antibiotherapy and mechanical ventilation.
TI  - [Vitreal surgery and etiological diagnosis of bacterial endophthalmitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effects of vitreal surgery and the importance of etiological diagnosis in the treatment for bacterial endophthalmitis. METHODS: Retrospective series case study. 20 cases (20 eyes) of bacterial endophthalmitis that were treated in Peking Union Hospital were enrolled. 14 eyes were post-traumatic endophthalmitis, and 6 eyes were postoperative endophthalmitis. Twenty cases of aged 3 to 83 years [mean (40.5 +/- 23.9) years] were enrolled, including 12 male and 8 female patients. Pre-operative visual acuity: 2 cases were able to count fingers, 6 cases were able to perform hand movement, 11 cases had light perception, light projection were uncertain in all cases, and there was no light perception in 1 case. Hypopyon was seen in 13 eyes. Severe anterior chamber inflammatory reaction was seen in the other 7 eyes. The fundus could not be observed in all 20 eyes. B-Scan ultrasound examination indicated that all 20 eyes displayed moderate to severe vitreous opacity; proliferation and organization were apparent in 12 eyes, and retinal detachment in 2 eyes. Vitrectomy and intravitreal injection of antibiotics were performed in 18 eyes, and only intravitreal injection of antibiotics was administered in the other 2 eyes. At the beginning of operation, vitreous fluids were smeared and Gram stained. To eyes that showed a positive result in Gram staining, 1 mg of Vancomycin was injected into the vitreous cavity or added in the perfusion fluid (balanced salt solution, BSS) in the eyes. To eyes that showed a negative result in Gram staining, 2 mg or 4 mg of Ceftazidime was injected into the vitreous cavity or added in the perfusion fluid (BSS) in the eyes, respectively. Additionally, we examined the vitreous specimens and performed drug susceptibility testing of the bacteria cultured from the specimens. The antibiotics that the bacteria were susceptible to were chosen according to the drug sensitivity tests. The follow-up period is from 1 to 102 months (average 16.6 months). RESULTS: Thirteen eyes presented with a positive Gram staining result, and 3 eyes presented a negative result; the other 4 eyes were not infected. Bacteria were cultured in 15 eyes. The detection rate of pathogen was 75%. The result for 11 eyes was consistent with the smear results. The bacteria detected were Staphylococcus aureus in 3 eyes, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 eyes, and Bacillus spp in 2 eyes. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Plesiomonas, Pseudomonas cepacia, Klebsiella oxytoca, Loffi Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas fluorescens were detected in 1 eye. The remaining 5 eyes did not have bacterial growth. The intraocular infection of all 20 eyes was controlled, and the intraocular inflammation was relieved. The visual acuity was significantly elevated. Postoperative visual acuity achieved were >/= 0.3 in 4 eyes, 0.1 to 0.2 in 4 eyes, 0.02 to 0.09 in 6 eyes, CF in 2 eyes, HM in 3 eyes and LP in 1 eye. The retinas of 17 eyes were normal, but recurrent retinal detachment occurred in the other 3 eyes, postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Vitrectomy combined with antibiotics and intravitreal injection of antibiotics were an effective treatment of bacterial endophthalmitis. We obtained the vitreous fluid smears at the beginning of surgery to quickly and accurately obtain etiological diagnoses by Gram staining. It is crucial to use etiological diagnosis to choose the susceptible antibiotics.
TI  - [Etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia in children].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) in children. METHOD: A retrospective hospital infection study was performed in 52,639 children admitted to our hospital from January 2005 to December 2008. RESULT: Six hundred and ninety eight patients were diagnosed as HAP. The incidence of HAP was 1.33%, among which, 108 (15.47%) cases were early-onset HAP and 590 (84.53%) were late-onset HAP. The HAP patients aged 3 days to 15 years (503 male and 195 female). The proportion of patients younger than 1 year was 51.4%. Main underlying diseases were cytomegalovirus hepatitis, congenital heart disease, malignant tumor, granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis, prematurity and low birth weight. There was significant difference in the incidences among different departments with the highest one seen in ICU, followed by departments of infectious diseases, hematology and digestive diseases. Two hundred and thirty one stains of pathogens were identified from sputum of 355 cases. One hundred and fifty six (67.5%) strains were Gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. There were 30 (13.0%) Gram-positive bacterial strains, and 29 (12.6%) respiratory tract virus strains, and 15 (6.5%) fungal strains, and 1 (0.4%) mycoplasma strain. The predominant bacterial pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. The isolation rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were 94.8% and 85.7%, respectively. Those two bacteria were universally resistant to the third and forth generations cephalosporins. The main pathogens of early-onset HAP were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, while the main pathogens of late-onset HAP were ESBLs-positive Klebsiella pneumonia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: HAP in children is most common in children younger than 1 year and with underlying diseases. The main pathogens are Gram-negative bacteria. RSV was an important pathogen of HAP. The pathogens of early-onset HAP are different from those of late-onset HAP. These results may be of some help in prevention and control of HAP in children and in guiding for rational application of antibiotics, especially the empirical antibiotic choice.
TI  - Etiology and outcome of community-acquired lung abscess.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anaerobes are the first and Streptococcus species the second most common cause of community-acquired lung abscess (CALA) in the West. The etiologic pathogens of this disease have changed in Taiwan, with Klebsiella pneumoniae being reported as the most common cause of CALA. OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiologies of community-acquired lung abscess. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 205 Japanese adult patients with CALA to evaluate etiologies and outcomes. We used not only traditional microbiological investigations but also percutaneous ultrasonography-guided transthoracic needle aspiration and protected specimen brushes. RESULTS: Of these 205 patients, 122 had documented bacteriological results, with 189 bacterial species isolated. Pure aerobic, mixed aerobic and anaerobic, and pure anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 90 (73.8%), 17 (13.9%), and 15 (12.3%) patients, respectively. The four most common etiologic pathogens were Streptococcus species (59.8%), anaerobes (26.2%), Gemella species (9.8%), and K. pneumoniae (8.2%). Streptococcus mitis was the most common among the Streptococcus species. Mean duration of antibiotic administration was 26 days. Six patients (2.9%, 3 with actinomycosis and 3 with nocardiosis) were treated with antibiotics for 76-189 days. Two patients with anaerobic lung abscess died. CONCLUSIONS: The first and second most common etiologic pathogens of CALA in our hospital were Streptococcus species and anaerobes, respectively. The etiologies in our study differ from those in Taiwan and are similar to those in the West with the exception that Streptococcus species were the most common etiologic pathogens in our study whereas anaerobes are the most frequent etiologic pathogens in Western countries. S. mitis and Gemella species are important etiologic pathogens as well. The identification of Actinomyces and Nocardia is important in order to define the adequate duration of antibiotic administration.
TI  - Risk of bacteremia in bleeding and nonbleeding gastric varices after endoscopic injection of cyanoacrylate.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: Bacteremia is common in cirrhosis with gastrointestinal bleeding, including variceal bleeding. Elective esophageal sclerotherapy and banding have been reported to cause bacteremia. The risk associated with therapeutic endoscopy in patients with gastric varices has not yet been reported. This study was conducted to compare the risk of bacteremia between patients with active gastric variceal bleeding and those with gastric varices that were not actively bleeding who underwent N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate injection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were categorized into three groups: group I, patients with bleeding gastric varices who underwent cyanoacrylate injection for hemostasis (n = 20); group II, patients who underwent elective cyanoacrylate injection for further obliteration of gastric varices (n = 18); and group III, patients with cirrhosis who underwent endoscopic surveillance for varices, and patients with gastric varices who presented for a follow-up endoscopy without a requirement for treatment (n = 17). Blood culture was obtained before and 5 minutes and 3 hours after endoscopy. Needle tips were also sent for culture. RESULTS: Before procedures, blood cultures were positive in 4 patients (20 %) from group I. The number of positive blood cultures in group I at 5 minutes and 3 hours after the procedure were 3 (15 %) and 2 (10 %) respectively. The identified organisms were: Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Escherichia coli (1), Vibrio cholerae non-O1 (1). No patient from group II had a positive culture at any point of blood drawn. Only one in group III had a positive culture, for Streptococcus mitis at 5 minutes. No clinical evidence of infections occurred in any patient. Needle-tip cultures grew mainly organisms from the oral and gastrointestinal tracts. CONCLUSIONS: Elective cyanoacrylate injection for nonbleeding gastric varices is not associated with significant bacteremia or infection. For this reason, prophylactic antibiotics may not be needed in this patient group. By contrast, prophylactic antibiotics are strongly recommended for patients with bleeding gastric varices undergoing cyanoacrylate injection.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - In-house validation of the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the FDA for the purpose of quality control (QC) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates: the BacT/ALERT blood culture system (bioMerieux) and the Pall eBDS (Pall Corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived PLTs. After the decision of the AABB to institute universal QC testing of PLT concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the performance of our current blood culture system, the BACTEC 9240, was carried out for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with PLT contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis PLT unit per organism. Four mL of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL was inoculated into blood culture bottles (Standard 10 Aerobic/F, Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Systems) and incubated in a BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. Positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to insure the identity of bacterial growth. RESULTS: With the exception of Streptococcus mitis, the BACTEC system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 CFUs per mL for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The limit of detection for the S. mitis test strain was 61 CFUs per mL. Detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. Ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis PLT products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. CONCLUSION: This study validates the use of the BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis PLTs in less than 24 hours.
TI  - Bacteremia in hematological and oncological children with febrile neutropenia: experience in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan.
AB  - A retrospective study of bacteremia in children with febrile neutropenia admitted to a medical center in Taiwan from January 1999 to December 1999 was performed. There were 190 episodes of febrile neutropenia during this period and 46 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 38 bacteremic episodes (7 mixed infections). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%), and Enterobacter cloacae (10.9%) were the most common isolates. Three of the 5 isolates of S. aureus were resistant to methicillin. Twenty-three episodes of bacteremia (four mixed infections) were associated with recent antibiotic use. Of the 23 bacteremic episodes with recent antibiotic use, P. aeruginosa (20%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (10%), K. pneumoniae (10%), Escherichia coli (10%), and E. cloacae (10%) were isolated most often. Relapsed leukemia (odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval 1.4-6.5) and recent antibiotic therapy (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7-7.7) were the independent risk factors of bacteremia. There were 9 mortality cases in patients with bacteremia, including 4 cases with mixed infections, and 5 cases with P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, S. aureus, and Streptococcus mitis, respectively. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were necessary in febrile neutropenic children because of the high percentage of mixed infection.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - The bacterial etiology of conjunctivitis in early infancy. Eye Prophylaxis Study  Group.
AB  - The authors conducted this study to determine the etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in early infancy. From 1985 to 1990, 630 infants enrolled in a randomized, controlled, double-masked study of eye prophylaxis were observed for 60 days after delivery for signs of conjunctivitis. The following isolates were categorized as pathogens: Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria cinerea, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Using conditional logistic regression for analysis of 97 infant pairs, the authors identified isolates categorized as pathogens almost exclusively among cases (odds ratio (OR) = 18.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-128). Among the microorganisms which have not usually been regarded as pathogens in the etiology of infant conjunctivitis, Streptococcus mitis was the only microorganism associated with an increased risk of conjunctivitis (OR = 5.3, 95% CI 1.8-15.0). The findings concerning the species of bacteria most often associated with conjunctivitis, as well as the finding that method of delivery is unimportant, suggest that bacteria were transmitted to the infants' eyes after birth and not from the birth canal.
TI  - Postsepsis bradycardia in children with leukemia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We observed sinus bradycardia in a small number of children with hematologic malignancies who were recovering from sepsis. Our objective was to define this symptom complex and attempt to delineate its etiology. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A pediatric ICU in a children's oncology hospital. PATIENTS: Children admitted to the ICU over a 24-month period who developed persistent bradycardia (heart rate less than 5% for age for greater than 1 hr) after an episode of sepsis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seven children developed postsepsis bradycardia. Six patients had a primary diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia and one patient had acute lymphocytic leukemia. All patients had positive blood cultures (Streptococcus mitis, n = 4; Escherichia coli, n = 2; and Klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 1). All seven children were clinically recovering from sepsis when the bradycardia developed. Neither hypotension nor other symptom was associated with the bradycardia. No therapy was given for the bradycardia. Echocardiograms and ECGs were normal in all patients, except for the presence of bradycardia. Bradycardia persisted for 24 to 72 hrs. After that time, heart rates slowly increased to the normal range for age. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that this syndrome may result from alterations in beta-adrenergic receptor function or an unidentified humoral factor produced by the invading organism or as part of the host's response to sepsis. Prior drug therapy or the underlying illness may predispose to this condition, since all the patients had acute leukemia. As the bradycardia was clinically insignificant, invasive therapeutic or diagnostic strategies were not indicated.
TI  - Rapid detection of Bordetella pertussis by a monoclonal antibody-based colony blot assay.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies to Bordetella pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used in a colony blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay designed for rapid detection of B. pertussis. Bacterial colonies from Bordet-Gengou agar plates were blotted onto nitrocellulose filter disks, lysed by immersion in chloroform, and reacted with monoclonal antibodies. Following reaction with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antisera and 4-chloro-1-naphthol, blue dots representing single colonies appeared on the filters. Blotting of single B. pertussis colonies could be performed after incubation for 40 h, i.e., before the colonies were visible by eye on the agar surface. Ten of ten B. pertussis strains showed positive blotting reactions with antibodies specific for B. pertussis FHA and LPS. Fourteen of fourteen B. parapertussis strains reacted with two of the FHA-specific antibodies but not with two of the LPS-specific antibodies. Strains of B. bronchiseptica showed a variable reaction pattern. No cross-reactions were observed with strains of Streptococcus mitis, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. This assay may be useful for identification of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis in suspected cases of whooping cough.
TI  - Prophylactic co-trimoxazole versus norfloxacin in neutropenic children--perspective randomized study.
AB  - Co-trimoxazole or norfloxacin were randomly administered to 44 granulocytopenic children with malignancies in order to prevent bacterial infections. Although more patients in the co-trimoxazole group had febrile episodes (p less than 0.01), the mean of febrile days and the mean of days with systemic antibiotics did not differ significantly in the two groups. Five patients in the co-trimoxazole group had a microbiologically documented infection (four with septicemia) due to Escherichia coli (n = 2), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sp. There were four septicemic episodes in the norfloxacin group due to P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus faecalis. Compliance was good during administration of both drugs. No signs or symptoms of arthropathy were seen in the norfloxacin group. The number of gram-negative bacilli resistant to co-trimoxazole isolated from stools significantly increased during prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (p less than 0.001). Norfloxacin did not select resistant strains and was very active in eradicating gram-negative bacilli from stools (27.5% of positive cultures).
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - Increased bactericidal activity of dilute preparations of povidone-iodine solutions.
AB  - Recent confirmation of intrinsic bacterial contamination of 10% povidone-iodine solution has raised questions regarding the bactericidal mechanism of iodophors and the possibility for survival of vegetative bacterial cells in iodophor solutions. In this laboratory investigation, five different species were exposed to various dilutions of three commercial preparations of 10% povidone-iodine solution; survival was assessed after exposure for time periods varying between 0 and 8 min. All brands of povidone-iodine solution tested demonstrated more rapid killing of Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium chelonei at dilutions of 1:2, 1:4, 1:10, 1:50, and 1:100 than did the stock solutions, S. aureus survived a 2-min exposure to full-strength povidone-iodine solution but did not survive a 15-s exposure to a 1:100 dilution of the iodophor. Both stock and dilute preparations of 10% povidone-iodine solution demonstrated rapid bactericidal action against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Streptococcus mitis.
