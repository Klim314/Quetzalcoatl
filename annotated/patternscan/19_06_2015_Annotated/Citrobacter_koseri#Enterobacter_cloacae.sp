TI  == in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  == pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the  family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus  or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.

TI  == supporting the ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam enterobacteriaceae breakpoint determination using humanised in vivo exposures in a thigh model.
AB  == previous in vivo studies using a human-simulated regimen of ceftaroline/avibactam 600/600mg every 8h (q8h) showed activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-, ampc- and kpc-producing enterobacteriaceae with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) </= 1 mug/ml. here we sought to determine the efficacy of this human-simulated regimen against organisms with mics >/= 1 mug/ml to help determine a breakpoint value that would reliability predict efficacy in humans. in total, 31 isolates (1 escherichia coli, 9 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 enterobacter cloacae, 1 citrobacter koseri, 2 serratia marcescens, 1 klebsiella oxytoca and 8 pseudomonas aeruginosa) with ceftaroline/avibactam mics of 1 to 16  mug/ml were tested in a murine immunocompromised thigh infection model; 15 isolates were also tested in an immunocompetent model. doses were given to simulate human free drug exposures of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h over 24h as a 1-h infusion by targeting the ft>mic profile. efficacy was evaluated as the change in log10 cfu compared with 0-h controls after 24h. reductions in bacterial cfu in the neutropenic model were seen against a majority of isolates tested with mics </= 4 mug/ml, where ft>mic was >55%. more variable efficacy was seen in isolates with mics >/= 8 mug/ml, where ft>mic drops below 40%. overall activity was enhanced in the immunocompetent model. the humanised regimen of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h as a 1-h infusion showed  predictable efficacy against isolates with various genotypic and phenotypic profiles and mics </= 4 mug/ml. these data provide valuable information to help determine a ceftaroline/avibactam breakpoint for enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == intraoperative vancomycin use in spinal surgery: single institution experience and microbial trends.
AB  == study design: retrospective case series. objective: to demonstrate the microbial  trends of spinal surgical site infections in patients who had previously received crystallized vancomycin in the operative bed. summary of background data: prior large, case control series demonstrate the significant decrease in surgical site  infection with the administration of vancomycin in the wound bed. methods: a single institution, electronic database search was conducted for all patients who underwent spinal surgery who had received prophylactic crystalline vancomycin powder in the wound bed. patients with a prior history of wound infection, intrathecal pumps, or spinal stimulators were excluded. results: a total of 981 consecutive patients (494 males, 487 females; mean age, 59.4 yr; range, 16-95 yr) were identified from january 2011 to june 2013. the average dose of vancomycin powder was 1.13 g (range, 1-6 g). sixty-six patients (6.71%) were diagnosed with  a surgical site infection, of which 51 patients had positive wound cultures (5.2%). of the 51 positive cultures, the most common organism was staphylococcus  aureus. the average dose of vancomycin was 1.3 g in the 38 cases where a gram-positive organism was cultured. a number of gram-negative infections were encountered such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter koseri, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the average dose of vancomycin was 1.2 g in 23 cases where a gram-negative infection was cultured. fifteen of the 51 positive cultures (29.4%) were polymicrobial. eight (53%) of these 15 polymicrobial cultures contained 3 or more distinct organisms. conclusion: prophylactic intraoperative vancomycin use in the wound bed in spinal surgery may increase the incidence of gram-negative or polymicrobial spinal infections. the use of intraoperative vancomycin may correlate with postoperative seromas, due to the high incidence of nonpositive cultures. large, randomized, prospective trials are needed to demonstrate causation and dose-response relationship.

TI  == intestinal enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli populations in japanese adults demonstrated by the reverse transcription-quantitative pcr and the clone library  analyses.
AB  == a primer set specific for escherichia coli/shigella 16s rrna was developed and used for rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 35 healthy adult volunteers in combination with the previously reported primer set specific for enterobacteriaceae. enterobacteriaceae and e. coli were present in the 29 out of  35 volunteers tested as intestinal commensals at the average population levels of 10(7.1+/-0.9) and 10(6.8+/-0.7)cellsg(-1) of stools (mean+/-standard deviation),  respectively. among the 7 volunteers, the significant deviation between the count of enterobacteriaceae and that of e. coli was observed, suggesting non-e. coli/shigella species were predominant in their enterobacteriaceae populations. the clone library analysis revealed that the non-e. coli/shigella populations included citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae/variicola and morganella morganii. these data suggested that the rt-qpcr method with the primer sets specific to both enterobacteriaceae and e. coli/shigella enabled the accurate enumeration of  intestinal e. coli populations and the other enterobacteriaceae species populations.

TI  == characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  == a total of 788 clinical enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (ame genes) and to characterize the plasmids that  carry these genes. among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 escherichia coli (80%), 33 proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six k. oxytoca (1.8%), five enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three morganella morganii (0.9%), three providencia stuartii (0.9%), two  salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each citrobacter freundii, c. koseri, proteus vulgaris, and shigella sonnei. the most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin  (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). the ame genes found were aph(3'')-ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-ia (37.5%), aph(3')-ia (13.9%), aac(3)-iia (12.4%), aac(6')-ib  (4.2%), ant(2'')-ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-iia (1.2%). thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. the most frequent association was ant(3'')-ia plus aph(3'')-ib (35 strains). from 66 selected ame genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-iia, six aph(3')-ia, three ant(3'')-ia, two ant(2'')-ia, and one aac(6')-ib. these genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups f, fia, fib, or hi2. in conclusion, the ame genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-iia, aac(6')-ib, and ant(2'')-ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.

TI  == [investigation of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants in enterobacteriaceae: a multicenter study].
AB  == fluoroquinolones which are in use since 1986, are effective agents both against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. quinolones show bactericidal effect as  a result of inhibition of dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv enzymes. main quinolone resistance mechanisms are chromosomal mutations in these enzymes and decreased intracellular accumulation due to efflux pumps or decreased membrane uptake. recently a new quinolone resistance mechanism mediated by plasmids has been defined. these plasmids carry genes called as qnr. qnr genes do not cause quinolone resistance but they cause decreased quinolone susceptibility and lead to higher minimum inhibitory concentrations. currently there are qnra, qnrb, qnrc, qnrd and qnrs genes. this study was aimed to investigate the presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants in enterobacteriaceae isolates collected from four different centers in turkey. a total of 647 isolates (387 from trabzon, black sea region; 82 from canakkale, trace region; 96 from ankara,  central anatolia region; 82 from tokat, black sea region) belonging to the enterobacteriaceae family collected between may-july 2009, were included in the study. presence of qnra, qnrb, qnrs and qnrc genes were investigated by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method and confirmed by gene sequencing. the results of the pcr amplification revealed that 2 isolates were positive for qnra, 12 isolates were positive for qnrb, 4 isolates were positive for qnrc and 10 isolates were positive for qnrs. however, the number of positive strains decreased with the use of gene sequencing, and this method led to the identification of qnra1 in two isolates [enterobacter cloacae (code. 796), salmonella group b (code. 491)], qnrb1 in two isolates [salmonella group b (code. 491), citrobacter freundii (code. 768)], qnrb6 in one isolate [escherichia coli (code. cc1800)], qnrb9 in one isolate [e.coli (code. cc1873)], qnrb24 in one isolate [citrobacter koseri (code. mp5200)], qnrb27 in one isolate [c.freundii (code. 842)], qnrs1 in two isolates [e.coli (code. cc1705), e.coli (code.159)] and qnrb2 in one isolate [e.coli (code. 843)]. one of the isolates that carried the qnr gene was ciprofloxacin-resistant and two isolates were nalidixic-acid resistant. transferable quinolone resistance due to the dissemination of qnr genes may have important impacts in terms of infection control and treatment problems. survey of plasmid mediated quinolone resistance will help to determine  the size of the issue and guide the measures that should be taken to avoid escalation of resistance and dissemination problem.

TI  == nosocomial transmission of highly resistant microorganisms on a spinal cord rehabilitation ward.
AB  == background/objective: to study the mechanism of nosocomial transmission of highly resistant microorganisms (hrmos). design: a prospective observational study. setting: a spinal cord ward of a rehabilitation center. participants: patients admitted to the spinal cord rehabilitation ward. outcome measures: hrmos present  in urine and feces. hrmos, enterobacteriaceae: (1) that produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl), (2) that were resistant to carbapenems,  (3) that fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides (for escherichia coli and klebsiella species), or other enterobacteriaceae species that were resistant to 2 of 3 of the following types of antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, cotrimoxazole). methods: bacterial growth, identification and sensitivity were tested in urine cultures of 46 patients and faeces cultures of 15 patients. data  were collected on demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, reason and date of admission, room number, method of catheterization (suprapubic, clean intermittent catheterization or indwelling foley catheter) and antibiotic use. results: nine different hrmos (7 e. coli, 1 enterobacter cloacae, and 1 citrobacter koseri) were isolated in urine samples from 15 patients. e. coli resistant to gentamicin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, and ciprofloxacin were isolated from 8 patients during the study (cluster 1). one strain of multiresistant e coli found before the start of the study was not found during the study period (cluster 2). e coli strains producing an esbl and resistant to tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, and ciprofloxacin were isolated from urine samples of 3 patients (cluster 3). ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli were present in feces of 3 patients (2 in cluster 1). catheterization was found to be  significantly more prevalent in patients with hrmos. most of the patients in cluster 1 were treated with antibiotics before the first isolation of the strain. conclusions: hrmos from urine samples were strongly correlated with the use of catheterization. a close correlation was found between prior use of antibiotics and colonization of the urinary tract on the level of the individual patient, which has been rarely described in the literature.

TI  == [infectious complications of surgically treatment pelvic fractures].
AB  == based on case histories, the authors draw attention to important infectious complications in patients surgically treated for pelvic injuries. these complications were recorded in four out of 75 patients (5.3%) undergoing surgery  for pelvic fracture in the period from 2001 to 2005. the chief risk factors for the development of infection included the poor state of health of a polytraumatized patient in combination with a long stay in an acute care unit, and severe trauma and bleeding of soft tissue structures in b and c types of pelvic injury. bacteriological findings showed the presence of several pathogenic species (enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter koseri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca) or multi-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus).

TI  == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2006].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 876 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1764 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 198 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2006 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mepm was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. mepm was also active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 2. as for pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of the mepm-resistant strains were resistant to imipenem (ipm). mepm showed low cross-resistant rate both againt ipm-resistant p. aeruginosa (41.8%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (33.3%). 3. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 4.3% (6 strains) in escherichia coli, 1.1% (1 strain) in citrobacter freundii, 21.7% (5 strains) in citrobacter koseri, 3.1% (4 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae, 3.3% (3 strains) in enterobacter cloacae, 0.8% (1 strain) in serratia marcescens, and 4.9% (2 strains) in providencia spp. the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 3.1% (10 strains) in p. aeruginosa. 4. of all species tested, there were no species, which mic90 of mepm was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous study. therefore, there is almost no significant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. in conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 11 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == dry stress and survival time of enterobacter sakazakii and other enterobacteriaceae in dehydrated powdered infant formula.
AB  == powdered infant formula is not a sterile product, and opportunistic pathogens could multiply in the reconstituted product, resulting in neonatal infections. in this study, the generation of sublethally injured enterobacteriaceae during desiccation and their persistence in dehydrated powdered infant formula was assessed during a 2.5-year period. the study included 27 strains of enterobacter  sakazakii, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella enteritidis, citrobacter koseri, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, escherichia vulneris, pantoea spp., klebsiella oxytoca, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the number of sublethally injured  cells generated during desiccation was lower for k. oxytoca, pantoea spp., salmonella enteritidis, and capsulated strains of e. sakazakii than for the other enterobacteriaceae. the enterobacteriaceae could be divided into three groups with respect to their long-term survival in the desiccated state. c. freundii, c. koseri, and e. cloacae were no longer recoverable after 6 months, and salmonella  enteritidis, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli could not be recovered after 15 months. pantoea spp., k. oxytoca, and e. vulneris persisted over 2 years, and some capsulated strains of e. sakazakii were still recoverable after 2.5 years.

TI  == ft-ir microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  == aims: to investigate the potentials and limitations of fourier transform-infrared (ft-ir) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. methods and  results: a total of 1570 ft-ir spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. a classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium at the species level. an average accuracy of about 80% was reached with gram negative bacteria from the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae families; enterobacter aerogenes,  enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., and citrobacter koseri; and proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. results were comparable with ft-ir measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. conclusions: early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with ft-ir microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is  necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. significance and impact of the study: combination of ft-ir microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.

TI  == qnrb, another plasmid-mediated gene for quinolone resistance.
AB  == a novel plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance gene, qnrb, has been discovered in  a plasmid encoding the ctx-m-15 beta-lactamase from a klebsiella pneumoniae strain isolated in south india. it has less than 40% amino acid identity with the original qnr (now qnra) gene or with the recently described qnrs but, like them,  codes for a protein belonging to the pentapeptide repeat family. strains with qnrb demonstrated low-level resistance to all quinolones tested. the gene has been cloned in an expression vector attaching a polyhistidine tag, which facilitated purification to >or=95% homogeneity. as little as 5 pm of qnrb-his6 protected purified dna gyrase against inhibition by 2 microg/ml (6 microm) ciprofloxacin. with a pcr assay qnrb has been detected in citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli isolates from the united states, linked to shv-12 beta-lactamase and coding for a product differing in five amino  acids from the indian (now qnrb1) variety. the qnrb gene has been found near orf1005 in some, but not all, plasmids and in association with open reading frames matching known chromosomal genes, suggesting that it too was acquired by plasmids from an as-yet-unknown bacterial source.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems.  thirty-two species 2,697 strains of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of  moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), escherichia coli (n = 250), citrobacter freundii (n = 153), citrobacter koseri (n = 97), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), serratia marcescens (n = 153), proteus mirabillis (n = 103), proteus vulgaris (n = 77), morganella morganii (n = 141), providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii; n = 154), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), pseudomonas putida (n = 49), burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), acinetobactor iwoffii (n = 30), bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola; n = 124). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == novel class a beta-lactamase sed-1 from citrobacter sedlakii: genetic diversity of beta-lactamases within the citrobacter genus.
AB  == citrobacter sedlakii 2596, a clinical strain resistant to aminopenicillins, carboxypenicillins, and early cephalosporins such as cephalothin, but remaining susceptible to acylureidopenicillins, carbapenems, and later cephalosporins such  as cefotaxime, was isolated from the bile of a patient treated with beta-lactam and quinolone antibiotics. the isolate produced an inducible class a beta-lactamase of pi 8.6, named sed-1, which was purified. characterized by a molecular mass of 30 kda, sed-1 preferentially hydrolyzed benzylpenicillin, cephalothin, and cloxacillin. the corresponding gene, bla(sed-1), was cloned and  sequenced. its deduced amino acid sequence shared more than 60% identity with the chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from citrobacter koseri (formerly c. diversus) (84%), klebsiella oxytoca (74%), serratia fonticola (67%), and proteus vulgaris (63%) and 71% identity with the plasmid-mediated enzyme men-1. a gene coding for  a lysr transcriptional regulator was found upstream from bla(sed-1). this regulator, named sedr, displayed 90% identity with the ampr sequence of the chromosomal beta-lactamase from c. koseri and 63 and 50% identity with the ampr sequences of p. vulgaris and enterobacter cloacae, respectively. by using dna-dna hybridization, a bla(sed-1)-like gene was identified in two reference strains, c. sedlakii (cip-105037) and citrobacter rodentium (cip-104675), but not in the 18 strains of c. koseri studied. two dna fragments were amplified and sequenced from the reference strains of c. sedlakii cip-105037 and c. rodentium cip-104675 using two primers specific for bla(sed-1). they shared 98 and 80% identity with bla(sed-1), respectively, confirming the diversity of the chromosomally encoded class a beta-lactamases found in citrobacter.

TI  == enhancement of neonatal innate defense: effects of adding an n-terminal recombinant fragment of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein on growth and tumor necrosis factor-inducing activity of gram-negative bacteria tested in neonatal cord blood ex vivo.
AB  == innate defense against microbial infection requires the action of neutrophils, which have cytoplasmic granules replete with antibiotic proteins and peptides. bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (bpi) is found in the primary granules of adult neutrophils, has a high affinity for lipopolysaccharides (or "endotoxins"), and exerts selective cytotoxic, antiendotoxic, and opsonic activity against gram-negative bacteria. we have previously reported that neutrophils derived from newborn cord blood are deficient in bpi (o. levy et al., pediatrics 104:1327-1333, 1999). the relative deficiency in bpi of newborns raised the possibility that supplementing the levels of bpi in plasma might enhance newborn antibacterial defense. here we determined the effects of addition of recombinant 21-kda n-terminal bpi fragment (rbpi(21)) on the growth and tumor  necrosis factor (tnf)-inducing activity of representative gram-negative clinical  isolates. bacteria were tested in citrated newborn cord blood or adult peripheral blood. bacterial viability was assessed by plating assay, and tnf-alpha release was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. whereas adult blood limited the growth of all isolates except klebsiella pneumoniae, cord blood also allowed  logarithmic growth of escherichia coli k1/r and citrobacter koseri. bacteria varied in their susceptibility to rbpi(21)'s bactericidal action: e. coli k1/r was relatively susceptible (50% inhibitory concentration [ic(50)], approximately  10 nm), c. koseri was intermediate (ic(50), approximately 1,000 nm), klebsiella pneumoniae was resistant (ic(50), approximately 10,000 nm), and enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens were highly resistant (ic(50), >10,000 nm). all isolates were potent inducers of tnf-alpha activity in both adult and newborn cord blood. in contrast to its variable antibacterial activity, rbpi(21) consistently inhibited the tnf-inducing activity of all strains tested (ic(50), 1 to 1,000 nm). the antibacterial effects of rbpi(21) were additive with those of a combination of conventional antibiotics typically used to treat bacteremic newborns (ampicillin and gentamicin). whereas ampicillin and gentamicin demonstrated little inhibition of bacterially induced tnf release, addition of rbpi(21) either alone or together with ampicillin and gentamicin profoundly inhibited release of this cytokine. thus, supplementing newborn cord blood with rbpi(21) potently inhibited the tnf-inducing activity of a variety of gram-negative bacterial clinical pathogens and, in some cases, enhanced bactericidal activity. these results suggest that administration of rbpi(21) may  be of clinical benefit to neonates suffering from gram-negative bacterial infection and/or endotoxemia.

TI  == population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime (ctx) in eight species of enterobacteriaceae was carried out. one strain of each species was examined. the  strains represented their individual species as regards natural susceptibility to ampicillin (a) and carbenicillin (ca). cephalothinase activity of the parental strains and strains selected on the plates with the highest concentration that allowed growth was determined by an ultraviolet assay. the populations of the a-susceptible/ca-susceptible (a-s/ca-s) species, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were homogeneous as regards susceptibility to ctx. the a-resistant/ca-resistant (a-r/ca-r) species, klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter koseri, were less homogeneous, but in all four mentioned species no increase in cephalothinase activity was observed between the parental strains and the strains selected in the population analysis. the four a-r/ca-s species, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii, were heterogeneous. the frequency of ctx-r mutants was approx. 10(-6.5). the ic50 for  ctx was 2(7.5)-2(8.5) times higher for the mutants than for the parental strains. the ctx resistance was maintained in subcultures of the strains. all four species had a very high increase in cephalothinase activity from parental strains to the  strains selected in the population analysis. only the enzyme of proteus vulgaris  was able to hydrolyze ctx.

TI  == enterobacteria of emerging pathogenic significance from clinical cases in man and animals and detection of toads and wall lizards as their reservoirs.
AB  == a total of 416 samples comprising faecal samples from diarrhoeic cases of man, calves, sheep and goats, and urine samples from patients with urinary tract infections, were examined for the presence of enterobacteria of emerging pathogenic significance. citrobacter freundii from 20, c. intermedius biotype-a from four, serratia marcescens (serotype 05:h13, bactericin type 16) from one and erwinia herbicola from two human stool samples were isolated. only two urine samples yielded c. freundii. citrobacter freundii was isolated from 10 and c. intermedius biotype-a from two calves. from sheep and goats, two isolates of c. freundii and three of c. intermedius biotype-a were obtained. none of these samples yielded edwarsiella tarda or yersinia enterocolitica. the examination of  99 toads and 145 wall lizards revealed that toads were reservoirs for c. freundii, c. intermedius biotype-a and salmonella brijbhumi, whereas wall lizards were reservoirs for c. freundii, c. intermedius biotype-a, e. herbicola, enterobacter cloacae and salmonella spp. these bacteria were present in the range of 2.0 x 10(6) to 6.0 x 10(11) organisms per gram of intestinal contents. in addition, toads were carriers for edwardsiella tarda (new serotypes 04167:h1 and  05159: non-motile). none of the toads and wall lizards proved positive for c. intermedius biotype-b (c. koseri), s. marcescens and y. entercolitica. c. freundii, c. intermedius biotype-a, e. herbicola and s. marcescens were resistant to penicillin and erythromycin whereas e. tarda isolates were also resistant to gentamycin, neomycin, colistin and sulfamethaxazole.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility patterns (antibiograms) as an aid in differentiating citrobacter species.
AB  == the hydrogen sulfide-negative citrobacter group represents a taxonomic problem. various investigators have proposed such designations as padlewskia, levinea, atypical enterobacter cloacae, h2s-negative variants of citrobacter, citrobacter  koseri and citrobacter diversus. this problem has been investigated with emphasis on antibiograms as a means of discrimination. clinical isolates fitting the designation citrobacter were studied and, using the criteria of ewing and davis,  separated into two groups: c. diversus (40 strains) or c. freundii (25 strains).  susceptibilities to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefazolin, cephaloridine and cephalothin were determined by the agar-dilution method. c. diversus strains were resistant to 8 mug/ml ampicillin (97.5%) and 32 mug/ml carbenicillin (87.5%), and were susceptible to 8 mug/ml cephalosporins (greater than or equal to 90%). c. freundii strains were moderately susceptible to 8 mug/ml ampicillin (25%) and susceptible to 8 mug/ml carbenicillin (92%), and were resistant to 8 mug/ml cephalosporin (greater than or equal 92%). using these data one can separate c. diversus from c. freundii with 90% accuracy.
