TI  == construction of isogenic mutants in streptococcus gallolyticus based on the development of new mobilizable vectors.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus is an emerging cause of infective endocarditis that has been epidemiologically linked to colorectal cancer. s. gallolyticus is poorly transformable using electroporation and no defined mutant has been published yet. hence, we used mobilization to introduce plasmid dna from streptococcus agalactiae into s. gallolyticus using the transfer origin of the conjugative element tngbs1 (orittngbs1), followed by a classical homologous recombination technique. two isogenic mutants of s. gallolyticus ucn34, one deleted for the pil1 pilus operon and another for the sortase a gene, were constructed and characterized. this genetic tool should help in unravelling virulence mechanisms  of this bacterium.

TI  == dynamics of fecal microbial communities in children with diarrhea of unknown etiology and genomic analysis of associated streptococcus lutetiensis.
AB  == background: the sequences of the 16s rrna genes extracted from fecal samples provide insights into the dynamics of fecal microflora. this potentially gives valuable etiological information for patients whose conditions have been ascribed to unknown pathogens, which cannot be accomplished using routine culture methods. we studied 33 children with diarrhea who were admitted to the children's hospital in shanxi province during 2006. results: nineteen of 33 children with diarrhea could not be etiologically diagnosed by routine culture and polymerase chain reaction methods. eleven of 19 children with diarrhea of unknown etiology had streptococcus as the most dominant fecal bacterial genus at admission. eight of nine children whom three consecutive fecal samples were collected had streptococcus as the dominant fecal bacterial genus, including three in the streptococcus bovis group and three streptococcus sp., which was reduced during and after recovery. we isolated strains that were possibly from the s. bovis group from feces sampled at admission, which were then identified as streptococcus lutetiensis from one child and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus from two children. we sequenced the genome of s. lutetiensis and identified five antibiotic islands, two pathogenicity islands, and five unique genomic islands. the identified virulence genes included hemolytic toxin cylz of  streptococcus agalactiae and sortase associated with colonization of pathogenic streptococci. conclusions: we identified s. lutetiensis and s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus from children with diarrhea of unknown etiology, and found pathogenic islands and virulence genes in the genome of s. lutetiensis.

TI  == [analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy chinese women by using dna-fingerprinting].
AB  == objective: to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to chinese females. methods: women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in peking university first hospital from october 2009 to january 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial dna was extracted. universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the v3 region of 16s  rdna gene. pcr products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). featured bands on dgge were recovered, cloned and sequenced. alignment with known sequence was made by using blast on genbank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora  in different physiological states. results: (1) vaginal flora in healthy chinese  women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. common bacteria included: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. while l. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) vaginal  bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. common bacteria included: lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gallolyticus, veillonella sp., streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus anginosus, prevotella sp., anaerococcus lactolyticus and bacteroides fragilis. conclusion: based on the dgge analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in chinese healthy women at reproductive age are lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., prevotella sp.,bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing veillonella sp. and anaerococcus lactolyticus. meanwhile lactobacillus iners was firstly found by dgge to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == mode of action and in vitro susceptibility of mastitis pathogens to macedocin st91km and preparation of a teat seal containing the bacteriocin.
AB  == mastitis is considered to be the most economically costly disease affecting the dairy industry. regular dosage of animals with antibiotics, including use of prophylactic concentrations, may select for resistant strains. the purpose of this study was to determine the mode of action of a new bacteriocin (macedocin st91km), to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance of mastitis pathogens to antibiotics commonly used in treatment remedies, and to introduce the possible use of an alternative antimicrobial agent. the bacteriocin macedocin st91km, produced by streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus st91km, is bactericidal to streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis and staphylococcus aureus associated with mastitis infections, including strains resistant to methicillin and oxacillin. sensitive cells were deformed and secreted nucleotides, k(+) and beta-galactosidase when exposed to macedocin st91km. adsorption of the peptide to target cells decreased in the presence of solvents, suggesting that receptors on the cell surfaces have lipid moieties. no  adsorption was recorded in the presence of mgcl2, ki and na2co3, suggesting that  ionic strength plays an important role. a teat seal preparation containing macedocin st91km effectively released the peptide and inhibited the growth of s.  agalactiae. macedocin st91km could form the basis for alternative dry cow therapy to prevent mastitis infections in dairy cows as it is effective against pathogens that display resistance to conventional antibiotic therapy.

TI  == bacteriocin st91km, produced by streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus st91km, is a narrow-spectrum peptide active against bacteria associated with mastitis in dairy cattle.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus st91km produces a bacteriocin (macedocin st91km) active against streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. macedocin st91km is, according to tricine-sds page, between 2.0 and 2.5 kda in size. antimicrobial activity remained unchanged  after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-10.0 and after 100 min at 100 degrees c. the peptide was inactivated after 20 min at 121 degrees c and when treated with proteolytic enzymes. treatment with alpha-amylase had no effect on activity, suggesting that the mode of action does not depend on glycosylation. amplification of the genome of strain st91km with primers designed from the macedocin precursor gene (mcda) produced 2 fragments (approximately 375 and 220 bp) instead of one 150-bp fragment, as recorded for macedocin produced by streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus aca-dc 198. strain aca-dc 198 was not available. however, dna amplified from strain lmg 18488 (aca-dc 206), genetically closely related to strain aca-dc 198, revealed 99% homology to the mcda of strain aca-dc 198 (accession no. dq835394). macedocin st91km may thus be  a second putative bacteriocin described for streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus.
