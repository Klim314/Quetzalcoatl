TI  - Interleukin-1 signaling in intestinal stromal cells controls KC/CXCR1 secretion,  which correlates with the recruitment of IL-22-secreting neutrophils at early stages of Citrobacter rodentium infection.
AB  - Attaching and effacing pathogens, including enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli in humans and Citrobacter rodentium in mice, raise serious public health concerns. Here we demonstrate that interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling is indispensable for protection against C. rodentium infection in mice. Four days after infection with C. rodentium, there were significant fewer neutrophils (CD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G+) in the colon of IL-1R-/- mice than in wild-type mice. Levels of mRNA and protein of KC/CXCL1 were also significantly reduced in colon homogenates of infected IL-1R-/- mice than in wild-type mice. Of note, infiltrated CD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G+ neutrophils were the main source for IL-22 secretion after C. rodentium infection. Interestingly, colonic stromal cells isolated from IL-1R-/- mice secreted lower levels of KC/CXCL1 than stromal cells from wild-type mice during C. rodentium infection. Similar effects were found when mouse colonic stromal cells and human nasal polyp stromal cells were treated with IL-1R antagonists (i.e., anakinra) in vitro. These results suggest that IL-1 signaling plays a pivotal role in activating mucosal stromal cells to secrete KC/CXCL1, which is essential for infiltration of IL-22-secreting neutrophils upon bacterial infection.
TI  - Delivery of a mucin domain enriched in cysteine residues strengthens the intestinal mucous barrier.
AB  - A weakening of the gut mucous barrier permits an increase in the access of intestinal luminal contents to the epithelial cells, which will trigger the inflammatory response. In inflammatory bowel diseases, there is an inappropriate and ongoing activation of the immune system, possibly because the intestinal mucus is less protective against the endogenous microflora. General strategies aimed at improving the protection of the intestinal epithelium are still missing. We generated a transgenic mouse that secreted a molecule consisting of 12 consecutive copies of a mucin domain into its intestinal mucus, which is believed to modify the mucus layer by establishing reversible interactions. We showed that the mucus gel was more robust and that mucin O-glycosylation was altered. Notably, the gut epithelium of transgenic mice housed a greater abundance of beneficial Lactobacillus spp. These modifications were associated with a reduced susceptibility of transgenic mice to chemically induced colitis. Furthermore, transgenic mice cleared faster Citrobacter rodentium bacteria which were orally given and mice were more protected against bacterial translocation induced by gavage with adherent-invasive Escherichia coli. Our data show that delivering the mucin CYS domain into the gut lumen strengthens the intestinal mucus blanket which is impaired in inflammatory bowel diseases.
TI  - Vitamin A deficient hosts become non-symptomatic reservoirs of Escherichia coli-like enteric infections.
AB  - Vitamin A deficiency (A-) remains a public health concern in developing countries and is associated with increased susceptibility to infection. Citrobacter rodentium was used to model human Escherichia coli infections. A- mice developed a severe and lethal (40%) infection. Vitamin A sufficient (A+) mice survived and cleared the infection by d25. Retinoic acid treatment of A- mice at the peak of the infection eliminated C. rodentium within 16d. Inflammation was not different in A+ and A- colons although the A- mice were still infected at d37. Increased mortality of A- mice was not due to systemic cytokine production, an inability to clear systemic C. rodentium or increased pathogenicity. Instead A- mice developed a severe gut infection with most of the A- mice surviving and resolving inflammation but not eliminating the infection. Improvements in vitamin A status might decrease susceptibility to enteric pathogens and eliminate potential carriers from spreading infection to susceptible populations.
TI  - IL-10-producing intestinal macrophages prevent excessive antibacterial innate immunity by limiting IL-23 synthesis.
AB  - Innate immune responses are regulated in the intestine to prevent excessive inflammation. Here we show that a subset of mouse colonic macrophages constitutively produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In mice infected with Citrobacter rodentium, a model for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infection in humans, these macrophages are required to prevent intestinal pathology. IL-23 is significantly increased in infected mice with a myeloid cell-specific deletion of IL-10, and the addition of IL-10 reduces IL-23 production by intestinal macrophages. Furthermore, blockade of IL-23 leads to reduced mortality in the context of macrophage IL-10 deficiency. Transcriptome and other analyses indicate that IL-10-expressing macrophages receive an autocrine IL-10 signal. Interestingly, only transfer of the IL-10 positive macrophages could rescue IL-10-deficient infected mice. Therefore, these data indicate a pivotal role for intestinal macrophages that constitutively produce IL-10, in controlling excessive innate immune activation and preventing tissue damage after an acute bacterial infection.
TI  - Draft Genome Sequence of Citrobacter rodentium DBS100 (ATCC 51459), a Primary Model of Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli Virulence.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is a Gram-negative bacterium which causes transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia and models the virulence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli in vivo. Thus, C. rodentium is used to study human gastrointestinal disease. We present the draft genome sequence of C. rodentium strain ATCC 51459, also known as DBS100.
TI  - Pro-Coagulant Endothelial Dysfunction Results from EHEC Shiga Toxins and Host Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns.
AB  - Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection is a leading cause of kidney failure in otherwise healthy U.S. children. The bacterial Shiga toxins (Stx) induce the characteristic coagulopathy of HUS, but the damage to toxin-receptor expressing cells and organ injury due to ischemia likely also releases inflammatory damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which may exacerbate injury along with the toxins. To examine this, human aortic and renal glomerular cell anti-coagulant and barrier functions were studied after in vitro challenge with Stx1, Stx2, and DAMPs. There was significant loss of surface anti-coagulant protein C pathway molecules, increased expression of pro-thrombotic PAR1 and reduced protein C activation capability by 15-27%. Histones nearly completely prevented the activated protein C protection of endothelial cells from thrombin-induced permeability. In mice, lethal Stx2 challenge elevated plasma HMGB1 (day 2, 321 +/- 118%; p < 0.01) and extracellular histones (day 3, 158 +/- 62%; p < 0.01). Mice colonized with Stx2-expressing Citrobacter rodentium developed increased HMGB1 (day 5, 155 +/- 55%; p < 0.01) and histones (day 3, 378 +/- 188%; p < 0.01). Anti-histone antibody reduced both DAMPs to baseline, but was not sufficient to improve survival outcome or kidney function. Together, these data suggest a potential role Stx to produce DAMPs, and DAMPs to produce endothelial injury and a pro-thrombotic environment.
TI  - The serine protease autotransporter Pic modulates Citrobacter rodentium pathogenesis and its innate recognition by the host.
AB  - Bacterial pathogens produce a number of autotransporters that possess diverse functions. These include the family of serine protease autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATEs) produced by enteric pathogens such as Shigella flexneri and enteroaggregative Escherichia coli. Of these SPATEs, one termed "protein involved in colonization" or Pic has been shown to possess mucinase activity in vitro, but to date, its role in in vivo enteric pathogenesis is unknown. Testing a pic null mutant (DeltapicC) in Citrobacter rodentium, a natural mouse pathogen, found that C. rodentium, DeltapicC was impaired in its ability to degrade mucin in vitro compared to wild-type. Upon infection of mice, the DeltapicC mutant exhibited a hypervirulent phenotype with dramatically heavier pathogen burdens found in intestinal crypts. DeltapicC infected mice suffered greater barrier disruption, more severe colitis and weight loss necessitating their euthanization between days 10-14 post-infection. Notably the virulence of DeltapicC was normalized when the picC gene was restored, however a PicC point mutant causing loss of mucinase activity did not replicate the DeltapicC phenotype. Exploring other aspects of PicC function, the DeltapicC mutant was found to aggregate to higher levels in vivo than wild-type C. rodentium. Moreover, unlike wild-type, DeltapicC C. rodentium had a red, dry and rough (RDAR) morphology in vitro, and showed increased activation of the innate receptor TLR2. Interestingly, DeltapicC C. rodentium caused a similar degree of pathology as wild-type C. rodentium when infecting TLR2 deficient mice, showing that despite its mucinase activity, PicC's major role in vivo may be to limit C. rodentium's stimulation of the host's innate immune system.
TI  - Inhibition of outer membrane proteases of the omptin family by aprotinin.
AB  - Bacterial proteases are important virulence factors that inactivate host defense  proteins and contribute to tissue destruction and bacterial dissemination. Outer membrane proteases of the omptin family, exemplified by Escherichia coli OmpT, are found in some Gram-negative bacteria. Omptins cleave a variety of substrates at the host-pathogen interface, including plasminogen and antimicrobial peptides. Multiple omptin substrates relevant to infection have been identified; nonetheless, an effective omptin inhibitor remains to be found. Here, we purified native CroP, the OmpT ortholog in the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Purified CroP was found to readily cleave both a synthetic fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate and the murine cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide. In contrast, CroP was found to poorly activate plasminogen into active plasmin. Although classical protease inhibitors were ineffective against CroP activity, we found that the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin displays inhibitory potency in the micromolar range. Aprotinin was shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of CroP activity and to interfere with the cleavage of the murine cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide. Importantly, aprotinin was able to inhibit not only CroP but also Yersinia pestis Pla and, to a lesser extent, E. coli OmpT. We propose a structural model of the aprotinin-omptin complex in which Lys15 of aprotinin forms salt bridges with conserved negatively charged residues of the omptin active site.
TI  - Activation of intestinal epithelial Stat3 orchestrates tissue defense during gastrointestinal infection.
AB  - Gastrointestinal infections with EHEC and EPEC are responsible for outbreaks of diarrheal diseases and represent a global health problem. Innate first-line-defense mechanisms such as production of mucus and antimicrobial peptides by intestinal epithelial cells are of utmost importance for host control of gastrointestinal infections. For the first time, we directly demonstrate a critical role for Stat3 activation in intestinal epithelial cells upon infection of mice with Citrobacter rodentium - a murine pathogen that mimics human infections with attaching and effacing Escherichia coli. C. rodentium induced transcription of IL-6 and IL-22 in gut samples of mice and was associated with activation of the transcription factor Stat3 in intestinal epithelial cells. C. rodentium infection induced expression of several antimicrobial peptides such as RegIIIgamma and Pla2g2a in the intestine which was critically dependent on Stat3 activation. Consequently, mice with specific deletion of Stat3 in intestinal epithelial cells showed increased susceptibility to C. rodentium infection as indicated by high bacterial load, severe gut inflammation, pronounced intestinal epithelial cell death and dissemination of bacteria to distant organs. Together, our data implicate an essential role for Stat3 activation in intestinal epithelial cells during C. rodentium infection. Stat3 concerts the host response to bacterial infection by controlling bacterial growth and suppression of apoptosis to maintain intestinal epithelial barrier function.
TI  - Metalloprotease NleC suppresses host NF-kappaB/inflammatory responses by cleaving p65 and interfering with the p65/RPS3 interaction.
AB  - Attaching/Effacing (A/E) pathogens including enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and the rodent equivalent Citrobacter rodentium are important causative agents of foodborne diseases. Upon infection, a myriad of virulence proteins (effectors) encoded by A/E pathogens are injected through their conserved type III secretion systems (T3SS) into host cells where they interfere with cell signaling cascades, in particular the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway that orchestrates both innate and adaptive immune responses for host defense. Among the T3SS-secreted non-LEE-encoded (Nle) effectors, NleC, a metalloprotease, has been recently elucidated to modulate host NF-kappaB signaling by cleaving NF-kappaB Rel subunits. However, it remains elusive how NleC recognizes NF-kappaB Rel subunits and how the NleC-mediated cleavage impacts on host immune responses in infected cells and animals. In this study, we show that NleC specifically targets p65/RelA through an interaction with a unique N-terminal sequence in p65. NleC cleaves p65 in intestinal epithelial cells, albeit a small percentage of the molecule, to generate the p65(1)(-)(3)(8) fragment during C. rodentium infection in cultured cells. Moreover, the NleC-mediated p65 cleavage substantially affects the expression of a subset of NF-kappaB target genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, immune cell infiltration in the colon, and tissue injury in C. rodentium-infected mice. Mechanistically, the NleC cleavage-generated p65(1)(-)(3)(8) fragment interferes with the interaction between p65 and ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a 'specifier' subunit of NF-kappaB that confers a subset of proinflammatory gene transcription, which amplifies the effect of cleaving only a small percentage of p65 to modulate NF-kappaB-mediated gene expression. Thus, our results reveal a novel mechanism for A/E pathogens to specifically block NF-kappaB signaling and inflammatory responses by cleaving a small percentage of p65 and targeting the p65/RPS3 interaction in host cells, thus providing novel insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of foodborne diseases.
TI  - Properdin provides protection from Citrobacter rodentium-induced intestinal inflammation in a C5a/IL-6-dependent manner.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is an attaching and effacing mouse pathogen that models enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli in humans. The complement system is an important innate defense mechanism; however, only scant information is available about the role of complement proteins during enteric infections. In this study, we examined the impact of the lack of properdin, a positive regulator of complement, in C. rodentium-induced colitis. Following infection, properdin knockout (P(KO)) mice had increased diarrhea and exacerbated inflammation combined with defective epithelial cell-derived IL-6 and greater numbers of colonizing bacteria. The defect in the mucosal response was reversed by administering exogenous properdin to P(KO) mice. Then, using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we show that the mechanism behind the exacerbated inflammation of P(KO) mice is due to a failure to increase local C5a levels. We show that C5a directly stimulates IL-6 production from colonic epithelial cells and that inhibiting C5a in infected wild-type mice resulted in defective epithelial IL-6 production and exacerbated inflammation. These outcomes position properdin early in the response to an infectious challenge in the colon, leading to complement activation and C5a, which in turn provides protection through IL-6 expression by the epithelium. Our results unveil a previously unappreciated mechanism of intestinal homeostasis involving complement, C5a, and IL-6 during bacteria-triggered epithelial injury.
TI  - The CpxRA two-component system is essential for Citrobacter rodentium virulence.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is a murine intestinal pathogen used as a model for the foodborne human pathogens enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and enteropathogenic E. coli. During infection, these pathogens use two-component signal transduction systems to detect and adapt to changing environmental conditions. In E. coli, the CpxRA two-component signal transduction system responds to envelope stress by modulating the expression of a myriad of genes. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that cpxRA was expressed in the colon of C57BL/6J mice infected with C. rodentium. To determine whether CpxRA plays a role during C. rodentium infection, a cpxRA deletion strain was generated and found to have a colonization defect during infection. This defect was independent of an altered growth rate or a defective type III secretion system, and single-copy chromosomal complementation of cpxRA restored virulence. The C. rodentium strains were then tested in C3H/HeJ mice, a lethal intestinal infection model. Mice infected with the DeltacpxRA strain survived infection, whereas mice infected with the wild-type or complemented strains succumbed to infection. Furthermore, we found that the cpxRA expression level was higher during early infection than at a later time point. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the CpxRA two-component signal transduction system is essential for the in vivo virulence of C. rodentium. In addition, these data suggest that fine-tuned cpxRA expression is important for infection. This is the first study that identifies a C. rodentium two-component transduction system required for pathogenesis. This study further indicates that CpxRA is an interesting target for therapeutics against enteric pathogens.
TI  - Locus of enterocyte effacement: a pathogenicity island involved in the virulence  of enteropathogenic and enterohemorragic Escherichia coli subjected to a complex network of gene regulation.
AB  - The locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) is a 35.6 kb pathogenicity island inserted in the genome of some bacteria such as enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E.coli, Citrobacter rodentium, and Escherichia albertii. LEE comprises the genes responsible for causing attaching and effacing lesions, a characteristic lesion that involves intimate adherence of bacteria to enterocytes, a signaling cascade leading to brush border and microvilli destruction, and loss of ions, causing severe diarrhea. It is composed of 41 open reading frames and five major operons encoding a type three system apparatus, secreted proteins, an adhesin, called intimin, and its receptor called translocated intimin receptor (Tir). LEE is subjected to various levels of regulation, including transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulators located both inside and outside of the pathogenicity island. Several molecules were described being related to feedback inhibition, transcriptional activation, and transcriptional repression. These molecules are involved in a complex network of regulation, including mechanisms such as quorum sensing and temporal control of LEE genes transcription and translation. In this mini review we have detailed the complex network that regulates transcription and expression of genes involved in this kind of lesion.
TI  - Identification and regulation of a novel Citrobacter rodentium gut colonization fimbria (Gcf).
AB  - The Gram-negative enteric bacterium Citrobacter rodentium is a natural mouse pathogen that has been extensively used as a surrogate model for studying the human pathogens enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. All three pathogens produce similar attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions in the intestinal epithelium. During infection, these bacteria employ surface structures called fimbriae to adhere and colonize the host intestinal epithelium. For C. rodentium, the roles of only a small number of its genome-carried fimbrial operons have been evaluated. Here, we report the identification of a novel C. rodentium colonization factor, called gut colonization fimbria (Gcf), which is encoded by a chaperone-usher fimbrial operon. A gcfA mutant shows a severe colonization defect within the first 10 days of infection. The gcf promoter is not active in C. rodentium under several in vitro growth conditions; however, it is readily expressed in a C. rodentium Deltahns1 mutant lacking the closest ortholog of the Escherichia coli histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS) but not in mutants with deletion of the other four genes encoding H-NS homologs. H-NS binds to the regulatory region of gcf, further supporting its direct role as a repressor of the gcf promoter that starts transcription 158 bp upstream of the start codon of its first open reading frame. The gcf operon possesses interesting novel traits that open future opportunities to expand our knowledge of the structure, regulation, and function during infection of these important bacterial structures. IMPORTANCE: Fimbriae are surface bacterial structures implicated in a variety of biological processes. Some have been shown to play a critical role during host colonization and thus in disease. Pathogenic bacteria possess the genetic information for an assortment of fimbriae, but their function and regulation and the interplay between them have not been studied in detail. This work provides new insights into the function and regulation of a novel fimbria called Gcf that is important for early establishment of a successful infection by C. rodentium in mice, despite being poorly expressed under in vitro growth conditions. This discovery offers an opportunity to better understand the individual role and the regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression of specific fimbrial operons that are critical during infection.
TI  - SepD/SepL-dependent secretion signals of the type III secretion system translocator proteins in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - The type III protein secretion system (T3SS) encoded by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) is essential for the pathogenesis of attaching/effacing bacterial pathogens, including enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), and Citrobacter rodentium. These pathogens use the T3SS to sequentially secrete three categories of proteins: the T3SS needle and inner rod protein components; the EspA, EspB, and EspD translocators; and many LEE- and non-LEE-encoded effectors. SepD and SepL are essential for translocator secretion, and mutations in either lead to hypersecretion of effectors. However, how SepD and SepL control translocator secretion and secretion hierarchy between translocators and effectors is poorly understood. In this report, we show that the secreted T3SS components, the translocators, and both LEE- and non-LEE-encoded effectors all carry N-terminal type III secretion and translocation signals. These signals all behave like those of the effectors and are sufficient for mediating type III secretion and translocation by wild-type EPEC and hypersecretion by the sepD and sepL mutants. Our results extended previous observations and suggest that the secretion hierarchy of the different substrates is determined by a signal other than the N-terminal secretion signal. We identified a domain located immediately downstream of the N-terminal secretion signal in the translocator EspB that is required for SepD/SepL-dependent secretion. We further demonstrated that this EspB domain confers SepD/SepL- and CesAB-dependent secretion on the secretion signal of effector EspZ. Our results thus suggest that SepD and SepL control and regulate secretion hierarchy between translocators and effectors by recognizing translocator-specific export signals. IMPORTANCE: Many bacterial pathogens use a syringe-like protein secretion apparatus, termed the type III protein secretion system (T3SS), to secrete and inject numerous proteins directly into the host cells to cause disease. The secreted proteins perform different functions at various stages during infection and are classified into three substrate categories (T3SS components, translocators, and effectors). They all contain secretion signals at their N termini, but how their secretion hierarchy is determined is poorly understood. Here, we show that the N-terminal secretion signals from different substrate categories all behave the same and do not confer substrate specificity. We further characterize the secretion signals of the translocators and identify a translocator-specific signal, demonstrating that substrate-specific secretion signals are required in regulating T3SS substrate hierarchy.
TI  - Evolutionary adaptation of an AraC-like regulatory protein in Citrobacter rodentium and Escherichia species.
AB  - The evolution of pathogenic bacteria is a multifaceted and complex process, which is strongly influenced by the horizontal acquisition of genetic elements and their subsequent expression in their new hosts. A well-studied example is the RegA regulon of the enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. The RegA regulatory protein is a member of the AraC/XylS superfamily, which coordinates the expression of a gene repertoire that is necessary for full pathogenicity of this murine pathogen. Upon stimulation by an exogenous, gut-associated signal, namely, bicarbonate ions, RegA activates the expression of a series of genes, including virulence factors, such as autotransporters, fimbriae, a dispersin-like protein, and the grlRA operon on the locus of enterocyte effacement pathogenicity island. Interestingly, the genes encoding RegA homologues are distributed across the genus Escherichia, encompassing pathogenic and nonpathogenic subtypes. In this study, we carried out a series of bioinformatic, transcriptional, and functional analyses of the RegA regulons of these bacteria. Our results demonstrated that regA has been horizontally transferred to Escherichia spp. and C. rodentium. Comparative studies of two RegA homologues, namely, those from C. rodentium and E. coli SMS-3-5, a multiresistant environmental strain of E. coli, showed that the two regulators acted similarly in vitro but differed in terms of their abilities to activate the virulence of C. rodentium in vivo, which evidently was due to their differential activation of grlRA. Our data indicate that RegA from C. rodentium has strain-specific adaptations that facilitate infection of its murine host. These findings shed new light on the development of virulence by C. rodentium and on the evolution of virulence-regulatory genes of bacterial pathogens in general.
TI  - Giardia duodenalis-induced alterations of commensal bacteria kill Caenorhabditis  elegans: a new model to study microbial-microbial interactions in the gut.
AB  - Giardia duodenalis is the most common cause of parasitic diarrhea worldwide and a well-established risk factor for postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. We hypothesized that Giardia-induced disruptions in host-microbiota interactions may play a role in the pathogenesis of giardiasis and in postgiardiasis disease. Functional changes induced by Giardia in commensal bacteria and the resulting effects on Caenorhabditis elegans were determined. Although Giardia or bacteria alone did not affect worm viability, combining commensal Escherichia coli bacteria with Giardia became lethal to C. elegans. Giardia also induced killing of C. elegans with attenuated Citrobacter rodentium espF and map mutant strains, human microbiota from a healthy donor, and microbiota from inflamed colonic sites of ulcerative colitis patient. In contrast, combinations of Giardia with microbiota from noninflamed sites of the same patient allowed for worm survival. The synergistic lethal effects of Giardia and E. coli required the presence of live bacteria and were associated with the facilitation of bacterial colonization in the C. elegans intestine. Exposure to C. elegans and/or Giardia altered the expression of 172 genes in E. coli. The genes affected by Giardia included hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis (HSB) genes, and deletion of a positive regulator of HSB genes, cysB, was sufficient to kill C. elegans even in the absence of Giardia. Our findings indicate that Giardia induces functional changes in commensal bacteria, possibly making them opportunistic pathogens, and alters host-microbe homeostatic interactions. This report describes the use of a novel in vivo model to assess the toxicity of human microbiota.
TI  - Vasoactive intestinal peptide prevents PKCepsilon-induced intestinal epithelial barrier disruption during EPEC infection.
AB  - We previously showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) protects against bacterial pathogen-induced epithelial barrier disruption and colitis, although the mechanisms remain poorly defined. The aim of the current study was to identify cellular pathways of VIP-mediated protection with use of pharmacological inhibitors during enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infection of Caco-2 cell monolayers and during Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis. EPEC-induced epithelial barrier disruption involved the PKC pathway but was independent of functional cAMP, Rho, and NF-kappaB pathways. VIP mediated its protective effects by inhibiting EPEC-induced PKC activity and increasing expression of the junctional protein claudin-4. Short-term treatment with TPA, which is known to activate PKC, was inhibited by VIP pretreatment, while PKC degradation via long-term treatment with TPA mimicked the protective actions of VIP. Immunostaining for specific PKC isotypes showed upregulated expression of PKCtheta and PKCepsilon during EPEC infection. Treatment with specific inhibitors revealed a critical role for PKCepsilon in EPEC-induced barrier disruption. Furthermore, activation of PKCepsilon and loss of barrier integrity correlated with claudin-4 degradation. In contrast, inhibition of PKCepsilon by VIP pretreatment or the PKCepsilon inhibitor maintained membrane-bound claudin-4 levels, along with barrier function. Finally, in vivo treatment with the PKCepsilon inhibitor protected mice from C. rodentium-induced colitis. In conclusion, EPEC infection increases intracellular PKCepsilon levels, leading to decreased claudin-4 levels and compromising epithelial barrier integrity. VIP inhibits PKCepsilon activation, thereby attenuating EPEC-induced barrier disruption.
TI  - The gut commensal bacteroides thetaiotaomicron exacerbates enteric infection through modification of the metabolic landscape.
AB  - The enteric pathogen enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) causes severe diarrhea, but the influence of the gut microbiota on EHEC infection is largely unknown. A predominant member of the microbiota, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt), is resident at EHEC attachment sites. We show that Bt enhances EHEC virulence gene expression through the transcription factor Cra, which is functionally sensitive to sugar concentrations. This enhanced virulence accompanies increased formation of attaching and effacing (AE) lesions requisite for EHEC colonization. Infection with Citrobacter rodentium, a natural mouse pathogen homologous to EHEC, in Bt-reconstituted mice results in increased gut permeability along with exacerbated host pathology and mortality compared to mice deplete of microflora. Bt modifies the metabolite environment at infection sites, increasing metabolites involved in gluconeogenesis, with stark increases in succinate, which can be sensed by Cra. Our findings suggest that microbiota composition affects disease outcome and may explain links between microbiota composition and disease susceptibility.
TI  - Expression of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli map is significantly different than that of other type III secreted effectors in vivo.
AB  - The enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-encoded effectors EspF and Map are multifunctional and have an impact on the tight junction barrier while the non-LEE-encoded proteins NleH1 and NleH2 possess significant anti-inflammatory activity. In order to address the temporal expression of these important genes in vivo, their promoters were cloned upstream of the luxCDABE operon, and luciferase expression was measured in EPEC-infected mice by bioluminescence using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS). Bioluminescent images of living mice, of excised whole intestines, and of whole intestines longitudinally opened and washed were assessed. The majority of bioluminescent bacteria localized in the cecum by 3 h postinfection, indicating that the cecum is not only a major colonization site of EPEC but also a site of EPEC effector gene expression in mice. espF, nleH1, and nleH2 were abundantly expressed over the course of infection. In contrast, map expression was suppressed at 2 days postinfection, and at 4 days postinfection it was totally abolished. After 2 to 4 days postinfection, when map is suppressed, EPEC colonization is significantly reduced, indicating that map may be one of the factors required to maintain EPEC colonization. This was confirmed in a competitive colonization study and in two models of chronic infection, repeated exposure to ketamine and Citrobacter rodentium infection. Our data suggest that map expression contributes to the maintenance of EPEC colonization.
TI  - An iron-containing dodecameric heptosyltransferase family modifies bacterial autotransporters in pathogenesis.
AB  - Autotransporters deliver virulence factors to the bacterial surface by translocating an effector passenger domain through a membrane-anchored barrel structure. Although passenger domains are diverse, those found in enteric bacteria autotransporters, including AIDA-I in diffusely adhering Escherichia coli (DAEC) and TibA in enterotoxigenic E. coli, are commonly glycosylated. We show that AIDA-I is heptosylated within the bacterial cytoplasm by autotransporter adhesin heptosyltransferase (AAH) and its paralogue AAH2. AIDA-I heptosylation determines DAEC adhesion to host cells. AAH/AAH2 define a bacterial autotransporter heptosyltransferase (BAHT) family that contains ferric ion and adopts a dodecamer assembly. Structural analyses of the heptosylated TibA passenger domain reveal 35 heptose conjugates forming patterned and solenoid-like arrays on the surface of a beta helix. Additionally, CARC, the AIDA-like autotransporter from Citrobacter rodentium, is essential for colonization in mice and requires heptosylation by its cognate BAHT. Our study establishes a bacterial glycosylation system that regulates virulence and is essential for pathogenesis.
TI  - Short-chain fructo-oligosaccharide and inulin modulate inflammatory responses and microbial communities in Caco2-bbe cells and in a mouse model of intestinal injury.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have focused on the ability of prebiotics to prevent pathogen-induced cellular changes or alter the composition of the intestinal microbiota in complimentary relevant cell and animal models of inflammatory bowel disease. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine if pretreatment with inulin and a short-chain fructo-oligosaccharide (sc-FOS) prevents enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 infection in Caco2-bbe epithelial cells and what effect 10% wt:v sc-FOS or inulin has on C57BL/6 mice under sham conditions or pretreatment with prebiotics before Citrobacter rodentium infection (10(8) colony-forming units). METHODS: Actin rearrangement and tight junction protein (zona occludin-1) were examined with immunofluorescence. Barrier function was assessed by a fluorescent probe and by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Alterations in cytokine gene expression and microbiome were assessed with quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured by GC. RESULTS: sc-FOS added to monolayers altered actin polymerization without affecting TER or permeability to a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) probe, whereas inulin increased TER (P < 0.005) and altered actin arrangement without affecting FITC permeability. Neither prebiotic attenuated EHEC-induced decreases in barrier function. Prebiotics increased interleukin 10 (Il10) and transforming growth factor-beta (Tgfbeta) cytokine responses alone (P < 0.05) or with EHEC O157:H7 infection (P < 0.05) in vitro. Increases in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnfalpha) (P < 0.05) and decreases in chemokine CXC motif ligand 8 (Cxcl8) (P < 0.05) expression were observed with prebiotic treatment prior to EHEC infection. No differences were noted in barrier function or cytokine responses in the absence or presence of C. rodentium in vivo. Alterations in microbiome were evident at 6 d and 10 d postinfection in treatment groups, but a change in C. rodentium load was not observed. Inulin and sc-FOS (P < 0.05) increased fecal SCFAs in the absence of infection. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights as to how prebiotics act in complementary in vitro and in vivo models of intestinal injury.
TI  - Citrobacter rodentium: infection, inflammation and the microbiota.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is a mucosal pathogen of mice that shares several pathogenic mechanisms with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), which are two clinically important human gastrointestinal pathogens. Thus, C. rodentium has long been used as a model to understand the molecular basis of EPEC and EHEC infection in vivo. In this Review, we discuss recent studies in which C. rodentium has been used to study mucosal immunology, including the deregulation of intestinal inflammatory responses during bacteria-induced colitis and the role of the intestinal microbiota in mediating resistance to colonization by enteric pathogens. These insights should help to elucidate the roles of mucosal inflammatory responses and the microbiota in the virulence of enteric pathogens.
TI  - Development of fatal intestinal inflammation in MyD88 deficient mice co-infected  with helminth and bacterial enteropathogens.
AB  - Infections with intestinal helminth and bacterial pathogens, such as enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, continue to be a major global health threat for children. To determine whether and how an intestinal helminth parasite, Heligomosomoides polygyrus, might impact the TLR signaling pathway during the response to a bacterial enteropathogen, MyD88 knockout and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were infected with H. polygyrus, the bacterial enteropathogen Citrobacter rodentium, or both. We found that MyD88 knockout mice co-infected with H. polygyrus and C. rodentium developed more severe intestinal inflammation and elevated mortality compared to the wild-type mice. The enhanced susceptibility to C. rodentium, intestinal injury and mortality of the co-infected MyD88 knockout mice were found to be associated with markedly reduced intestinal phagocyte recruitment, decreased expression of the chemoattractant KC, and a significant increase in bacterial translocation. Moreover, the increase in bacterial infection and disease severity were found to be correlated with a significant downregulation of antimicrobial peptide expression in the intestinal tissue in co-infected MyD88 knockout mice. Our results suggest that the MyD88 signaling pathway plays a critical role for host defense and survival during helminth and enteric bacterial co-infection.
TI  - Somatostatin regulates tight junction proteins expression in colitis mice.
AB  - Tight junction plays a critical role in intestinal defence. The alteration and perturbation of tight junction proteins could induce intestine barrier damage, and lead to the malabsorption of electrolytes and water. Previous studies had showed that colonic infection and inflammation could lead to the alteration of tight junction function, and somatostatin could protect intestinal epithelia. Thus, this study could explore that whether somatostatin could regulate tight junction in colitis mice. Colitis mice with diarrhea were induced by Citrobacter rodentium (CR) and Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). In CR infected model, cladudin-1 and claudin-3 expression significantly decreased compared with the control mice (P<0.05); after octreotide treatment, claudin-1 and claudin-3 expression significantly increased compared with untreated CR infected mice (P<0.05). In DSS colitis model, occludin and claudin-3 expression significantly decreased compared with the control mice (P<0.05); and octreotide treatment could only significantly upregulate claudin-3 expression compared with untreated DSS colitis mice (P<0.05). To testify our results in vivo, we repeated the models in caco-2 cells by exposed with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (E. Coli) and Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). The results in vitro were consistent with in vivo study. The results suggested that somatostatin play a role in intestinal barrier protection by modulating tight junction proteins expression.
TI  - A large family of antivirulence regulators modulates the effects of transcriptional activators in Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - We have reported that transcription of a hypothetical small open reading frame (orf60) in enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) strain 042 is impaired after mutation of aggR, which encodes a global virulence activator. We have also reported that the cryptic orf60 locus was linked to protection against EAEC diarrhea in two epidemiologic studies. Here, we report that the orf60 product acts as a negative regulator of aggR itself. The orf60 protein product lacks homology to known repressors, but displays 44-100% similarity to at least fifty previously undescribed small (<10 kDa) hypothetical proteins found in many gram negative pathogen genomes. Expression of orf60 homologs from enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) repressed the expression of the AraC-transcriptional ETEC regulator CfaD/Rns and its regulon in ETEC strain H10407. Complementation in trans of EAEC 042orf60 by orf60 homologs from ETEC and the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium resulted in dramatic suppression of aggR. A C. rodentium orf60 homolog mutant showed increased levels of activator RegA and increased colonization of the adult mouse. We propose the name Aar (AggR-activated regulator) for the clinically and epidemiologically important orf60 product in EAEC, and postulate the existence of a large family of homologs among pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae and Pasteurellaceae. We propose the name ANR (AraC Negative Regulators) for this family.
TI  - Indispensable functions of ABL and PDGF receptor kinases in epithelial adherence  of attaching/effacing pathogens under physiological conditions.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Citrobacter rodentium are attaching-and-effacing (A/E) pathogens that cause intestinal inflammation and diarrhea. The bacteria adhere to the intestinal epithelium, destroy microvilli, and induce actin-filled membranous pedestals but do not invade the mucosa. Adherence leads to activation of several host cell kinases, including FYN, n-SRC, YES, ABL, and ARG, phosphorylation of the bacterial translocated intimin receptor, and actin polymerization and pedestal formation in cultured cells. However, marked functional redundancy appears to exist between kinases, and their physiological importance in A/E pathogen infections has remained unclear. To address this question, we employed a novel dynamic in vitro infection model that mimics transient and short-term interactions in the intestinal tract. Screening of a kinase inhibitor library and RNA interference experiments in vitro revealed that ABL and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (PDGFR) kinases, as well as p38 MAP kinase, have unique, indispensable roles in early attachment of EPEC to epithelial cells under dynamic infection conditions. Studies with mutant EPEC showed that the attachment functions of ABL and PDGFR were independent of the intimin receptor but required bacterial bundle-forming pili. Furthermore, inhibition of ABL and PDGFR with imatinib protected against infection of mice with modest loads of C. rodentium, whereas the kinases were dispensable for high inocula or late after infection. These results indicate that ABL and PDGFR have indispensable roles in early A/E pathogen attachment to intestinal epithelial cells and for in vivo infection with limiting inocula but are not required for late intimate bacterial attachment or high inoculum infections.
TI  - Polarizing the T helper 17 response in Citrobacter rodentium infection via expression of resistin-like molecule alpha.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium infection is a murine model of pathogenic Escherichia coli  infection that allows investigation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in host-protective immunity and bacterial-induced intestinal inflammation. We recently demonstrated that following C. rodentium infection, the absence of Resistin-Like Molecule (RELM) alpha resulted in attenuated Th17 cell responses and reduced intestinal inflammation with minimal effects on bacterial clearance. In this addendum, we investigated the cytokine modulatory effects of RELMalpha and RELMalpha expression in the intestinal mucosa following C. rodentium infection. We show that in addition to promoting Th17 cytokine responses, RELMalpha inhibits Th2 cytokine expression and Th2-cytokine effector macrophage responses in the C. rodentium-infected colons. Second, utilizing reporter C. rodentium, we examined RELMalpha expression and macrophage recruitment at the host pathogen interface. We observed infection-induced macrophage infiltration and RELMalpha expression by intestinal epithelial cells. The influence of infection-induced RELMalpha on macrophage recruitment in the intestine is discussed.
TI  - Vitamin D deficiency promotes epithelial barrier dysfunction and intestinal inflammation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D, an important modulator of the immune system, has been shown to protect mucosal barrier homeostasis. This study investigates the effects of vitamin D deficiency on infection-induced changes in intestinal epithelial barrier function in vitro and on Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis in mice. METHODS: Polarized epithelial Caco2-bbe cells were grown in medium with or without vitamin D and challenged with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7. Barrier function and tight junction protein expression were assessed. Weaned C57BL/6 mice were fed either a vitamin D-sufficient or vitamin D-deficient diet and then infected with C. rodentium. Disease severity was assessed by histological analysis, intestinal permeability assay, measurement of inflammatory cytokine levels, and microbiome analysis. RESULTS: 1,25(OH)2D3 altered E. coli O157:H7-induced reductions in transepithelial electrical resistance (P < .01), decreased permeability (P < .05), and preserved barrier integrity. Vitamin D-deficient mice challenged with C. rodentium demonstrated increased colonic hyperplasia and epithelial barrier dysfunction (P < .0001 and P < .05, respectively). Vitamin D deficiency resulted in an altered composition of the fecal microbiome both in the absence and presence of C. rodentium infection. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that vitamin D is an important mediator of intestinal epithelial defenses against infectious agents. Vitamin D deficiency predisposes to more-severe intestinal injury in an infectious model of colitis.
TI  - Protection from intestinal inflammation by bacterial exopolysaccharides.
AB  - Host inflammatory responses against pathogenic organisms can be abrogated by commensals; however, the molecular mechanisms by which pathogenesis is prevented are still poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrated that administration of a single dose of Bacillus subtilis prevented disease and inflammation by the enteric mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, which causes disease similar to the human pathogen enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. No protection was observed when an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-deficient mutant of B. subtilis was used, suggesting that EPS are the protective factor. In this study, we isolated and characterized EPS and showed that they also prevent C. rodentium-associated intestinal disease after a single injection. Protection is TLR4 dependent because EPS-treated TLR4 knockout mice developed disease. Furthermore, protection could be conveyed to wild-type mice by adoptive transfer of macrophage-rich peritoneal cells from EPS-treated mice. We found that EPS specifically bind peritoneal macrophages, and because mice lacking MyD88 signaling in myeloid cells were not protected by EPS, we conclude that bacterial EPS prevent colitis in a TLR4-dependent manner that requires myeloid cells. These studies provide a simple means of preventing intestinal inflammation caused by enteric pathogens.
TI  - Role of class 1 serine protease autotransporter in the pathogenesis of Citrobacter rodentium colitis.
AB  - A growing family of virulence factors called serine protease autotransporters of  Enterobacteriaceae (SPATEs) are secreted by Shigella, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli pathotypes. SPATEs are subdivided into class 1 and class 2 based on structural features and phylogenetics. Class 1 SPATEs induce cytopathic effects in numerous epithelial cell lines, and several have been shown to cleave the cytoskeletal protein spectrin in vitro. However, to date the in vivo role of class 1 SPATEs in enteric pathogenesis is unknown. Citrobacter rodentium, a natural mouse pathogen, has recently been shown to harbor class 1 and class 2 SPATEs. To better understand the contribution of class 1 SPATEs in enteric infection, we constructed a class 1 SPATE null mutant (Deltacrc1) in C. rodentium. Upon infection of C57BL/6 mice, the Deltacrc1 mutant exhibited a hypervirulent, hyperinflammatory phenotype compared with its parent, accompanied by greater weight loss and a trend toward increased mortality in young mice; the effect was reversed when the crc1 gene was restored. Using flow cytometry, we observed increased infiltration of T cells, B cells, and neutrophils into the lamina propria of the distal colon in mice fed the Deltacrc1 mutant, starting as early as 5 days after infection. No significant difference in epithelial cytotoxicity was observed. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of distal colonic tissue on day 10 postinfection showed significant increases in mRNA encoding cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), IL-1beta, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) but not in mRNA encoding IL-17, IL-4, or IL-10 in the Deltacrc1 mutant-infected mice. Our data suggest a previously unsuspected role for class 1 SPATEs in enteric infection.
TI  - Influence of NleH effector expression, host genetics, and inflammation on Citrobacter rodentium colonization of mice.
AB  - The Escherichia coli NleH1 and NleH2 virulence proteins differentially regulate host transcription of innate immunity genes. The mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium encodes one NleH protein, which functions equivalently to E. coli NleH1. We examined the impact of host genetics and intestinal inflammation on the contribution of NleH to C. rodentium colonization of mice differing in LPS responsiveness. NleH expression was detrimental to C. rodentium in C57BL/10ScNJ mice, which do not mount LPS-induced inflammatory responses. This phenotype was reversed if inflammation was induced by chemical means. C. rodentium that expressed both E. coli NleH1 and NleH2 was hypervirulent in C3H/HeJ mice.
TI  - Dynamic changes in mucus thickness and ion secretion during Citrobacter rodentium infection and clearance.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is an attaching and effacing pathogen used as a murine model for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. The mucus layers are a complex matrix of molecules, and mucus swelling, hydration and permeability are affected by many factors, including ion composition. Here, we used the C. rodentium model to investigate mucus dynamics during infection. By measuring the mucus layer thickness in tissue explants during infection, we demonstrated that the thickness changes dynamically during the course of infection and that its thickest stage coincides with the start of a decrease of bacterial density at day 14 after infection. Although quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that mucin mRNA increases during early infection, the increased mucus layer thickness late in infection was not explained by increased mRNA levels. Proteomic analysis of mucus did not demonstrate the appearance of additional mucins, but revealed an increased number of proteins involved in defense responses. Ussing chamber-based electrical measurements demonstrated that ion secretion was dynamically altered during the infection phases. Furthermore, the bicarbonate ion channel Bestrophin-2 mRNA nominally increased, whereas the Cftr mRNA decreased during the late infection clearance phase. Microscopy of Muc2 immunostained tissues suggested that the inner striated mucus layer present in the healthy colon was scarce during the time point of most severe infection (10 days post infection), but then expanded, albeit with a less structured appearance, during the expulsion phase. Together with previously published literature, the data implies a model for clearance where a change in secretion allows reformation of the mucus layer, displacing the pathogen to the outer mucus layer, where it is then outcompeted by the returning commensal flora. In conclusion, mucus and ion secretion are dynamically altered during the C. rodentium infection cycle.
TI  - NLRC4 expression in intestinal epithelial cells mediates protection against an enteric pathogen.
AB  - The inflammasomes have an important role in connecting the detection of endogenous and microbial danger signals to caspase-1 activation and induction of protective immune responses. NLRC4 is a cytosolic NOD (nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain)-like receptor (NLR) that can trigger inflammasome formation in response to bacterial flagellin, an immunodominant antigen in the intestine. To characterize the role of NLRC4 in bacterially triggered intestinal inflammation, we used the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, an extracellular, attaching/effacing bacterium similar to enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and enteropathogenic E. coli. Following infection with C. rodentium, we found that Nlrc4(-/-) mice developed more severe weight loss, increased bacterial colonization levels, and exacerbated intestinal inflammation compared with wild-type counterparts. Nlrc4(-/-) mice mounted robust adaptive immune responses but were unable to control early colonization by C. rodentium, suggesting that a defect in innate immunity was responsible. Experiments using bone marrow (BM) chimeras revealed that the protective effects of NLRC4 were dependent on its expression in non-hematopoietic cells, and quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analyses revealed that NLRC4 was highly expressed in epithelial crypts but not in intestinal stroma. Thus, early NLRC4 sensing in intestinal epithelial cells regulates colonization by an extracellular bacterial pathogen and limits subsequent intestinal damage.
TI  - Escherichia coli virulence protein NleH1 interaction with the v-Crk sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene-like protein (CRKL) governs NleH1 inhibition of the ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3)/nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway.
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and other attaching/effacing bacterial pathogens cause diarrhea in humans. These pathogens use a type III secretion system to inject virulence proteins (effectors) into host cells, some of which inhibit the innate immune system. The enterohemorrhagic E. coli NleH1 effector prevents the nuclear translocation of RPS3 (ribosomal protein S3) to inhibit its participation as a nuclear "specifier" of NF-kappaB binding to target gene promoters. NleH1 binds to RPS3 and inhibits its phosphorylation on Ser-209 by IkappaB kinase-beta (IKKbeta). However, the precise mechanism of this inhibition is unclear. NleH1 possesses a Ser/Thr protein kinase activity that is essential both for its ability to inhibit the RPS3/NF-kappaB pathway and for full virulence of the attaching/effacing mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. However, neither RPS3 nor IKKbeta is a substrate of NleH1 kinase activity. We therefore screened approximately 9,000 human proteins to identify NleH1 kinase substrates and identified CRKL (v-Crk sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene-like protein), a substrate of the BCR/ABL kinase. Knockdown of CRKL abundance prevented NleH1 from inhibiting RPS3 nuclear translocation and NF-kappaB activity. CRKL residues Tyr-198 and Tyr-207 were required for interaction with NleH1. Lys-159, the kinase-active site of NleH1, was necessary for its interaction with CRKL. We also identified CRKL as an IKKbeta interaction partner, mediated by CRKL Tyr-198. We propose that the CRKL interaction with IKKbeta recruits NleH1 to the IKKbeta complex, where NleH1 then inhibits the RPS3/NF-kappaB pathway.
TI  - A type III effector antagonizes death receptor signalling during bacterial gut infection.
AB  - Successful infection by enteric bacterial pathogens depends on the ability of the bacteria to colonize the gut, replicate in host tissues and disseminate to other hosts. Pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella and enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic (EPEC and EHEC, respectively) Escherichia coli use a type III secretion system (T3SS) to deliver virulence effector proteins into host cells during infection that promote colonization and interfere with antimicrobial host responses. Here we report that the T3SS effector NleB1 from EPEC binds to host cell death-domain-containing proteins and thereby inhibits death receptor signalling. Protein interaction studies identified FADD, TRADD and RIPK1 as binding partners of NleB1. NleB1 expressed ectopically or injected by the bacterial T3SS prevented Fas ligand or TNF-induced formation of the canonical death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) and proteolytic activation of caspase-8, an essential step in death-receptor-induced apoptosis. This inhibition depended on the N-acetylglucosamine transferase activity of NleB1, which specifically modified Arg 117 in the death domain of FADD. The importance of the death receptor apoptotic pathway to host defence was demonstrated using mice deficient in the FAS signalling pathway, which showed delayed clearance of the EPEC-like mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium and reversion to virulence of an nleB mutant. The activity of NleB suggests that EPEC and other attaching and effacing pathogens antagonize death-receptor-induced apoptosis of infected cells, thereby blocking a major antimicrobial host response.
TI  - [Rspo2 controls C. rodentium infection outcome in mice].
AB  
TI  - Noncanonical inflammasome activation by intracellular LPS independent of TLR4.
AB  - Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, Citrobacter rodentium, Salmonella typhimurium, and Shigella flexneri are sensed in an ill-defined manner by an intracellular inflammasome complex that activates caspase-11. We show that macrophages loaded with synthetic lipid A, E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or S. typhimurium LPS activate caspase-11 independently of the LPS receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Consistent with lipid A triggering the noncanonical inflammasome, LPS containing a divergent lipid A structure antagonized caspase-11 activation in response to E. coli LPS or Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, LPS-mutant E. coli failed to activate caspase-11. Tlr4(-/-) mice primed with TLR3 agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] to induce pro-caspase-11 expression were as susceptible as wild-type mice were to sepsis induced by E. coli LPS. These data unveil a TLR4-independent mechanism for innate immune recognition of LPS.
TI  - CD3(-)NK1.1(+) cells aid in the early induction of a Th1 response to an attaching and effacing enteric pathogen.
AB  - Extracellular attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens including pathogenic Escherichia coli colonize the host gut causing diarrhea and inflammation. Although much is known regarding the pathogenesis of A/E bacteria, there remains an incomplete understanding of host immune responses to these microbes. NK cells are an important source of IFN-gamma and are essential for early innate responses to viral pathogens; however, their role during extracellular bacterial infections is still largely unexplored. We studied the host response to the murine A/E pathogen Citrobacter rodentium to investigate NK-cell function during infection. NK1.1(+) cell depletions and analysis of colonic intestinal inflammation following Citrobacter infection demonstrated that CD3(-)NK1.1(+) cells play an important role in the initial clearance of C. rodentium, as evidenced by higher bacterial load, intestinal pathology, and crypt hyperplasia at the peak of inflammation in depleted mice. Loss of CD3(-)NK1.1(+) cells resulted in lower colonic IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-12, and a delay in homing of IFN-gamma(+)CD4(+) T cells to the gut. Loss of this response resulted in lower anti-C. rodentium IgG in NK1.1-depleted mice. These data establish that CD3(-)NK1.1(+) cells are critical for inducing an early Th1 response involved in clearance of a pathogen that is restricted to the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - The inhibition of COPII trafficking is important for intestinal epithelial tight  junction disruption during enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium infection.
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are bacterial pathogens that cause severe illnesses in humans. Citrobacter rodentium is a related mouse pathogen that serves as a small animal model for EPEC and EHEC infections. EPEC, EHEC and C. rodentium translocate bacterial virulence proteins directly into host intestinal cells via a type III secretion system (T3SS). Non-LEE-encoded effector A (NleA) is a T3SS effector that is common to EPEC, EHEC and C. rodentium. NleA interacts with and inhibits the mammalian COPII complex, impairing cellular secretion; this interaction is required for bacterial virulence. Although diarrhea is a hallmark of EPEC, EHEC and C. rodentium infections, the underlying mechanisms are not well characterized. One of the essential functions of the intestine is to maintain a barrier between the lumen and submucosa. Tight junctions seal the space between adjacent epithelial cells creating this barrier. Consequently, it is thought that the disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions by EPEC, EHEC, and C. rodentium could result in a loss of barrier function. In this study, we demonstrate that NleA mediated COPII inhibition is required for EPEC- and C. rodentium-mediated disruption of tight junction proteins and increases in fecal water content.
TI  - R-spondin 2 signalling mediates susceptibility to fatal infectious diarrhoea.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is a natural mouse pathogen widely used as a model for enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infections in humans. While C. rodentium causes self-limiting colitis in most inbred mouse strains, it induces fatal diarrhoea in susceptible strains. The physiological pathways as well as the genetic determinants leading to susceptibility have remained largely uncharacterized. Here we use a forward genetic approach to identify the R-spondin2 gene as a major determinant of susceptibility to C. rodentium infection. Robust induction of R-spondin2 expression during infection in susceptible mouse strains causes a potent Wnt-mediated proliferative response of colonic crypt cells, leading to the generation of an immature and poorly differentiated colonic epithelium with deficiencies in ion-transport components. Our data demonstrate a previously unknown role of R-spondins and Wnt signalling in susceptibility to infectious diarrhoea and identify R-spondin2 as a key molecular link between infection and intestinal homoeostasis.
TI  - Bacterial serine proteases secreted by the autotransporter pathway: classification, specificity, and role in virulence.
AB  - Serine proteases exist in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms and have emerged during evolution as the most abundant and functionally diverse group. In Gram-negative bacteria, there is a growing family of high molecular weight serine proteases secreted to the external milieu by a fascinating and widely employed bacterial secretion mechanism, known as the autotransporter pathway. They were initially found in Neisseria, Shigella, and pathogenic Escherichia coli, but have now also been identified in Citrobacter rodentium, Salmonella, and Edwardsiella species. Here, we focus on proteins belonging to the serine protease autotransporter of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATEs) family. Recent findings regarding the predilection of serine proteases to host intracellular or extracellular protein-substrates involved in numerous biological functions, such as those implicated in cytoskeleton stability, autophagy or innate and adaptive immunity, have helped provide a better understanding of SPATEs' contributions in pathogenesis. Here, we discuss their classification, substrate specificity, and potential roles in pathogenesis.
TI  - The enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli effector protein NleF binds mammalian Tmp21.
AB  - The human pathogens enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EHEC and EPEC), as well as the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium encode type III secretion system (T3SS) effector proteins to promote their survival in the infected host. The mechanisms of action and the host targets of T3SS effectors are under active investigation because of their importance to bacterial virulence. The non-locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-encoded protein F, NleF, contributes to E. coli and C. rodentium colonization of piglets and mice, respectively. Here we sought to characterize the host binding partners of NleF. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified Tmp21, a type-I integral membrane protein and COPI-vesicle receptor involved in trans-Golgi network function, as an NleF-binding partner. We confirmed this interaction using immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). We expressed a temperature-sensitive vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (tsVSVG) to monitor protein trafficking and determined that NleF slows the intracellular trafficking of tsVSVG from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi.
TI  - Resistin-like molecule alpha promotes pathogenic Th17 cell responses and bacterial-induced intestinal inflammation.
AB  - Resistin-like molecule (RELM)alpha belongs to a family of secreted mammalian proteins that have putative immunomodulatory functions. Recent studies have identified a pathogenic role for RELMalpha in chemically induced colitis through effects on innate cell populations. However, whether RELMalpha regulates intestinal adaptive immunity to enteric pathogens is unknown. In this study, we employed Citrobacter rodentium as a physiologic model of pathogenic Escherichia coli-induced diarrheal disease, colitis, and Th17 cell responses. In response to Citrobacter, RELMalpha expression was induced in intestinal epithelial cells, infiltrating macrophages, and eosinophils of the infected colons. Citrobacter-infected RELMalpha(-/-) mice exhibited reduced infection-induced intestinal inflammation, characterized by decreased leukocyte recruitment to the colons and reduced immune cell activation compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Interestingly, Citrobacter colonization and clearance were unaffected in RELMalpha(-/-) mice, suggesting that the immune stimulatory effects of RELMalpha following Citrobacter infection were pathologic rather than host-protective. Furthermore, infected RELMalpha(-/-) mice exhibited decreased CD4(+) T cell expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A. To directly test whether RELMalpha promoted Citrobacter-induced intestinal inflammation via IL-17A, infected WT and IL-17A(-/-) mice were treated with rRELMalpha. RELMalpha treatment of Citrobacter-infected WT mice exacerbated intestinal inflammation and IL-17A expression whereas IL-17A(-/-) mice were protected from RELMalpha-induced intestinal inflammation. Finally, infected RELMalpha(-/-) mice exhibited reduced levels of serum IL-23p19 compared with WT mice, and RELMalpha(-/-) peritoneal macrophages showed deficient IL-23p19 induction. Taken together, these data identify a proinflammatory role for RELMalpha in bacterial-induced colitis and suggest that the IL-23/Th17 axis is a critical mediator of RELMalpha-induced inflammation.
TI  - RegR virulence regulon of rabbit-specific enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strain E22.
AB  - AraC-like regulators play a key role in the expression of virulence factors in enteric pathogens, such as enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, and Citrobacter rodentium. Bioinformatic analysis of the genome of rabbit-specific EPEC (REPEC) strain E22 (O103:H2) revealed the presence of a gene encoding an AraC-like regulatory protein, RegR, which shares 71% identity to the global virulence regulator, RegA, of C. rodentium. Microarray analysis demonstrated that RegR exerts 25- to 400-fold activation on transcription of several genes encoding putative virulence-associated factors, including a fimbrial operon (SEF14), a serine protease, and an autotransporter adhesin. These observations were confirmed by proteomic analysis of secreted and heat-extracted surface-associated proteins. The mechanism of RegR-mediated activation was investigated by using its most highly upregulated gene target, sefA. Transcriptional analyses and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that RegR activates the expression of sefA by binding to a region upstream of the sefA promoter, thereby relieving gene silencing by the global regulatory protein H-NS. Moreover, RegR was found to contribute significantly to virulence in a rabbit infection experiment. Taken together, our findings indicate that RegR controls the expression of a series of accessory adhesins that significantly enhance the virulence of REPEC strain E22.
TI  - Hypervirulent-host-associated Citrobacter rodentium cells have poor acid tolerance.
AB  - Enhanced virulence or infectivity after passage through a mammalian host has been reported for a number of enteric food-borne pathogens. Citrobacter rodentium is a mouse pathogen that mimics many aspects of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection of humans and serves as a useful model for studying virulence mechanisms. Emergence of a hyperinfectious state after passage through mouse gastrointestinal tract was reported for C. rodentium. We wanted to investigate if increased acid tolerance could explain hypervirulence status of C. rodentium. Although we were able to observe hyperinfectious state of C. rodentium upon host passage, the cells were extremely acid sensitive. Growth under mildly acidic conditions (LB-MES, pH 5.5) induced acid tolerance of C. rodentium, but did not improve the organism's ability to establish infection. Growth under anaerobic environment on fecal components also did not induce hyperinfectious state. Thus, contrary to conventional anticipation, hypervirulent C. rodentium cells were found to be acid sensitive thereby revealing limitations of the role of mouse gastric acidity by itself in elucidating the hypervirulent phenotype.
TI  - Effect of coiled-coil peptides on the function of the type III secretion system-dependent activity of enterohemorragic Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Many animal and human pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria such as Salmonella, Yersinia, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) possess a type III secretion system (TTSS) that is used to deliver virulence proteins directly into the host cell. Recent evidence has suggested that CoilA and CoilB, two synthetic peptides corresponding to coiled-coil domains of the translocator protein EspA, are effective in inhibiting the action of TTSS from EPEC. In the current study, the action of these coiled-coil peptides on the TTSS of EHEC O157:H7 and Citrobacter rodentium was examined. CoilA and CoilB showed to be effective in reducing the red blood cell lysis mediated by EHEC O157:H7 and the in vitro secretion of translocator proteins EspB and EspD by EHEC O157:H7 and EspD by C. rodentium. Treatment of mice with CoilA and CoilB peptides prevented colon damage when the animals were inoculated with C. rodentium. Colon samples of the non-treated group showed areas with loss of superficial epithelium, damaged cells, and endoluminal mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate, consistent with histological lesions induced by C. rodentium, whereas mice treated with the synthetic peptides displayed normal surface epithelium showing a similar structure as the uninfected control group. These encouraging results prompt us to test coiled-coil peptides as treatment or vaccines in other models of bacterial infections in future work.
TI  - Intestinal epithelial CD98 directly modulates the innate host response to enteric bacterial pathogens.
AB  - CD98 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein whose expression increases in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) during intestinal inflammation. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a food-borne human pathogen that attaches to IECs and injects effector proteins directly into the host cells, thus provoking an inflammatory response. In the present study, we investigated CD98 and EPEC interactions in vitro and ex vivo and examined FVB wild-type (WT) and villin-CD98 transgenic mice overexpressing human CD98 in IECs (hCD98 Tg mice) and infected with Citrobacter rodentium as an in vivo model. In vivo studies indicated that CD98 overexpression, localized to the apical domain of colonic cells, increased the attachment of C. rodentium in mouse colons and resulted in increased expression of proinflammatory markers and decreased expression of anti-inflammatory markers. The proliferative markers Ki-67 and cyclin D1 were significantly increased in the colonic tissue of C. rodentium-infected hCD98 Tg mice compared to that of WT mice. Ex vivo studies correlate with the in vivo data. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) studies with Caco2-BBE cells showed a decrease in adherence of EPEC to Caco2 cells in which CD98 expression was knocked down. In vitro surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments showed direct binding between recombinant hCD98 and EPEC/C. rodentium proteins. We also demonstrated that the partial extracellular loop of hCD98 was sufficient for direct binding to EPEC/C. rodentium. These findings demonstrate the importance of the extracellular loop of CD98 in the innate host defense response to intestinal infection by attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens.
TI  - Natural killer cells protect against mucosal and systemic infection with the enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells are traditionally considered in the context of tumor surveillance and viral defense, but their role in bacterial infections, particularly those caused by enteric pathogens, is less clear. C57BL/6 mice were orally gavaged with Citrobacter rodentium, a murine pathogen related to human diarrheagenic Escherichia coli. We used polyclonal anti-asialo GM1 antibody to actively deplete NK cells in vivo. Bioluminescent imaging and direct counts were used to follow infection. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy were used to analyze immune responses. During C. rodentium infection, NK cells were recruited to mucosal tissues, where they expressed a diversity of immune-modulatory factors. Depletion of NK cells led to higher bacterial loads but less severe colonic inflammation, associated with reduced immune cell recruitment and lower cytokine levels. NK cell-depleted mice also developed disseminated systemic infection, unlike control infected mice. NK cells were also cytotoxic to C. rodentium in vitro.
TI  - Promoter swapping unveils the role of the Citrobacter rodentium CTS1 type VI secretion system in interbacterial competition.
AB  - The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a versatile secretion machine dedicated to various functions in Gram-negative bacteria, including virulence toward eukaryotic cells and antibacterial activity. Activity of T6SS might be followed in vitro by the release of two proteins, Hcp and VgrG, in the culture supernatant. Citrobacter rodentium, a rodent pathogen, harbors two T6SS gene clusters, cts1 and cts2. Reporter fusion and Hcp release assays suggested that the CTS1 T6SS was not produced or not active. The cts1 locus is composed of two divergent operons. We therefore developed a new vector allowing us to swap the two divergent endogenous promoters by P(tac) and P(BAD) using the lambda red recombination technology. Artificial induction of both promoters demonstrated that the CTS1 T6SS is functional as shown by the Hcp release assay and confers on C. rodentium a growth advantage in antibacterial competition experiments with Escherichia coli.
TI  - A novel murine infection model for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli.
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) is an important subset of Shiga toxin-producing  (Stx-producing) E. coli (STEC), pathogens that have been implicated in outbreaks of food-borne illness and can cause intestinal and systemic disease, including severe renal damage. Upon attachment to intestinal epithelium, EHEC generates "attaching and effacing" (AE) lesions characterized by intimate attachment and actin rearrangement upon host cell binding. Stx produced in the gut transverses the intestinal epithelium, causing vascular damage that leads to systemic disease. Models of EHEC infection in conventional mice do not manifest key features of disease, such as AE lesions, intestinal damage, and systemic illness. In order to develop an infection model that better reflects the pathogenesis of this subset of STEC, we constructed an Stx-producing strain of Citrobacter rodentium, a murine AE pathogen that otherwise lacks Stx. Mice infected with Stx-producing C. rodentium developed AE lesions on the intestinal epithelium and Stx-dependent intestinal inflammatory damage. Further, the mice experienced lethal infection characterized by histopathological and functional kidney damage. The development of a murine model that encompasses AE lesion formation and Stx-mediated tissue damage will provide a new platform upon which to identify EHEC alterations of host epithelium that contribute to systemic disease.
TI  - Inhibition of TLR signaling by a bacterial protein containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs.
AB  - The protein Tir (translocated intimin receptor) in enteric bacteria shares sequence similarity with the host cellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs). Despite the importance of Tir in pedestal formation, relatively little is known about the role of Tir and its ITIMs in the regulation of the host immune response. Here we demonstrate that Tir from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) interacted with the host cellular tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 in an ITIM phosphorylation-dependent manner. The association of Tir with SHP-1 facilitated the recruitment of SHP-1 to the adaptor TRAF6 and inhibited the ubiquitination of TRAF6. Moreover, the ITIMs of Tir suppressed EPEC-stimulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines and inhibited intestinal immunity to infection with Citrobacter rodentium. Our findings identify a previously unknown mechanism by which bacterial ITIM-containing proteins can inhibit innate immune responses.
TI  - Toll or interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-beta (TRIF)-mediated caspase-11 protease production integrates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) protein- and Nlrp3 inflammasome-mediated host defense against enteropathogens.
AB  - Enteric pathogens represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Toll-like receptor (TLR) and inflammasome signaling are critical for host responses against these pathogens, but how these pathways are integrated remains unclear. Here, we show that TLR4 and the TLR adaptor TRIF are required for inflammasome activation in macrophages infected with the enteric pathogens Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium. In contrast, TLR4 and TRIF were dispensable for Salmonella typhimurium-induced caspase-1 activation. TRIF regulated expression of caspase-11, a caspase-1-related protease that is critical for E. coli- and C. rodentium-induced inflammasome activation, but dispensable for inflammasome activation by S. typhimurium. Thus, TLR4- and TRIF-induced caspase-11 synthesis is critical for noncanonical Nlrp3 inflammasome activation in macrophages infected with enteric pathogens.
TI  - A Genomic Island in Salmonella enterica ssp. salamae provides new insights on the genealogy of the locus of enterocyte effacement.
AB  - The genomic island encoding the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) is an important virulence factor of the human pathogenic Escherichia coli. LEE typically encodes a type III secretion system (T3SS) and secreted effectors capable of forming attaching and effacing lesions. Although prominent in the pathogenic E. coli such as serotype O157:H7, LEE has also been detected in Citrobacter rodentium, E. albertii, and although not confirmed, it is likely to also be in Shigella boydii. Previous phylogenetic analysis of LEE indicated the genomic island was evolving through stepwise acquisition of various components. This study describes a new LEE region from two strains of Salmonella enterica subspecies salamae serovar Sofia along with a phylogenetic analysis of LEE that provides new insights into the likely evolution of this genomic island. The Salmonella LEE contains 36 of the 41 genes typically observed in LEE within a genomic island of 49, 371 bp that encodes a total of 54 genes. A phylogenetic analysis was performed on the entire T3SS and four T3SS genes (escF, escJ, escN, and escV) to elucidate the genealogy of LEE. Phylogenetic analysis inferred that the previously known LEE islands are members of a single lineage distinct from the new Salmonella LEE lineage. The previously known lineage of LEE diverged between islands found in Citrobacter and those in Escherichia and Shigella. Although recombination and horizontal gene transfer are important factors in the genealogy of most genomic islands, the phylogeny of the T3SS of LEE can be interpreted with a bifurcating tree. It seems likely that the LEE island entered the Enterobacteriaceae through horizontal gene transfer as a single unit, rather than as separate subsections, which was then subjected to the forces of both mutational change and recombination.
TI  - TRIF licenses caspase-11-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation by gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Systemic infections with Gram-negative bacteria are characterized by high mortality rates due to the "sepsis syndrome," a widespread and uncontrolled inflammatory response. Though it is well recognized that the immune response during Gram-negative bacterial infection is initiated after the recognition of endotoxin by Toll-like receptor 4, the molecular mechanisms underlying the detrimental inflammatory response during Gram-negative bacteremia remain poorly defined. Here, we identify a TRIF pathway that licenses NLRP3 inflammasome activation by all Gram-negative bacteria. By engaging TRIF, Gram-negative bacteria activate caspase-11. TRIF activates caspase-11 via type I IFN signaling, an event that is both necessary and sufficient for caspase-11 induction and autoactivation. Caspase-11 subsequently synergizes with the assembled NLRP3 inflammasome to regulate caspase-1 activation and leads to caspase-1-independent cell death. These events occur specifically during infection with Gram-negative, but not Gram-positive, bacteria. The identification of TRIF as a regulator of caspase-11 underscores the importance of TLRs as master regulators of inflammasomes during Gram-negative bacterial infection.
TI  - HVEM signalling at mucosal barriers provides host defence against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM), a member of the tumour-necrosis factor receptor family, has diverse functions, augmenting or inhibiting the immune response. HVEM was recently reported as a colitis risk locus in patients, and in a mouse model of colitis we demonstrated an anti-inflammatory role for HVEM, but its mechanism of action in the mucosal immune system was unknown. Here we report an important role for epithelial HVEM in innate mucosal defence against pathogenic bacteria. HVEM enhances immune responses by NF-kappaB-inducing kinase-dependent Stat3 activation, which promotes the epithelial expression of genes important for immunity. During intestinal Citrobacter rodentium infection, a mouse model for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infection, Hvem-/- mice showed decreased Stat3 activation, impaired responses in the colon, higher bacterial burdens and increased mortality. We identified the immunoglobulin superfamily molecule CD160 (refs 7 and 8), expressed predominantly by innate-like intraepithelial lymphocytes, as the ligand engaging epithelial HVEM for host protection. Likewise, in pulmonary Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, HVEM is also required for host defence. Our results pinpoint HVEM as an important orchestrator of mucosal immunity, integrating signals from innate lymphocytes to induce optimal epithelial Stat3 activation, which indicates that targeting HVEM with agonists could improve host defence.
TI  - Quantitative proteomic analysis of type III secretome of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli reveals an expanded effector repertoire for attaching/effacing bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Type III secretion systems are central to the pathogenesis and virulence of many  important Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, and elucidation of the secretion mechanism and identification of the secreted substrates are critical to our understanding of their pathogenic mechanisms and developing potential therapeutics. Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture-based mass spectrometry is a quantitative and highly sensitive proteomics tool that we have previously used to successfully analyze the type III secretomes of Citrobacter rodentium and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. In this report, stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture was used to analyze the type III secretome of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), an important human pathogen, which, together with enterohemorrhagic E. coli and C. rodentium, represents the family of attaching and effacing bacterial pathogens. We not only confirmed all 25 known EPEC type III-secreted proteins and effectors previously identified by conventional molecular and bioinformatical techniques but also identified several new type III-secreted proteins, including two novel effectors, C_0814/NleJ and LifA, that were shown to be translocated into host cells. LifA is a known virulence factor believed to act as a toxin as well as an adhesin, but its mechanism of secretion and function is not understood. With a predicted molecular mass of 366 kDa, LifA is the largest type III effector identified thus far in any pathogen. We further demonstrated that Efa1, ToxB, and Z4332 (homologs of LifA in enterohemorrhagic E. coli) are also type III effectors. This study has comprehensively characterized the type III secretome of EPEC, expanded the repertoire of type III-secreted effectors for the attaching and effacing pathogens, and provided new insights into the mode of function for LifA/Efa1/ToxB/Z4332, an important family of virulence factors.
TI  - The sphingosine-1-phosphate analogue FTY720 impairs mucosal immunity and clearance of the enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - The sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) analogue FTY720 is therapeutically efficacious  in multiple sclerosis and in the prevention of transplant rejection. It prevents the migration of lymphocytes to sites of pathology by trapping them within the peripheral lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), and Peyer's patches. However, evidence suggests that its clinical use may increase the risk of mucosal infections. We investigated the impact of FTY720 treatment on susceptibility to gastrointestinal infection with the mouse enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. This attaching and effacing bacterium induces a transient bacterial colitis in immunocompetent mice that resembles human infection with pathogenic Escherichia coli. FTY720 treatment induced peripheral blood lymphopenia, trapped lymphocytes in the MLNs, and prevented the clearance of bacteria when mice were infected with luciferase-tagged C. rodentium. FTY720-treated C. rodentium-infected mice had enhanced colonic inflammation, with significantly higher colon mass, colon histopathology, and neutrophil infiltration than vehicle-infected animals. In addition, FTY720-treated infected mice had significantly lower numbers of colonic dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that FTY720-treated infected mice had an impaired innate immune response and a blunted mucosal adaptive immune response, including Th1 cytokines. The data demonstrate that the S1P analogue FTY720 adversely affects the immune response to and clearance of C. rodentium.
TI  - Regulated virulence controls the ability of a pathogen to compete with the gut microbiota.
AB  - The virulence mechanisms that allow pathogens to colonize the intestine remain unclear. Here, we show that germ-free animals are unable to eradicate Citrobacter rodentium, a model for human infections with attaching and effacing bacteria. Early in infection, virulence genes were expressed and required for pathogen growth in conventionally raised mice but not germ-free mice. Virulence gene expression was down-regulated during the late phase of infection, which led to relocation of the pathogen to the intestinal lumen where it was outcompeted by commensals. The ability of commensals to outcompete C. rodentium was determined, at least in part, by the capacity of the pathogen and commensals to grow on structurally similar carbohydrates. Thus, pathogen colonization is controlled by bacterial virulence and through competition with metabolically related commensals.
TI  - Microbiology. Virulence or competition?
AB  
TI  - Discovery of an archetypal protein transport system in bacterial outer membranes.
AB  - Bacteria have mechanisms to export proteins for diverse purposes, including colonization of hosts and pathogenesis. A small number of archetypal bacterial secretion machines have been found in several groups of bacteria and mediate a fundamentally distinct secretion process. Perhaps erroneously, proteins called 'autotransporters' have long been thought to be one of these protein secretion systems. Mounting evidence suggests that autotransporters might be substrates to be secreted, not an autonomous transporter system. We have discovered a new translocation and assembly module (TAM) that promotes efficient secretion of autotransporters in proteobacteria. Functional analysis of the TAM in Citrobacter rodentium, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli showed that it consists of an Omp85-family protein, TamA, in the outer membrane and TamB in the inner membrane of diverse bacterial species. The discovery of the TAM provides a new target for the development of therapies to inhibit colonization by bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Role of inflammasomes in host defense against Citrobacter rodentium infection.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is an enteric bacterial pathogen of the mouse intestinal tract that triggers inflammatory responses resembling those of humans infected with enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. Inflammasome signaling is emerging as a central regulator of inflammatory and host responses to several pathogens, but the in vivo role of inflammasome signaling in host defense against C. rodentium has not been characterized. Here, we show that mice lacking the inflammasome components Nlrp3, Nlrc4, and caspase-1 were hypersusceptible to C. rodentium-induced gastrointestinal inflammation. This was due to defective interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 production given that il-1beta(-/-) and il-18(-/-) mice also suffered from increased bacterial burdens and exacerbated histopathology. C. rodentium specifically activated the Nlrp3 inflammasome in in vitro-infected macrophages independently of a functional bacterial type III secretion system. Thus, production of IL-1beta and IL-18 downstream of the Nlrp3 and Nlrc4 inflammasomes plays a critical role in host defense against enteric infections caused by C. rodentium.
TI  - Functional differences and interactions between the Escherichia coli type III secretion system effectors NleH1 and NleH2.
AB  - The human pathogens enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EHEC and EPEC), as well as the related mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, utilize a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject multiple effector proteins into host cells. The E. coli O157:H7 strain EDL933 carries two copies of non-locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-encoded protein H, designated NleH1 and NleH2, both of which bind to the human ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a subunit of NF-kappaB transcriptional complexes. In this study, we describe significant functional differences between NleH1 and NleH2 in their ability to regulate the host NF-kappaB pathway. We show that the EHEC and EPEC NleH effectors are functionally equivalent in their ability to affect RPS3 nuclear translocation. NleH1, but not NleH2, inhibited NF-kappaB activity without altering the kinetics of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation/degradation. We also determined that the class I PSD-95/Disc Large/ZO-1 (PDZ)-binding domain of NleH was important for its activity in the NF-kappaB pathway. In addition to binding RPS3, we found that NleH1 and NleH2 are able to bind to each other in vitro and in vivo, suggesting an additional mechanism by which the E. coli NleH effectors may regulate the extent and duration of NF-kappaB activation after their T3SS-dependent translocation. We also performed mouse infection experiments and established that mouse mortality and Citrobacter colonization were reduced in mice infected with DeltanleH. Complementing DeltanleH with NleH1 restored Citrobacter virulence and colonization to wild-type levels, whereas complementing with NleH2 reduced them. Taken together, our data show that NleH1 and NleH2 have pronounced functional differences in their ability to alter host transcriptional responses to bacterial infection.
TI  - EscA is a crucial component of the type III secretion system of enteropathogenic  Escherichia coli.
AB  - The virulence of many Gram-negative pathogens is associated with type III secretion systems (T3SSs), which deliver virulence effector proteins into the cytoplasm of host cells. Components of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) T3SS are encoded within the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). While most LEE-encoded T3SS proteins in EPEC have assigned names and functions, a few of them remain poorly characterized. Here, we studied a small LEE-encoded protein, Orf15, that shows no homology to other T3SS/flagellar proteins and is only present in attaching and effacing pathogens, including enterohemorrhagic E. coli and Citrobacter rodentium. Our findings demonstrated that it is essential for type III secretion (T3S) and that it is localized to the periplasm and associated with the inner membrane. Membrane association was driven by the N-terminal 19 amino acid residues, which were also shown to be essential for T3S. Consistent with its localization, Orf15 was found to interact with the EPEC T3SS outer membrane ring component, EscC, which was previously shown to be embedded within the outer membrane and protruding into the periplasmic space. Interestingly, we found that the predicted coiled-coil structure of Orf15 is critical for the protein's function. Overall, our findings suggest that Orf15 is a structural protein that contributes to the structural integrity of the T3S complex, and therefore we propose to rename it EscA.
TI  - Sec24 interaction is essential for localization and virulence-associated function of the bacterial effector protein NleA.
AB  - Enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHEC) are food-borne pathogens that cause severe diarrhoeal disease in humans. Citrobacter rodentium is a related mouse pathogen that serves as a small animal model for EPEC and EHEC infections. EPEC, EHEC and C. rodentium translocate bacterial virulence proteins directly into host cells via a type III secretion system (T3SS). Non-LEE-encoded effector A (NleA) is a T3SS effector that is common to EPEC, EHEC and C. rodentium and is required for bacterial virulence. NleA localizes to the host cell secretory pathway and inhibits vesicle trafficking by interacting with the Sec24 subunit of mammalian coatamer protein II complex (COPII). Mammalian cells express four paralogues of Sec24 (Sec24A-D), which mediate selection of cargo proteins for transport and possess distinct, but overlapping cargo specificities. Here, we show that NleA binds Sec24A-D with two distinct mechanisms. An NleA protein variant with greatly diminished interaction with all Sec24 paralogues does not properly localize, does not inhibit COPII-mediated vesicle budding, and does not confer virulence in the mouse infection model. Together, this work provides strong evidence that the interaction and inhibition of COPII by NleA is an important aspect of EPEC- and EHEC-mediated disease.
TI  - Allele- and tir-independent functions of intimin in diverse animal infection models.
AB  - Upon binding to intestinal epithelial cells, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and Citrobacter rodentium trigger formation of actin pedestals beneath bound bacteria. Pedestal formation has been associated with enhanced colonization, and requires intimin, an adhesin that binds to the bacterial effector translocated intimin receptor (Tir), which is translocated to the host cell membrane and promotes bacterial adherence and pedestal formation. Intimin has been suggested to also promote cell adhesion by binding one or more host receptors, and allelic differences in intimin have been associated with differences in tissue and host specificity. We assessed the function of EHEC, EPEC, or C. rodentium intimin, or a set of intimin derivatives with varying Tir-binding abilities in animal models of infection. We found that EPEC and EHEC intimin were functionally indistinguishable during infection of gnotobiotic piglets by EHEC, and that EPEC, EHEC, and C. rodentium intimin were functionally indistinguishable during infection of C57BL/6 mice by C. rodentium. A derivative of EHEC intimin that bound Tir but did not promote robust pedestal formation on cultured cells was unable to promote C. rodentium colonization of conventional mice, indicating that the ability to trigger actin assembly, not simply to bind Tir, is required for intimin-mediated intestinal colonization. Interestingly, streptomycin pre-treatment of mice eliminated the requirement for Tir but not intimin during colonization, and intimin derivatives that were defective in Tir-binding still promoted colonization of these mice. These results indicate that EPEC, EHEC, and C. rodentium intimin are functionally interchangeable during infection of gnotobiotic piglets or conventional C57BL/6 mice, and that whereas the ability to trigger Tir-mediated pedestal formation is essential for colonization of conventional mice, intimin provides a Tir-independent activity during colonization of streptomycin pre-treated mice.
TI  - A structural motif is the recognition site for a new family of bacterial protein  O-glycosyltransferases.
AB  - The Escherichia coli Adhesin Involved in Diffuse Adherence (AIDA-I) is a multifunctional protein that belongs to the family of monomeric autotransporters. This adhesin can be glycosylated by the AIDA-associated heptosyltransferase (Aah). Glycosylation appears to be restricted to the extracellular domain of AIDA-I, which comprises imperfect repeats of a 19-amino-acid consensus sequence and is predicted to form a beta-helix. Here, we show that Aah homologues can be found in many Gram-negative bacteria, including Citrobacter rodentium. We demonstrated that an AIDA-like protein is glycosylated in this species by the Aah homologue. We then investigated the substrate recognition mechanism of the E. coli Aah heptosyltransferase. We found that a peptide corresponding to one repeat of the 19-amino-acid consensus is sufficient for recognition and glycosylation by Aah. Mutagenesis studies suggested that, unexpectedly, Aah recognizes a structural motif typical of beta-helices, but not a specific sequence. In agreement with this finding, we observed that the extracellular domain of the Bordetella pertussis pertactin, a beta-helical polypeptide lacking the 19-amino-acid consensus sequence, could be glycosylated by Aah. Overall, our findings suggest that Aah represents the prototype of a new large family of bacterial protein O-glycosyltransferases that modify various substrates recognized through a structural motif.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis-mediated protection from Citrobacter rodentium-associated enteric disease requires espH and functional flagella.
AB  - Commensals limit disease caused by invading pathogens; however, the mechanisms and genes utilized by beneficial microbes to inhibit pathogenesis are poorly understood. The attaching and effacing mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium associates intimately with the intestinal epithelium, and infections result in acute colitis. C. rodentium is used to model the human pathogens enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and enteropathogenic E. coli. To confirm that Bacillus subtilis, a spore-forming bacterium found in the gut of mammals, could reduce C. rodentium-associated disease, mice received wild-type B. subtilis spores and 24 h later were infected by oral gavage with pathogenic C. rodentium. Disease was assessed by determining the extent of colonic epithelial hyperplasia, goblet cell loss, diarrhea, and pathogen colonization. Mice that received wild-type B. subtilis prior to enteric infection were protected from disease even though C. rodentium colonization was not inhibited. In contrast, espH and hag mutants, defective in exopolysaccharides and flagellum production, respectively, did not protect mice from C. rodentium-associated disease. A motAB mutant also failed to protect mice from disease, suggesting that B. subtilis-mediated protection requires functional flagella. By expanding our current mechanistic knowledge of bacterial protection, we can better utilize beneficial microbes to prevent intestinal disease caused by pathogenic bacteria, ultimately reducing human disease. Our data demonstrate that wild-type B. subtilis reduced disease caused by C. rodentium infection through a mechanism that required espH and functional flagella.
TI  - Direct and indirect control of Lrp on LEE pathogenicity genes of Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is a mouse pathogen that, because of its similarities with  human enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) strains of Escherichia coli is widely used as a model system for in vivo and in vitro studies. Similarly to EPEC and EHEC, C. rodentium carries the LEE (locus of enterocyte effacement) pathogenicity island, encoding virulence factors essential for causing transmissible colonic hyperplasia in mice by attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions. Expression of the genes carried by the LEE pathogenicity island is controlled by complex networks of transcriptional factors, including the global regulators H-NS, IHF, and Fis. In this study, we analyzed the role of Lrp, another global regulator of gene expression in enteric bacteria, on the expression of LEE genes of C. rodentium. To this aim, a real-time PCR approach was used and revealed a negative role of Lrp on the expression of all analyzed LEE genes. Mobility-shift experiments indicated that Lrp action is direct on LEE1 and indirect on all other analyzed LEE genes.
TI  - Polyethylene glycol diminishes pathological effects of Citrobacter rodentium infection by blocking bacterial attachment to the colonic epithelia.
AB  - Infections from enteric bacteria such as enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are a public health threat worldwide. EPEC and EHEC are extracellular pathogens, and their interaction with host surface receptors is critical to the infection process. We previously demonstrated that polyethylene glycol (PEG) downregulates surface receptors in intestinal cells. Here we show that PEG decreases beta1-integrin, the surface receptor in intestinal cells that is critical for EPEC and EHEC attachment. We hypothesized that PEG would inhibit the attachment of these enteric pathogens to host cells and improve clinical signs of infection. We found that attachment of the mouse enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, which belongs to the same group of pathogens as EPEC and EHEC, was attenuated by the concurrent presence of PEG. Pretreatment with PEG, without concurrent presence during infection, also reduced bacterial attachment. This finding was further supported in vivo such as that PEG administered by gavage daily during infection as well as prior to infection significantly decreased C. rodentium in the colon and improved the appearance of the infected colon in mice. In addition, PEG decreased the beta1-integrin in colonic mucosa and reduced the C. rodentium-induced activation of epidermal growth factor receptors. PEG also significantly reduced infection-induced colonic inflammation. Finally, PEG efficiently reduced C. rodentium shedding from the colon during infection. In conclusion, PEG can be an efficient and safe preventive agent against EPEC and EHEC infections.
TI  - Non-canonical inflammasome activation targets caspase-11.
AB  - Caspase-1 activation by inflammasome scaffolds comprised of intracellular nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and the adaptor ASC is believed to be essential for production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 during the innate immune response. Here we show, with C57BL/6 Casp11 gene-targeted mice, that caspase-11 (also known as caspase-4) is critical for caspase-1 activation and IL-1beta production in macrophages infected with Escherichia coli, Citrobacter rodentium or Vibrio cholerae. Strain 129 mice, like Casp11(-/-) mice, exhibited defects in IL-1beta production and harboured a mutation in the Casp11 locus that attenuated caspase-11 expression. This finding is important because published targeting of the Casp1 gene was done using strain 129 embryonic stem cells. Casp1 and Casp11 are too close in the genome to be segregated by recombination; consequently, the published Casp1(-/-) mice lack both caspase-11 and caspase-1. Interestingly, Casp11(-/-) macrophages secreted IL-1beta normally in response to ATP and monosodium urate, indicating that caspase-11 is engaged by a non-canonical inflammasome. Casp1(-/-)Casp11(129mt/129mt) macrophages expressing caspase-11 from a C57BL/6 bacterial artificial chromosome transgene failed to secrete IL-1beta regardless of stimulus, confirming an essential role for caspase-1 in IL-1beta production. Caspase-11 rather than caspase-1, however, was required for non-canonical inflammasome-triggered macrophage cell death, indicating that caspase-11 orchestrates both caspase-1-dependent and -independent outputs. Caspase-1 activation by non-canonical stimuli required NLRP3 and ASC, but caspase-11 processing and cell death did not, implying that there is a distinct activator of caspase-11. Lastly, loss of caspase-11 rather than caspase-1 protected mice from a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide. These data highlight a unique pro-inflammatory role for caspase-11 in the innate immune response to clinically significant bacterial infections.
TI  - Immunization of mice with Lactobacillus casei expressing a beta-intimin fragment  reduces intestinal colonization by Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a common cause of diarrhea in children from developing countries. Intimate adhesion of the bacteria to intestinal cells occurs via binding of the adhesin intimin to the TIR receptor exposed on cell surfaces. Here, Lactobacillus casei expressing a fragment of beta-intimin (L. casei-Int(cv)) was tested as mucosal vaccines in mice against intestinal colonization with the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Oral or sublingual immunization of C57BL/6 mice with L. casei-Int(cv) induced anti-Int(cv) IgA in feces but no IgG in sera. Conversely, anti-Int(cv) IgG was induced in the sera of mice after sublingual immunization with purified Int(cv). All vaccines were able to decrease C. rodentium recovery from feces. However, this reduction was more evident and sustained over time in mice immunized with L. casei-Int(cv) by the sublingual route. These mice also displayed an increase in interleukin 6 (IL-6) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) secretion by spleen cells 10 days after infection. Additionally, oral or sublingual immunization of C3H/HePas mice, which are highly susceptible to C. rodentium infection, with L. casei-Int(cv) induced anti-Int(cv) antibodies and significantly increased survival after challenge. Immunohistological analysis of colon sections revealed that C. rodentium was located in deep fractions of the tissue from C3H/HePas mice immunized with L. casei whereas superficial staining was observed in colon sections from mice immunized with L. casei-Int(cv.) The results indicate that vaccines composed of L. casei expressing intimin may represent a promising approach and that the C3H/HePas infection model with C. rodentium can be used to evaluate potential vaccines against EPEC.
TI  - PerC and GrlA independently regulate Ler expression in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - Ler, encoded by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) of attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens, induces the expression of LEE genes by counteracting the silencing exerted by H-NS. Ler expression is modulated by several global regulators, and is activated by GrlA, which is also LEE-encoded. Typical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains contain the EAF plasmid, which carries the perABC locus encoding PerC. The precise role of PerC in EPEC virulence gene regulation has remained unclear, mainly because EPEC strains lacking the pEAF still express the LEE genes and because PerC is not present in other A/E pathogens such as Citrobacter rodentium. Here, we describe that either PerC or GrlA can independently activate ler expression and, in consequence, of LEE genes depending on the growth conditions. Both PerC and GrlA, with the aid of IHF, counteract the repression exerted by H-NS on ler and can also further increase its activity. Our results substantiate the role of PerC and GrlA in EPEC virulence gene regulation and suggest that these convergent regulatory mechanisms may have represented an evolutionary adaptation in EPEC to co-ordinate the expression of plasmid- and chromosome-encoded virulence factors needed to successfully colonize its intestinal niche.
TI  - The WxxxE effector EspT triggers expression of immune mediators in an Erk/JNK and NF-kappaB-dependent manner.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and Citrobacter rodentium colonize their respective hosts while forming attaching and effacing lesions. Their infection strategy relies on translocation of a battery of type III secretion system effectors, including Map, EspM and EspT, which belong to the WxxxE/SopE family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Using the C. rodentium mouse model we found that EspT triggers expression of KC and TNFalpha in vivo. Indeed, a growing body of evidence suggests that, in addition to subversion of actin dynamics, the SopE and the WxxxE effectors activate signalling pathways involved in immune responses. In this study we found that EspT induces expression of the pro-inflammatory mediators cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) an enzyme involved in production of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE2), interleukin (Il)-8 and Il-1beta in U937 human macrophages by activating the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. Since EspT modulates the activation of Cdc42 and Rac1, which mediates bacterial invasion into epithelial cells, we investigated the involvement of these Rho GTPases and bacterial invasion on pro-inflammatory responses and found that (i) Rac1, but not Cdc42, is involved in EspT-induced Il-8 and Il-1beta secretion and (ii) cytochalasin D inhibits EspT-induced EPEC invasion into U937 but not Il-8 or Il-1beta secretion. These results suggest that while EPEC translocates a number of effectors (i.e. NleC, NleD, NleE, NleH) that inhibit inflammation, a subset of strains, which encode EspT, employ an infection strategy that also involves upregulation of immune mediators.
TI  - Attaching and effacing bacterial effector NleC suppresses epithelial inflammatory responses by inhibiting NF-kappaB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli are noninvasive attaching and effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogens that cause intestinal inflammation and severe diarrheal disease. These pathogens utilize a type III secretion system to deliver effector proteins into host epithelial cells, modulating diverse cellular functions, including the release of the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). While studies have implicated the effectors NleE (non-locus of enterocyte effacement [LEE]-encoded effector E) and NleH1 in suppressing IL-8 release, by preventing NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, the impact of these effectors only partially replicates the immunosuppressive actions of wild-type EPEC, suggesting another effector or effectors are involved. Testing an array of EPEC mutants, we identified the non-LEE-encoded effector C (NleC) as also suppressing IL-8 release. Infection by DeltanleC EPEC led to exaggerated IL-8 release from infected Caco-2 and HT-29 epithelial cells. NleC localized to EPEC-induced pedestals, with signaling studies revealing NleC inhibits both NF-kappaB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Using Citrobacter rodentium, a mouse-adapted A/E bacterium, we found that DeltanleC and wild-type C. rodentium-infected mice carried similar pathogen burdens, yet DeltanleC strain infection led to worsened colitis. Similarly, infection with DeltanleC C. rodentium in a cecal loop model induced significantly greater chemokine responses than infection with wild-type bacteria. These studies thus advance our understanding of how A/E pathogens subvert host inflammatory responses.
TI  - Modulation of connexin signaling by bacterial pathogens and their toxins.
AB  - Inherent to their pivotal tasks in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, gap junctions, connexin hemichannels, and pannexin hemichannels are frequently involved in the dysregulation of this critical balance. The present paper specifically focuses on their roles in bacterial infection and disease. In particular, the reported biological outcome of clinically important bacteria including Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, Helicobacter pylori, Bordetella pertussis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter rodentium, Clostridium species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus and their toxic products on connexin- and pannexin-related signaling in host cells is reviewed. Particular attention is paid to the underlying molecular mechanisms of these effects as well as to the actual biological relevance of these findings.
TI  - Long-term selenium deficiency increases the pathogenicity of a Citrobacter rodentium infection in mice.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is a mouse pathogen that causes infectious colitis and shares characteristics with human enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) Escherichia coli, including the ability to cause attaching and effacing lesions in the colon and serves as a useful model to study the pathogenicity of these bacteria. In this study, mice were fed a selenium-deficient diet for 5 or 20 weeks and then infected with C. rodentium. Colonization of the colon by C. rodentium was similar in mice fed adequate or selenium-deficient diets, but total bacterial colonization of the spleen was elevated in mice fed selenium-deficient diet for 20 weeks. Infection-induced changes to the colon included inflammatory cell infiltration, gross changes in crypt architecture, and ulceration and denuding of the epithelial layer that were greatest in mice fed a selenium-deficient diet for 20 weeks. Expression of pro-inflammatory genes was significantly higher 12-days post-infection in mice fed the selenium-deficient diet for 20 weeks compared to mice fed a selenium-adequate diet or selenium-deficient diet for 5 weeks. Diarrhea was prevalent in mice fed the selenium-deficient diet for 20 weeks but not 5 weeks, and this was associated with decreased expression of solute carrier family 26a3 and carbonic anhydrase IV, genes involved in ion transport. These results indicated that selenium played an important role in resistance to the pathological effects of a C. rodentium infection, and therefore, selenium status may be important in the expression of human disease caused by common food-borne bacteria.
TI  - The Nod2 sensor promotes intestinal pathogen eradication via the chemokine CCL2-dependent recruitment of inflammatory monocytes.
AB  - The intracellular sensor Nod2 is activated in response to bacteria, and the impairment of this response is linked to Crohn's disease. However, the function of Nod2 in host defense remains poorly understood. We found that Nod2-/- mice exhibited impaired intestinal clearance of Citrobacter rodentium, an enteric bacterium that models human infection by pathogenic Escherichia coli. The increased bacterial burden was preceded by reduced CCL2 chemokine production, inflammatory monocyte recruitment, and Th1 cell responses in the intestine. Colonic stromal cells, but not epithelial cells or resident CD11b+ phagocytic cells, produced CCL2 in response to C. rodentium in a Nod2-dependent manner. Unlike resident phagocytic cells, inflammatory monocytes produced IL-12, a cytokine that induces adaptive immunity required for pathogen clearance. Adoptive transfer of Ly6C(hi) monocytes restored the clearance of the pathogen in infected Ccr2-/- mice. Thus, Nod2 mediates CCL2-CCR2-dependent recruitment of inflammatory monocytes, which is important in promoting bacterial eradication in the intestine.
TI  - The EHEC type III effector NleL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that modulates pedestal formation.
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 causes hemorrhagic colitis and  may result in potentially fatal hemolytic uremia syndrome in humans. EHEC colonize the intestinal mucosa and promote the formation of actin-rich pedestals via translocated type III effectors. Two EHEC type III secreted effectors, Tir and EspFu/TccP, are key players for pedestal formation. We discovered that an EHEC effector protein called Non-LEE-encoded Ligase (NleL) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. In vitro, we showed that the NleL C753 residue is critical for its E3 ligase activity. Functionally, we demonstrated that NleL E3 ubiquitin ligase activity is involved in modulating Tir-mediated pedestal formation. Surprisingly, EHEC mutant strain deficient in the E3 ligase activity induced more pedestals than the wild-type strain. The canonical EPEC strain E2348/69 normally lacks the nleL gene, and the ectopic expression of the wild-type EHEC nleL, but not the catalytically-deficient nleL(C753A) mutant, in this strain resulted in fewer actin-rich pedestals. Furthermore, we showed that the C. rodentium NleL homolog is a E3 ubiquitin ligase and is required for efficient infection of murine colonic epithelial cells in vivo. In summary, our study demonstrated that EHEC utilizes NleL E3 ubiquitin ligase activity to modulate Tir-mediated pedestal formation.
TI  - Difluoromethylornithine is a novel inhibitor of Helicobacter pylori growth, CagA  translocation, and interleukin-8 induction.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori infects half the world's population, and carriage is lifelong without antibiotic therapy. Current regimens prescribed to prevent infection-associated diseases such as gastroduodenal ulcers and gastric cancer can be thwarted by antibiotic resistance. We reported that administration of 1% D,L-alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) to mice infected with H. pylori reduces gastritis and colonization, which we attributed to enhanced host immune response due to inhibition of macrophage ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis. Although no ODC has been identified in any H. pylori genome, we sought to determine if DFMO has direct effects on the bacterium. We found that DFMO significantly reduced the growth rate of H. pylori in a polyamine-independent manner. Two other gram-negative pathogens possessing ODC, Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium, were resistant to the DFMO effect. The effect of DFMO on H. pylori required continuous exposure to the drug and was reversible when removed, with recovery of growth rate in vitro and the ability to colonize mice. H. pylori exposed to DFMO were significantly shorter in length than those untreated and they contained greater internal levels of ATP, suggesting severe effects on bacterial metabolism. DFMO inhibited expression of the H. pylori virulence factor cytotoxin associated gene A, and its translocation and phosphorylation in gastric epithelial cells, which was associated with a reduction in interleukin-8 expression. These findings suggest that DFMO has effects on H. pylori that may contribute to its effectiveness in reducing gastritis and colonization and may be a useful addition to anti-H. pylori therapies.
TI  - Virulence regulation in Citrobacter rodentium: the art of timing.
AB  - The mouse enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, like its human counterpart, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, causes attaching and effacing lesions in the intestinal epithelium of its host. This phenotype requires virulence factors encoded by the locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island. For timely expression of these virulence determinants at the site of infection and for efficient delivery of some virulence factors into epithelial cells, C. rodentium utilizes a positive regulatory loop involving the LEE-encoded regulatory proteins Ler, GrlA and GrlR to control LEE expression. Several transcription factors not encoded by LEE, some of which respond to specific environmental signals, also participate in this regulatory loop. Recently, we identified a non-LEE encoded, AraC-like regulatory protein, RegA, which plays a key role in the ability of C. rodentium to colonize the intestine. RegA functions by activating the transcription of a number of horizontally acquired operons encoding virulence-associated factors, such as autotransporters, fimbriae, a dispersin-like protein and its transporter. In addition, RegA represses transcription of a number of housekeeping genes. Importantly, RegA requires a gut-specific environmental signal, bicarbonate, to exert its effects on gene expression. In our proposed model, when C. rodentium senses bicarbonate ions in the gastrointestinal tract, RegA directs the bacterium to reduce the production of proteins involved in normal cellular functions, while enhancing the production of factors required for colonization and virulence.
TI  - Enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli type III secretion effector EspV induces radical morphological changes in eukaryotic cells.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are important human pathogens that rely on translocation of type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors for subversion of signal transduction pathways and colonization of the mammalian gut mucosa. While a core set of effectors is conserved between EPEC and EHEC strains, a growing number of accessory effectors that were found at various frequencies in clinical and environmental isolates have been recently identified. Recent genome projects identified espV as a pseudogene in EHEC but a putative functional gene in EPEC strains E110019 and E22 and the closely related mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of espV among clinical EPEC and EHEC strains and to investigate its function and role in pathogenesis. espV was found in 16% of the tested strains. While deletion of espV from C. rodentium did not affect colonization dynamics or fitness in mixed infections, expression of EspV in mammalian cells led to drastic morphological alterations, which were characterized by nuclear condensation, cell rounding, and formation of dendrite-like projections. Expression of EspV in yeast resulted in a dramatic increase in cell size and irreversible growth arrest. Although the role of EspV in infection and its target host cell protein(s) require further investigation, the data point to a novel mechanism by which the T3SS subverts cell signaling.
TI  - A small-molecule inhibitor of the bacterial type III secretion system protects against in vivo infection with Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - The type III secretion system (T3SS) is highly conserved in many Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria and functions as an injector of bacterial proteins (effectors) into host cells. T3SSs are involved in establishing disease processes, but this machinery is not essential for bacterial growth or homeostasis. Thus, T3SS is expected to be a candidate therapeutic target, and inhibitors of T3SSs could potentially reduce virulence without causing bacterial death, thereby avoiding any subsequent development of resistance. We identified a linear polyketide compound, aurodox, as a specific T3SS inhibitor from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. using a screening system for the T3SS-mediated hemolysis of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) established by our group. Aurodox strongly inhibited T3SS-mediated hemolysis with an IC(50) value of 1.5 mug ml(-1) without affecting bacterial growth in liquid media. We also demonstrated that aurodox specifically inhibits the secretion of type III-secreted proteins such as EspB, EspF and Map, without affecting the expression of the housekeeping protein GroEL. Furthermore, an in vivo infection study using mice clearly indicated that the administration of aurodox allowed the mice to survive a lethal dose of Citrobactor rodentium, a model bacterium for human pathogens such as EPEC. Thus, our in vivo study directly demonstrated for the first time that this putative T3SS inhibitor can be applied as a novel class of anti-infective agents.
TI  - EspJ effector in enterohemorrhagic E. coli translocates into host mitochondria via an atypical mitochondrial targeting signal.
AB  - EHEC is a bacterial pathogen causing diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis in humans.  To exert virulence, EHEC exploits a subset of effectors that are translocated into host cells via the type III secretion system. EspJ, which was recently identified as a type III secreted effector, is conserved in related pathogens such as EPEC and Citrobacter rodentium. However, the exact function of EspJ remains unclear. In the present study, we found that EspJ was unstable in host cells, which might be attributable to the N-terminal part beginning from amino acid number 59. Using stable forms of EspJ derivatives, we demonstrated for the first time that EspJ has the ability to translocate into mitochondria via an atypical mitochondrial targeting signal at the N terminus (1-36 a.a.) of EspJ. It has been reported that a mitochondrial targeting effector, EspF, disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in an induction of host cell death. To further investigate EspJ function in mitochondria, HeLa cells were infected with wild-type EPEC, an isogenic EspJ-mutant or an EspJ-overexpressing strain. The result of LDH release assay using an EspJ-mutant showed that the EspJ effector appears not to be involved in cytotoxicity.
TI  - Muc2 protects against lethal infectious colitis by disassociating pathogenic and  commensal bacteria from the colonic mucosa.
AB  - Despite recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of attaching and effacing (A/E) Escherichia coli infections, the mechanisms by which the host defends against these microbes are unclear. The goal of this study was to determine the role of goblet cell-derived Muc2, the major intestinal secretory mucin and primary component of the mucus layer, in host protection against A/E pathogens. To assess the role of Muc2 during A/E bacterial infections, we inoculated Muc2 deficient (Muc2(-/-)) mice with Citrobacter rodentium, a murine A/E pathogen related to diarrheagenic A/E E. coli. Unlike wildtype (WT) mice, infected Muc2(-/-) mice exhibited rapid weight loss and suffered up to 90% mortality. Stool plating demonstrated 10-100 fold greater C. rodentium burdens in Muc2(-/-) vs. WT mice, most of which were found to be loosely adherent to the colonic mucosa. Histology of Muc2(-/-) mice revealed ulceration in the colon amid focal bacterial microcolonies. Metabolic labeling of secreted mucins in the large intestine demonstrated that mucin secretion was markedly increased in WT mice during infection compared to uninfected controls, suggesting that the host uses increased mucin release to flush pathogens from the mucosal surface. Muc2 also impacted host-commensal interactions during infection, as FISH analysis revealed C. rodentium microcolonies contained numerous commensal microbes, which was not observed in WT mice. Orally administered FITC-Dextran and FISH staining showed significantly worsened intestinal barrier disruption in Muc2(-/-) vs. WT mice, with overt pathogen and commensal translocation into the Muc2(-/-) colonic mucosa. Interestingly, commensal depletion enhanced C. rodentium colonization of Muc2(-/-) mice, although colonic pathology was not significantly altered. In conclusion, Muc2 production is critical for host protection during A/E bacterial infections, by limiting overall pathogen and commensal numbers associated with the colonic mucosal surface. Such actions limit tissue damage and translocation of pathogenic and commensal bacteria across the epithelium.
TI  - Transcriptional analysis of the grlRA virulence operon from Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - The locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE) is the virulence hallmark of the attaching-and-effacing (A/E) intestinal pathogens, namely, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, and Citrobacter rodentium. The LEE carries more than 40 genes that are arranged in several operons, e.g., LEE1 to LEE5. Expression of the various transcriptional units is subject to xenogeneic silencing by the histone-like protein H-NS. The LEE1-encoded regulator, Ler, plays a key role in relieving this repression at several major LEE promoters, including LEE2 to LEE5. To achieve appropriate intracellular concentrations of Ler in different environments, A/E pathogens have evolved a sophisticated regulatory network to control ler expression. For example, the LEE-encoded GrlA and GrlR proteins work as activator and antiactivator, respectively, of ler transcription. Thus, control of the transcriptional activities of the LEE1 (ler) promoter and the grlRA operon determines the rate of transcription of all of the LEE-encoded virulence factors. To date, only a single promoter has been identified for the grlRA operon. In this study, we showed that the non-LEE-encoded AraC-like regulatory protein RegA of C. rodentium directly stimulates transcription of the grlRA promoter by binding to an upstream region in the presence of bicarbonate ions. In addition, in vivo and in vitro transcription assays revealed a sigma(70) promoter that is specifically responsible for transcription of grlA. Expression from this promoter was strongly repressed by H-NS and its paralog StpA but was activated by Ler. DNase I footprinting demonstrated that Ler binds to a region upstream of the grlA promoter, whereas H-NS interacts specifically with a region extending from the grlA core promoter into its coding sequence. Together, these findings provide new insights into the environmental regulation and differential expressions of the grlR and grlA genes of C. rodentium.
TI  - Efa-1/LifA mediates intestinal colonization of calves by enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O26 : H- in a manner independent of glycosyltransferase and cysteine protease motifs or effects on type III secretion.
AB  - Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) comprise a group of animal and zoonotic pathogens of worldwide importance. Our previous research established that intestinal colonization of calves by EHEC serotypes O5 : H- and O111 : H- requires EHEC factor for adherence (Efa-1), also known as lymphostatin (LifA). Towards an understanding of the mode of action of Efa-1/LifA, chromosomal in-frame deletions of predicted glycosyltransferase (DXD) and cysteine protease (CHD) motifs were created in a Deltastx1 derivative of EHEC O26 : H-. The magnitude and duration of faecal excretion of EHEC O26 : H- were significantly reduced by null mutation of efa-1/lifA, but were not impaired by DeltaDXD or DeltaCHD mutations, in contrast to observations made with truncated Efa-1/LifA mutants of Citrobacter rodentium in mice. Although C. rodentium Efa-1/LifA influences the induction of colonic hyperplasia in mice, EHEC O26 : H- Efa-1/LifA was not required for fluid accumulation or neutrophil recruitment in bovine ileal loops. In contrast to observations with EHEC O5 : H- or O111 : H- mutants, inactivation of efa-1/lifA in EHEC O26 : H- did not significantly affect adherence or secretion of type III secreted proteins that play pivotal roles in calf colonization. Lymphostatin activity could not be reliably demonstrated in lysates of EHEC O26 : H-; however, deletion of the glycosyltransferase and cysteine protease motifs in Efa-1/LifA from enteropathogenic E. coli O127 : H6 abolished lymphostatin activity. Our data uncouple the role of Efa-1/LifA in calf colonization from effects on type III secretion and reinforce the potential for pathotype- and serotype-specific phenotypes.
TI  - The role of lymphostatin/EHEC factor for adherence-1 in the pathogenesis of gram  negative infection.
AB  - Lymphostatin/EHEC factor for adherence-1 is a novel large toxin represented in various Gram negative bacteria, highly associated with the development of infectious diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome. In vitro and in vivo experiments identified lymphostatin/EFA-1 as a toxin with a central role in the pathogenesis of Gram negative bacteria, responsible for bacterial adhesion, intestinal colonization, immunosuppression, and disruption of gut epithelial barrier function.
TI  - Gamma interferon produced by antigen-specific CD4+ T cells regulates the mucosal  immune responses to Citrobacter rodentium infection.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium, a murine model pathogen for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, colonizes the surface of intestinal epithelial cells and causes mucosal inflammation. This bacterium is an ideal model for investigating pathogen-host immune interactions in the gut. It is well known that gene transcripts for Th1 cytokines are highly induced in colonic tissue from mice infected with C. rodentium. However, it remains to be seen whether the Th1 or Th2 cytokines produced by antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells provide effective regulation of the host immune defense against C. rodentium infection. To investigate the antigen-specific immune responses, C. rodentium expressing ovalbumin (OVA-C. rodentium), a model antigen, was generated and used to define antigen-specific responses under gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-deficient or interleukin-4 (IL-4)-deficient conditions in vivo. The activation of antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells and macrophage phagocytosis were evaluated in the presence of IFN-gamma or IL-4 in vitro. IFN-gamma-deficient mice exhibited a loss of body weight and a higher bacterial concentration in feces during OVA-C. rodentium infection than C57BL/6 (wild type) or IL-4-deficient mice. This occurred through the decreased efficiency of macrophage phagocytosis and the activation of antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, a deficiency in antigen-specific CD4(+) T-cell-expressed IFN-gamma led to a higher susceptibility to mucosal and gut-derived systemic OVA-C. rodentium infection. These results show that the IFN-gamma produced by antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells plays an important role in the defense against C. rodentium.
TI  - Determination of bacterial antibiotic resistance based on osmotic shock response.
AB  - We investigate the buoyant mass of bacterial cells in real time with the suspended microchannel resonator (SMR) as the population recovers from an osmotic shock. The density of the culture medium is chosen such that the bacteria initially have a positive buoyant mass which becomes negative as they recover from the hyperosmotic stress. This behavior can be used to differentiate between an antibiotic-resistant and an antibiotic-susceptible strain of the pathogenic bacteria Citrobacter rodentium, and we propose a general approach for exploiting the high precision of the SMR for rapid detection of antibiotic resistance.
TI  - A bacterial effector targets host DH-PH domain RhoGEFs and antagonizes macrophage phagocytosis.
AB  - Bacterial pathogens often harbour a type III secretion system (TTSS) that injects effector proteins into eukaryotic cells to manipulate host processes and cause diseases. Identification of host targets of bacterial effectors and revealing their mechanism of actions are crucial for understating bacterial virulence. We show that EspH, a type III effector conserved in enteric bacterial pathogens including enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohaemorrhagic E. coli and Citrobacter rodentium, markedly disrupts actin cytoskeleton structure and induces cell rounding up when ectopically expressed or delivered into HeLa cells by the bacterial TTSS. EspH inactivates host Rho GTPase signalling pathway at the level of RhoGEF. EspH directly binds the DH-PH domain in multiple RhoGEFs, which prevents their binding to Rho and thereby inhibits nucleotide exchange-mediated Rho activation. Consistently, infection of mouse macrophages with EPEC harbouring EspH attenuates phagocytosis of the bacteria as well as FcgammaR-mediated phagocytosis. EspH represents the first example of targeting RhoGEFs by bacterial effectors, and our results also reveal an unprecedented mechanism used by enteric pathogens to counteract the host defence system.
TI  - NleH effectors interact with Bax inhibitor-1 to block apoptosis during enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infection.
AB  - The human pathogens enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and the related mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium subvert a variety of host cell signaling pathways via their plethora of type III secreted effectors, including triggering of an early apoptotic response. EPEC-infected cells do not develop late apoptotic symptoms, however. In this study we demonstrate that the NleH family effectors, homologs of the Shigella effector kinase OspG, blocks apoptosis. During EPEC infection, NleH effectors inhibit elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations, nuclear condensation, caspase-3 activation, and membrane blebbing and promote cell survival. NleH1 alone is sufficient to prevent procaspase-3 cleavage induced by the proapoptotic compounds staurosporine, brefeldin A, and tunicamycin. Using C. rodentium, we found that NleH inhibits procaspase-3 cleavage at the bacterial attachment sites in vivo. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified the endoplasmic reticulum six-transmembrane protein Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) as an NleH-interacting partner. We mapped the NleH-binding site to the N-terminal 40 amino acids of BI-1. Knockdown of BI-1 resulted in the loss of NleH's antiapoptotic activity. These results indicate that NleH effectors are inhibitors of apoptosis that may act through BI-1 to carry out their cytoprotective function.
TI  - Determination of spatial and temporal colonization of enteropathogenic E. coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli in mice using bioluminescent in vivo imaging.
AB  - Infectious diarrhea is a major contributor of child morbidity and mortality in developing nations. Murine models to study the pathogenesis of infectious diarrhea caused by organisms such as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are not fully characterized. More emphasis has been placed on infection of mice with the murine specific pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. While these three organisms are genetically related they are not identical. Our goal was to better characterize the murine model of EPEC and EHEC infection by using bioluminescent bacteria to determine temporal and spatial colonization of these two human pathogens. EPEC and EHEC were transformed with a bacterial luciferase expression plasmid containing the constitutive OmpC promoter. C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with bioluminescent EPEC or EHEC and bacterial localization in the intestine was monitored ex vivo and in vivo by IVIS. At 3 days after infection, EPEC, EHEC and Citrobacter rodentium were all localized in the cecum and colon. EPEC colonization peaked at day 2-3 and was undetectable by day 7. The bioluminescent EPEC adheres to the cecum and colon of the mouse intestine. However, when EPEC infected mice were administered xylazine/ketamine for in vivo live imaging, the EPEC persisted at high densities for up to 31 days. This is the first report of a bioluminescent imaging of luciferase expressing EPEC in a mouse model.
TI  - A comprehensive proteomic analysis of the type III secretome of Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, and Citrobacter rodentium belong to the family of attaching and effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogens. They intimately attach to host intestinal epithelial cells, trigger the effacement of intestinal microvilli, and cause diarrheal disease. Central to their pathogenesis is a type III secretion system (T3SS) encoded by a pathogenicity island called the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). The T3SS is used to inject both LEE- and non-LEE-encoded effector proteins into the host cell, where these effectors modulate host signaling pathways and immune responses. Identifying the effectors and elucidating their functions are central to understanding the molecular pathogenesis of these pathogens. Here we analyzed the type III secretome of C. rodentium using the highly sensitive and quantitative SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture)-based mass spectrometry. This approach not only confirmed nearly all known secreted proteins and effectors previously identified by conventional biochemical and proteomic techniques, but also identified several new secreted proteins. The T3SS-dependent secretion of these new proteins was validated, and five of them were translocated into cultured cells, representing new or additional effectors. Deletion mutants for genes encoding these effectors were generated in C. rodentium and tested in a murine infection model. This study comprehensively characterizes the type III secretome of C. rodentium, expands the repertoire of type III secreted proteins and effectors for the A/E pathogens, and demonstrates the simplicity and sensitivity of using SILAC-based quantitative proteomics as a tool for identifying substrates for protein secretion systems.
TI  - Gut barrier disruption by an enteric bacterial pathogen accelerates insulitis in  NOD mice.
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Increased exposure to enteric microbes as a result of intestinal barrier disruption is thought to contribute to the development of several intestinal inflammatory diseases; however, it less clear whether such exposure modulates the development of extra-intestinal inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The goal of this study was to examine the potential role of pathogenic enteric microbes and intestinal barrier dysfunction in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Using NOD mice, we assessed: (1) intrinsic barrier function in mice at different ages by measuring serum levels of FITC-labelled dextran; and (2) the impact on insulitis development of infection by strains of an enteric bacterial pathogen (Citrobacter rodentium) either capable (wild-type) or incapable (lacking Escherichia coli secreted protein F virulence factor owing to deletion of the gene [DeltaespF]) of causing intestinal epithelial barrier disruption. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that prediabetic (12-week-old) NOD mice display increased intestinal permeability compared with non-obese diabetes-resistant and C57BL/6 mice. We also found that young (4-week-old) NOD mice infected with wild-type C. rodentium exhibited accelerated development of insulitis in concert with infection-induced barrier disruption. In contrast, insulitis development was not altered in NOD mice infected with the non-barrier-disrupting DeltaespF strain. Moreover, C. rodentium-infected NOD mice demonstrated increased activation and proliferation of pancreatic-draining lymph node T cells, including diabetogenic CD8(+) T cells, compared with uninfected NOD mice. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This is the first demonstration that a loss of intestinal barrier integrity caused by an enteric bacterial pathogen results in the activation of diabetogenic CD8(+) T cells and modulates insulitis.
TI  - Detergent-resistant microdomains mediate activation of host cell signaling in response to attaching-effacing bacteria.
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 causes outbreaks of bloody diarrhea and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. EHEC intimately adheres to epithelial cells, effaces microvilli and induces attaching-effacing (AE) lesions. Detergent-resistant microdomains (lipid rafts) serve as membrane platforms for the recruitment of signaling complexes to mediate host responses to infection. The aim of this study was to define the role of lipid rafts in activating signal transduction pathways in response to AE bacterial pathogens. Epithelial cell monolayers were infected with EHEC (MOI 100:1, 3 h, 37 degrees C) and lipid rafts isolated by buoyant density ultracentrifugation. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) localization to lipid rafts was confirmed using PI3K and anti-caveolin-1 antibodies. Mice with cholesterol storage disease Niemann-Pick, type C were used as in vivo models to confirm the role of lipid rafts in mediating signaling response to AE organisms. In contrast to uninfected cells, PI3K was recruited to lipid rafts in response to EHEC infection. Metabolically active bacteria and cells with intact cholesterol-rich microdomains were necessary for the recruitment of second messengers to lipid rafts. Recruitment of PI3K to lipid rafts was independent of the intimin (eaeA) gene, type III secretion system, and production of Shiga-like toxins. Colonization of NPC(-/-) colonic mucosa by Citrobacter rodentium and AE lesion formation were both delayed, compared with wild-type mice infected with the murine-specific AE bacterial pathogen. C. rodentium-infected NPC(-/-) mice had reduced colonic epithelial hyperplasia (64+/-8.251 vs 112+/-2.958 microm; P<0.05) and decreased secretion of IFN-gamma (17.6+/-17.6 vs 71+/-26.3 pg/ml, P<0.001). Lipid rafts mediate host cell signal transduction responses to AE bacterial infections both in vitro and in vivo. These findings advance the current understanding of microbial-eukaryotic cell interactions in response to enteric pathogens that hijack signaling responses mediated through lipid rafts.
TI  - The Citrobacter rodentium genome sequence reveals convergent evolution with human pathogenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium (formally Citrobacter freundii biotype 4280) is a highly infectious pathogen that causes colitis and transmissible colonic hyperplasia in mice. In common with enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHEC, respectively), C. rodentium exploits a type III secretion system (T3SS) to induce attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions that are essential for virulence. Here, we report the fully annotated genome sequence of the 5.3-Mb chromosome and four plasmids harbored by C. rodentium strain ICC168. The genome sequence revealed key information about the phylogeny of C. rodentium and identified 1,585 C. rodentium-specific (without orthologues in EPEC or EHEC) coding sequences, 10 prophage-like regions, and 17 genomic islands, including the locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE) region, which encodes a T3SS and effector proteins. Among the 29 T3SS effectors found in C. rodentium are all 22 of the core effectors of EPEC strain E2348/69. In addition, we identified a novel C. rodentium effector, named EspS. C. rodentium harbors two type VI secretion systems (T6SS) (CTS1 and CTS2), while EHEC contains only one T6SS (EHS). Our analysis suggests that C. rodentium and EPEC/EHEC have converged on a common host infection strategy through access to a common pool of mobile DNA and that C. rodentium has lost gene functions associated with a previous pathogenic niche.
TI  - Dissecting the role of the Tir:Nck and Tir:IRTKS/IRSp53 signalling pathways in vivo.
AB  - Attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions and actin polymerization, the hallmark of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and Citrobacter rodentium (CR) infections, are dependent on the effector Tir. Phosphorylation of Tir(EPEC/CR) Y474/1 leads to recruitment of Nck and neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and strong actin polymerization in cultured cells. Tir(EPEC/CR) also contains an Asn-Pro-Tyr (NPY(454/1)) motif, which triggers weak actin polymerization. In EHEC the NPY(458) actin polymerization pathway is amplified by TccP/EspF(U), which is recruited to Tir via IRSp53 and/or insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (IRTKS). Here we used C. rodentium to investigate the different Tir signalling pathways in vivo. Following infection with wild-type C. rodentium IRTKS, but not IRSp53, was recruited to the bacterial attachment sites. Similar results were seen after infection of human ileal explants with EHEC. Mutating Y471 or Y451 in Tir(CR) abolished recruitment of Nck and IRTKS respectively, but did not affect recruitment of N-WASP or A/E lesion formation. This suggests that despite their crucial role in actin polymerization in cultured cells the Tir:Nck and Tir:IRTKS pathways are not essential for N-WASP recruitment or A/E lesion formation in vivo. Importantly, wild-type C. rodentium out-competed the tir tyrosine mutants during mixed infections. These results uncouple the Tir:Nck and Tir:IRTKS pathways from A/E lesion formation in vivo but assign them an important in vivo role.
TI  - Bicarbonate-mediated stimulation of RegA, the global virulence regulator from Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - The global virulence regulatory protein RegA, an AraC-like regulator, controls the expression of more than 60 genes in the mouse enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. In the presence of bicarbonate, RegA activates the transcription of a number of virulence determinants and inhibits the expression of a series of housekeeping genes. To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which bicarbonate stimulates RegA activity, we carried out biophysical and mutational analyses. Our data indicate that RegA exists as a dimer in solution regardless of bicarbonate concentration. A leucine zipper, located in the region downstream of the N-terminal domain, is responsible for dimerisation. The N-terminal arm itself is involved in modulating the response to bicarbonate, which appears to bind to a region comprising a series of beta-sheets within the N-terminal domain. The presence of bicarbonate relieves the autoinhibition of RegA activity by its N-terminal arm. RegA is the first example of a bacterial virulence regulator that utilises the light switch mechanism, previously described for the Escherichia coli AraC protein, to respond to a gut-associated effector that controls its activity.
TI  - Gap junction hemichannels contribute to the generation of diarrhoea during infectious enteric disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, enteropathogenic E coli and Citrobacter rodentium colonise intestinal tracts, attach to enterocytes, collapse infected cell microvilli and alter numerous host cell processes during infection. Enterocyte alterations result in numerous small molecules being released from host cells that likely contribute to diarrhoeal phenotypes observed during these infections. One possible route for small molecules to be released from intestinal cells may be through functional gap junction hemichannels. Here we examine the involvement of these hemichannels during the diarrhoeal disease caused by A/E pathogens in vivo. DESIGN: Mice were infected with the diarrhoea-causing murine A/E pathogen C rodentium for 7 days. Connexin43 (Cx43) protein levels and immunolocalization in the colon were initially used to determine alterations during A/E bacterial infections in vivo. Connexin mimetic peptides and connexin permeable tracer molecules were used to gage the presence and function of unpaired connexin hemichannels. The role of Cx43 in diarrhoea generation was assessed by comparing infections of wild-type mice to Cx43 mutant mice and determining the water abundance in the colonic luminal material. RESULTS: We demonstrate that Cx43 protein levels are increased in colonocytes during in vivo A/E bacterial infections, resulting in functionally open connexon hemichannels in apical membranes of infected cells. moreover, infected Cx43 +/- mice do not suffer from diarrhoeal disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that functional connexon hemichannels can occur in the intestine and are a novel molecular mechanism of water release during infectious diarrhoea.
TI  - CXCR2-dependent mucosal neutrophil influx protects against colitis-associated diarrhea caused by an attaching/effacing lesion-forming bacterial pathogen.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a major cause of diarrheal disease in young children, yet symptoms and duration are highly variable for unknown reasons. Citrobacter rodentium, a murine model pathogen that shares important functional features with EPEC, colonizes mice in colon and cecum and causes inflammation, but typically little or no diarrhea. We conducted genome-wide microarray studies to define mechanisms of host defense and disease in C. rodentium infection. A significant fraction of the genes most highly induced in the colon by infection encoded CXC chemokines, particularly CXCL1/2/5 and CXCL9/10, which are ligands for the chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR3, respectively. CD11b(+) dendritic cells were the major producers of CXCL1, CXCL5, and CXCL9, while CXCL2 was mainly induced in macrophages. Infection of gene-targeted mice revealed that CXCR3 had a significant but modest role in defense against C. rodentium, whereas CXCR2 had a major and indispensable function. CXCR2 was required for normal mucosal influx of neutrophils, which act as direct antibacterial effectors. Moreover, CXCR2 loss led to severe diarrhea and failure to express critical components of normal ion and fluid transport, including ATPase beta(2)-subunit, CFTR, and DRA. The antidiarrheal functions were unique to CXCR2, since other immune defects leading to increased bacterial load and inflammation did not cause diarrhea. Thus, CXCR2-dependent processes, particularly mucosal neutrophil influx, not only contribute to host defense against C. rodentium, but provide protection against infection-associated diarrhea.
TI  - Vasoactive intestinal peptide ameliorates intestinal barrier disruption associated with Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis.
AB  - Attaching and effacing bacterial pathogens attach to the apical surface of epithelial cells and disrupt epithelial barrier function, increasing permeability and allowing luminal contents access to the underlying milieu. Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) regulates epithelial paracellular permeability, and the high concentrations and close proximity of VIP-containing nerve fibers to intestinal epithelial cells would support such a function in vivo. The aim of this study was to examine whether VIP treatment modulated Citrobacter rodentium-induced disruption of intestinal barrier integrity and to identify potential mechanisms of action. Administration of VIP had no effect on bacterial attachment although histopathological scoring demonstrated a VIP-induced amelioration of colitis-induced epithelial damage compared with controls. VIP treatment prevented the infection-induced increase in mannitol flux a measure of paracellular permeability, resulting in levels similar to control mice, and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VIP prevented the translocation of tight junction proteins: zonula occludens-1, occludin, and claudin-3. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infection of Caco-2 monolayers confirmed a protective role for VIP on epithelial barrier function. VIP prevented EPEC-induced increase in long myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) expression and myosin light chain phosphorylation (p-MLC). Furthermore, MLCK inhibition significantly attenuated bacterial-induced epithelial damage both in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, our results indicate that VIP protects the colonic epithelial barrier by minimizing bacterial-induced redistribution of tight junction proteins in part through actions on MLCK and MLC phosphorylation.
TI  - Pathogenic bacteria induce colonic PepT1 expression: an implication in host defense response.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Expression of the di/tripeptide transporter PepT1 has been observed in the colon under inflammatory conditions; however, the inducing factors and underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we address the effects of pathogenic bacteria on colonic PepT1 expression together with its functional consequences. METHODS: Human colonic HT29-Cl.19A cells were infected with the attaching and effacing enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). Wild-type and PepT1 transgenic mice or cultured colonic tissues derived from these mice were infected with Citrobacter rodentium, a murine attaching and effacing pathogen related to EPEC. RESULTS: EPEC induced PepT1 expression and activity in HT29-Cl.19A cells by intimately attaching to host cells through lipid rafts. Induction of PepT1 expression by EPEC required the transcription factor Cdx2. PepT1 expression reduced binding of EPEC to lipid rafts, as well as activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase and production of interleukin-8. Accordingly, ex vivo and in vivo experiments revealed that C rodentium induced colonic PepT1 expression and that, compared with their wild-type counterparts, PepT1 transgenic mice infected with C rodentium exhibited decreased bacterial colonization, production of proinflammatory cytokines, and neutrophil infiltration into the colon. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of colonic PepT1 expression under pathologic conditions and reveal a novel role for PepT1 in host defense via its capacity to modulate bacterial-epithelial interactions and intestinal inflammation.
TI  - Decreased expression of colonic Slc26a3 and carbonic anhydrase iv as a cause of fatal infectious diarrhea in mice.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium causes epithelial hyperplasia and colitis and is used as a  model for enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infections. Little or no mortality develops in most inbred strains of mice, but C3H and FVB/N mice exhibit fatal outcomes of infection. Here we test the hypothesis that decreased intestinal transport activity during C. rodentium infection results in fatality in C3H/HeOu and FVB/N mice. Susceptible strains were compared to resistant C57BL/6 mice and to inbred strains SWR and SJL of Swiss origin, which have not been previously characterized for outcomes of C. rodentium infection. Mortality in susceptible strains C3H/HeOu and FVB/N was associated with significant fluid loss in feces, a remarkable downregulation of Slc26a3 and carbonic anhydrase IV (CAIV) message and protein expression, retention of chloride in stool, and hypochloremia, suggesting defects in intestinal chloride absorption. SWR, SJL, and C57BL/6 mice were resistant and survived the infection. Fluid therapy fully prevented mortality in C3H/HeOu and FVB/N mice without affecting clinical disease. Common pathogenic mechanisms, such as decreased levels of expression of Slc26a3 and CAIV, affect intestinal ion transport in C. rodentium-infected FVB and C3H mice, resulting in profound electrolyte loss, dehydration, and mortality. Intestinal chloride absorption pathways are likely a potential target for the treatment of infectious diarrhea.
TI  - Distribution of espM and espT among enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli.
AB  - Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) translocate dozens of type III secretion system effectors, including the WxxxE effectors Map, EspM and EspT that activate Rho GTPases. While map, which is carried on the LEE pathogenicity island, is absolutely conserved among EPEC and EHEC strains, the prevalence of espM and espT is not known. Here we report the results of a large screen aimed at determining the prevalence of espM and espT among clinical EPEC and EHEC isolates. The results suggest that espM, detected in 51 % of the tested strains, is more commonly found in EPEC and EHEC serogroups that are linked to severe human infections. In contrast, espT was absent from all the EHEC isolates and was found in only 1.8 % of the tested EPEC strains. Further characterization of the virulence gene repertoire of the espT-positive strains led to the identification of a new zeta2 intimin variant. All the espT-positive strains but two contained the tccP gene. espT was first found in Citrobacter rodentium and later in silico in EPEC E110019, which is of particular interest as this strain was responsible for a particularly severe diarrhoeal outbreak in Finland in 1987 that affected 650 individuals in a school complex and an additional 137 associated household members. Comparing the protein sequences of EspT to that of E110019 showed a high level of conservation, with only three strains encoding EspT that differed in 6 amino acids. At present, it is not clear why espT is so rare, and what impact EspM and EspT have on EPEC and EHEC infection.
TI  - Bacteria hijack integrin-linked kinase to stabilize focal adhesions and block cell detachment.
AB  - The rapid turnover and exfoliation of mucosal epithelial cells provides an innate defence system against bacterial infection. Nevertheless, many pathogenic bacteria, including Shigella, are able to surmount exfoliation and colonize the epithelium efficiently. Here we show that the Shigella flexneri effector OspE (consisting of OspE1 and OspE2 proteins), which is highly conserved among enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterohaemorrhagic E. coli, Citrobacter rodentium and Salmonella strains, reinforces host cell adherence to the basement membrane by interacting with integrin-linked kinase (ILK). The number of focal adhesions was augmented along with membrane fraction ILK by ILK-OspE binding. The interaction between ILK and OspE increased cell surface levels of 1 integrin and suppressed phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin, which are required for rapid turnover of focal adhesion in cell motility. Nocodazole-washout-induced focal adhesion disassembly was blocked by expression of OspE. Polarized epithelial cells infected with a Shigella mutant lacking the ospE gene underwent more rapid cell detachment than cells infected with wild-type Shigella. Infection of guinea pig colons with Shigella corroborated the pivotal role of the OspE-ILK interaction in suppressing epithelial detachment, increasing bacterial cell-to-cell spreading, and promoting bacterial colonization. These results indicate that Shigella sustain their infectious foothold by using special tactics to prevent detachment of infected cells.
TI  - Genomic analysis of the PAI ICL3 locus in pathogenic LEE-negative Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) causes a spectrum of human illnesses such as haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic-uraemic syndrome. Although the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) seems to confer enhanced virulence, LEE-negative STEC strains are also associated with severe human disease, suggesting that other unknown factors enhance the virulence potential of STEC strains. A novel hybrid pathogenicity island, termed PAI I(CL3), has been previously characterized in the LEE-negative O113 : H21 STEC strain CL3. Screening for the presence of PAI I(CL3) elements in 469 strains of E. coli, including attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens [enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC)], non-A/E pathogens [LEE-negative STEC, extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC)] and commensal E. coli isolates, showed that PAI I(CL3) is unique to LEE-negative STEC strains linked to disease, providing a new marker for these strains. We also showed that a PAI I(CL3)-equivalent gene cluster is present in the genome of Citrobacter rodentium, on a 53 kb genomic island inserted into the pheV tRNA locus. While the C. rodentium PAI I(CL3) shows high similarities at the nucleotide level and in organization with the E. coli PAI I(CL3), the genetic context of the integration differs completely. In addition, blast searches revealed that other E. coli pathotypes (O157 : H7 EHEC, ExPEC, EPEC and EAEC) possess incomplete PAI I(CL3) elements that contain only the genes located at the extremities of the island. Six of the 16 sequenced E. coli genomes showed deleted PAI I(CL3) gene clusters which are carried on mobile genetic elements inserted into pheV, selC or serW tRNA loci, which is compatible with the idea that the PAI I(CL3) gene cluster entered E. coli and C. rodentium at multiple times through independent events. The phylogenetic distribution of the PAI I(CL3) variants suggests that a B1 genetic background is necessary for the maintenance of the full complement of PAI I(CL3) genes in E. coli.
TI  - Innate immune recognition of infected apoptotic cells directs T(H)17 cell differentiation.
AB  - Adaptive immune responses rely on differentiation of CD4 T helper cells into subsets with distinct effector functions best suited for host defence against the invading pathogen. Interleukin (IL)-17-producing T helper cells (T(H)17) are a recently identified subset, separate from the T helper type 1 (T(H)1) and T helper type 2 (T(H)2) subsets. Synergy between the cytokines transforming growth factor-beta and IL-6 in vitro induces development of T(H)17 cells in mouse and human systems, whereas IL-23 supports expansion of these cells. However, it is not known which conditions in vivo would induce this combination of cytokines. Furthermore, it is enigmatic that a combination of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines would be required to generate an effector T(H)17 response. Here we show that the relevant physiological stimulus triggering this combination of cytokines is the recognition and phagocytosis of infected apoptotic cells by dendritic cells. Phagocytosis of infected apoptotic cells uniquely triggers the combination of IL-6 and transforming growth factor-beta through recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and phosphatidylserine exposed on apoptotic cells, respectively. Conversely, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in the absence of microbial signals induces differentiation of the closely related regulatory T cells, which are important for controlling autoimmunity. Blocking apoptosis during infection of the mouse intestinal epithelium with the rodent pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, which models human infections with the attaching and effacing enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, impairs the characteristic T(H)17 response in the lamina propria. Our results demonstrate that infected apoptotic cells are a critical component of the innate immune signals instructing T(H)17 differentiation, and point to pathogens particularly adept at triggering apoptosis that might preferentially induce T(H)17-mediated immunity. Because T(H)17 cells have been correlated with autoimmune diseases, investigation of the pathways of innate recognition of infected apoptotic cells might lead to improved understanding of the causative defects in autoimmunity.
TI  - Contribution of the pst-phoU operon to cell adherence by atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and virulence of Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) generally employ the adhesins bundle-forming pili (Bfp) and intimin to colonize the intestine. Atypical EPEC strains possess intimin but are negative for Bfp and, yet, are able to cause disease. To identify alternative adhesins to Bfp in atypical EPEC, we constructed a transposon mutant library of atypical EPEC strain E128012 (serotype O114:H2) using TnphoA. Six mutants that had lost the ability to adhere to HEp-2 cells were identified, and in all six mutants TnphoA had inserted into the pstSCAB-phoU (Pst) operon. To determine if the Pst operon is required for adherence, we used site-directed mutagenesis to construct a pstCA mutant of E128012. The resultant mutant showed a reduced ability to adhere to HEp-2 cells and T84 intestinal epithelial cells, which was restored by trans-complementation with intact pstCA. To determine if pst contributes to bacterial colonization in vivo, a pstCA mutation was made in the EPEC-like murine pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. C57BL/6 mice infected perorally with the pstCA mutant of C. rodentium excreted significantly lower numbers of C. rodentium than those given the wild-type strain. Moreover, colonic hyperplasia and diarrhea, which are features of infections with C. rodentium, were not observed in mice infected with the pstCA mutant but did occur in mice given the trans-complemented mutant. As mutations in pst genes generally lead to constitutive expression of the Pho regulon, our findings suggested that the Pho regulon may contribute to the reduced virulence of the pstCA mutants. To investigate this, we inactivated phoB in the pstCA mutants of EPEC E128012 and C. rodentium and found that the phoB mutation restored the adherent phenotype of both mutant strains. These results demonstrate that Pst contributes to the virulence of atypical EPEC and C. rodentium, probably by causing increased expression of an unidentified, Pho-regulated adhesin.
TI  - [Multitalented lymphostatin].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gastrointestinal infections are a significant cause of diarrhea and a worldwide problem with annually one billion illnesses and 3 to 4 million deaths. Gram negative bacteria like Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) in developing countries and Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) in the developed world are responsible for the majority of acute diarrheal episodes, especially among children less than three years of age. Pathogenic E. coli are supplied with an arsenal of effector proteins to modify and neutralize specific cellular functions of the host organism. METHODS: Based on personal and extensively published results we provide a selected overview of Gram negative virulence functions with a focus on lymphostatin. RESULTS: Lymphostatin is an effector protein encoded by lifA/efa-1 (lymphocyte inhibitory factor A/ EHEC factor for adherence). lifA/efa-1 and homologous genes have been identified in EPEC, EHEC, and mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, as well as various Chlamydia strains. Multiple groups have shown that in various EHEC strains lifA/efa-1 is part of a larger pathogenicity island responsible for increased virulence. Statistically, DNA Microarray analysis associated lifA/efa-1 as the single most imortant gene with diarrhea caused by EPEC. Interestingly, lifA/efa-1 encodes for two critical enzymatic activities that have been identified in other pathogenic bacteria: glucosyltransferase- in Clostridium- and protease activity in Yersinia strains. In vitro studies identified lymphostatin as an effector protein with an immunosuppressive effect on peripheral blood and gastrointestinal mucosa T lymphocytes. Further, lymphostatin regulates the barrier function of epithelial monolayer cultures: activation of small GTPase RhoA and inhibition of Cdc42 lead to disassembly of adherens junctions and tight junctions, respectively. Besides an effect on immune and epithelial barrier function, lymphostatin also functions as an adhesion factor for EPEC and EHEC, is essential for colonization of mouse and calf intestine, and regulates bacterial effector proteins. SUMMARY: Lymphostatin is a common toxin in Gram negative bacteria with multiple functions: cell adhesion, immunosuppression, disruption of epithelial barrier function, and intestinal colonization.
TI  - Evaluation of colostrum-derived human mammary-associated serum amyloid A3 (M-SAA3) protein and peptide derivatives for the prevention of enteric infection: in vitro and in murine models of intestinal disease.
AB  - In vitro experiments confirmed that a 10-mer peptide derived from human mammary-associated serum amyloid A3 (M-SAA3) protected intestinal epithelial cells from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) adherence. The entire 42-mer human M-SAA3 protein was even more effective, reducing EPEC binding by 72% relative to untreated cells (P<0.05), compared with 25% and 57% reductions for the human 10-mer and Lactobacillus GG, respectively. However, none of the M-SAA3 peptides reduced Salmonella invasion in vitro (P>0.05). Each of the M-SAA3 10-mer peptides and the 42-mer was then administered orally to mice at 500 mug day(-1) for 4 days before deliberate infection with either Citrobacter rodentium (mouse model of EPEC) or Salmonella Typhimurium. None of the peptides protected against Salmonella infection and the 42-mer may even increase infection, as there was a trend towards increased Salmonella counts in the liver and small intestine in 42-mer-treated mice compared with those in sodium acetate-treated control mice. Citrobacter counts were reduced in the caecum of mice administered the 42-mer relative to a scrambled 10-mer (P<0.05), but not compared with the sodium acetate control and no reductions were observed in the faeces or colon. Overall, although promising anti-infective activity was demonstrated in vitro, neither the 42-mer M-SAA3 protein nor a 10-mer peptide derivative prevented enteric infection in the animal models tested.
TI  - Modelling of infection by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains in lineages 2 and 4 ex vivo and in vivo by using Citrobacter rodentium expressing TccP.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains colonize the human gut mucosa via attaching-and-effacing (A/E) lesion formation, while in vitro they employ diverse strategies to trigger actin polymerization. Strains belonging to the EPEC-1 lineage trigger strong actin polymerization via tyrosine phosphorylation of the type III secretion system (T3SS) effector Tir, recruitment of Nck, and activation of N-WASP. Strains belonging to EPEC-2 and EPEC-4 can trigger strong actin polymerization by dual mechanisms, since while employing the Tir-Nck pathway they can additionally activate N-WASP via the T3SS effectors TccP2 and TccP, respectively. It is currently not known if the ability to trigger actin polymerization by twin mechanisms increases in vivo virulence or fitness. Since mice are resistant to EPEC infection, in vivo studies are frequently done using the murine model pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, which shares with EPEC-1 strains the ability to induce A/E lesions and trigger strong actin polymerization via the Tir:Nck pathway. In order to model infections with EPEC-2 and EPEC-4, we constructed C. rodentium strains expressing TccP. Using a mouse intestinal in vitro organ culture model and oral gavage into C57BL/6 mice, we have shown that TccP can cooperate with Tir of C. rodentium. The recombinant strains induced typical A/E lesions ex vivo and in vivo. Expression of TccP did not alter C. rodentium colonization dynamics or pathology. In competition with the wild-type strain, expression of TccP in C. rodentium did not confer a competitive advantage.
TI  - Mucin dynamics in intestinal bacterial infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial gastroenteritis causes morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. Murine Citrobacter rodentium infection is a model for gastroenteritis caused by the human pathogens enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli. Mucin glycoproteins are the main component of the first barrier that bacteria encounter in the intestinal tract. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using Immunohistochemistry, we investigated intestinal expression of mucins (Alcian blue/PAS, Muc1, Muc2, Muc4, Muc5AC, Muc13 and Muc3/17) in healthy and C. rodentium infected mice. The majority of the C. rodentium infected mice developed systemic infection and colitis in the mid and distal colon by day 12. C. rodentium bound to the major secreted mucin, Muc2, in vitro, and high numbers of bacteria were found in secreted MUC2 in infected animals in vivo, indicating that mucins may limit bacterial access to the epithelial surface. In the small intestine, caecum and proximal colon, the mucin expression was similar in infected and non-infected animals. In the distal colonic epithelium, all secreted and cell surface mucins decreased with the exception of the Muc1 cell surface mucin which increased after infection (p<0.05). Similarly, during human infection Salmonella St Paul, Campylobacter jejuni and Clostridium difficile induced MUC1 in the colon. CONCLUSION: Major changes in both the cell-surface and secreted mucins occur in response to intestinal infection.
TI  - Interleukin-1 receptor signaling protects mice from lethal intestinal damage caused by the attaching and effacing pathogen Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, and Citrobacter rodentium are classified as attaching and effacing pathogens based on their ability to adhere to the intestinal epithelium via actin-filled membranous protrusions (pedestals). Infection of mice with C. rodentium causes a breach of the intestinal epithelial barrier, leading to colitis via a vigorous inflammatory response resulting in diarrhea and a protective antibody response that clears the pathogen. Here we show that interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling protects mice following infection with C. rodentium. Upon infection, mice lacking the type I IL-1R exhibit increased mortality together with severe colitis characterized by intramural colonic bleeding and intestinal damage including gangrenous mucosal necrosis, phenotypes also evident in MyD88-deficient mice. However, unlike MyD88(-/-) mice, IL-1R(-/-) mice do not exhibit increased pathogen loads in the colon, delays in the recruitment of innate immune cells such as neutrophils, or defects in the capacity to replace damaged enterocytes. Further, we demonstrate that IL-1R(-/-) mice have an increased predisposition to intestinal damage caused by C. rodentium but not to that caused by chemical irritants, such as dextran sodium sulfate. Together, these data suggest that IL-1R signaling regulates the susceptibility of the intestinal epithelia to damage caused by C. rodentium.
TI  - Role of RpoS in the virulence of Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is a mouse enteropathogen that is closely related to Escherichia coli and causes severe colonic hyperplasia and bloody diarrhea. C. rodentium infection requires expression of genes of the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, which simulates infection by enteropathogenic E. coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli in the human intestine, providing an effective model for studying enteropathogenesis. In this study we investigated the role of RpoS, the stationary phase sigma factor, in virulence in C. rodentium. Sequence analysis showed that the rpoS gene is highly conserved in C. rodentium and E. coli, exhibiting 92% identity. RpoS was critical for survival under heat shock conditions and during exposure to H(2)O(2) and positively regulated the expression of catalase KatE (HPII). The development of the RDAR (red dry and rough) morphotype, an important virulence trait in E. coli, was also mediated by RpoS in C. rodentium. Unlike E. coli, C. rodentium grew well in the mouse colon, and the wild-type strain colonized significantly better than rpoS mutants. However, a mutation in rpoS conferred a competitive growth advantage over the wild type both in vitro in Luria-Bertani medium and in vivo in the mouse colon. Survival analysis showed that the virulence of an rpoS mutant was attenuated. The expression of genes on the LEE pathogenicity island, which are essential for colonization and virulence, was reduced in the rpoS mutant. In conclusion, RpoS is important for the stress response and is required for full virulence in C. rodentium.
TI  - RegA, an AraC-like protein, is a global transcriptional regulator that controls virulence gene expression in Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is an attaching and effacing pathogen which causes transmissible colonic hyperplasia in mice. Infection with C. rodentium serves as a model for infection of humans with enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. To identify novel colonization factors of C. rodentium, we screened a signature-tagged mutant library of C. rodentium in mice. One noncolonizing mutant had a single transposon insertion in an open reading frame (ORF) which we designated regA because of its homology to genes encoding members of the AraC family of transcriptional regulators. Deletion of regA in C. rodentium resulted in markedly reduced colonization of the mouse intestine. Examination of lacZ transcriptional fusions using promoter regions of known and putative virulence-associated genes of C. rodentium revealed that RegA strongly stimulated transcription of two newly identified genes located close to regA, which we designated adcA and kfcC. The cloned adcA gene conferred autoaggregation and adherence to mammalian cells to E. coli strain DH5alpha, and a kfc mutation led to a reduction in the duration of intestinal colonization, but the kfc mutant was far less attenuated than the regA mutant. These results indicated that other genes of C. rodentium whose expression required activation by RegA were required for colonization. Microarray analysis revealed a number of RegA-regulated ORFs encoding proteins homologous to known colonization factors. Transcription of these putative virulence determinants was activated by RegA only in the presence of sodium bicarbonate. Taken together, these results show that RegA is a global regulator of virulence in C. rodentium which activates factors that are required for intestinal colonization.
TI  - Role of NleH, a type III secreted effector from attaching and effacing pathogens, in colonization of the bovine, ovine, and murine gut.
AB  - The human pathogen enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 colonizes human and animal gut via formation of attaching and effacing lesions. EHEC strains use a type III secretion system to translocate a battery of effector proteins into the mammalian host cell, which subvert diverse signal transduction pathways implicated in actin dynamics, phagocytosis, and innate immunity. The genomes of sequenced EHEC O157:H7 strains contain two copies of the effector protein gene nleH, which share 49% sequence similarity with the gene for the Shigella effector OspG, recently implicated in inhibition of migration of the transcriptional regulator NF-kappaB to the nucleus. In this study we investigated the role of NleH during EHEC O157:H7 infection of calves and lambs. We found that while EHEC DeltanleH colonized the bovine gut more efficiently than the wild-type strain, in lambs the wild-type strain exhibited a competitive advantage over the mutant during mixed infection. Using the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, which shares many virulence factors with EHEC O157:H7, including NleH, we observed that the wild-type strain exhibited a competitive advantage over the mutant during mixed infection. We found no measurable differences in T-cell infiltration or hyperplasia in colons of mice inoculated with the wild-type or the nleH mutant strain. Using NF-kappaB reporter mice carrying a transgene containing a luciferase reporter driven by three NF-kappaB response elements, we found that NleH causes an increase in NF-kappaB activity in the colonic mucosa. Consistent with this, we found that the nleH mutant triggered a significantly lower tumor necrosis factor alpha response than the wild-type strain.
TI  - Modulation of acute diarrheal illness by persistent bacterial infection.
AB  - Acute diarrheal illness is a global health problem that may be exacerbated by concurrent infection. Using Citrobacter rodentium, a murine model of attaching and effacing diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, we demonstrate that persistent Helicobacter hepaticus infection modulates host responses to diarrheal disease, resulting in delayed recovery from weight loss and from tissue damage. Chronic colitis in concurrently infected mice is characterized by macrophage and Foxp3(+) regulatory T-cell accumulation. Prolonged disease is also associated with increased interleukin-17 expression, which may be due to suppression of gamma interferon during the acute phase of diarrheal infection. This new model of polymicrobial infection provides insight into the mechanism by which subclinical infection can exacerbate morbidity due to an unrelated self-limiting infection.
TI  - The p50 subunit of NF-kappaB is critical for in vivo clearance of the noninvasive enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium, a natural mouse pathogen, belongs to the family of extracellular enteric pathogens that includes enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). C. rodentium shares many virulence factors with EPEC and EHEC and relies on attaching-and-effacing lesion formation for colonization and infection of the gut. In vivo, C. rodentium infection is characterized by increased epithelial cell proliferation, mucosal thickening, and a TH1-type immune response, but with protective immunity believed to be mediated by serum immunoglobulin G (IgG). In this work, we characterize the immune response and pathology of mice lacking the p50 subunit of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) during C. rodentium infection. We show that p50(-/-) mice are unable to clear C. rodentium infection. Furthermore, these animals show a reduced influx of immune cells into infected colonic tissue and greater levels of mucosal hyperplasia and the cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and gamma interferon. Surprisingly, despite being unable to eliminate infection, p50(-/-) mice showed markedly higher levels of anti-Citrobacter IgG and IgM, suggesting that antibody alone is not responsible for bacterial clearance. These data also demonstrate that non-NF-kappaB-dependent defenses are insufficient to control C. rodentium infection, and hence, the NF-kappaB p50 subunit is critical for defense against this noninvasive pathogen.
TI  - Protective and destructive innate immune responses to enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and related A/E pathogens.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli (O157:H7) and Citrobacter rodentium are classified as attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens based on their ability to adhere to intestinal epithelium, destroy microvilli and induce pedestal formation at the site of infection. A/E bacterial infections also cause acute diarrheal episodes and intestinal inflammation. The use of model systems has led to an understanding of the innate immune response to A/E pathogens. The innate immune system plays a protective role, initiating a productive antibody response, directly killing bacteria and inducing repair mechanisms following tissue damage caused by infection. However, hyperactivation of the innate immune system can have negative consequences, including exacerbated tissue destruction following neutrophil infiltration. Here we review how innate immune cell types, including neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells, orchestrate both protective and destructive responses. Such information is crucial for the development of therapeutics that can mitigate destructive inflammatory responses while accentuating those that are protective.
TI  - Tight junctional disruption and apoptosis in an in vitro model of Citrobacter rodentium infection.
AB  - The murine model of Citrobacter rodentium infection has been used to complement in vitro studies of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infections of human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). However, the differences in epithelial cell responses between these two models are not fully understood. We used an in vitro model of C. rodentium infection to examine important, yet incompletely understood, cellular responses of murine IECs to this pathogen. C. rodentium attached to CMT-93 cells and disrupted their tight junctional expression of claudins-4 and -5. This was associated with a loss of barrier function that required live bacteria and was partially prevented by the inhibition of Rho kinase. Furthermore, C. rodentium caused an upregulation of IEC apoptosis that was associated with the cytoplasmic accumulation of apoptosis-inducing factor, but not with the activation of caspase-3. These studies demonstrate for the first time that C. rodentium affects murine IECs in ways that may be similar, but distinct, to the effects of EPEC on human IECs.
TI  - The apolipoprotein E-mimetic peptide COG112 inhibits the inflammatory response to Citrobacter rodentium in colonic epithelial cells by preventing NF-kappaB activation.
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease arises from the interplay between luminal bacteria and the colonic mucosa. Targeted inhibition of pro-inflammatory pathways without global immunosuppression is highly desirable. Apolipoprotein (apo) E has immunomodulatory effects and synthetically derived apoE-mimetic peptides are beneficial in models of sepsis and neuroinflammation. Citrobacter rodentium is the rodent equivalent of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, and it causes colitis in mice by colonizing the surface of colonic epithelial cells and inducing signaling events. We have reported that mice deficient in inducible nitric-oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) have attenuated C. rodentium-induced colitis. We used young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells that mimic primary colonic epithelial cells to study effects of an antennapedia-linked apoE-mimetic peptide, COG112, on C. rodentium-activated cells. COG112 significantly attenuated induction of NO production, and iNOS mRNA and protein expression, in a concentration-dependent manner. COG112 inhibited the C. rodentium-stimulated induction of iNOS and the CXC chemokines KC and MIP-2 to the same degree as the NF-kappaB inhibitors MG132 or BAY 11-7082, and there was no additive effect when COG112 and these inhibitors were combined. COG112 significantly reduced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, when assessed by electromobility shift assay, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence for p65. This correlated with inhibition of both C. rodentium-stimulated IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation and degradation, and IkappaB kinase activity, which occurred by inhibition of IkappaB kinase complex formation rather than by a direct effect on the enzyme itself. These studies indicate that apoE-mimetic peptides may have novel therapeutic potential by inhibiting NF-kappaB-driven proinflammatory epithelial responses to pathogenic colonic bacteria.
TI  - Subversion of actin dynamics by EspM effectors of attaching and effacing bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Rho GTPases are common targets of bacterial toxins and type III secretion system  effectors. IpgB1 and IpgB2 of Shigella and Map of enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) Escherichia coli were recently grouped together on the basis that they share a conserved WxxxE motif. In this study, we characterized six WxxxE effectors from attaching and effacing pathogens: TrcA and EspM1 of EPEC strain B171, EspM1 and EspM2 of EHEC strain Sakai and EspM2 and EspM3 of Citrobacter rodentium. We show that EspM2 triggers formation of global parallel stress fibres, TrcA and EspM1 induce formation of localized parallel stress fibres and EspM3 triggers formation of localized radial stress fibres. Using EspM2 and EspM3 as model effectors, we report that while substituting the conserved Trp with Ala abolished activity, conservative Trp to Tyr or Glu to Asp substitutions did not affect stress-fibre formation. We show, using dominant negative constructs and chemical inhibitors, that the activity of EspM2 and EspM3 is RhoA and ROCK-dependent. Using Rhotekin pull-downs, we have shown that EspM2 and EspM3 activate RhoA; translocation of EspM2 and EspM3 triggered phosphorylation of cofilin. These results suggest that the EspM effectors modulate actin dynamics by activating the RhoA signalling pathway.
TI  - Characterization of the NleF effector protein from attaching and effacing bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a water- and food-borne pathogen that causes hemorrhagic colitis. EHEC uses a type III secretion system (T3SS) to translocate effector proteins that subvert host cell function. T3SS-substrates encoded outside of the locus of enterocyte effacement are important to E. coli pathogenesis. We discovered an EHEC secreted protein, NleF, encoded by z6020 in O-island 71 of E. coli EDL933 that we hypothesized to be a T3SS substrate. Experiments are presented that probe the function of NleF and its role in virulence. Immunoblotting of secreted and translocated proteins suggest that NleF is secreted by the T3SS and is translocated into host cells in vitro where it localizes to the host cytoplasm. Infection of HeLa cells with E. coli possessing or lacking nleF and transient expression of NleF-GFP via transfection did not reveal a significant role for NleF in several assays of bacterial adherence, host cytoskeletal remodeling, or host protein secretion. However, competitive coinfection of mice with Citrobacter rodentium strains possessing or lacking nleF suggested a contribution of NleF to bacterial colonization. Challenge of gnotobiotic piglets also revealed a role for NleF in colonization of the piglet colon and rectoanal junction.
TI  - Interleukin-22 mediates early host defense against attaching and effacing bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Infections by attaching and effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogens, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, pose a serious threat to public health. Using a mouse A/E pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium, we show that interleukin-22 (IL-22) has a crucial role in the early phase of host defense against C. rodentium. Infection of IL-22 knockout mice results in increased intestinal epithelial damage, systemic bacterial burden and mortality. We also find that IL-23 is required for the early induction of IL-22 during C. rodentium infection, and adaptive immunity is not essential for the protective role of IL-22 in this model. Instead, IL-22 is required for the direct induction of the Reg family of antimicrobial proteins, including RegIIIbeta and RegIIIgamma, in colonic epithelial cells. Exogenous mouse or human RegIIIgamma substantially improves survival of IL-22 knockout mice after C. rodentium infection. Together, our data identify a new innate immune function for IL-22 in regulating early defense mechanisms against A/E bacterial pathogens.
TI  - CD4+ T cells transfer resistance against Citrobacter rodentium-induced infectious colitis by induction of Th 1 immunity.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium induces an acute, self-limited colitis in mice which is histologically associated with crypt hyperplasia. The infection serves as a model for human infectious colitis induced by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. We investigated if Balb/c mice, which had spontaneously cleared C. rodentium infection, were protected against re-infection and if resistance against intestinal infection can be systemically transferred using spleen cells. The course of infection was monitored by faecal excretion. Spleen cells, splenic CD3+ and CD4+ cells were transferred from resistant mice to non-infected recipients prior to infection. Cytokine secretion, serum and faecal antibody titres and histological disease severity were assessed. Balb/c mice were resistant against re-infection. The course of infection was shorter in mice receiving primed spleen cells, CD3+ and CD4+ cells. Transfer of CD4+ T cells from resistant mice induced gamma-interferon, interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-17 secretion and suppressed IL-10 secretion. Anti-Citrobacter serum IgG1 and IgG2a enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay OD levels were increased. Faecal IgA secretion was increased while serum IgA was suppressed in recipients of CD4+ cells. Large bowel histology showed protection from colitis in recipients of primed cells as indicated by normal colonic epithelium. In Balb/c mice, C. rodentium infection is followed by resistance, which can be transferred by CD4+ cells. Transfer of protection is associated with IL-17 secretion, enhanced serum IgG and faecal IgA secretion. This is the first study to demonstrate the mechanisms by which systemic resistance from previously C. rodentium-infected mice can be transferred to non-infected animals.
TI  - Flagellin-dependent and -independent inflammatory responses following infection by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium belong to the attaching and effacing (A/E) family of bacterial pathogens. These noninvasive bacteria infect intestinal enterocytes using a type 3 secretion system (T3SS), leading to diarrheal disease and intestinal inflammation. While flagellin, the secreted product of the EPEC fliC gene, causes the release of interleukin 8 (IL-8) from epithelial cells, it is unclear whether A/E bacteria also trigger epithelial inflammatory responses that are FliC independent. The aims of this study were to characterize the FliC dependence or independence of epithelial inflammatory responses to direct infection by EPEC or C. rodentium. Following infection of Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells by wild-type and DeltafliC EPEC, a rapid activation of several proinflammatory genes, including those encoding IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 3alpha (MIP3alpha), and beta-defensin 2, occurred in a FliC-dependent manner. These responses were accompanied by mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, as well as the Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5)-dependent activation of NF-kappaB. At later infection time points, a subset of these proinflammatory genes (IL-8 and MIP3alpha) was also induced in cells infected with DeltafliC EPEC. The nonmotile A/E pathogen C. rodentium also triggered similar innate responses through a TLR5-independent but partially NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism. Moreover, the EPEC FliC-independent responses were increased in the absence of the locus of enterocyte effacement-encoded T3SS, suggesting that translocated bacterial effectors suppress rather than cause the FliC-independent inflammatory response. Thus, we demonstrate that infection of intestinal epithelial cells by A/E pathogens can trigger an array of proinflammatory responses from epithelial cells through both FliC-dependent and -independent pathways, expanding our understanding of the innate epithelial response to infection by these pathogens.
TI  - Fcgamma receptor regulation of Citrobacter rodentium infection.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium, a murine model pathogen for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, colonizes the colon utilizing attaching and effacing lesions to adhere specifically to the surfaces of intestinal epithelial cells and cause mucosal inflammation. CD4+ T cells, B cells, and immunoglobulin G (IgG), but not secretory IgA or IgM, play a critical role in eradicating this pathogen. Consistent with the importance of IgG in C. rodentium eradication, IgG transport by the neonatal Fc receptor for IgG within the intestinal epithelium also has a critical role in the regulation of C. rodentium infection. It remains to be determined, however, whether Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaRs), the receptors for the Fc portion of IgG, regulate this bacterial infection within mucosal tissues. Therefore, we investigated the roles of FcgammaRs during C. rodentium infection. Fc receptor common gamma chain (FcRgamma)-deficient mice were more susceptible to C. rodentium-induced colitis. This occurred through decreased efficiency of FcR-mediated endocytosis and maturation of dendritic cells and consequently T-cell activation of antigen-specific T cells. Moreover, in the absence of FcgammaRs, phagocytosis by macrophages was significantly diminished. Therefore, activating FcgammaRs play an important role in defending against C. rodentium infection, indicating that the critical role played by IgG in this infection is not mediated by IgG alone but is dependent upon this class of receptors.
TI  - Regulation of expression and secretion of NleH, a new non-locus of enterocyte effacement-encoded effector in Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Together with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Citrobacter rodentium is a member of the attaching-and-effacing (A/E) family of bacterial pathogens. A/E pathogens use a type III secretion system (T3SS) to translocate an assortment of effector proteins, encoded both within and outside the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), into the colonized host cell, leading to the formation of A/E lesions and disease. Here we report the identification and characterization of a new non-LEE encoded effector, NleH, in C. rodentium. NleH is conserved among A/E pathogens and shares identity with OspG, a type III secreted effector protein in Shigella flexneri. Downstream of nleH, genes encoding homologues of the non-LEE-encoded effectors EspJ and NleG/NleI are found. NleH secretion and translocation into Caco-2 cells requires a functional T3SS and signals located at its amino-terminal domain. Transcription of nleH is not significantly reduced in mutants lacking the LEE-encoded regulators Ler and GrlA; however, NleH protein levels are highly reduced in these strains, as well as in escN and cesT mutants. Inactivation of Lon, but not of ClpP, protease restores NleH levels even in the absence of CesT. Our results indicate that the efficient engagement of NleH in active secretion is needed for its stability, thus establishing a posttranslational regulatory mechanism that coregulates NleH levels with the expression of LEE-encoded proteins. A C. rodentium nleH mutant shows a moderate defect during the colonization of C57BL/6 mice at early stages of infection.
TI  - The enteropathogenic E. coli effector EspB facilitates microvillus effacing and antiphagocytosis by inhibiting myosin function.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) destroys intestinal microvilli and suppresses phagocytosis by injecting effectors into infected cells through a type III secretion system (TTSS). EspB, a component of the TTSS, is also injected into the cytoplasm of host cells. However, the physiological functions of EspB within the host cell cytoplasm remain unclear. We show that EspB binds to myosins, which are a superfamily of proteins that interact with actin filaments and mediate essential cellular processes, including microvillus formation and phagocytosis. EspB inhibits the interaction of myosins with actin, and an EspB mutant that lacks the myosin-binding region maintained its TTSS function but could not induce microvillus effacing or suppress phagocytosis. Moreover, the myosin-binding region of EspB is essential for Citrobacter rodentium, an EPEC-related murine pathogen, to efficiently infect mice. These results suggest that EspB inhibits myosin functions and thereby facilitates efficient infection by EPEC.
TI  - Utility of the Citrobacter rodentium infection model in laboratory mice.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There have been considerable advances in our understanding of  the molecular pathogenesis of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection. Given the difficulty of infecting laboratory mice with these diarrhea-causing pathogens, a growing number of studies have found the murine bacterial pathogen Citrobacter rodentium to provide a robust, relevant in-vivo model system. RECENT FINDINGS: All inbred strains and outbred stocks of laboratory mice studied to date have been found to be susceptible to C. rodentium infection. The natural course of disease ranges from subclinical epithelial hyperplasia in the colon, to clinical diarrhea and colitis, to fatal infection, depending on the age, genetic background, and health status of the host. Infection is self-limiting, leading to disease resolution and protective immunity. Here we review recent discoveries related to bacterial virulence determinants, epithelial hyperplasia, innate and adaptive immune responses, and mechanisms of diarrhea. SUMMARY: Infection of laboratory mice with C. rodentium provides a useful in-vivo model for studying the pathogenesis of infectious gastroenteritis and acute diarrheal illness, and for preclinical evaluation of candidate preventive and therapeutic agents.
TI  - Gastrointestinal infections, an overview: from pathogens to metagenomes.
AB  
TI  - Host-mediated inflammation disrupts the intestinal microbiota and promotes the overgrowth of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - While the normal microbiota has been implicated as a critical defense against invading pathogens, the impact of enteropathogenic infection and host inflammation on intestinal microbial communities has not been elucidated. Using mouse models of Citrobacter rodentium, which closely mimics human diarrheal pathogens inducing host intestinal inflammation, and Campylobacter jejuni infection, as well as chemically and genetically induced models of intestinal inflammation, we demonstrate that host-mediated inflammation in response to an infecting agent, a chemical trigger, or genetic predisposition markedly alters the colonic microbial community. While eliminating a subset of indigenous microbiota, host-mediated inflammation supported the growth of either the resident or introduced aerobic bacteria, particularly of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Further, assault by an enteropathogen and host-mediated inflammation combined to significantly reduce the total numbers of resident colonic bacteria. These findings underscore the importance of intestinal microbial ecosystems in infectious colitis and noninfectious intestinal inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease.
TI  - Modulation of intestinal goblet cell function during infection by an attaching and effacing bacterial pathogen.
AB  - The attaching and effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogens enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli and the related mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium colonize their hosts' intestines by infecting the apical surfaces of enterocytes, subverting their function, and they ultimately cause diarrhea. Surprisingly, little is known about the interactions of these organisms with goblet cells, which are specialized epithelial cells that secrete the protective molecules Muc2 and trefoil factor 3 (Tff3) into the intestinal lumen. C. rodentium infection leads to dramatic goblet cell depletion within the infected colon, yet it is not clear whether C. rodentium infects goblet cells or if this pathology is pathogen or host mediated. As determined by immunostaining and PCR, both the number of goblet cells and the expression of genes encoding Muc2 and Tff3 were significantly reduced by day 10 postinfection. While electron microscopy and immunostaining revealed that C. rodentium directly infected a fraction of colonic goblet cells, C. rodentium localization did not correlate with goblet cell depletion. To assess the role of the host immune system in these changes, Rag1 knockout (KO) (T- and B-cell-deficient) mice were infected with C. rodentium. Rag1 KO mice did not exhibit the reduction in the number of goblet cells or in mediator (Muc2 and Tff3) expression observed in infected immunocompetent mice. However, reconstitution of Rag1 KO mice with T and B lymphocytes from C57BL/6 mice restored the goblet cell depletion phenotype during C. rodentium infection. In conclusion, these studies demonstrated that while colonic goblet cells can be subject to direct infection and potential subversion by A/E pathogens in vivo, it is the host immune system that primarily modulates the function of these cells during infection.
TI  - A C-terminal class I PDZ binding motif of EspI/NleA modulates the virulence of attaching and effacing Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli induces characteristic attaching-effacing (A/E) lesions on the intestinal mucosa during infection. The locus of enterocyte effacement is essential for A/E lesion formation and encodes a type III secretion system that translocates multiple effector proteins into the host cell. Following translocation, EspI/NleA localizes to the Golgi. Using the yeast two-hybrid system (Y2HS) and PSD-95/Disk-large/ZO-1 (PDZ)-domain protein array overlays, we identified 15 putative host-interacting partners of EspI. All but two of the target proteins contained PDZ domains. Examination of the EspI amino acid sequence revealed a C-terminal consensus class I PDZ binding motif. Deletion of the last 7 amino acids of EspI to generate EspI(DeltaC7) abrogated the Y2HS interaction between EspI and 5 of the 6 putative host cell target proteins tested. Deletion of the EspI PDZ binding motif also resulted in delayed trafficking of EspI to the Golgi. Using a mouse model of infection, we showed that Citrobacter rodentium expressing truncated EspI(DeltaC7) was attenuated when in competition with C. rodentium expressing full-length EspI. Overall, these results suggested that EspI may modulate the virulence of A/E pathogens by binding host PDZ-domain proteins.
TI  - Cell attachment properties and infectivity of host-adapted and environmentally adapted Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium belongs to a family of extracellular enteric pathogens that include enterohaemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, which colonises the gastrointestinal mucosa by the attaching and effacing (A/E) mechanism. We previously described the appearance of a 'hyper-infectious' state after passage of C. rodentium through the murine gastrointestinal tract. Here we report that host-adapted C. rodentium is able to efficiently adhere and trigger actin polymerisation on cultured epithelial cells. Consistent with these observations we recorded higher levels of expression of genes carried on the LEE pathogenicity island and type III secretion system effector genes carried on prophages compared with in vitro-grown bacteria; importantly, the level of ler gene expression was unchanged. These phenotypes were lost after shed C. rodentium was adapted to the external environment. Upon exposure of C57Bl/6 mice, environmentally adapted C. rodentium was no longer infectious at the low doses associated with host-adapted bacteria and the bacteria were found to be localised in the caecal patch in a similar way to C. rodentium cultured in laboratory media. Thus, the 'hyper-infectious' host-adapted state, allowing efficient transmission and colonisation of naive hosts, is transient in nature and gradually lost after shedding into the environment.
TI  - A generalized transducing phage for the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - A virulent phage (phiCR1) capable of generalized transduction in Citrobacter rodentium was isolated from the environment and characterized. C. rodentium is a natural pathogen of mice, causing transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia. Sequencing of its genome has recently been completed and will soon be fully annotated and published. C. rodentium is an important model organism for infections caused by the human pathogens enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHEC). phiCR1 uses a lipopolysaccharide receptor, has a genome size of approximately 300 kb, and is able to transduce a variety of markers. phiCR1 is the first reported transducing phage for C. rodentium and will be a useful tool for functional genomic analysis of this important natural murine pathogen.
TI  - TLR signaling mediated by MyD88 is required for a protective innate immune response by neutrophils to Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, and Citrobacter rodentium are classified as attaching and effacing pathogens based on their ability to adhere to intestinal epithelium via actin-filled membranous protrusions (pedestals). Infection of mice with C. rodentium causes breach of the colonic epithelial barrier, a vigorous Th1 inflammatory response, and colitis. Ultimately, an adaptive immune response leads to clearance of the bacteria. Whereas much is known about the adaptive response to C. rodentium, the role of the innate immune response remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that the TLR adaptor MyD88 is essential for survival and optimal immunity following infection. MyD88(-/-) mice suffer from bacteremia, gangrenous mucosal necrosis, severe colitis, and death following infection. Although an adaptive response occurs, MyD88-dependent signaling is necessary for efficient clearance of the pathogen. Based on reciprocal bone marrow transplants in conjunction with assessment of intestinal mucosal pathology, repair, and cytokine production, our findings suggest a model in which TLR signaling in hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic cells mediate three distinct processes: 1) induction of an epithelial repair response that maintains the protective barrier and limits access of bacteria to the lamina propria; 2) production of KC or other chemokines that attract neutrophils and thus facilitate killing of bacteria; and 3) efficient activation of an adaptive response that facilitates Ab-mediated clearance of the infection. Taken together, these experiments provide evidence for a protective role of innate immune signaling in infections caused by attaching and effacing pathogens.
TI  - Quorum sensing has an unexpected role in virulence in the model pathogen Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - The bacterial mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium causes attaching and effacing  (AE) lesions in the same manner as pathogenic Escherichia coli, and is an important model for this mode of pathogenesis. Quorum sensing (QS) involves chemical signalling by bacteria to regulate gene expression in response to cell density. E. coli has never been reported to have N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) QS, but it does utilize luxS-dependent signalling. We found production of AHL QS signalling molecules by an AE pathogen, C. rodentium. AHL QS is directed by the croIR locus and a croI mutant is affected in its surface attachment, although not in Type III secretion. AHL QS has an important role in virulence in the mouse as, unexpectedly, the QS mutant is hypervirulent; by contrast, we detected no impact of luxS inactivation. Further study of QS in Citrobacter should provide new insights into AE pathogenesis. As the croIR locus might have been horizontally acquired, AHL QS might exist in some strains of pathogenic E. coli.
TI  - Tir phosphorylation and Nck/N-WASP recruitment by enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli during ex vivo colonization of human intestinal mucosa is different to cell culture models.
AB  - Tir, the translocated intimin receptor of enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHEC) and Citrobacter rodentium, is translocated into the host cell by a filamentous type III secretion system. Epithelial cell culture has demonstrated that Tir tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary for attaching effacing (A/E) lesion formation by EPEC and C. rodentium, but is not required by EHEC O157:H7. Recent in vivo work on C. rodentium has reported that Tir translocation, but not its phosphorylation, is necessary for colonization of the mouse colon. In this study we investigated the involvement of Tir and its tyrosine phosphorylation in EPEC and EHEC human intestinal colonization, N-WASP accumulation and F-actin recruitment using in vitro organ culture (IVOC). We showed that both EPEC and EHEC Tir are translocated into human intestinal epithelium during IVOC and that Tir is necessary for ex vivo intestinal colonization by both EPEC and EHEC. EPEC, but not EHEC, Tir is tyrosine phosphorylated but Tir phosphorylation-deficient mutants still colonize intestinal explants. While EPEC Tir recruits the host adaptor protein Nck to initiate N-WASP-Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization, Tir derivatives deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation recruit N-WASP independently of Nck indicating the presence of a tyrosine phosphorylation-independent mechanism of A/E lesion formation and actin recruitment ex vivo by EPEC in man.
TI  - Analysis of the expression, regulation and export of NleA-E in Escherichia coli O157 : H7.
AB  - Previous work has shown that locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-encoded effector proteins such as Tir and Map can be exported via the type III secretion system (T3SS) of Escherichia coli O157 : H7. Additionally, a family of non-LEE-encoded (Nle) effector proteins has been shown to be secreted from Citrobacter rodentium, homologues of which are located on the E. coli O157 chromosome. While NleA has been shown to be secreted from pathogenic E. coli, the secretion of other Nle effector proteins has only been detected under induced conditions, or using a mutated T3SS. This study aimed to determine: (1) which nle genes are expressed in E. coli O157 : H7 under secretion-permissive conditions; (2) if Nle proteins are secreted from wild-type E. coli O157 : H7 under secretion-permissive conditions; and (3) if nle gene expression is regulated co-ordinately with other LEE-encoded effectors. Using data generated from a combination of transcriptome arrays, reporter fusions and proteomics, it was demonstrated that only nleA is expressed co-ordinately with the LEE. Secretion and expression of NleA were regulated directly or indirectly by ler, a key activator of the LEE. MS confirmed the secretion of NleA into the culture supernatant, while NleB-F were not detected.
TI  - Desmosomes are unaltered during infections by attaching and effacing pathogens.
AB  - The human attaching and effacing (A/E) intestinal pathogens enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and the murine A/E pathogen Citrobacter rodentium cause serious diarrhea in their hosts. These bacteria alter numerous host cell components, including organelles, the host cell cytoskeleton, and tight junctions during the infectious process. One of the proteins that contribute to the intermediate filament network in host cells, cytokeratin-18, is extensively altered during EPEC infections. Based on this, we tested the hypothesis that desmosomes, the only intercellular junctions that interact with intermediate filaments, are also influenced by A/E pathogen infections. We found that the desmosomal transmembrane proteins desmoglein and desmocollin, as well as the desmosome plaque protein desmoplakin, all remain unchanged during EPEC infection in vitro. This evidence is corroborated by the unaltered localization of desmoglein and desmoplakin in vivo in mice infected with C. rodentium for 7 days. Electron microscopic analysis of 7-day C. rodentium-infected murine colonocytes also show no observable differences in the desmosomes when compared to uninfected controls. Our data suggest that, unlike tight junctions, the desmosome protein levels and localization, as well as desmosome morphology, are unaltered during A/E pathogenesis.
TI  - Functional studies of intimin in vivo and ex vivo: implications for host specificity and tissue tropism.
AB  - Intimin is an outer-membrane adhesin that is essential for colonization of the host gastrointestinal tract by attaching and effacing pathogens including enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and Citrobacter rodentium (CR). The N-terminus of intimin from the different strains is highly conserved while the C-terminus, which harnesses the active receptor-binding site, shows sequence and antigenic polymorphism. This diversity was used to define a number of distinct intimin types, the most common of which are alpha, beta and gamma. Intimin binds the type III secretion system effector protein Tir. However, a large body of evidence suggests that intimin also binds a host-cell-encoded receptor(s) (Hir), and interaction of different intimin types with Hir contributes to tissue and host specificity. The aims of this study were to compare the activity of the major intimin types (alpha, beta and gamma) in vivo and ex vivo, using the CR mouse model and in vitro organ culture (IVOC), and to determine their exchangeability. The results confirm that intimin gamma is not functional in the CR mouse model. In the pig, intimin beta can substitute for EPEC intimin alpha but when placed in an EHEC O157 : H7 background it does not produce an intimin alpha-like tropism, although some adhesion to the small and large intestine was observed. In contrast, in human IVOC, intimin beta in an EHEC background produces small intestinal colonization in a similar manner to intimin alpha.
TI  - Citrobacter rodentium virulence in mice associates with bacterial load and the type III effector NleE.
AB  - Severe disease caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) has been associated with a pathogenicity island, O-Island 122, which encodes the type III secretion system-effector NleE. Here we show that full virulence of the related attaching and effacing mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium requires NleE. Relative to wild-type bacteria, nleE-mutant C. rodentium are attenuated for colonisation in mice in both single and mixed infections. Examination of the ability of nleE-mutant bacteria to induce pathologic change in vivo revealed that nleE-mutant bacteria induce significantly less pathologic change than wild-type bacteria in susceptible mice. Consistent with these results, mice infected with nleE-mutant bacteria exhibit delayed mortality. These results suggested that pathologic change during attaching and effacing pathogen infection may associate with the degree of pathogen colonisation. Using mutants of 23 type III secretion genes, including the type III effectors nleC, nleD, nleE and nleF, the association of pathologic change with the ability of these mutants to colonise mice was examined. The induction of in vivo disease correlates strongly with the degree of colonisation, suggesting that the colonisation advantage type III secretion genes afford the bacteria, contribute to, and are required for, full virulence.
TI  - Identification and characterization of NleI, a new non-LEE-encoded effector of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC).
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), a major gastrointestinal pathogen, causes infantile diarrhea in many developing countries. EPEC is an attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogen that utilizes a LEE-encoded type III secretion system (TTSS) to deliver effector proteins into host cells. These effectors have been identified as potential virulence factors in A/E pathogens including EPEC, enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and Citrobacter rodentium (CR). We used a proteomics approach to identify a new non-LEE-encoded effector, NleI, from the EPEC sepL and sepD mutants. The nleI gene, located in a prophage-associated island with nleBCD, is also present in EHEC and CR but not in E. coli K-12. In EPEC, the transcription of nleI was increased upon sepD inactivation but remained unaffected in ler and sepL mutants. We demonstrated that NleI is secreted and translocated into HeLa cells in a TTSS-dependent manner and that the CesT chaperone is required for efficient NleI translocation. Nevertheless, under overexpression conditions, the first 20 amino acids of NleI are sufficient to support both secretion and translocation. After translocation, NleI can be detected in the cytoplasmic and membrane of HeLa cells.
TI  - Comparison of colonization dynamics and pathology of mice infected with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterohaemorrhagic E. coli and Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and Citrobacter rodentium (CR) colonize the gastrointestinal tract epithelium via attaching and effacing lesions. While humans are believed to be the only living reservoir of typical EPEC and EHEC to have border host specificity, CR is a restricted mouse pathogen. Recently, conflicting conclusions were reported concerning the utility of a murine model to study mechanisms of EPEC and EHEC colonization and infection. We therefore aimed to compare colonization dynamics of EPEC, EHEC and CR, together with a commensal E. coli (Nissle) as a control, in the murine. We show that all strains are equally shed in stools over the first 48 h post inoculation. However, while the CR population then rapidly expanded the EPEC, EHEC and Nissle populations quickly declined to a level just above detection. We conclude that following oral inoculation EPEC and EHEC develop a commensal, rather than pathogenic, interaction within the mouse host.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis spores reduce susceptibility to Citrobacter rodentium-mediated  enteropathy in a mouse model.
AB  - The present work was aimed at investigating whether Bacillus subtilis spores, widely used in probiotic as well as pharmaceutical preparations for mild gastrointestinal disorders, can suppress enteric infections. To address this issue, we developed a mouse model of infection using the mouse enteropathogen Citrobacter rodentium, a member of a family of human and animal pathogens which includes the clinically significant enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) Escherichia coli strains. This group of pathogens causes transmissible colonic hyperplasia by using attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions to colonize the host colon. Because of its similarities to human enteropathogens, C. rodentium is now widely used as an in vivo model for gastrointestinal infections. Swiss NIH mice were orally administered B. subtilis spores one day before infection with C. rodentium. Mice were sacrificed on day 15 after infection, and distal colon, liver and mesenteric lymph nodes were removed for bacteria counts, morphology, immunohistology and IFNgamma mRNA analysis. We observed that spore predosing was effective in significantly decreasing infection and enteropathy in suckling mice infected with a dose of C. rodentium sufficient to cause colon colonization, crypt hyperplasia and high mortality rates. Moreover, in mice predosed with spores, the number of CD4(+) cells and IFNgamma transcript levels remained high. These results thus indicate that our newly established model of C. rodentium infection is a suitable system for analyzing the effects of probiotic bacteria on enteroinfections and that B. subtilis spores are efficient at reducing C. rodentium infection in mice, leaving unaltered the immune response against the pathogen.
TI  - Identification and characterization of EspK, a type III secreted effector protein of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) causes bloody diarrhoea in humans and  deploys a type III secretion system (T3SS) encoded by the locus of enterocyte effacement to elicit the formation of attaching and effacing (AE) lesions on intestinal epithelia. Here, we report the identification of a new secreted substrate of this system, z1829, which is encoded by cryptic prophage CP-933N. Elevated secretion of a beta-lactamase-z1829 fusion protein was detected upon mutation of sepD in EHEC O157:H7 and the fusion protein was translocated into infected epithelial cells in a T3SS-dependent manner; accordingly, we named the protein EspK. In common with the related Salmonella enterica type III secreted effector GogB, we observed that EspK localized to the cytoplasm when transiently expressed in COS-7 cells using EspK-specific antiserum. Inactivation of espK did not impair adherence or actin nucleation during infection of HeLa cells but affected persistence of EHEC O157:H7 in the intestines of orally inoculated calves. Inactivation of an orthologue of espK in the murine AE pathogen Citrobacter rodentium did not impair intestinal colonization in mice.
TI  - Bacterial genetic determinants of non-O157 STEC outbreaks and hemolytic-uremic syndrome after infection.
AB  - Although O157:H7 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are the predominant cause of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) in the world, non-O157:H7 serotypes are a medically important cause of HUS that are underdetected by current diagnostic approaches. Because Shiga toxin is necessary but not sufficient to cause HUS, identifying the virulence determinants that predict severe disease after non-O157 STEC infection is of paramount importance. Disease caused by O157:H7 STEC has been associated with a 26-gene pathogenicity island known as O island (OI) 122. To assess the public-health significance of this pathogenicity island, we examined the association between OI122 genes and outbreaks and HUS after non-O157 STEC infection. We found that a subset of OI122 genes is independently associated with outbreaks and HUS after infection with non-O157 STEC. The presence of multiple virulence genes in non-O157 serotypes strengthened this association, which suggests that the additive effects of a variable repertoire of virulence genes contribute to disease severity. In vivo, Citrobacter rodentium mutants lacking outbreak- and HUS-associated genes were deficient for virulence in mice; in particular, nleB mutant bacteria were unable to cause mortality in mice. The present study shows that virulence genes associated epidemiologically with outbreaks and HUS after non-O157 STEC infection are pivotal to the initiation, progression, and outcome of in vivo disease.
TI  - In vivo bioluminescence imaging of the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is a natural mouse pathogen related to enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. We have previously utilized bioluminescence imaging (BLI) to determine the in vivo colonization dynamics of C. rodentium. However, due to the oxygen requirement of the bioluminescence system and the colonic localization of C. rodentium, in vivo localization studies were performed using harvested organs. Here, we report the detection of bioluminescent C. rodentium and commensal E. coli during colonization of the gastrointestinal tract in intact living animals. Bioluminescence was dependent on intact blood circulation, suggesting that the colonic environment is not anaerobic but nanaerobic. In addition, BLI revealed that C. rodentium colonizes the rectum, a site previously unreported for this pathogen.
TI  - Aquaporins contribute to diarrhoea caused by attaching and effacing bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens such as enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) cause serious global health problems. These bacteria colonize the gastrointestinal system, attach to intestinal epithelial cells, efface (collapse) infected cell microvilli and cause overt diarrhoea that may ultimately result in death of the host. Although pathogenically induced diarrhoea is a significant global health issue, the molecular mechanisms that underlie this disease remain largely unknown. A natural murine infection model, employing the A/E pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, has been helpful in studying the diseases in vivo. C. rodentium colonize the colon at high levels, attach to colonocytes, efface microvilli and cause hyperplasia and inflammation in infected mice. As the disease progresses, the mice develop a diarrhoea-like phenotype. Aquaporin (AQP) water channels have been proposed to play a role in the normal dehydration of faecal contents. Here we examine whether C. rodentium infection may alter AQP localization in colonocytes. We demonstrate that during infection, AQP2 and AQP3 are mislocalized from their normal location along cell membranes to the cell cytoplasm. The change in localization of these proteins correlates with the diarrhoea-like phenotype present in infected mice. Mice that recover from the infection at 28-35 days post inoculum regain their normal membrane AQP localization. The altered localization of AQPs is partially dependent on the bacterial type III effector proteins EspF and EspG. We conclude that altered AQP localization may be a contributing factor to diarrhoea during bacterial infection.
TI  - Citrobacter rodentium infection causes both mitochondrial dysfunction and intestinal epithelial barrier disruption in vivo: role of mitochondrial associated protein (Map).
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli are non-invasive attaching/effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogens that infect their host's intestinal epithelium, causing severe diarrhoeal disease. These bacteria utilize a type III secretion apparatus to deliver effector molecules into host cells, subverting cellular function. Mitochondrial associated protein (Map) is a multifunctional effector protein that targets host cell mitochondria and contributes to infection-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction in vitro. Unfortunately, the relevance of these actions to the pathogenesis of EPEC-induced disease is uncertain. Using Citrobacter rodentium, a mouse-adapted A/E bacterium, we found that Map colocalized with host cell mitochondria, and that in vivo infection led to a disruption of mitochondrial morphology in infected colonocytes as assessed by electron microscopy. Histochemical staining for the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase also revealed a significant loss of mitochondrial respiratory function in the infected intestinal epithelium; however, both pathologies were attenuated in mice infected with a Deltamap strain. C. rodentium Map was also implicated in the disruption of epithelial barrier function both in vitro and in vivo. These studies thus advance our understanding of how A/E pathogens subvert host cell functions and cause disease, demonstrating that Map contributes to the functional disruption of the intestinal epithelium during enteric infection by C. rodentium.
TI  - Toll-like receptor 4 contributes to colitis development but not to host defense during Citrobacter rodentium infection in mice.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are noninvasive bacterial pathogens that infect their hosts' intestinal epithelium, causing severe diarrheal disease. These infections also cause intestinal inflammation, although the mechanisms underlying the inflammatory response, as well as its potential role in host defense, are unclear. Since these bacteria are gram-negative, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), the innate receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide may contribute to the host response; however, the role of TLR4 in the gastrointestinal tract is poorly understood, and its impact has yet to be tested against this family of enteric bacterial pathogens. Since EPEC and EHEC are human specific, we infected mice with Citrobacter rodentium, a mouse-adapted attaching and effacing (A/E) bacterium that infects colonic epithelial cells, causing colitis and epithelial hyperplasia, using a similar array of virulence proteins as EPEC and EHEC. We demonstrated that C. rodentium activates TLR4 and rapidly induced NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in host cells in a partially TLR4-dependent manner. Infection of TLR4-deficient mice revealed that TLR4-dependent responses mediate much of the inflammation and tissue pathology seen during infection, including the induction of the chemokines MIP-2 and MCP-1, as well as the recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils into the infected intestine. Surprisingly, spread of C. rodentium through the colon was delayed in TLR4-deficient mice, whereas the duration of the infection was unaffected, indicating that TLR4-mediated responses against this A/E pathogen are not host protective and are ultimately maladaptive to the host, contributing to both the morbidity and the pathology seen during infection.
TI  - The enteropathogenic Escherichia coli type III secretion system effector Map binds EBP50/NHERF1: implication for cell signalling and diarrhoea.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is the single most important contributor to child diarrhoea in developing countries. Nevertheless, the mechanism responsible for EPEC diarrhoea remains elusive. Using the yeast two-hybrid system to determine the target host cell protein of the EPEC type III secretion system effector Map led to identification of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM)-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50), also known as Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1). Protein interaction is mediated by the carboxy-terminal Thr-Arg-Leu (TRL) motif of Map and the PSD-95/Disk-large/ZO-1 domain 1 (PDZ1) of EBP50/NHERF1. Although EBP50/NHERF1 is recruited to site of EPEC adhesion in a Map-independent mechanism, co-immunoprecipitation and immunostaining revealed that Map binds to, induces proteolysis of, and colocalizes with EBP50/NHERF1 during infection of cultured epithelial cells. The TRL motif of Map was involved in Map-induced filopodia formation and brush border elongation on infected HeLa and Caco-2 cells respectively. As EBP50/NHERF1 regulates ion channels in the intestine we assessed the involvement of Map in diarrhoea using the Citrobacter rodentium mouse model of EPEC. We report significantly greater diarrhoea following infections with wild-type C. rodentium compared with C. rodentiumDeltamap. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of EPEC diarrhoea.
TI  - Essential role of the type III secretion system effector NleB in colonization of  mice by Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens are a significant cause of gastrointestinal illness in humans and animals. All A/E pathogens carry a large pathogenicity island, termed the locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE), which encodes a type III secretion system that translocates several effector proteins into host cells. To identify novel virulence determinants in A/E pathogens, we performed a signature-tagged mutagenesis screen in C57BL/6 mice by using the mouse A/E pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Five hundred seventy-six derivatives of C. rodentium were tested in pools of 12 mutants. One attenuated mutant carried a transposon insertion in nleB, which encodes a putative effector of the LEE-encoded type III secretion system (T3SS). nleB is present in a genomic pathogenicity island that also encodes another putative effector, NleE, immediately downstream. Using translational fusions with beta-lactamase (TEM-1), we showed that both NleB and NleE were translocated into host cells by the LEE-encoded T3SS of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. In addition, deletion of the gene encoding NleB in C. rodentium resulted in reduced colonization of mice in single infections and reduced colonic hyperplasia. In contrast, the deletion of other non-LEE-encoded effector genes in C. rodentium, nleC, nleD, or nleE, had no effect on host colonization or disease. These results suggest that nleB encodes an important virulence determinant of A/E pathogens.
TI  - Attaching and effacing pathogen-induced tight junction disruption in vivo.
AB  - Diarrhoea is a hallmark of infections by the human attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). Although the mechanisms underlying diarrhoea induced by these pathogens remain unknown, cell culture results have suggested that these pathogens may target tight junctions. Tight junctions in the colon function as physical intercellular barriers that separate and prevent mixing of the luminal contents with adlumenal regions of the epithelium. Consequently, it is thought that the disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions by A/E pathogens could result in a loss of barrier function in the alimentary tract; however, this remains unexamined. Here we demonstrate for the first time that A/E pathogen infection results in the morphological alteration of tight junctions during natural disease. Tight junction alteration, characterized by relocalization of the transmembrane tight junction proteins claudin 1, 3 and 5, is a functional disruption; molecular tracers, which do not normally penetrate uninfected epithelia, pass across pathogen-infected epithelia. Functional junction disruption occurs with a concomitant increase in colon luminal water content. The effects on tissue are dependent upon the bacterial type III effector EspF (E. coli secreted protein F), because bacteria lacking EspF, while able to colonize, are defective for junction disruption and result in decreased proportions of water in the colon compared with wild-type infection. These results suggest that the diarrhoea induced by A/E pathogens occurs as part of functional tight junction disruption.
TI  - The lpf gene cluster for long polar fimbriae is not involved in adherence of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli or virulence of Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Using the enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) genome sequence, we found that EPEC E2348/69 has an lpfABCDE gene cluster homologous (about 60% identical at the protein level) to the Salmonella long polar fimbria (LPF) operon. To determine whether this operon is essential for adherence, the lpfABCD(E2)(3) genes were deleted from EPEC strain E2348/69 by allelic exchange. Analysis of the resulting EPECDeltalpfABCD(E23) strain showed no change in adherence to HeLa cells or to human intestinal biopsy cells in the in vitro organ culture (IVOC) system compared to the wild type. Sera from volunteers experimentally infected with E2348/69 showed no antibody response to the major subunit protein, LpfA. These results suggested that the lpf(E23) gene cluster is not necessary for EPEC adherence and attaching/effacing (A/E) lesion formation on human biopsy samples and is not expressed during human infection. We also identified an lpf gene cluster in Citrobacter rodentium strain ICC168 (lpf(cr)). A DeltalpfA(cr) mutant of ICC168 retained wild-type adherence and A/E lesion-forming activity on HeLa cells. C3H/HeJ mice were infected with a wild-type C. rodentium strain and its lpfA(cr) isogenic mutant. Both strains were recovered at high levels in stools, and there were no significant differences between the groups both in terms of the number of CFU/organ (colon and cecum) and in terms of the amount of hyperplasia, as measured by weight. Similar results were observed in a second mouse strain, C57BL/6. These data suggest that in addition to playing no apparent role in EPEC pathogenesis, lpf(cr) is not required for C. rodentium virulence in either the C3H/HeJ or C57BL/6 mouse model.
TI  - Hepatic and renal cytochrome p450 gene regulation during citrobacter rodentium infection in wild-type and toll-like receptor 4 mutant mice.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is the rodent equivalent of human enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infection. This study investigated regulation of hepatic and renal cytochrome P450 (P450) mRNAs, hepatic P450 proteins, cytokines, and acute phase proteins during C. rodentium infection. Female C3H/HeOuJ (HeOu) and C3H/HeJ (HeJ) mice [which lack functional toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)] were infected with C. rodentium by oral gavage and sacrificed 6 days later. Hepatic CYP4A10 and 4A14 mRNAs were decreased in HeOu mice (<4% of control). CYP3A11, 2C29, 4F14, and 4F15 mRNAs were reduced to 16 to 55% of control levels, whereas CYP2A5, 4F16, and 4F18 mRNAs were induced (180, 190, and 600% of control, respectively). The pattern of P450 regulation in HeJ mice was similar to that in HeOu mice for most P450s, with the exception of the TLR4 dependence of CYP4F15. Hepatic CYP2C, 3A, and 4A proteins in both groups were decreased, whereas CYP2E protein was not. Renal CYP4A10 and 4A14 mRNAs were significantly down-regulated in HeOu mice, whereas other P450s were unaffected. Most renal P450 mRNAs in infected HeJ mice were increased, notably CYP4A10, 4A14, 4F18, 2A5, and 3A13. Hepatic levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) mRNAs were significantly increased in infected HeOu mice, whereas only TNFalpha mRNA was significantly increased in HeJ mice. Hepatic alpha1-acid glycoprotein was induced in both groups, whereas alpha-fibrinogen and angiotensinogen were unchanged. These data indicate that hepatic inflammation induced by C. rodentium infection is mainly TLR4-independent and suggest that hepatic P450 down-regulation in this model may be cytokine-mediated.
TI  - Expression of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoform mRNAs during inflammation and infection in mouse liver and kidney.
AB  - Inflammation or infection down-regulates the activity and expression of cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes involved in hepatic drug clearance, possibly altering drug effectiveness and leading to toxicity. The regulation of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) in inflammation and infection is less well characterized. To determine the response of hepatic and renal UGTs during inflammation and infection, mice were administered either saline or 1 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (16 h), or Citrobacter rodentium by oral gavage (6 days). Hepatic mRNA expression of UGT1A1, 1A9, and 2B5 was similarly down-regulated after LPS exposure and C. rodentium infection, whereas UGT1A2 and 1A6 mRNAs were unchanged. Effects of C. rodentium infection did not require a functional Toll-like receptor 4. Conversely, renal UGT isoforms were relatively unaffected, except for UGT2B5 induction after LPS treatment. Regulation of UGTs during the inflammatory response exhibits similarities to and differences from regulation of P450s, and may be cytokine-mediated.
TI  - Citrobacter rodentium of mice and man.
AB  - The major classes of enteric bacteria harbour a conserved core genomic structure, common to both commensal and pathogenic strains, that is most likely optimized to a life style involving colonization of the host intestine and transmission via the environment. In pathogenic bacteria this core genome framework is decorated with novel genetic islands that are often associated with adaptive phenotypes such as virulence. This classical genome organization is well illustrated by a group of extracellular enteric pathogens, which includes enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and Citrobacter rodentium, all of which use attaching and effacing (A/E) lesion formation as a major mechanism of tissue targeting and infection. Both EHEC and EPEC are poorly pathogenic in mice but infect humans and domestic animals. In contrast, C. rodentium is a natural mouse pathogen that is related to E. coli, hence providing an excellent in vivo model for A/E lesion forming pathogens. C. rodentium also provides a model of infections that are mainly restricted to the lumen of the intestine. The mechanism's by which the immune system deals with such infections has become a topic of great interest in recent years. Here we review the literature of C. rodentium from its emergence in the mid-1960s to the most contemporary reports of colonization, pathogenesis, transmission and immunity.
TI  - Preinoculation with the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus early in life effectively inhibits murine Citrobacter rodentium colitis.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a common pathogen in infantile diarrhea, causing a characteristic histopathologic attaching and effacing (A/E) lesion in the intestinal mucosa. The mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium causes a similar A/E lesion in the murine intestine. Like EPEC, C. rodentium infection results in colonic crypt hyperplasia, goblet cell depletion, epithelial proliferation, and mucosal disruption. Using this murine model, we tested the hypothesis that preinoculation of murine gut with Lactobacillus acidophilus early in life can enhance host defense against enteric bacterial infection and attenuate bacteria-mediated colitis. Two-week old BALB/c mice were inoculated with L. acidophilus twice per week for 4 weeks before C. rodentium infection or concomitantly with the exposure to C. rodentium at 6-8 weeks of age. The probiotics were administered twice weekly thereafter. We observed that L. acidophilus inoculation in mice inhibits C. rodentium-induced colitis, which is associated with a decrease in C. rodentium colonization and translocation, an increase in its clearance, and a suppression of colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Probiotic treatment also stimulates regulatory cytokine expression in the colon [transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), interleukin (IL)-10]. Preinoculation with L. acidophilus is more effective than concomitant use of probiotics in the induction of intestinal IgA secretion and in the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression [tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6, and IL-12]. These observations suggest that inoculation with probiotics can effectively prevent bacteria-induced colitis by limiting enteric bacteria infection and promoting mucosal protective regulatory immune responses. This study may have ramifications for prevention of infectious diarrhea in human infants and children, particularly in developing countries.
TI  - A positive regulatory loop controls expression of the locus of enterocyte effacement-encoded regulators Ler and GrlA.
AB  - The formation of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions on intestinal epithelial cells is an essential step in the pathogenesis of human enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and of the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. The genes required for the development of the A/E phenotype are located within a pathogenicity island known as the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). The LEE-encoded transcriptional regulators Ler, an H-NS-like protein, and GrlA, a member of a novel family of transcriptional activators, positively control the expression of the genes located in the LEE and their corresponding virulence. In this study, we used C. rodentium as a model to study the mechanisms controlling the expression of Ler and GrlA. By deletion analysis of the ler and grlRA regulatory regions and complementation experiments, negative and positive cis-acting regulatory motifs were identified that are essential for the regulation of both genes. This analysis confirmed that GrlA is required for the activation of ler, but it also showed that Ler is required for the expression of grlRA, revealing a novel regulatory loop controlling the optimal expression of virulence genes in A/E pathogens. Furthermore, our results indicate that Ler and GrlA induce the expression of each other by, at least in part, counteracting the repression mediated by H-NS. However, whereas GrlA is still required for the optimal expression of ler even in the absence of H-NS, Ler is not needed for the expression of grlRA in the absence of H-NS. This type of transcriptional positive regulatory loop represents a novel mechanism in pathogenic bacteria that is likely required to maintain an appropriate spatiotemporal transcriptional response during infection.
TI  - AIP56, a novel plasmid-encoded virulence factor of Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida with apoptogenic activity against sea bass macrophages and neutrophils.
AB  - A strategy used by extracellular pathogens to evade phagocytosis is the utilization of exotoxins that kill host phagocytes. We have recently shown that one major pathogenicity strategy of Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp), the agent of the widespread fish pasteurellosis, is the induction of extensive apoptosis of sea bass macrophages and neutrophils that results in lysis of these phagocytes by post-apoptotic secondary necrosis. Here we show that this unique process is mediated by a novel plasmid-encoded apoptosis inducing protein of 56 kDa (AIP56), an exotoxin abundantly secreted by all virulent, but not avirulent, Phdp strains tested. AIP56 is related to an unknown protein of the enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 and NleC, a Citrobacter rodentium type III secreted effector of unknown function. Passive immunization of sea bass with a rabbit anti-AIP56 serum conferred protection against Phdp challenge, indicating that AIP56 represents a key virulence factor of that pathogen and is a candidate for the design of an anti-pasteurellosis vaccine.
TI  - Multiple functions of l0036 in the regulation of the pathogenicity island of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Diarrhoeagenic enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli and enteropathogenic E. coli attach to human intestinal epithelium and efface brush-border microvilli, forming an A/E (attaching and effacing) lesion. These human pathogens are phenotypically similar to the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Genetically, they all have a homologous set of virulent genes involved in the A/E lesion, and these genes are organized on a LEE (locus of enterocyte effacement), a pathogenicity island. This island comprises 41 specific open reading frames, of which most are organized at five operons, LEE1, LEE2, LEE3, LEE4 and tir (LEE5). The expression of the LEE genes is regulated in a complicated manner, and current knowledge is that there are at least two positive regulators, Ler (LEE-encoded regulator) and GrlA (global regulator of LEE activator), and one negative regulator, called GrlR (global regulator of LEE repressor). In enterohaemorrhagic E. coli, GrlA is encoded by l0043, whereas GrlR is encoded by l0044. Here we report a fourth regulatory gene located in LEE3, namely l0036. Its expression is tightly controlled. When overexpressed, this factor, named Mpc (multiple point controller), interacts with Ler and suppresses the expression of the LEE proteins. When the translation is not initiated or terminated before maturation, the type III secretion of effectors is completely abolished. Therefore, together with the fact that several cis elements reside in the region that l0036 spans, l0036 appeared to have multiple functions in the regulation of LEE expression.
TI  - The lrp gene and its role in type I fimbriation in Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is a murine pathogen that is now widely used as an in vivo  model for gastrointestinal infections due to its similarities with human enteropathogens, such as the possession of a locus for enterocyte effacement (the LEE island). We studied the lrp gene of C. rodentium and found that it encodes a product highly similar to members of the Lrp (leucine-responsive regulatory protein) family of transcriptional regulators, able to recognize leucine as an effector and to repress the expression of its own structural gene. In enterobacteria, Lrp is a global regulator of gene expression, as it controls a large variety of genes, including those coding for cell appendages and other potential virulence factors. Based on the well-established role of Lrp on the expression of pilus genes in Escherichia coli, we also studied the role of Lrp in controlling the formation of the type I pilus in C. rodentium. Type I pili, produced by the fim system, are virulence factors of uropathogens, involved in mediating bacterial adhesion to bladder epithelial cells. Yeast agglutination assays showed that Lrp is needed for type I pilus formation and real-time PCR experiments indicated that Lrp has a strong leucine-mediated effect on the expression of the fimAICDFGH operon. Mutant studies indicated that this positive action is exerted mainly through a positive control of Lrp on the phase variation mechanism that regulates fimAICDFGH expression. A quantitative analysis of its expression suggested that this operon may also be negatively regulated at the level of transcription.
TI  - Concurrent infection with an intestinal helminth parasite impairs host resistance to enteric Citrobacter rodentium and enhances Citrobacter-induced colitis in mice.
AB  - Infections with intestinal helminth and bacterial pathogens, such as enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, continue to be a major global health threat for children. To test the hypothesis that intestinal helminth infection may be a risk factor for enteric bacterial infection, a murine model was established by using the intestinal helminth Heligomosomoides polygyrus. To analyze the modulatory effect of a Th2-inducing helminth on the outcome of enteric bacterium Citrobacter rodentium infection, BALB/c and STAT 6 knockout (KO) mice were infected with H. polygyrus, C. rodentium, or both. We found that only BALB/c mice coinfected with H. polygyrus and C. rodentium displayed a marked morbidity and mortality. The enhanced susceptibility to C. rodentium and intestinal injury of coinfected BALB/c mice were shown to be associated with a significant increase in helminth-driven Th2 responses, mucosally and systemically, and correlated with a significant downregulation of protective gamma interferon and with a dramatic upregulation of the proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor alpha response. In addition, C. rodentium-associated colonic pathology in coinfected BALB/c mice was significantly enhanced, whereas bacterial burden was increased and clearance was delayed. In contrast, coinfection in STAT 6 KO mice failed to promote C. rodentium infection or to induce a more severe intestinal inflammation and tissue injury, demonstrating a mechanism by which helminth influences the development of host protective immunity and susceptibility to bacterial infections. We conclude that H. polygyrus coinfection can promote C. rodentium-associated disease and colitis through a STAT 6-mediated immune mechanism.
TI  - Emergence of a 'hyperinfectious' bacterial state after passage of Citrobacter rodentium through the host gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium belongs to a family of human and animal enteric pathogens that includes the clinically significant enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). These pathogens exploit attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions to colonize the host gastrointestinal tract. However, both EHEC and EPEC are poorly pathogenic in mice. In contrast, C. rodentium, which is genetically highly related to E. coli, relies on A/E lesion formation as an essential step in both colonization and infection of the murine mucosa, providing an excellent in vivo model. In this study we have used bioluminescence imaging (BLI) to investigate the organ specificity and dynamics of colonization of mice by LB-grown and mouse-passaged C. rodentium in situ and in real time. We have demonstrated the appearance of a 'hyperinfectious' state after passage of C. rodentium through the murine gastrointestinal tract. The 'hyperinfectious' state was found to dramatically reduce the dose required to infect secondary individuals, and also influenced the tissue distribution of colonizing bacteria, removing the requirement for primary colonization of the caecal patch. In addition, the 'hyperinfectious' phenotype was found to be transient with one overnight passage in rich medium sufficient to return C. rodentium to 'culture' infectivity.
TI  - A major role for proteolytic activity and proteinase-activated receptor-2 in the  pathogenesis of infectious colitis.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is a bacterial pathogen that causes a murine infectious colitis equivalent to enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection in humans. Colonic luminal fluid from C. rodentium-infected mice, but not from sham-infected mice, contains active serine proteinases that can activate proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2). We have identified granzyme A and murine trypsins to be present in C. rodentium-infected luminal fluid, as determined by mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis. Inflammatory indices (colonic mucosa macroscopic damage score, increased intestinal wall thickness, granulocyte infiltration, and bacterial translocation from the colonic lumen to peritoneal organs) were all increased in C. rodentium-infected mice, compared with sham-infected mice. Soybean trypsin inhibitor-treated wild-type mice and untreated PAR2-deficient (PAR2-/-) mice (compared with their wild-type littermates) both had substantially reduced levels of C. rodentium-induced inflammation. These data point to an important role for both pathogen-induced host serine proteinases and PAR2 in the setting of infectious colitis.
TI  - A gene encoding L-methionine gamma-lyase is present in Enterobacteriaceae family  genomes: identification and characterization of Citrobacter freundii L-methionine gamma-lyase.
AB  - Citrobacter freundii cells produce L-methionine gamma-lyase when grown on a medium containing L-methionine. The nucleotide sequence of the hybrid plasmid with a C. freundii EcoRI insert of about 3.0 kbp contained two open reading frames, consisting of 1,194 nucleotides and 1,296 nucleotides, respectively. The first one (denoted megL) encoded L-methionine gamma-lyase. The enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The second frame encoded a protein belonging to the family of permeases. Regions of high sequence identity with the 3'-terminal part of the C. freundii megL gene located in the same regions of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, E. coli, and Citrobacter rodentium genomes were found.
TI  - Modulation of host cytoskeleton function by the enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium effector protein EspG.
AB  - EspG is a conserved protein encoded by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) of attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens, including enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium. EspG is delivered into infected host cells by a type III secretion system. The role of EspG in virulence has not yet been defined. Here we describe experiments that probe the virulence characteristics and biological activities of EspG in vitro and in vivo. A C. rodentium espG mutant displayed a significantly reduced ability to colonize C57BL/6 mice and to cause colonic hyperplasia. Epitope-tagged EspG was detected in the apical regions of infected colonic epithelial cells in infected mice, partially localizing with another LEE-encoded effector protein, Tir. EspG was found to interact with mammalian tubulin in both genetic screens and gel overlay assays. Binding to tubulin by EspG caused localized microtubule depolymerization, resulting in actin stress fiber formation through an undefined mechanism. Heterologous expression of EspG in yeast resulted in loss of cytoplasmic microtubule structure and function, preventing coordination between bud development and nuclear division. Yeast expressing EspG were also unable to control cortical actin polarity. We suggest that EspG contributes to the ability of A/E pathogens to establish infection through a modulation of the host cytoskeleton involving transient microtubule destruction and actin polymerization in a manner akin to the Shigella flexneri VirA protein.
TI  - Cathelicidin mediates innate intestinal defense against colonization with epithelial adherent bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (mCRAMP), the sole murine cathelicidin, is encoded by the gene Cnlp. We show that mCRAMP expression in the intestinal tract is largely restricted to surface epithelial cells in the colon. Synthetic mCRAMP had antimicrobial activity against the murine enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, which like the related clinically important human pathogens enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli, adheres to the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. Colon epithelial cell extracts from Cnlp+/+ mice had significantly greater antimicrobial activity against C. rodentium than those of mutant Cnlp-/- mice that lack mCRAMP. Cnlp-/- mice developed significantly greater colon surface and crypt epithelial cell colonization, surface epithelial cell damage, and systemic dissemination of infection than Cnlp+/+ mice after oral infection with C. rodentium. Moreover, Cnlp+/+ mice were protected from oral infections with C. rodentium inocula that infected the majority of Cnlp-/- mice. These results establish cathelicidin as an important component of innate antimicrobial defense in the colon.
TI  - Regulation of type III secretion hierarchy of translocators and effectors in attaching and effacing bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Human enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), and the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium (CR) belong to the family of attaching and effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogens. They possess the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, which encodes a type III secretion system. These pathogens secrete a number of proteins into culture media, including type III effector proteins and translocators that are required for the translocation of effectors into host cells. Preliminary evidence indicated that the LEE-encoded SepL and Rorf6/SepD may form a molecular switch that controls the secretion of translocators and effectors in CR. Here, we show that SepL and SepD indeed perform this function in A/E pathogens such as EHEC and EPEC. Their sepL and sepD mutants do not secrete translocators but exhibit enhanced secretion of effectors. We demonstrate that SepL and SepD interact with each other and that both SepL and SepD are localized to the bacterial membranes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that culture media influence the type III secretion profile of EHEC, EPEC, and CR and that low-calcium concentrations inhibit secretion of translocators but promote the secretion of effectors, similar to effects on type III secretion by mutations in sepL and sepD. However, the secretion profile of the sepD and sepL mutants is not affected by these culture conditions. Collectively, our results suggest that SepL and SepD not only are necessary for efficient translocator secretion in A/E pathogens but also control a switch from translocator to effector secretion by sensing certain environmental signals such as low calcium.
TI  - Mast cells limit systemic bacterial dissemination but not colitis in response to  Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli cause an inflammatory colitis in human patients characterized by neutrophil infiltration, proinflammatory cytokine expression, and crypt hyperplasia. Citrobacter rodentium causes a similar colitis in mice and serves as a model for enteropathogenic E. coli infection in humans. C. rodentium induces systemic T-cell-dependent antibody production that facilitates clearance of the bacteria and protects the host from reinfection. The role of innate immune cells in infectious colitis, however, is less well understood. In this study, we have determined the role of mast cells in the inflammatory response and disease induced by C. rodentium. Mice deficient in mast cells exhibit more severe colonic histopathology and have a higher mortality rate following infection with C. rodentium than do wild-type animals. Despite unimpaired neutrophil recruitment and lymphocyte activation, mast cell-deficient mice have a disseminated infection evident in crucial organ systems that contributes to sepsis. Importantly, mast cells also have the capacity to directly kill C. rodentium. Together, these results suggest that mast cells protect the host from systemic infection by reducing the bacterial load and preventing dissemination of the bacterium from the colon.
TI  - Citrobacter rodentium lifA/efa1 is essential for colonic colonization and crypt cell hyperplasia in vivo.
AB  - Previously, we have identified a large gene (lifA, for lymphocyte inhibitory factor A) in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) encoding a protein termed lymphostatin that suppresses cytokine expression in vitro. This protein also functions as an adhesion factor for enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli and is alternatively known as efa1 (EHEC factor for adherence 1). The lifA/efa1 gene is also present in Citrobacter rodentium, an enteric pathogen that causes a disease termed transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia (TMCH), which induces colitis and massive crypt cell proliferation, in mice. To determine if lifA/efa1 is required for C. rodentium-induced colonic pathology in vivo, three in-frame mutations were generated, disrupting the glycosyltransferase (GlM12) and protease (PrMC31) motifs and a domain in between that does not encode any known activity (EID3). In contrast to infection with wild-type C. rodentium, that with any of the lifA/efa1 mutant strains did not induce weight loss or TMCH. Enteric infection with motif mutants GlM12 and PrM31 resulted in significantly reduced colonization counts during the entire 20-day course of infection. In contrast, EID3 was indistinguishable from the wild type during the initial colonic colonization, but cleared rapidly after day 8 of the infection. The colonic epithelium of all infected mice displayed increased epithelial regeneration. However, significantly increased regeneration was observed by day 20 only in mice infected with the wild-type in comparison to those infected with lifA/efa1 mutant EID3. In summary, lifA/efa1 is a critical gene outside the locus for enterocyte effacement that regulates bacterial colonization, crypt cell proliferation, and epithelial cell regeneration.
TI  - The Flag-2 locus, an ancestral gene cluster, is potentially associated with a novel flagellar system from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli K-12 possesses two adjacent, divergent, promoterless flagellar genes, fhiA-mbhA, that are absent from Salmonella enterica. Through bioinformatics analysis, we found that these genes are remnants of an ancestral 44-gene cluster and are capable of encoding a novel flagellar system, Flag-2. In enteroaggregative E. coli strain 042, there is a frameshift in lfgC that is likely to have inactivated the system in this strain. Tiling path PCR studies showed that the Flag-2 cluster is present in 15 of 72 of the well-characterized ECOR strains. The Flag-2 system resembles the lateral flagellar systems of Aeromonas and Vibrio, particularly in its apparent dependence on RpoN. Unlike the conventional Flag-1 flagellin, the Flag-2 flagellin shows a remarkable lack of sequence polymorphism. The Flag-2 gene cluster encodes a flagellar type III secretion system (including a dedicated flagellar sigma-antisigma combination), thus raising the number of distinct type III secretion systems in Escherichia/Shigella to five. The presence of the Flag-2 cluster at identical sites in E. coli and its close relative Citrobacter rodentium, combined with its absence from S. enterica, suggests that it was acquired by horizontal gene transfer after the former two species diverged from Salmonella. The presence of Flag-2-like gene clusters in Yersinia pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Chromobacterium violaceum suggests that coexistence of two flagellar systems within the same species is more common than previously suspected. The fact that the Flag-2 gene cluster was not discovered in the first 10 Escherichia/Shigella genome sequences studied emphasizes the importance of maintaining an energetic program of genome sequencing for this important taxonomic group.
TI  - A genomic population genetics analysis of the pathogenic enterocyte effacement island in Escherichia coli: the search for the unit of selection.
AB  - Comparative genomic analysis is a powerful tool for understanding the history and organization of complete genomes. The mathematical tools of population genetics combined with genomic analysis provide a powerful approach to dissect heterogeneities in genome evolution. This study presents a hierarchical analysis of the enterocyte and effacement island (35 kb), which is found in the enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic strains in Escherichia coli and in Citrobacter rodentium. The locus of enterocyte and effacement in E. coli is considered to be a clonal unit inside a clonal organism and is expected to evolve as a single unit. This analysis examines the clonal assumption by determining genetic diversity, GC content, and the substitution rates at the different functional levels of (i) the complete pathogenic island, (ii) the five operons in which the island is organized, and (iii) for each of the individual 41 genes that comprise the locus. We find that there is a conserved region that is composed of genes that belong to the type III secretion system and that may be products of horizontal transfer. A more diverse region is composed of genes for secreted proteins and genes that we infer to be original components of the E. coli genome. This genetic mosaic seems to be differentially affected by selection and mutation. Our results suggest that recombination and selection may be breaking this structure so that different elements are, at best, weakly coupled in their evolution. These observations suggest that the units of selection are not the complete island, but rather, much smaller units that comprise the island.
TI  - EspJ is a prophage-carried type III effector protein of attaching and effacing pathogens that modulates infection dynamics.
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, and Citrobacter rodentium are highly adapted enteropathogens that successfully colonize their host's gastrointestinal tract via the formation of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions. These pathogens utilize a type III secretion system (TTSS) apparatus, encoded by the locus of enterocyte effacement, to translocate bacterial effector proteins into epithelial cells. Here, we report the identification of EspJ (E. coli-secreted protein J), a translocated TTSS effector that is carried on the 5' end of the cryptic prophage CP-933U. Infection of epithelial cells in culture revealed that EspJ is not required for A/E lesion activity in vivo and ex vivo. However, in vivo studies performed with mice demonstrated that EspJ possesses properties that influence the dynamics of clearance of the pathogen from the host's intestinal tract, suggesting a role in host survival and pathogen transmission.
TI  - Attaching-effacing bacteria in animals.
AB  - Enteric bacteria with a demonstrable or potential ability to form attaching-effacing lesions, so-called attaching-effacing (AE) bacteria, have been found in the intestinal tracts of a wide variety of warm-blooded animal species, including man. In some host species, for example cattle, pigs, rabbits and human beings, attaching-effacing Escherichia coli (AEEC) have an established role as enteropathogens. In other host species, AE bacteria are of less certain significance. With continuing advances in the detection and typing of AE strains, the importance of these bacteria for many hosts is likely to become clearer. The pathogenic effects of AE bacteria result from adhesion to the intestinal mucosa by a variety of mechanisms, culminating in the formation of the characteristic intimate adhesion of the AE lesion. The ability to induce AE lesions is mediated by the co-ordinated expression of some 40 bacterial genes organized within a so-called pathogenicity island, known as the "Locus for Enterocyte Effacement". It is also believed that the production of bacterial toxins, principally Vero toxins, is a significant virulence factor for some AEEC strains. Recent areas of research into AE bacteria include: the use of Citrobacter rodentium to model human AEEC disease; quorum-sensing mechanisms used by AEEC to modulate virulence gene expression; and the potential role of adhesion in the persistent colonization of the intestine by AE bacteria. This review of AE bacteria covers their molecular biology, their occurrence in various animal species, and the diagnosis, pathology and clinical aspects of animal diseases with which they are associated. Reference is made to human pathogens where appropriate. The focus is mainly on natural colonization and disease, but complementary experimental data are also included.
TI  - Targeting of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli EspF to host mitochondria is essential for bacterial pathogenesis: critical role of the 16th leucine residue in EspF.
AB  - The attachment of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) to host cells and the  induction of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions are prominent pathogenic features. EPEC infection also leads to host cell death and damage to the intestinal mucosa, which is partly dependent upon EspF, one of the effectors. In this study, we demonstrate that EspF is a mitochondrial import protein with a functional mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS), because EspF activity for importing into the mitochondria was abrogated by MTS deletion mutants. Substitution of the 16th leucine with glutamic acid (EspF(L16E)) completely abolished EspF activity. Infection of HeLa cells with wild type but not the espF mutant (DeltaespF) decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), leading to cell death. The DeltaPsi(m) decrease and cell death were restored in cells infected with DeltaespF/pEspF but not DeltaespF/pEspF(L16E), suggesting that the 16th leucine in the MTS is a critical amino acid for EspF function. To demonstrate the impact of EspF in vivo, we exploited Citrobacter rodentium by infecting C3H/HeJ mice with DeltaespF(CR), DeltaespF(CR)/pEspF(CR), or DeltaespF(CR)/pEspF(L16E)(CR). These results indicate that EspF activity contributes to bacterial pathogenesis, as judged by murine lethality and intestinal histopathology, and promotion of bacterial colonization of the intestinal mucosa.
TI  - The lymphotoxin-beta receptor is critical for control of murine Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Lymphotoxin is a tumor necrosis factor-family cytokine. Blocking of lymphotoxin alpha 1 beta 2 /lymphotoxin-beta receptor interactions prevents experimental colitis in mice, and this suggests a potential treatment principle of human inflammatory bowel disease. Infection of mice with Citrobacter rodentium serves as an animal model for human infectious colitis induced by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli . We studied the role of lymphotoxin alpha 1 beta 2 /lymphotoxin-beta receptor signaling in Citrobacter rodentium -induced colitis. METHODS: Mice with disrupted lymphotoxin alpha 1 beta 2 /lymphotoxin-beta receptor interactions secondary to gene defects (lymphotoxin-alpha -/- , lymphotoxin-beta -/- , and lymphotoxin-beta receptor -/- ) or treatment with the antagonist lymphotoxin-beta receptor-immunoglobulin G fusion protein were infected with Citrobacter rodentium . Body weight, fecal excretion of Citrobacter rodentium , and disease-related mortality were monitored. Spleen and liver organ cultures of mice assessed systemic infection. Intestinal inflammation and lymphoid architecture were histologically recorded in the large intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen of infected mice. RESULTS: Inhibition of lymphotoxin alpha 1 beta 2 /lymphotoxin-beta receptor interactions was associated with increased severity of Citrobacter rodentium -induced colitis, as indicated by increased disease-related mortality, more severe weight loss, intestinal bacterial abscesses, and a higher burden of Citrobacter rodentium in the spleen and liver of -/- and lymphotoxin-beta receptor-immunoglobulin G-treated mice. There was a reduction of CD11c + dendritic cells in the spleen of naive and infected -/- and lymphotoxin-beta receptor-immunoglobulin G-treated mice. In infected lymphotoxin-beta receptor -/- mice, anti- Citrobacter rodentium immunoglobulin G2a levels were decreased, whereas immunoglobulin G1 levels were increased. Citrobacter rodentium -induced interleukin-4 secretion was increased in lymphotoxin-beta receptor -/- mice. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphotoxin alpha 1 beta 2 /lymphotoxin-beta receptor interactions are critical for immunity against Citrobacter rodentium in mice. Impaired anti-enteropathogenic Escherichia coli immunity may be anticipated in anti-lymphotoxin-beta receptor-directed therapy for human inflammatory bowel disease.
TI  - Organ specificity, colonization and clearance dynamics in vivo following oral challenges with the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium belongs to a family of human and animal enteric pathogens that includes the clinically significant enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). These pathogens use attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions to colonize the host gastrointestinal tract. In this study we have used bioluminescence imaging (BLI) to investigate the organ specificity, dynamics of colonization and clearance of mice by C. rodentium in situ and in real time. The bioluminescent C. rodentium derivative, strain ICC180, expresses the luxCDABE operon from the entemopathogenic nematode symbiont Photorhabdus luminescens and light levels accurately reflect bacterial numbers both in vitro and in vivo. We have demonstrated that primary colonization of the mouse by C. rodentium takes place within the caecum, specifically within the specialized patch of lymphoid tissue known as the caecal patch. Following colonization of the caecum C. rodentium established a colonic infection. Clearance of C. rodentium ICC180 parallels the colonization dynamics, i.e. the caecum was first to be cleared followed by the colon. A bioluminescent eae (encoding the outer membrane adhesin intimin) C. rodentium mutant failed to establish long-term colonization, although low levels of bacteria could be recovered for up to 3 days post challenge from the caecum.
TI  - SseK1 and SseK2 are novel translocated proteins of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  - Salmonella enterica is a gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogen that causes disease symptoms ranging from gastroenteritis to typhoid fever. A key virulence strategy is the translocation of bacterial effector proteins into the host cell, mediated by the type III secretion systems (TTSSs) encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) and SPI-2. In S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2, we identified the protein products of STM4157 and STM2137 as novel candidate secreted proteins by comparison to known secreted proteins from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium. The STM4157 and STM2137 proteins, which we have designated SseK1 and SseK2, respectively, are 61% identical at the amino acid level and differ mainly in their N termini. Western analysis showed that in vitro accumulation and secretion of these proteins in serovar Typhimurium were affected by mutations in the two-component systems SsrA/B and PhoP/Q, which are key mediators of intracellular growth and survival. SPI-2 TTSS-dependent translocation of recombinant SseK1::Cya was evident at 9 h postinfection of epithelial cells, while translocation of SseK2::Cya was not detected until 21 h. Remarkably, the translocation signal for SseK1 was contained within the N-terminal 32 amino acids. Fractionation of infected epithelial cells revealed that following translocation SseK1 localizes to the host cytosol, which is unusual among the currently known Salmonella effectors. Phenotypic analysis of DeltasseK1, DeltasseK2, and DeltasseK1/DeltasseK2 mutants provided evidence for a role that was not critical during systemic infection. In summary, this work demonstrates that SseK1 and SseK2 are novel translocated proteins of serovar Typhimurium.
TI  - Intimin types alpha, beta, and gamma bind to nucleolin with equivalent affinity but lower avidity than to the translocated intimin receptor.
AB  - The outer membrane adhesins of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Citrobacter rodentium, and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 that mediate attach and efface intestinal lesions are classified as intimin alpha, beta, and gamma, respectively. Each of these intimin types binds to its cognate, bacterially encoded receptor (called Tir for translocated intimin receptor) to promote tight adherence of the organism to the host-cell plasma membrane. We previously reported that gamma intimin of EHEC O157:H7 also bound to a eucaryotic receptor that we determined was nucleolin. The objective of this study was to investigate in vitro and in vivo the interactions of intimins alpha, beta, and gamma with nucleolin in the presence of Tir from EHEC O157:H7. Protein binding experiments demonstrated that intimin of types alpha, beta, and gamma bound nucleolin with similar affinity. Moreover, all three intimin types co-localized with regions of nucleolin expressed on the surface of HEp-2 cells. When intimin alpha, beta, or gamma bound to Tir in vitro, the intimin interaction with nucleolin was blocked. Both Tir and nucleolin accumulated beneath intimin-presenting bacteria that had attached to the surface of HEp-2 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that nucleolin is involved in bacterial adherence promoted by all intimin types and that Tir and nucleolin compete for intimin during adherence.
TI  - Clearance of Citrobacter rodentium requires B cells but not secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) or IgM antibodies.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium, a murine model pathogen for human enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, predominantly colonizes the lumen and mucosal surface of the colon and cecum and causes crypt hyperplasia and mucosal inflammation. Mice infected with C. rodentium develop a secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) response, but the role of B cells or secretory antibodies in host defense is unknown. To address this question, we conducted oral C. rodentium infections in mice lacking B cells, IgA, secreted IgM, polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR), or J chain. Normal mice showed peak bacterial numbers in colon and feces at 1 week and bacterial eradication after 3 to 4 weeks. B-cell-deficient mice were equally susceptible initially but could not control infection subsequently. Tissue responses showed marked differences, as infection of normal mice was accompanied by transient crypt hyperplasia and mucosal inflammation in the colon and cecum at 2 but not 6 weeks, whereas B-cell-deficient mice had few mucosal changes at 2 weeks but severe epithelial hyperplasia with ulcerations and mucosal inflammation at 6 weeks. The functions of B cells were not mediated by secretory antibodies, since mice lacking IgA or secreted IgM or proteins required for their transport into the lumen, pIgR or J chain, cleared C. rodentium normally. Nonetheless, systemic administration of immune sera reduced bacterial numbers significantly in normal and pIgR-deficient mice, and depletion of IgG abrogated this effect. These results indicate that host defense against C. rodentium depends on B cells and IgG antibodies but does not require production or transepithelial transport of IgA or secreted IgM.
TI  - [Plasticity of bacterial genomes: pathogenicity islands and the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)].
AB  - Many bacterial virulence attributes, like toxins, adhesins, invasins, iron uptake systems, are encoded within specific regions of the bacterial genome. These in size varying regions are termed pathogenicity islands (PAIs) since they confer pathogenic properties to the respective micro-organism. Per definition PAIs are exclusively found in pathogenic strains and are often inserted near transfer-RNA genes. Nevertheless, non-pathogenic bacteria also possess foreign DNA elements that confer advantageous features, leading to improved fitness. These additional DNA elements as well as PAIs are termed genomic islands and were acquired during bacterial evolution. Significant G+C content deviation in pathogenicity islands with respect to the rest of the genome, the presence of direct repeat sequences at the flanking regions, the presence of integrase gene determinants as other mobility features,the particular insertion site (tRNA gene) as well as the observed genetic instability suggests that pathogenicity islands were acquired by horizontal gene transfer. PAIs are the fascinating proof of the plasticity of bacterial genomes. PAIs were originally described in human pathogenic Escherichia (E.) coli strains. In the meantime PAIs have been found in various pathogenic bacteria of humans, animals and even plants. The Locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE) is one particular widely distributed PAI of E coli. In addition, it also confers pathogenicity to the related species Citrobacter (C.) rodentium and Escherichia (E.) alvei. The LEE is an important virulence feature of several animal pathogens. It is an obligate PAI of all animal and human enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and most enterohaemorrhegic E. coli (EHEC) also harbor the LEE. The LEE encodes a type III secretion system, an adhesion (intimin) that mediates the intimate contact between the bacterium and the epithelial cell, as well as various proteins which are secreted via the type III secretion system. The LEE encoded virulence features are responsible for the formation of so called attaching and effacing (AE) lesions in the intestinal epithelium. Due to its wide distribution in animal pathogens, LEE encoded antigens are suitable vaccine antigens. Acquisition and structure of the LEE pathogenicity island is the crucial point of numerous investigations. However, the evolution of the LEE, its origin and further spread in E. coli, are far from being resolved.
TI  - Identification of a novel Citrobacter rodentium type III secreted protein, EspI,  and roles of this and other secreted proteins in infection.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is a member of a group of pathogens that colonize the lumen of the host gastrointestinal tract via attaching and effacing (A/E) lesion formation. C. rodentium, which causes transmissible colonic hyperplasia in mice, is used as an in vivo model system for the clinically significant A/E pathogens enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. These bacteria all contain a pathogenicity island called the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), which encodes a type III secretion system that is designed to deliver effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells. These effectors are involved in the subversion of host eukaryotic cell functions to the benefit of the bacterium. In this study we used mutant strains to determine the effects of the C. rodentium LEE-encoded effectors EspF, EspG, EspH, and Map on virulence in the mouse model. In addition, we identified a novel secreted protein, EspI encoded outside the LEE, whose secretion is also dependent on a functional type III secretion system. Mutant strains with each of the effectors investigated were found to be outcompeted by wild-type bacteria in mixed-infection experiments in vivo, although the effects of EspF and EspH were only subtle. In single-infection experiments, we found that EspF, EspG, and EspH are not required for efficient colonization of the mouse colon or for the production of hyperplasia. In contrast, strains producing EspI and Map had significant colonization defects and resulted in dramatically reduced levels of hyperplasia, and they exhibited very different growth dynamics in mice than the wild-type strain exhibited.
TI  - Dissecting virulence: systematic and functional analyses of a pathogenicity island.
AB  - Bacterial pathogenicity islands (PAI) often encode both effector molecules responsible for disease and secretion systems that deliver these effectors to host cells. Human enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), enteropathogenic E. coli, and the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium (CR) possess the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) PAI. We systematically mutagenized all 41 CR LEE genes and functionally characterized these mutants in vitro and in a murine infection model. We identified 33 virulence factors, including two virulence regulators and a hierarchical switch for type III secretion. In addition, 7 potential type III effectors encoded outside the LEE were identified by using a proteomics approach. These non-LEE effectors are encoded by three uncharacterized PAIs in EHEC O157, suggesting that these PAIs act cooperatively with the LEE in pathogenesis. Our findings provide significant insights into bacterial virulence mechanisms and disease.
TI  - Identification and characterization of NleA, a non-LEE-encoded type III translocated virulence factor of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 uses a specialized protein translocation apparatus, the type III secretion system (TTSS), to deliver bacterial effector proteins into host cells. These effectors interfere with host cytoskeletal pathways and signalling cascades to facilitate bacterial survival and replication and promote disease. The genes encoding the TTSS and all known type III secreted effectors in EHEC are localized in a single pathogenicity island on the bacterial chromosome known as the locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE). In this study, we performed a proteomic analysis of proteins secreted by the LEE-encoded TTSS of EHEC. In addition to known LEE-encoded type III secreted proteins, such as EspA, EspB and Tir, a novel protein, NleA (non-LEE-encoded effector A), was identified. NleA is encoded in a prophage-associated pathogenicity island within the EHEC genome, distinct from the LEE. The LEE-encoded TTSS directs translocation of NleA into host cells, where it localizes to the Golgi apparatus. In a panel of strains examined by Southern blot and database analyses, nleA was found to be present in all other LEE-containing pathogens examined, including enteropathogenic E. coli and Citrobacter rodentium, and was absent from non-pathogenic strains of E. coli and non-LEE-containing pathogens. NleA was determined to play a key role in virulence of C. rodentium in a mouse infection model.
TI  - Dietary pectin and calcium inhibit colonic proliferation in vivo by differing mechanisms.
AB  - Diet plays an important role in promoting and/or preventing colon cancer; however, the effects of specific nutrients remain uncertain because of the difficulties in correlating epidemiological and basic observations. Transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia (TMCH) induced by Citrobacter rodentium, causes significant hyperproliferation and hyperplasia in the mouse distal colon and increases the risk of subsequent neoplasia. We have recently shown that TMCH is associated with an increased abundance of cellular beta-catenin and its nuclear translocation coupled with up-regulation of its downstream targets, c-myc and cyclin D1. In this study, we examined the effects of two putatively protective nutrients, calcium and soluble fibre pectin, on molecular events linked to proliferation in the colonic epithelium during TMCH. Dietary intervention incorporating changes in calcium [high (1.0%) and low (0.1%)] and alterations in fibre content (6% pectin and fibre-free) were compared with the standard AIN-93 diet (0.5% calcium, 5% cellulose), followed by histomorphometry and immunochemical assessment of potential oncogenes. Dietary interventions did not alter the time course of Citrobacter infection. Both 1.0% calcium and 6% pectin diet inhibited increases in proliferation and crypt length typically seen in TMCH. Neither the low calcium nor fibre-free diets had significant effect. Pectin diet blocked increases in cellular beta-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-myc levels associated with TMCH by 70%, whereas neither high nor low calcium diet had significant effect on these molecules. Diets supplemented with either calcium or pectin therefore, exert anti-proliferative effects in mouse distal colon involving different molecular pathways. TMCH is thus a diet-sensitive model for examining the effect of specific nutrients on molecular characteristics of the pre-neoplastic colonic epithelium.
TI  - Critical role of T cell-dependent serum antibody, but not the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, for surviving acute mucosal infection with Citrobacter rodentium, an attaching and effacing pathogen.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium uses virulence factors similar to the enteropathogenic Escherichia coli to produce attaching and effacing lesions in the distal colon of mice. We used this infection model to determine components of adaptive immunity needed to survive infection. During acute infection, wild-type mice develop breaks across infected epithelial surfaces but resolve infection. Surprisingly, mice markedly deficient in mucosal lymphocyte populations from beta(7) integrin deficiency resolve infection, as do CD8alpha-/- or TCR-delta-/- mice. In contrast, CD4-/- or TCR-beta-/- mice develop polymicrobial sepsis and end-organ damage, and succumb during acute infection, despite epithelial damage similar to wild-type mice. B cell-deficient (MuMT-/-) or B and T cell-deficient (recombinase-activating gene 2-/-) mice develop severe pathology in colon and internal organs, and deteriorate rapidly during acute infection. Surviving mice develop robust Citrobacter-specific serum IgM responses during acute infection, whereas mice that succumb do not. However, CD4-/- mice receiving serum Igs from infected wild-type mice survive and clear the infection. Our data show that survival of apparently self-limited and luminal mucosal infections requires a systemic T cell-dependent Ab response against bacteria that enter through damaged mucosa. These findings have implications for understanding host defense against mucosal infections, including the pathogenesis of these diseases in immunocompromised populations.
TI  - Host susceptibility to the attaching and effacing bacterial pathogen Citrobacter  rodentium.
AB  - Many studies have shown that genetic susceptibility plays a key role in determining whether bacterial pathogens successfully infect and cause disease in potential hosts. Surprisingly, whether host genetics influence the pathogenesis of attaching and effacing (A/E) bacteria such as enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli has not been examined. To address this issue, we infected various mouse strains with Citrobacter rodentium, a member of the A/E pathogen family. Of the strains tested, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) nonresponder C3H/HeJ mouse strain experienced more rapid and extensive bacterial colonization than did other strains. Moreover, the high bacterial load in these mice was associated with accelerated crypt hyperplasia, mucosal ulceration, and bleeding, together with very high mortality rates. Interestingly, the basis for the increased susceptibility was not due to LPS hyporesponsiveness, as the genetically related but LPS-responsive C3H/HeOuJ and C3H/HeN mouse strains were also susceptible to infection. Analysis of the intestinal pathology in these susceptible strains revealed significant crypt epithelial cell apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end label staining) as well as bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes. Further studies with infection of SCID (T- and B-lymphocyte-deficient) C3H/HeJ mice demonstrated that loss of lymphocytes had no effect on bacterial numbers but did reduce crypt cell apoptosis and delayed mortality. These studies thus identify the adaptive immune system, crypt cell apoptosis, and bacterial translocation but not LPS responsiveness as contributing to the tissue pathology and mortality seen during C. rodentium infection of highly susceptible mouse strains. Determining the basis for these strains' susceptibility to intestinal colonization by an A/E pathogen will be the focus of future studies.
TI  - Host defences to Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is a natural non-invasive bacterial pathogen which infects  the distal colon of mice. It uses the same molecular mechanisms of type III secretion as human enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli to colonise the epithelial cells of the gut and is therefore an ideal model to study host-bacterial pathogen interactions in vivo. Infection elicits mucosal inflammation with similarities to inflammatory bowel disease, and so it is a readily accessible model to investigate the relationship between inflammation and anti-bacterial immunity in the gut.
TI  - Identification of a novel type IV pilus gene cluster required for gastrointestinal colonization of Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is used as an in vivo model system for clinically significant enteric pathogens such as enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). These pathogens all colonize the lumen side of the host gastrointestinal tract via attaching and effacing (A/E) lesion formation. In order to identify genes required for the colonization of A/E-forming pathogens, a library of signature-tagged transposon mutants of C. rodentium was constructed and screened in mice. Of the 576 mutants tested, 14 were attenuated in their ability to colonize the descending colon. Of these, eight mapped to the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), which is required for the formation of A/E lesions, underlying the importance of this mechanism for pathogenesis. Another mutant, P5H2, was found to have a transposon insertion in an open reading frame that has strong similarity to type IV pilus nucleotide-binding proteins. The region flanking the transposon insertion was sequenced, identifying a cluster of 12 genes that encode the first described pilus of C. rodentium (named colonization factor Citrobacter, CFC). The proteins encoded by cfc genes have identity to proteins of the type IV COF pilus of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), the toxin co-regulated pilus of Vibrio cholerae and the bundle-forming pilus of EPEC. A non-polar mutation in cfcI, complementation of this strain with wild-type cfcI and complementation of strain P5H2 with wild-type cfcH confirmed that these genes are required for colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by C. rodentium. Thus, CFC provides a convenient model to study type IV pilus-mediated pathogen-host interactions under physiological conditions in the natural colonic environment.
TI  - Citrobacter rodentium translocated intimin receptor (Tir) is an essential virulence factor needed for actin condensation, intestinal colonization and colonic hyperplasia in mice.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium infection of mice serves as a relevant small animal model to study enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) infections in man. Enteropathogenic E. coli and EHEC translocate Tir into the host cytoplasmic membrane, where it serves as the receptor for the bacterial adhesin intimin and plays a central role in actin condensation beneath the adherent bacterium. In this report, we examined the function of C. rodentium Tir both in vitro and in vivo. Similar to EPEC, C. rodentium Tir is tyrosine phosphorylated and is essential for actin condensation. Citrobacter Tir and EPEC Tir are functionally interchangeable and both require tyrosine phosphorylation to mediate actin rearrangements. In contrast, Citrobacter Tir supports actin nucleation in EHEC independent of tyrosine phosphorylation, while EHEC Tir cannot replace Citrobacter Tir for this function. This indicates that C. rodentium and EPEC use an actin nucleating mechanism different from EHEC. We also found that Tir is expressed and translocated into mouse enterocytes in vivo by C. rodentium during infections. This represents the first direct demonstration of a type III effector translocated in vivo into a natural host by any pathogen. In addition, we showed that Tir, but not its tyrosine phosphorylation, is essential for C. rodentium to colonize the large bowel and induce attaching/effacing (A/E) lesions and colonic hyperplasia in mice, and that both EPEC Tir and EHEC Tir can substitute for Citrobacter Tir for these activities in vivo. These results thus demonstrate that Tir is an essential virulence factor in this infection model. The data also show that the function of Tir tyrosine phosphorylation and its subsequent actin nucleating activity are not essential for C. rodentium colonization of the mouse gut nor for inducing A/E lesions and colonic hyperplasia, thereby uncoupling colonization and disease from actin condensation for this A/E pathogen.
TI  - CesD2 of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli is a second chaperone for the type III secretion translocator protein EspD.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli are extracellular pathogens that employ a type III secretion system to export translocator and effector proteins, proteins which facilitates colonization of the mucosal surface of the intestine via formation of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions. The genes encoding the proteins for A/E lesion formation are located on a pathogenicity island, termed the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), which contains eae encoding intimin as well as the type III secretion system and effector genes. Many type III secreted proteins are stabilized and maintained in a secretion-competent conformation in the bacterial cytosol by specific chaperone proteins. Three type III chaperones have been described thus far within the EPEC LEE region: CesD, for the translocator proteins EspB and EspD; CesT, for the effector proteins Tir and Map; and CesF, for EspF. In this study we report the characterization of CesD2 (previously Orf27), a second LEE-encoded chaperone for EspD. We show specific CesD2-EspD protein interaction which appears to be necessary for proper EspD secretion in vitro and pathogenesis in vivo as demonstrated in the A/E-lesion-forming mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium.
TI  - Tyrosine residues at the immunoglobulin-C-type lectin inter-domain boundary of intimin are not involved in Tir-binding but implicated in colonisation of the host.
AB  - Intimin is an outer membrane adhesion molecule involved in bacterial adhesion to  intestinal epithelium by several human and animal enteric pathogens, including enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium. Intimin binds to the translocated intimin receptor, Tir, which is delivered to the plasma membrane of the host cell by a type III protein translocation system. Intimin is also implicated in binding to a host cell-encoded intimin receptor (Hir). The receptor-binding activity of intimin resides within the carboxy terminus 280 amino acids (Int280) of the polypeptide. Structural analysis of this region revealed two immunoglobulin-like domains, the second of which forms a number of contacts with the distal C-type lectin-like module. Specific orientation differences at this inter-domain boundary, which consists of several tyrosine residues, were detected between the crystal and solution structures. In this study, we determined the influence of site-directed mutagenesis of each of four tyrosine residues on intimin-Tir interactions and on intimin-mediated intimate attachment. The mutant intimins were also studied using a variety of in vitro and in vivo infection models. The results show that three of the four Tyr, although not essential for A/E lesion formation in vitro, are required for efficient colonisation of the mouse host following oral challenge.
TI  - Comparison of an espB gene fecal polymerase chain reaction assay with bacteriologic isolation for detection of Citrobacter rodentium infection in mice.
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for specific detection of Citrobacter rodentium in fecal samples of mice and to compare this assay with bacterial isolation and identification methods. METHODS: The target sequence of the PCR assay was the espB gene encoding a secreted virulence factor. To facilitate visual identification during primary isolation on MacConkey agar containing ampicillin, C. rodentium ATCC type strain 51459 was transformed by use of a plasmid encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and ampicillin resistance. The EGFP-C. rodentium was inoculated into Swiss Webster (SW) mice to study the time course of detection of the organism by use of fecal PCR analysis, bacterial isolation, and development of colonic hyperplasia by light microscopy. Lactose-fermenting fluorescent bacterial colonies identified during primary isolation of fecal bacteria on MacConkey-ampicillin agar were identified by use of biochemical typing. RESULTS: Mice inoculated with EGFP-transformed C. rodentium developed colonic mucosal hyperplasia, characterized by a three-fold increase in colonic crypt height that peaked at post-inoculation day (PID) 14. The espB PCR assay detected as little as 0.3 colony-forming units of C. rodentium. The PCR assay was specific in that it did not detect the espB gene of Escherichia coli 0157. Results of in vivo studies in SW mice indicated that EGFP-C. rodentium could be detected by use of espB fecal PCR analysis in 100% of inoculated mice tested on PID 1, 3, 7, and 8, in 60% on PID 9, and in 20% on PID 10 (n = 5). Bacterial isolation from the same fecal samples detected the organism in 100% of the inoculated mice on PID 7, in 50% on PID 8, and in none on subsequent PID 9-14. The ability of the PCR assay to detect C. rodentium in fresh feces of inoculated mice was significantly better than that of bacterial isolation methods (Fisher-Irwin exact test, P < 0.01). At the time of peak colonic hyperplasia, the organism could no longer be cultivated or detected in mice by use of fecal PCR analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The EGFP-C. rodentium was capable of inducing transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia similar to that previously reported in SW mice. The PCR assay for detection of the espB gene sequence of C. rodentium in total fecal DNA was a more sensitive diagnostic assay than was bacterial isolation.
TI  - Modulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression by the attaching and effacing bacterial pathogen citrobacter rodentium in infected mice.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium belongs to the attaching and effacing family of enteric bacterial pathogens that includes both enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. These bacteria infect their hosts by colonizing the intestinal mucosal surface and intimately attaching to underlying epithelial cells. The abilities of these pathogens to exploit the cytoskeleton and signaling pathways of host cells are well documented, but their interactions with the host's antimicrobial defenses, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), are poorly understood. To address this issue, we infected mice with C. rodentium and found that iNOS mRNA expression in the colon significantly increased during infection. Immunostaining identified epithelial cells as the major source for immunoreactive iNOS. Finding that nitric oxide (NO) donors were bacteriostatic for C. rodentium in vitro, we examined whether iNOS expression contributed to host defense by infecting iNOS-deficient mice. Loss of iNOS expression caused a small but significant delay in bacterial clearance without affecting tissue pathology. Finally, immunofluorescence staining was used to determine if iNOS expression was localized to infected cells by staining for the C. rodentium virulence factor, translocated intimin receptor (Tir), as well as iNOS. Interestingly, while more than 85% of uninfected epithelial cells expressed iNOS, fewer than 15% of infected (Tir-positive) cells expressed detectable iNOS. These results demonstrate that both iNOS and intestinal epithelial cells play an active role in host defense during C. rodentium infection. However, the selective expression of iNOS by uninfected but not infected cells suggests that this pathogen has developed mechanisms to locally limit its exposure to host-derived NO.
TI  - How bacteria could cause cancer: one step at a time.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori highlighted the potential for bacteria to cause cancer. It is becoming clear that chronic infection with other bacteria, notably Salmonella typhi, can also facilitate tumour development. Infections caused by several bacteria (e.g. Bartonella spp., Lawsonia intracellularis and Citrobacter rodentium) can induce cellular proliferation that can be reversed by antibiotic treatment. Other chronic bacterial infections have the effect of blocking apoptosis. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms are far from clear. Conversely, several bacterial toxins interfere with cellular signalling mechanisms in a way that is characteristic of tumour promoters. These include Pasteurella multocida toxin, which uniquely acts as a mitogen, and Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor, which activates Rho family signalling. This leads to activation of COX2, which is involved in several stages of tumour development, including inhibition of apoptosis. Such toxins could provide valuable models for bacterial involvement in cancer, but more significantly they could play a direct role in cancer causation and progression.
TI  - Mice lacking T and B lymphocytes develop transient colitis and crypt hyperplasia  yet suffer impaired bacterial clearance during Citrobacter rodentium infection.
AB  - The bacterial pathogen Citrobacter rodentium belongs to a family of gastrointestinal pathogens that includes enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and is the causative agent of transmissible colonic hyperplasia in mice. The molecular mechanisms used by these pathogens to colonize host epithelial surfaces and form attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions have undergone intense study. In contrast, little is known about the host's immune response to these infections and its importance in tissue pathology and bacterial clearance. To address these issues, wild-type mice and mice lacking T and B lymphocytes (RAG1 knockout [KO]) were infected with C. rodentium. By day 10 postinfection (p.i.), both wild-type and RAG1 KO mice developed colitis and crypt hyperplasia, and these responses became more exaggerated in wild-type mice over the next 2 weeks, as they cleared the infection. By day 24 p.i., bacterial clearance was complete, and the colitis had subsided; however, crypt heights remained increased. In contrast, inflammatory and crypt hyperplastic responses in the RAG1 KO mice were transient, subsiding after 2 weeks. By day 24 p.i., RAG1 KO mice showed no signs of bacterial clearance and infection was often fatal. Surprisingly, despite remaining heavily infected, tissues from RAG1 KO mice surviving the acute colitis showed few signs of disease. These results thus emphasize the important contribution of the host immune response during infection by A/E bacterial pathogens. While T and/or B lymphocytes are essential for host defense against C. rodentium, they also mediate much of the tissue pathology and disease symptoms that occur during infection.
TI  - Mutagenesis of conserved tryptophan residues within the receptor-binding domain of intimin: influence on binding activity and virulence.
AB  - Intimate bacterial adhesion to intestinal epithelium is a pathogenic mechanism shared by several human and animal enteric pathogens, including enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium. The proteins directly involved in this process are the outer-membrane adhesion molecule intimin and the translocated intimin receptor, Tir. The receptor-binding activity of intimin resides within the carboxy terminus 280 aa (Int280) of the polypeptide. Four tryptophan residues, W117/776, W136/795, W222/881 and W240/899, are conserved within different Int280 molecules that otherwise show considerable sequence variation. In this study the influence of site-directed mutagenesis of each of the four tryptophan residues on intimin-Tir interactions and on intimin-mediated intimate attachment was determined. The mutant intimins were also studied using a variety of in vitro and in vivo infection models. The results show that all the substitutions modulated intimin activity, although some mutations had more profound effects than others.
TI  - Species-specific cell adhesion of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli is mediated by type IV bundle-forming pili.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a causative agent of diarrhoea in humans. Localized adherence of EPEC onto intestinal mucosa was reproduced in an in vitro adherence assay with cultured human epithelial cells. We found that the efficiency of EPEC adherence to a mouse-derived colonic epithelial cell line, CMT-93, was remarkably lower than its adherence to human-derived intestinal cell lines, such as Intestine-407 or Caco-2. Although EPEC did adhere to some cell lines derived from non-human species, fixing the cells with formalin to inactivate one or more formalin-sensitive factors allowed us to observe species-specific differences in EPEC adherence. In contrast to these results, an EPEC mutant that is defective in bundle-forming pili (BFP) production adhered as efficiently to CMT-93 cells as to Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, Citrobacter rodentium expressing BFP adhered to Caco-2 cells much more efficiently than to CMT-93 cells. Finally, a purified BfpA-His6 fusion protein showed higher affinity for Caco-2 cells than for CMT-93 cells, and inhibited EPEC adherence. Following BFP-mediated adherence, secretion of EspB from adherent bacteria and reorganization of F-actin in the host cells was observed. EPEC adhering to CMT-93 cells induced far less secretion of EspB, or reorganization of F-actin in the host CMT-93 cells, than did EPEC adhering to Caco-2 cells. These results indicated that BFP plays an important role in the cell-type-dependent adherence of EPEC and in the progression to the later steps in EPEC adherence.
TI  - Structural studies on the O-polysaccharide of the lipopolysaccharide produced by  Citrobacter rodentium (ATCC 51459).
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is the etiologic agent of transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia (TMCH) and is the only Citrobacter species known to possess virulence factors homologous to human enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. Members of this species are considered clonal and represent the only known attaching and effacing bacterial pathogen of mice and thus provides a useful animal model for studying the molecular basis of attaching and effacing pathology. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produced by C. rodentium has not been previously studied or its possible role as a virulence factor determined. The structure of the LPS has been undertaken as a first step in an investigation of its possible role in pathogenesis. The structure of C. rodentium (ATCC 51459, prototype TMCH isolate, original biotype 4280, previously designated DBS 100) LPS was determined from composition and methylation analyses, mass spectrometry, and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The antigenic O-polysaccharide was found to be a high molecular mass branched polymer of repeating pentasaccharide units composed of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose (D-GlcNAc), d-glucose (D-Glc), and L-rhamnose (L-Rha) in the molar ratio 2 : 2 : 1 linked through phosphate, and has the structure: [structure: see text]
TI  - Locus of enterocyte effacement from Citrobacter rodentium: sequence analysis and  evidence for horizontal transfer among attaching and effacing pathogens.
AB  - The family of attaching and effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogens, which includes diarrheagenic enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), remains a significant threat to human and animal health. These bacteria intimately attach to host intestinal cells, causing the effacement of brush border microvilli. The genes responsible for this phenotype are encoded in a pathogenicity island called the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). Citrobacter rodentium is the only known murine A/E pathogen and serves as a small animal model for EPEC and EHEC infections. Here we report the full DNA sequence of C. rodentium LEE and provide a comparative analysis with the published LEEs from EPEC, EHEC, and the rabbit diarrheagenic E. coli strain RDEC-1. Although C. rodentium LEE shows high similarities throughout the entire sequence and shares all 41 open reading frames with the LEE from EPEC, EHEC, and RDEC-1, it is unique in its location of the rorf1 and rorf2/espG genes and the presence of several insertion sequences (IS) and IS remnants. The LEE of EPEC and EHEC is inserted into the selC tRNA gene. In contrast, the Citrobacter LEE is flanked on one side by an operon encoding an ABC transport system, and an IS element and sequences homologous to Shigella plasmid R100 and EHEC pO157 flank the other. The presence of plasmid sequences next to C. rodentium LEE suggests that the prototype LEE resided on a horizontally transferable plasmid. Additional sequence analysis reveals that the 3-kb plasmid in C. rodentium is nearly identical to p9705 in EHEC O157:H7, suggesting that horizontal plasmid transfer among A/E pathogens has occurred. Our results indicate that the LEE has been acquired by C. rodentium and A/E E. coli strains independently during evolution.
TI  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infection induces expression of the early growth response factor by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades in epithelial cells.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is an extracellular bacterial pathogen that infects the human intestinal epithelium and is a major cause of infantile diarrhea in developing countries. EPEC belongs to the group of attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens. It uses a type III secretion system to deliver proteins into the host cell that mediate signal transduction events in host cells. We used gene array technology to study epithelial cell responses to EPEC infection at the level of gene expression. We found that EPEC induces the expression of several genes in infected HeLa cells by a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-independent mechanism, including cytokines and early growth response factor 1 (Egr-1). The transcription factor Egr-1 is an immediate-early-induced gene that is activated in most cell types in response to stress. EPEC-induced upregulation of egr-1 is mediated by the activation of the MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signal transduction pathway and is dependent on the type III secretion system. egr-1 is also induced during infection of mice by the A/E pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, suggesting that both Egr-1 and the activation of this mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway may play a role in disease.
TI  - Intimin-specific immune responses prevent bacterial colonization by the attaching-effacing pathogen Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - The formation of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions on gut enterocytes is central to the pathogenesis of enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) Escherichia coli, enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and the rodent pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Genes encoding A/E lesion formation map to a chromosomal pathogenicity island termed the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). Here we show that the LEE-encoded proteins EspA, EspB, Tir, and intimin are the targets of long-lived humoral immune responses in C. rodentium-infected mice. Mice infected with C. rodentium developed robust acquired immunity and were resistant to reinfection with wild-type C. rodentium or a C. rodentium derivative, DBS255(pCVD438), which expressed intimin derived from EPEC strain E2348/69. The receptor-binding domain of intimin polypeptides is located within the carboxy-terminal 280 amino acids (Int280). Mucosal and systemic vaccination regimens using enterotoxin-based adjuvants were employed to elicit immune responses to recombinant Int280alpha from EPEC strain E2348/69. Mice vaccinated subcutaneously with Int280alpha, in the absence of adjuvant, were significantly more resistant to oral challenge with DBS255(pCVD438) but not with wild-type C. rodentium. This type-specific immunity could not be overcome by employing an exposed, highly conserved domain of intimin (Int388-667) as a vaccine. These results show that anti-intimin immune responses can modulate the outcome of a C. rodentium infection and support the use of intimin as a component of a type-specific EPEC or EHEC vaccine.
TI  - Comparison of bacteriological, genetic and pathological characters between Escherichia coli O115a,c:K(B) and Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Murine pathogenic Escherichia coli O115a,c:K(B) (MPEC) is the causative agent of  mouse megaenteron, the pathology of which resembles that of transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia caused by Citrobacter rodentium. We compared their genetic and pathological features to reveal the relationship between these two bacteria. To evaluate the genetic distances, 16S rDNA genes were sequenced and biochemical reactions were tested. Mouse strain susceptibility tests, using CF1 MPEC-susceptible germfree mice and BALB/cA(Jic) resistant mice were performed. MPEC strains and C. rodentium showed more than 99.6% identity by comparison of 16S rDNA gene sequences. All results from biochemical reactions and the mouse strain susceptibility tests were identical. It is proposed that MPEC should be reclassified as C. rodentium.
TI  - Citrobacter rodentium, the causative agent of transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia, exhibits clonality: synonymy of C. rodentium and mouse-pathogenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium (formerly Citrobacter freundii biotype 4280 and Citrobacter genomospecies 9) was described on the basis of biochemical characterization and DNA-DNA hybridization data and is the only Citrobacter species known to possess virulence factors homologous to those of the human pathogens enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli. These virulence factors are encoded on the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), a pathogenicity island required for the characteristic attaching and effacing (AE) pathology seen in infection with these three pathogens. C. rodentium, which apparently infects only mice, provides a useful animal model for studying the molecular basis of AE pathology. No work has been done to assess differences in pathogenicity between C. rodentium isolates from diverse sources. Here, we report the examination of 15 C. rodentium isolates using a battery of genetic and biochemical approaches. No differences were observed between the isolates by repetitive-element sequence-based PCR analysis, biochemical analysis, and possession of LEE-specific virulence factors. These data suggest that members of the species are clonal. We further characterized an atypical E. coli strain from Japan called mouse-pathogenic E. coli (MPEC) that, in our hands, caused the same disease as C. rodentium. Applying the same battery of tests, we found that MPEC possesses LEE-encoded virulence factors and is indistinguishable from the previously characterized C. rodentium isolate DBS100. These results demonstrate that MPEC is a misclassified C. rodentium isolate and that members of this species are clonal and represent the only known attaching and effacing bacterial pathogen of mice.
TI  - Expression of intimin gamma from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli in Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - The carboxy-terminal 280 amino acids (Int280) of the bacterial adhesion molecule  intimin include the receptor-binding domain. At least five different types of Int280, designated alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon, have been described based on sequence variation in this region. Importantly, the intimin types are associated with different evolutionary branches and contribute to distinct tissue tropism of intimin-positive bacterial pathogens. In this study we engineered a strain of Citrobacter rodentium, which normally displays intimin beta, to express intimin gamma from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. We show that intimin gamma binds to the translocated intimin receptor (Tir) from C. rodentium and has the ability to produce attaching and effacing lesions on HEp-2 cells. However, C. rodentium expressing intimin gamma could not colonize orally infected mice or induce mouse colonic hyperplasia. These results suggest that intimin may contribute to host specificity, possibly through its interaction with a receptor on the host cell surface.
TI  - Citrobacter rodentium espB is necessary for signal transduction and for infection of laboratory mice.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is the causative agent of transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia and contains a locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) similar to that found in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). EPEC espB is necessary for intimate attachment and signal transduction between EPEC and cultured cell monolayers. Mice challenged with wild-type C. rodentium develop a mucosal immunoglobulin A response to EspB. In this study, C. rodentium espB has been cloned and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. C. rodentium espB was found to have 90% identity to EPEC espB. A nonpolar insertion mutation in C. rodentium espB was constructed and used to replace the chromosomal wild-type allele. The C. rodentium espB mutant exhibited reduced cell association and had no detectable fluorescent actin staining activity on cultured cell monolayers. The C. rodentium espB mutant also failed to colonize laboratory mice following experimental inoculation. The espB mutation could be complemented with a plasmid-encoded copy of the gene, which restored both cell association and fluorescent actin staining activity, as well as the ability to colonize laboratory mice. These studies indicate that espB is necessary for signal transduction and for colonization of laboratory mice by C. rodentium.
TI  - Role of bacterial intimin in colonic hyperplasia and inflammation.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) cells adhere to gut epithelial cells through intimin alpha: the ligand for a bacterially derived epithelial transmembrane protein called the translocated intimin receptor. Citrobacter rodentium colonizes the mouse colon in a similar fashion and uses a different intimin: intimin beta. Intimin alpha was found to costimulate submitogenic signals through the T cell receptor. Dead intimin beta+ C. rodentium, intimin alpha-transfected C. rodentium or E. coli strain K12, and EPEC induced mucosal hyperplasia identical to that caused by C. rodentium live infection, as well as a massive T helper cell-type 1 immune response in the colonic mucosa. Mutation of cysteine-937 of intimin to alanine reduced costimulatory activity in vitro and prevented immunopathology in vivo. The mucosal changes elicited by C. rodentium were interferon-gamma-dependent. Immunopathology induced by intimin enables the bacteria to promote conditions that are favorable for increased microbial colonization.
TI  - Citrobacter rodentium infection in mice elicits a mucosal Th1 cytokine response and lesions similar to those in murine inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is a classically noninvasive pathogen of mice that is similar to enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) in man. Following oral infection of young mice, the organism colonizes the distal colon, and within 1 week the colonic mucosa doubles in thickness and there is massive epithelial cell hyperplasia. Since T-cell responses in mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) also cause epithelial hyperplasia, we have investigated the possibility that C. rodentium promotes similar T-cell responses in the mucosa, thereby increasing epithelial shedding, transmission, and replication of the organism. Beginning 6 days after infection, bacteria were observed to be in close association with the epithelial surface and were also visible scattered throughout the lamina propria and in the submucosa. There was a CD3(+)-cell infiltrate into the colonic lamina propria and epithelium as well as mucosal thickening and crypt hyperplasia. The majority of CD3(+) cells were CD4(+) and were not gammadelta+. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of cytokines also revealed a highly polarized Th1 response (interleukin-12, gamma interferon, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) in the mucosa and a large increase in the epithelial cell mitogen keratinocyte growth factor. None of the changes were seen in mice inoculated with bacteria lacking intimin (which is necessary for colonization), but they were seen in mice inoculated with C. rodentium complemented with intimin from EPEC. This is the first example of a classically noninvasive bacterial pathogen which elicits a strong mucosal Th1 response and which produces pathology similar to that seen in mouse models of IBD, which is also characterized by a strong Th1 response. These results also suggest that the colonic mucosa responds in a stereotypic way to Th1 responses.
TI  - Generation of Escherichia coli intimin derivatives with differing biological activities using site-directed mutagenesis of the intimin C-terminus domain.
AB  - Intimins, encoded by eae genes, are outer membrane proteins involved in attaching-effacing (A/E) lesion formation and host cell invasion by pathogenic bacteria, including enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Citrobacter rodentium. A series of intimins, harbouring specific mutations close to the C-terminus, were constructed using pCVD438, which encodes the eae gene from EPEC strain E2348/69. These mutant plasmids were introduced into EPEC strain CVD206 and C. rodentium strain DBS255, which both contain deletion mutations in their eae genes. CVD206, CVD206(pCVD438) and CVD206(pCVD438) derivatives were assessed for their ability to promote A/E lesion formation or invasion of HEp-2 cells and to induce A/E lesions on fresh human intestinal in vitro organ cultures (IVOC). The pathogenicity of C. rodentium DBS255 harbouring these plasmid derivatives was also studied in mice. Here, we report that intimin-mediated A/E lesion formation can be segregated from intimin-mediated HEp-2 cell invasion. Moreover, adherence to IVOC, EPEC-induced microvillus elongation and colonization of the murine intestine by C. rodentium were also modulated by the modified intimins.
TI  - Direct detection of eae-positive bacteria in human and veterinary colorectal specimens by PCR.
AB  - A PCR test based on the amplification of an eae-specific sequence was designed and evaluated for its ability to directly detect homologous sequences in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and Citrobacter spp. (amplification of eae open reading frame, 178 bp) in sections of the intestines of humans and animals with colonic lesions. Positive PCR results were observed with eae-positive reference strains of E. coli and Citrobacter rodentium (Citrobacter freundii biotype 4280). Known eae-negative reference strains of E. coli and other laboratory strains of enteric bacteria were negative by the amplification test. The sensitivity of the PCR for detection of eae-positive E. coli and C. rodentium was between 1 and 2 CFU. To detect these sequences directly from sections of fixed colon from human and veterinary sources, PCR conditions were modified by the addition of 0.1 mM 8-methoxypsoralen to eliminate extraneous bacterial DNA from the PCR amplification cocktail without added template. Sections of colon from three pigs experimentally affected with colon lesions due to enteropathogenic (attaching and effacing) E. coli were PCR positive for bacterial eae genome. Sections from control animals were negative. Sections of colon from one of 18 biopsies from confirmed AIDS patients and from 22 of 35 colorectal cancer patients were PCR positive for bacterial eae genome. The PCR test was a simple and quick method of detecting bacterial eae genome in human and veterinary clinical specimens. This method may remove the need for initial culture and detection of the gene by DNA probing from potential associated lesions. The clear relationship of bacteria containing the eae gene with colonic lesions in the pigs and mice indicates that a similar relationship is possible for human patients having similar lesions.
TI  - Inhibition of murine splenic and mucosal lymphocyte function by enteric bacterial products.
AB  - Previously we showed that lysates of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) inhibit lymphokine production by mitogen-activated human peripheral blood and lamina propria mononuclear cells. The aims of the present study were to determine whether EPEC-inhibitory factors have similar effects on murine lymphoid populations in order to further delineate the mechanisms of alteration of cytokine production. Preexposure to EPEC lysates inhibited mitogen-stimulated interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production by murine spleen cells, but IL-10 production was increased. The inhibition was not due to increased apoptosis and was not blocked by neutralizating antibodies against IL-10 or transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). EPEC lysates also inhibited mitogen-stimulated IL-2 and IFN-gamma production by CD11b-depleted spleen cells, IL-2 and IL-4 production by intraepithelial and Peyer's patch lymphocytes, IL-2 production by the human T-cell line Jurkat, and antigen-stimulated IL-2 production by murine spleen cells. Lysates obtained from Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli, E. coli RDEC-1, Citrobacter rodentium, and an EPEC espB insertion mutant all inhibited IL-2 and IL-4 production by mitogen-stimulated lymphoid cells. In conclusion, lysates of EPEC and related bacteria directly inhibit cytokine production by lymphoid cells from multiple sites by a mechanism that does not increase apoptosis or result from secondary effects of IL-10 or TGF-beta.
TI  - Detection of intimins alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, four intimin derivatives expressed by attaching and effacing microbial pathogens.
AB  - Intimins are outer membrane proteins expressed by enteric bacterial pathogens capable of inducing intestinal attachment-and-effacement lesions. A eukaryotic cell-binding domain is located within a 280-amino-acid (Int280) carboxy terminus of intimin polypeptides. Polyclonal antiserum was raised against Int280 from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) serotypes O127:H6 and O114:H2 (anti-Int280-H6 and anti-Int280-H2, respectively), and Western blot analysis was used to explore the immunological relationship between the intimin polypeptides expressed by different clinical EPEC and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) isolates, a rabbit diarrheagenic E. coli strain (RDEC-1), and Citrobacter rodentium. Anti-Int280-H6 serum reacted strongly with some EPEC serotypes, whereas anti-Int280-H2 serum reacted strongly with strains belonging to different EPEC and EHEC serotypes, RDEC-1, and C. rodentium. These observations were confirmed by using purified Int280 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by immunogold and immunofluorescence labelling of whole bacterial cells. Some bacterial strains were recognized poorly by either antiserum (e.g., EPEC O86:H34 and EHEC O157:H7). By using PCR primers designed on the basis of the intimin-encoding eae gene sequences of serotype O127:H6, O114:H2, and O86:H34 EPEC and serotype O157:H7 EHEC, we could distinguish between different eae gene derivatives. Accordingly, the different intimin types were designated alpha, beta, delta, and gamma, respectively.
TI  - Intimin from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli restores murine virulence to a Citrobacter rodentium eaeA mutant: induction of an immunoglobulin A response to intimin and EspB.
AB  - The formation of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions is central to the pathogenesis of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC)-mediated disease in humans and Citrobacter rodentium (formerly C. freundii biotype 4280)-mediated transmissible colonic hyperplasia in mice. Closely related outer membrane proteins, known as intimins, are required for formation of the A/E lesion by both EPEC (Int(EPEC)) and C. rodentium (Int(CR)). A secreted protein, EspB (formally EaeB), is also necessary for A/E-lesion formation. Here we report that expression of a cloned Int(EPEC), encoded by plasmid pCVD438, restores murine virulence to an intimin-deficient mutant of C. rodentium DBS255. Replacement of Cys937 with Ala abolished the ability of the cloned EPEC intimin to complement the deletion mutation in DBS255. Ultrastructural examination of tissues from wild-type C. rodentium and DBS255(pCVD438)-infected mice revealed multiple A/E lesion on infected cells and loss of contact between enterocytes and basement membrane. Histological investigation showed that although both wild-type C. rodentium and DBS255(pCVD438) colonized the descending colon and induced colonic hyperplasia in orally infected 21-day-old mice, the latter strain adhered to epithelial cells located deeper within crypts. Nonetheless, infection with the wild-type strain was consistently more virulent, as indicated by a higher mortality rate. All the surviving mice, challenged with either wild-type C. rodentium or DBS255(pCVD438), developed a mucosal immunoglobulin A response to intimin and EspB. These results show that C. rodentium infection provides a relevant, simple, and economic model to investigate the role of EPEC proteins in the formation of A/E lesions in vivo and in intestinal disease.
TI  - Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene meeting at Manson House, London, 14 December 1995. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli--mucosal infection models.
AB  - The formation of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions is central to the pathogenesis of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC)-mediated disease in humans and Citrobacter rodentium-mediated transmissible colonic hyperplasia in mice. Closely related outer membrane proteins, known as intimins, are required for formation of the A/E lesion by both EPEC and C. rodentium. In this study we found similar ultrastructural damage in small intestinal biopsies from an EPEC-infected child and large bowel specimens from C. rodentium-infected mice. The C. rodentium-infected large bowel biopsies revealed massive hyperplastic reactions and the infected human small intestinal biopsies showed an increase in total crypt cell number and mitotic index. EPEC-infected small intestinal organ cultures revealed bacteria adhering in a localized pattern and evidence of A/E lesions. Covaspheres coated with a biologically active cell-binding domain of intimin also adhered to cells in a localized fashion but did not induce the characteristic A/E lesions.
