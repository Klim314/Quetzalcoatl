TI  == response of endophytic bacterial communities in banana tissue culture plantlets to fusarium wilt pathogen infection.
AB  == endophytic bacteria reside within plant hosts without having pathogenic effects,  and various endophytes have been found to functionally benefit plant disease suppressive ability. in this study, the influence of banana plant stress on the endophytic bacterial communities, which was achieved by infection with the wilt pathogen fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, was examined by cultivation-independent denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of 16s ribosomal dna directly amplified from plant tissue dna. community analysis clearly demonstrated increased bacterial diversity in pathogen-infected plantlets compared to that in control plantlets. by sequencing, bands most similar to species of bacillus and pseudomonas showed high density in the pathogen-treated pattern. in vitro screening of the isolates for antagonistic activity against fusarium wilt pathogen acquired three strains of endophytic bacteria which were found to match those species that obviously increased in the pathogen infection process; moreover, the most inhibitive strain could also interiorly colonize plantlets and perform antagonism. the evidence obtained from this work showed that antagonistic endophytic bacteria could be induced by the appearance of a host fungal pathogen and further be an ideal biological control agent to use in banana fusarium wilt disease protection.

TI  == diversity of endophytic bacterial populations and their interaction with xylella  fastidiosa in citrus plants.
AB  == citrus variegated chlorosis (cvc) is caused by xylella fastidiosa, a phytopathogenic bacterium that can infect all citrus sinensis cultivars. the endophytic bacterial communities of healthy, resistant, and cvc-affected citrus plants were studied by using cultivation as well as cultivation-independent techniques. the endophytic communities were assessed in surface-disinfected citrus branches by plating and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). dominant isolates were characterized by fatty-acid methyl ester analysis as bacillus pumilus, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, enterobacter cloacae, methylobacterium spp. (including methylobacterium extorquens, m. fujisawaense, m. mesophilicum, m. radiotolerans, and m. zatmanii), nocardia sp., pantoea agglomerans, and xanthomonas campestris. we observed a relationship between cvc symptoms and the frequency of isolation of species of methylobacterium, the genus that we most frequently isolated from symptomatic plants. in contrast, we isolated c. flaccumfaciens significantly more frequently from asymptomatic plants than from those with symptoms of cvc while p. agglomerans was frequently isolated from tangerine (citrus reticulata) and sweet-orange (c. sinensis) plants, irrespective of whether the plants were symptomatic or asymptomatic or showed symptoms of cvc. dgge analysis of 16s rrna gene fragments amplified from total plant dna resulted in several bands that matched those from the bacterial isolates, indicating that dgge profiles can be used to detect some endophytic bacteria of citrus plants. however, some bands had no match with any isolate, suggesting the occurrence of other, nonculturable or as yet uncultured, endophytic bacteria. a specific band with a high g+c ratio was observed only in asymptomatic plants. the higher frequency of c. flaccumfaciens in asymptomatic plants suggests a role for this organism in the resistance of plants to cvc.

TI  == variability and interactions between endophytic bacteria and fungi isolated from  leaf tissues of citrus rootstocks.
AB  == fungi and bacteria were isolated from surface disinfected leaf tissues of several citrus rootstocks. the principal bacterial species isolated were alcaligenes sp., bacillus spp. (including b. cereus, b. lentus, b. megaterium, b. pumilus, and b.  subtilis), burkholderia cepacia, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, enterobacter cloacae, methylobacterium extorquens, and pantoea agglomerans, with p. agglomerans and b. pumilus being the most frequently isolated species. the most abundant fungal species were colletotrichum gloeosporioides, guignardia citricarpa, and cladosporium sp. genetic variability between 36 endophytic bacterial isolates was analysed by the random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) technique, which indicated that b. pumilus isolates were more diverse than p. agglomerans isolates, although genetic diversity was not related to the host plants. in vitro interaction studies between g. citricarpa isolates and the most  frequently isolated endophytic bacteria showed that metabolites secreted by g. citricarpa have an inhibitory growth effect on some bacillus species, and a stimulatory growth effect on p. agglomerans.

TI  == dust-borne bacteria in animal sheds, schools and children's day care centres.
AB  == a total of 316 bacterial strains, including psychrophiles, mesophiles and thermophiles, were isolated and identified from indoor dusts in schools, children's day care centres and animal sheds. several species which had not previously been reported from indoor environments were found: sphingomonas, brevibacterium, nocardiopsis, deinococcus and rhodococcus/gordona. a new psychrophilic actinomycete genus was also found in animal sheds, representing a new undescribed peptidoglycan type and an unusual whole-cell fatty acid composition. the indoor dusts of animal sheds contained mainly the gram-negative  genera pseudomonas, pantoea, flavobacterium and xanthomonas early in the indoor feeding season, but changed to a composition dominated by bacillus, micrococcus and mesophilic and thermophilic actinomycetes towards the end of the season. the  dust contained, and air-borne bacterial flora in schools and day care centres were dominated by, gram-positive bacilli and actinomycetes, notably bacillus cereus, brevibacillus brevis, b. licheniformis, b. subtilis and species of arthrobacter, corynebacterium, rhodococcus/gordona, nocardiopsis sp., deinococcus, staphylococcus and micrococcus. indoor air and dust contained klebsiella oxytoca, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, ac. lwoffi, bacillus cereus and  nocardiopsis dassonvillei with the status of hazard group ii. indoor dusts of animal sheds contained eight different 3-hydroxy fatty acids, the 2-hydroxy fatty acid 14:0 and two 10-methyl fatty acids, whereas in dusts from schools and day care centres, these were below the detection level (< 3.5 ng mg-1). the 3-and 2-hydroxy fatty acids could be assigned to one or more of the dust-contained cultivable strains, but 10-methyl c16:0 was not present in any of the strains isolated. the dusts from schools and children's day care centres contained 0.2-0.3 ng of endotoxin mg-1 and 0.5-1.4 ng of beta-d-glucan mg-1, whereas the dusts from animal sheds contained more 0.3-41 ng mg-1 and 8-35 ng mg-1, respectively.
