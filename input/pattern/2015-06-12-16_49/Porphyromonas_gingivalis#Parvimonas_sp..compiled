TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of phosphoric acid solution compared to other root canal irrigants.
AB  - Phosphoric acid has been suggested as an irrigant due to its effectiveness in removing the smear layer. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of a 37% phosphoric acid solution to other irrigants commonly used in endodontics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The substances 37% phosphoric acid, 17% EDTA, 10% citric acid, 2% chlorhexidine (solution and gel), and 5.25% NaOCl were evaluated. The antimicrobial activity was tested against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces meyeri, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella nigrescens according to the agar diffusion method. The cytotoxicity of the irrigants was determined by using the MTT assay. RESULTS: Phosphoric acid presented higher antimicrobial activity compared to the other tested irrigants. With regard to the cell viability, this solution showed results similar to those with 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution), whereas 17% EDTA and 10% citric acid showed higher cell viability compared to other irrigants. CONCLUSION: Phosphoric acid demonstrated higher antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity similar to that of 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution).
TI  - Microbial diversity of the supra- and subgingival biofilm of healthy individuals  after brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles.
AB  - Nanoparticulate silver has recently been reported as an effective antimicrobial agent. The aim of this clinical study was to investigate the potential changes on the oral microbiota of healthy individuals after controlled brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles. Twenty-four healthy participants were enrolled in this investigation and randomly submitted to 3 interventions. All the participants received, in a crossover format, the following toothbrushing interventions: (i) chlorhexidine-coated bristles, (ii) silver-coated bristles, and (iii) conventional toothbrush (Control). All the interventions had a duration of 30 days. The DNA checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify up to 43 microbial species colonizing the supra- and subgingival biofilm. The supragingival samples presented higher genome counts than the subgingival samples (p < 0.0001). The total genome counts from the Control group showed the highest values, followed by the silver and chlorhexidine groups (p < 0.0001). After 4 weeks of brushing, the silver-coated and chlorhexidine-coated bristles were capable of reducing or maintaining lower levels of the bacterial counts of the putative periodontal pathogens Tanerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Other major periodontal pathogens, such as Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, and Parvimonas micra, were also detected at lower levels. The toothbrush bristles impregnated with silver nanoparticles reduced the total and individual genome count in the supra- and subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. Chlorhexidine was not effective in reducing the total genome counts in both supra- or subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. Chlorhexidine reduced the individual genome counts in the supragingival biofilm for most of the target species, including putative periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Bacteria community study of combined periodontal-endodontic lesions using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The entire microbial population and predominant microflora of root canals (RCs) and adjacent periodontal pockets (PPs) from teeth with combined periodontal-endodontic lesions were determined and compared. METHODS: Pooled RC and PP samples were collected from the molars of 20 patients diagnosed with combined periodontal-endodontic lesions. DNA was extracted for polymerase chain reaction-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), cloning, and sequence analysis. A coefficient of similarity (Cs) was used to determine the similarity of the bacterial profiles from RCs and PPs. RESULTS: Significantly fewer bands were produced by PCR-DGGE from RCs (5.9 +/- 1.7) than from PPs (8.0 +/- 1.8) (P <0.001). The average Cs of the RC and PP samples was 93.81% +/- 10.26%. Overall, 60 genera/species were identified by sequencing. Of these, the predominant genera in RCs were Porphyromonas sp. (13.9%), Filifactor sp. (12.5%), and Parvimonas sp. (11.1%), similar to the genera obtained from PP samples. In total, 43 genera/species were common to the RC and PP samples. The most prevalent bacteria in both the RC and PP samples were (in descending order) Filifactor alocis, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia. CONCLUSIONS: The high similarity in the sets of organisms present in both RC and PP samples in this study suggests that the pocket could be a source of RC infection. The data also demonstrate that combined periodontal-endodontic lesions consist of a diverse and complex microbial community.
TI  - Effectiveness of three antimicrobial mouthrinses on the disinfection of toothbrushes stored in closed containers: a randomized clinical investigation by DNA Checkerboard and Culture.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate the efficacy of three antimicrobial solutions on the disinfection of toothbrushes after storage in closed containers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen healthy subjects were enrolled in this randomized cross-over clinical investigation. The study was conducted in four phases, in which mouthrinses (chlorhexidine gluconate-based or cetilpiridinium-based) and sterile tap water (control group) were used to individually store used toothbrushes in closed containers during 7 days of toothbrushing. Five toothbrushes were used as negative control for bacterial colonisation before contact with oral cavity. Conventional culture and DNA Checkerboard hybridization were used to detect bacterial contamination on the toothbrushes. Subsequently, the number of bacterial species on the bristles was estimated by the DNA Checkerboard method. RESULTS: One toothbrush presented bacterial contamination in the negative control test. Both culture and DNA Checkerboard showed positive signals of bacterial contamination in the toothbrushes with no differences in the frequency of detection. The control group showed higher total bacterial counts when compared with the mouthrinse groups. Porphyromonas gingivalis had the highest bacterial count followed by Parvimonas micra. CONCLUSION: Culture and DNA Checkerboard showed positive signals of bacterial contamination. Mouthrinses that contains 0.12% of chlorhexidine gluconate were more effective in reducing bacterial colonisation on the toothbrushes.
TI  - Impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (RP) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [GR]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) analysis. METHODS: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or >3 sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GR (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after treatment. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM analysis. Significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. Species that increased or persisted in high frequency in RP but were significantly reduced in GR included Bacteroidetes sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Dialister spp., Selenomonas spp., Catonella morbi, Eubacterium spp., Filifactor alocis, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus sp. OT113, Fusobacterium sp. OT203, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Streptococcus intermedius or Streptococcus constellatus, and Shuttlesworthia satelles. In contrast, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Gemella haemolysans, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Kingella oralis, Lautropia mirabilis, Neisseria elongata, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus australis, and Veillonella spp. were more associated with therapeutic success. CONCLUSION: Persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.
TI  - Detection of periodontal pathogens in newborns and children with mixed dentition.
AB  - We report the age-related prevalence of red complex periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia, along with four strains of orange complex pathogens. The bacteria present in samples isolated from tongue, cheek, and subgingival sulcus in edentulous newborns and children with mixed dentition were monitored by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). P. gingivalis was not detected in any site of any subject in the two groups tested. However, T. denticola was not only found in the 6-13 years age group, but also in edentulous newborns at a relatively high prevalence, indicating non-dentition-related colonization by T. denticola. Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, T. forsythia, Eikenella corrodens, and Parvimonas micra were found in the oral cavity of most subjects belonging to the 6-13 years age group compared to newborns. This suggested a pronounced association between these colonizing bacteria and the presence of teeth. There was also a strong relation between T. denticola and T. forsythia for their prevalence in the subgingival sulcus of the 6-13 years age group (p < 0.0001), but not in the other sites tested, suggesting that the colonization of dentition-related T. forsythia may be associated with the increased prevalence of non-dentition-related T. denticola in the subgingival sulcus. Overall, these results suggest that dentition is a key determinant of bacterial colonization, especially orange complex bacteria and the red complex bacterium T. forsythia.
TI  - Detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  - To culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. Micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus (HAIN Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) tests are two commercially available rapid PCR-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. In this study, we compared these commercial PCR-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. A total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. Aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. The overall agreement between both methods was excellent for Eubacterium nodatum, Tannerella forsythia and Porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for Capnocytophaga sp, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra (Micromonas micros), and Campylobacter rectus (86-78%). Discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i P. intermedia/Prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. Nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - The effect of a supragingival plaque-control regimen on the subgingival microbiota in smokers and never-smokers: evaluation by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of strict supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microbiota in smokers and never-smokers. Research into the impact of supragingival plaque control on the number of subgingival bacteria has resulted in contradictory findings. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been suggested as a valid alternative to current microbiologic methods based on bacteria cultures. METHODS: Forty-five subjects with chronic periodontitis were selected. Twenty-four of them had never smoked, and 21 were active smokers. Four sites per patient were selected for sampling. Supragingival debridement was performed at baseline, and the subjects received weekly instructions on oral hygiene for 180 days. A clinical examination and subgingival plaque sampling were carried out at baseline and at 30, 90, and 180 days. A real-time PCR assay was used to detect and quantify Porphyromonas gingivalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Dialister pneumosintes, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and the total bacteria load (eubacteria) in the subgingival samples. Statistical analysis was performed using linear models adjusted for the clustering of observations within individuals. RESULTS: Smokers and never-smokers exhibited a similar and significant reduction in total bacteria counts over time. Irrespective of smoking status, deep sites consistently harbored greater quantities of total bacteria throughout the study. Higher numbers of the bacteria investigated were associated with bleeding on probing. CONCLUSION: Supragingival plaque control markedly reduced subgingival microbiota counts in smokers and never-smokers.
