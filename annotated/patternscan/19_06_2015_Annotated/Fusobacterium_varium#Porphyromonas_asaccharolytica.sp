TI  == activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  == the activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions.  peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus prevotii) and porphyromonas spp. (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. the mics of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, clostridium innocuum, clostridium clostridioforme, anaerobiospirillum spp., bacteroides tectum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides gracilis (now campylobacter gracilis), prevotella intermedia, prevotella heparinolytica, and the prevotella oris-buccae  group. fusobacterium naviforme and fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while fusobacterium varium  strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other fusobacterium species, such as fusobacterium ulcerans and fusobacterium russii, as well as veillonella spp., the prevotella melaninogenica group, prevotella bivia, clostridium difficile, and bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (mic(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  == gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) cfu/spot. comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (du-6859a), penicillin g, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. the mic(50) and mic(90) (mics at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for  clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for fusobacterium varium  (13), 0.5 and 1; for fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for prevotella melaninogenica (11),  1 and 1. gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than  trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were  equivalent against clostridia and p. asaccharolytica. gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (du 6859a) against peptostreptococci, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria.  sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of bacteroides and other genera of gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  == a numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of bacteroides, polyphyromonas, prevotella [not prevotella (labroue, 1976)] and fusobacterium. isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. computation of similarity coefficients was  followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. at the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) fusobacterium mortiferum, f. necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum and f.  varium; (3) b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformus and b. vulgatus; (4) b. splanchnicus; (5) porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) b. bivius (prevotella bivia); (7) b. disiens (p. disiens); (8) b. intermedius (p. intermedia);and (9) b. melaninogenicus (p. melaninogenica). single isolates of b. ruminicola (p. ruminicola), b. denticola (p. denticola) and b. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
