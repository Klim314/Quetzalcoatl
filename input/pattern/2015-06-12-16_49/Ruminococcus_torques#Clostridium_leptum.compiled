TI  - Characterization of 1706, a virulent phage from Lactococcus lactis with similarities to prophages from other Firmicutes.
AB  - The virulent lactococcal phage 1706, isolated in 1995 from a failed cheese production in France, represents a new lactococcal phage species of the Siphoviridae family. This phage has a burst size of 160 and a latent period of 85 min. Its linear double-stranded DNA genome was composed of 55,597 bp with a 33.7% G+C content. Its deduced proteome (76 ORFs) shared limited similarities to other known phage proteins. SDS-PAGE coupled with LC-MS/MS analyses led to the identification of 15 structural proteins. The most striking feature of the 1706 proteome was that 22 ORFs shared similarities with proteins deduced from the genome of either Ruminococcus torques and/or Clostridium leptum. Both are Firmicutes bacteria found in the gut flora of humans. We also identified a four-gene module in phage 1706, most likely involved in host recognition that shared similarities with lactococcal prophages. We propose that the virulent phage 1706 infected another bacterial genus before picking up a lactococcal host recognition module.
TI  - Assessment of microbial diversity in human colonic samples by 16S rDNA sequence analysis.
AB  - Abstract The bacterial species diversity of three colonic tissue samples from elderly people was investigated by sequence analysis of randomly cloned eubacterial 16S rDNA. The majority of sequences (87%) clustered within three bacterial groups: (1) Bacteroides; (2) low G+C content Gram-positives related to Clostridium coccoides (cluster XIVa); (3) Gram-positives related to Clostridium leptum (cluster IV). These groups have been shown to dominate the human faecal flora. Only 25% of sequences were closely related (>97%) to current species type strains, and 28% were less than 97% related to any database entry. 19% of sequences were most closely related to recently isolated butyrate-producing bacteria belonging to clusters XIVa and IV, with a further 18% of the sequences most closely related to Ruminococcus obeum and Ruminococcus torques (members of cluster XIVa). These results provide the first molecular information on the microbial diversity present in human colonic samples.
