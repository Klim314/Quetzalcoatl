TI  == identification and genetics of 6-thioguanine secreted by erwinia species and its  interference with the growth of other bacteria.
AB  == we identified a compound in culture supernatants of erwinia species, such as erwinia amylovora, e. pyrifoliae, e. billingiae, e. tasmaniensis, e. persicina and e. rhapontici absorbing at 340 nm, which was associated before with the yellow pigment produced by e. amylovora on media containing copper ions. the compound was purified from e. tasmaniensis strain et1/99 supernatants by chromatography on dowex-1 and dowex-50 columns and identified by hplc/ms and nmr  analysis as 6-thioguanine (6tg). its signal at 167 da matched with the expected molecular mass. by random mutagenesis with minitn5, we obtained mutants defective in the genes for pyrimidine and purine metabolism. a specific gene cluster with ycf genes described by us before, absent in the corresponding region of escherichia coli, was identified in the genome sequence of three erwinia species  and named tgs region for thioguanine synthesis. clones of the tgs gene cluster promoted 6tg synthesis and secretion in e. coli, when the bacteria were grown in  minimal medium supplemented with amino acids. 6tg was bacteriostatic for e. coli  and salmonella typhimurium strains, with cell growth resumed after prolonged incubation. similar results were obtained with p. agglomerans strains. bacteria from the genus pectobacterium were barely and rahnella or gibbsiella species were not inhibited by 6tg. adenine and guanine relieved the toxic effect of 6tg on e.  coli. non-producing strains were fully virulent on host plants. 6tg synthesis may help erwinias to interfere with growth of some microorganisms in the environment.

TI  == phylogenetic position and virulence apparatus of the pear flower necrosis pathogen erwinia piriflorinigrans cfbp 5888t as assessed by comparative genomics.
AB  == erwinia piriflorinigrans is a necrotrophic pathogen of pear reported from spain that destroys flowers but does not progress further into the host. we sequenced the complete genome of the type strain cfbp 5888(t) clarifying its phylogenetic position within the genus erwinia, and indicating a position between its closest  relative, the epiphyte erwinia tasmaniensis and other plant pathogenic erwinia spp. (i.e., the fire blight pathogen e. amylovora and the asian pear pathogen e.  pyrifoliae). common features are the type iii and type vi secretion systems, amylovoran biosynthesis and desferrioxamine production. the e. piriflorinigrans genome also provided the first evidence for production of the siderophore chrysobactin within the genus erwinia sensu stricto, which up to now was mostly associated with phytopathogenic, soft-rot dickeya and pectobacterium species. plasmid pepir37, reported in this strain, is closely related to small plasmids found in the fire blight pathogen e. amylovora and e. pyrifoliae. the genome of e. piriflorinigrans also gives detailed insights in evolutionary genomics of pathoadapted erwinia.

TI  == comparative genomics of japanese erwinia pyrifoliae strain ejp617 with closely related erwinias.
AB  == japanese erwinia pyrifoliae strains cause bacterial shoot blight of pear (bsbp) in japan. the genetics of japanese erwinia remains largely unknown relative to the abundant genomic information available for other erwinia strains. we compared the genome of japanese and korean e. pyrifoliae strains along with those of e. amylovora and e. tasmaniensis. comparisons with the korean e. pyrifoliae strain revealed numerous gene insertions/deletions, rearrangements, and inversions in the central regions of the chromosomes. approximately 80% (2843) of coding dna sequences (cdss) are shared by these two genomes which represent about three-quarters of the genome, and there are about 20% unique cdss. comparative analysis with closely related erwinias showed that 1942 (more than 50%) core open reading frames (orf) are shared by all these strains. in addition to two type iii secretion systems (hrp/dsp and inv/spa), the genome of ejp617 encodes numerous virulence factors, including a type vi secretion system, an exopolysaccharide synthesis cluster, and another protein secretion system present in plant pathogenic erwinia strains. the availability of whole genome sequence should provide a resource to further improve the understanding of pathogenesis in japanese e. pyrifoliae ejp617 and to facilitate evolutionary studies among the species of the genus erwinia.

TI  == identification of erwinia species isolated from apples and pears by differential  pcr.
AB  == many pathogenic and epiphytic bacteria isolated from apples and pears belong to the genus erwinia; these include the species e. amylovora, e. pyrifoliae, e. billingiae, e. persicina, e. rhapontici and e. tasmaniensis. identification and classification of freshly isolated bacterial species often requires tedious taxonomic procedures. to facilitate routine identification of erwinia species, we have developed a pcr method based on species-specific oligonucleotides (ssos) from the sequences of the housekeeping genes reca and gpd. using species-specific primers that we report here, differentiation was done with conventional pcr (cpcr) and quantitative pcr (qpcr) applying two consecutive primer annealing temperatures. the specificity of the primers depends on terminal single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) that are characteristic for the target species. these pcr assays enabled us to distinguish eight erwinia species, as well as to identify new erwinia isolates from plant surfaces. when performed with mixed bacterial cultures, they only detected a single target species. this method is a  novel approach to classify strains within the genus erwinia by pcr and it can be  used to confirm other diagnostic data, especially when specific pcr detection methods are not already available. the method may be applied to classify species  within other bacterial genera.

TI  == functions and origin of plasmids in species that are pathogenic to or epiphytically associated with pome fruit trees.
AB  == the genus erwinia includes plant-associated pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. among them, all species pathogenic to pome fruit trees (e. amylovora, e. pyrifoliae, e. piriflorinigrans, erwinia sp. from japan) cause similar symptoms,  but differ in their degrees of aggressiveness, i.e. in symptoms, host range or both. the presence of plasmids of similar size, in the range of 30 kb, is a common characteristic that they possess. besides, they share some genetic content with high homology in several genes associated with exopolysaccharide production  and hence, with virulence, as well as in some other genes. knowledge of the content of these plasmids and comparative genetic analyses may provide interesting new clues to understanding the origin and evolution of these pathogens and the level of symptoms they produce. furthermore, genetic similarities observed among some of the plasmids (and genomes) from the above indicated pathogenic species and e. tasmaniensis or e. billingiae, which are epiphytic on the same hosts, may reveal associations that could expose the mechanisms of origin of pathogens. a summary of the current information on their  plasmids and the relationships among them is presented here.

TI  == detection of erwinia species from the apple and pear flora by mass spectroscopy of whole cells and with novel pcr primers.
AB  == aims: to detect the apple and pear pathogens erwinia amylovora and erwinia pyrifoliae as well as the related epiphytes erwinia tasmaniensis and erwinia billingiae, we created novel pcr primers and also applied them to a series of other plant-associated bacteria as control. to facilitate fast diagnosis, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). methods and results: the pcr primers were deduced from the psts-glms regions, which can include the gene for levansucrase, and also from regions encoding capsular polysaccharide synthesis. all primer combinations were  specific for their associated erwinia species to detect them with conventional pcr, also in mixed cultures from necrotic plant tissue. other primers designed for quantitative pcr with sybr green or together with taqman probes were applied  for real-time detection to determine growth of erw. amylovora, erw. billingiae, erw. pyrifoliae and erw. tasmaniensis in apple blossoms. from whole-cell protein  extracts, profiles were generated using a bruker microflex machine and erwinia strains classified according to a score scheme. conclusions: the designed pcr primers identified the erwinia species unambiguously and can be applied to qualitative and quantitative tests. maldi-tof ms data were in agreement with the  pcr assays. significance and impact of the study: the applied diagnosis methods allow fast and precise monitoring of two pathogenic and two epiphytic erwinia species. they are valuable for population studies with apple and pear flowers and with diseased plant material.

TI  == comparative genomics of erwinia amylovora and related erwinia species-what do we  learn?
AB  == erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of fire blight disease of apples and pears, is one of the most important plant bacterial pathogens with worldwide economic significance. recent reports on the complete or draft genome sequences of four species in the genus erwinia, including e. amylovora, e. pyrifoliae, e. tasmaniensis, and e. billingiae, have provided us near complete genetic information about this pathogen and its closely-related species. this review describes in silico subtractive hybridization-based comparative genomic analyses  of eight genomes currently available, and highlights what we have learned from these comparative analyses, as well as genetic and functional genomic studies. sequence analyses reinforce the assumption that e. amylovora is a relatively homogeneous species and support the current classification scheme of e. amylovora and its related species. the potential evolutionary origin of these erwinia species is also proposed. the current understanding of the pathogen, its virulence mechanism and host specificity from genome sequencing data is summarized. future research directions are also suggested.

TI  == evolutionary insights from erwinia amylovora genomics.
AB  == evolutionary genomics is coming into focus with the recent availability of complete sequences for many bacterial species. a hypothesis on the evolution of virulence factors in the plant pathogen erwinia amylovora, the causative agent of fire blight, was generated using comparative genomics with the genomes e. amylovora, erwinia pyrifoliae and erwinia tasmaniensis. putative virulence factors were mapped to the proposed genealogy of the genus erwinia that is based  on phylogenetic and genomic data. ancestral origin of several virulence factors was identified, including levan biosynthesis, sorbitol metabolism, three t3ss and two t6ss. other factors appeared to have been acquired after divergence of pathogenic species, including a second flagellar gene and two glycosyltransferases involved in amylovoran biosynthesis. e. amylovora singletons include 3 unique t3ss effectors that may explain differential virulence/host ranges. e. amylovora also has a unique t1ss export system, and a unique third t6ss gene cluster. genetic analysis revealed signatures of foreign dna suggesting that horizontal gene transfer is responsible for some of these differential features between the three species.

TI  == genome comparison of the epiphytic bacteria erwinia billingiae and e. tasmaniensis with the pear pathogen e. pyrifoliae.
AB  == background: the genus erwinia includes plant-associated pathogenic and non-pathogenic enterobacteria. important pathogens such as erwinia amylovora, the causative agent of fire blight and e. pyrifoliae causing bacterial shoot blight of pear in asia belong to this genus. the species e. tasmaniensis and e. billingiae are epiphytic bacteria and may represent antagonists for biocontrol of fire blight. the presence of genes that are putatively involved in virulence in e. amylovora and e. pyrifoliae is of special interest for these species in consequence. results: here we provide the complete genome sequences of the pathogenic e. pyrifoliae strain ep1/96 with a size of 4.1 mb and of the non-pathogenic species e. billingiae strain eb661 with a size of 5.4 mb, de novo  determined by conventional sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing techniques. genome comparison reveals large inversions resulting from homologous  recombination events. furthermore, comparison of deduced proteins highlights a relation of e. billingiae strain eb661 to e. tasmaniensis strain et1/99 and a distance to e. pyrifoliae for the overall gene content as well as for the presence of encoded proteins representing virulence factors for the pathogenic species. pathogenicity of e. pyrifoliae is supposed to have evolved by accumulation of potential virulence factors. e. pyrifoliae carries factors for type iii secretion and cell invasion. other genes described as virulence factors  for e. amylovora are involved in the production of exopolysaccharides, the utilization of plant metabolites such as sorbitol and sucrose. some virulence-associated genes of the pathogenic species are present in e. tasmaniensis but mostly absent in e. billingiae. conclusion: the data of the genome analyses correspond to the pathogenic lifestyle of e. pyrifoliae and underlines the epiphytic localization of e. tasmaniensis and e. billingiae as a saprophyte.

TI  == erwinia piriflorinigrans sp. nov., a novel pathogen that causes necrosis of pear  blossoms.
AB  == eight erwinia strains, isolated from necrotic pear blossoms in valencia, spain, were compared with reference strains of erwinia amylovora and erwinia pyrifoliae, both of which are pathogenic to species of pear tree, and to other species of the family enterobacteriaceae using a polyphasic approach. phenotypic analyses clustered the novel isolates into one phenon, distinct from other species of the  genus erwinia, showing that the novel isolates constituted a homogeneous phenotypic group. rep-pcr profiles, pcr products obtained with different pairs of primers and plasmid contents determined by restriction analysis showed differences between the novel strains and reference strains of e. amylovora and e. pyrifoliae. phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna, gpd and reca gene sequences showed that the eight novel strains could not be assigned to any recognized species. on the basis of dna-dna hybridization studies, the novel isolates constituted a single group with relatedness values of 87-100 % to the designated  type strain of the group, cfbp 5888(t). depending on the method used, strain cfbp 5888(t) showed dna-dna relatedness values of between 22.7 and 50 % to strains of  the closely related species e. amylovora and e. tasmaniensis. the dna g+c contents of two of the novel strains, cfbp 5888(t) and cfbp 5883, were 51.1 and 50.5 mol%, respectively. on the basis of these and previous results, the novel isolates represent a novel species of the genus erwinia, for which the name erwinia piriflorinigrans sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is cfbp 5888(t) (=cect 7348(t)).

TI  == complete genome sequence of the fire blight pathogen erwinia pyrifoliae dsm 12163t and comparative genomic insights into plant pathogenicity.
AB  == background: erwinia pyrifoliae is a newly described necrotrophic pathogen, which  causes fire blight on asian (nashi) pear and is geographically restricted to eastern asia. relatively little is known about its genetics compared to the closely related main fire blight pathogen e. amylovora. results: the genome of the type strain of e. pyrifoliae strain dsm 12163t, was sequenced using both 454  and solexa pyrosequencing and annotated. the genome contains a circular chromosome of 4.026 mb and four small plasmids. based on their respective role in virulence in e. amylovora or related organisms, we identified several putative virulence factors, including type iii and type vi secretion systems and their effectors, flagellar genes, sorbitol metabolism, iron uptake determinants, and quorum-sensing components. a deletion in the rpos gene covering the most conserved region of the protein was identified which may contribute to the difference in virulence/host-range compared to e. amylovora. comparative genomics with the pome fruit epiphyte erwinia tasmaniensis et1/99 showed that both species are overall highly similar, although specific differences were identified, for example the presence of some phage gene-containing regions and a high number of putative genomic islands containing transposases in the e. pyrifoliae dsm 12163t  genome. conclusions: the e. pyrifoliae genome is an important addition to the published genome of e. tasmaniensis and the unfinished genome of e. amylovora providing a foundation for re-sequencing additional strains that may shed light on the evolution of the host-range and virulence/pathogenicity of this important  group of plant-associated bacteria.

TI  == the genome of erwinia tasmaniensis strain et1/99, a non-pathogenic bacterium in the genus erwinia.
AB  == the complete genome of the bacterium erwinia tasmaniensis strain et1/99 consisting of a 3.9 mb circular chromosome and five plasmids was sequenced. strain et1/99 represents an epiphytic plant bacterium related to erwinia amylovora and e. pyrifoliae, which are responsible for the important plant diseases fire blight and asian pear shoot blight, respectively. strain et1/99 is  a non-pathogenic bacterium and is thought to compete with these and other bacteria when occupying the same habitat during initial colonization. genome analysis revealed tools for colonization, cellular communication and defence modulation, as well as genes coding for the synthesis of levan and a not detected capsular exopolysaccharide. strain et1/99 may secrete indole-3-acetic acid to increase availability of nutrients provided on plant surfaces. these nutrients are subsequently accessed and metabolized. secretion systems include the hypersensitive response type iii pathway present in many pathogens. differences or missing parts within the virulence-related factors distinguish strain et1/99 from pathogens such as pectobacterium atrosepticum and the related erwinia spp. strain et1/99 completely lacks the sorbitol operon, which may also affect its inability to invade fire blight host plants. erwinia amylovora in contrast depends for virulence on utilization of sorbitol, the dominant carbohydrate in rosaceous plants. the presence of other virulence-associated factors in strain et1/99 indicates the ancestral genomic background of many plant-associated bacteria.

TI  == autoinducer-2 of the fire blight pathogen erwinia amylovora and other plant-associated bacteria.
AB  == autoinducers are important for cellular communication of bacteria. the luxs gene  has a central role in the synthesis of autoinducer-2 (ai-2). the gene was identified in a shotgun library of erwinia amylovora and primers designed for pcr amplification from bacterial dna. supernatants of several erwinia amylovora strains were assayed for ai-2 activity with a vibrio harveyi mutant and were positive. many other plant-associated bacteria also showed ai-2 activity such as  erwinia pyrifoliae and erwinia tasmaniensis. the luxs genes of several bacteria were cloned, sequenced, and complemented escherichia coli strain dh5alpha and a salmonella typhimurium mutant, both defective in luxs, for synthesis of ai-2. assays to detect ai-2 activity in culture supernatants of several pseudomonas syringae pathovars failed, which may indicate the absence of ai-2 or synthesis of another type. several reporter strains did not detect synthesis of an acyl homoserine lactone (ahl, ai-1) by erwinia amylovora, but confirmed ahl-synthesis  for erwinia carotovora ssp. atroseptica and pantoea stewartii.
