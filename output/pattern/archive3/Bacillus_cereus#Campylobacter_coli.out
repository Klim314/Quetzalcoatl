inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
inhibited growth of common enteropathogenic bacteria in lactic-fermented cereal gruels.
a natural lactic fermentation of mixtures of water and whole flour of either maize or high-tannin sorghum was obtained either before or after cooking to a weaning gruel: the preparations had a final ph of about 3.8 (range 3.67 to 4.00) and a ratio of lactic acid to acetic acid of 9ratio1 (w/w). the growth of added (about 10(7) c.f.u./g gruel) gram-negative intestinal pathogenic bacteria, enterotoxigenicescherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella flexneri andsalmonella typhimurium, was strongly inhibited in the sour gruels, and the effect could primarily be explained by the low ph caused by the formation of lactic and acetic acids during the fermentation process. of the added gram-positive bacteria,bacillus cereus andstaphylococcus aureus showed similar inhibited growth up to 7h after inoculation in the sour gruels. the strain ofstaphylococcus, however, showed only a continued reduction in growth in the fermented gruel samples, which had a viable lactic bacteria culture indicating the presence of a bacteriocin. this implies that a low ph (< 4.0) alone is not sufficient to sustain the inhibition of the growth ofstaphylococcus aureus. the survival studies were carried out at optimal temperatures for each respective enteropathogen.
bacterial aetiology of infantile diarrhoea in papua new guinea.
bacterial examination of stools of children with diarrhoea was carried out at port moresby, papua new guinea, where little information is available concerning the causative bacteria of diarrhoea. shigellae, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter jejuni, and aeromonas hydrophila were isolated with the decreasing frequency in that order. among these, enterotoxigenic e. coli and c. jejuni were isolated for the first time in this country. although vibrio parahaemolyticus was recovered from sea water, no cases suffering from this organism were found.
