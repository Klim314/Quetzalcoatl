TI  == platelets and infections - complex interactions with bacteria.
AB  == platelets can be considered sentinels of vascular system due to their high number in the circulation and to the range of functional immunoreceptors they express. platelets express a wide range of potential bacterial receptors, including complement receptors, fcgammarii, toll-like receptors but also integrins conventionally described in the hemostatic response, such as gpiib-iiia or gpib.  bacteria bind these receptors either directly, or indirectly via fibrinogen, fibronectin, the first complement c1q, the von willebrand factor, etc. the fate of platelet-bound bacteria is questioned. several studies reported the ability of activated platelets to internalize bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus or porphyromonas gingivalis, though there is no clue on what happens thereafter. are they sheltered from the immune system in the cytoplasm of platelets or are they lysed? indeed, while the presence of phagolysosome has not been demonstrated in platelets, they contain antimicrobial peptides that were shown to be efficient on s. aureus. besides, the fact that bacteria can bind to platelets via receptors involved in hemostasis suggests that they may induce aggregation; this has indeed been described for streptococcus sanguinis, s. epidermidis, or c. pneumoniae. on  the other hand, platelets are able to display an inflammatory response to an infectious triggering. we, and others, have shown that platelet release soluble immunomodulatory factors upon stimulation by bacterial components. moreover, interactions between bacteria and platelets are not limited to only these two partners. indeed, platelets are also essential for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils, resulting in bacterial clearance by trapping  bacteria and concentrating antibacterial factors but in enhancing thrombosis. in  conclusion, the platelet-bacteria interplay is a complex game; its fine analysis  is complicated by the fact that the inflammatory component adds to the aggregation response.

TI  == antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. materials and methods. the growth of selected bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. the  content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with hplc-esi-ms. results. the spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with ph varying between 4.1-5.4. conclusions. the present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice ph explains bacterial in vitro growth. this may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.

TI  == introducing a semi-coated model to investigate antibacterial effects of biocompatible polymers on titanium surfaces.
AB  == peri-implant infections from bacterial biofilms on artificial surfaces are a common threat to all medical implants. they are a handicap for the patient and can lead to implant failure or even life-threatening complications. new implant surfaces have to be developed to reduce biofilm formation and to improve the long-term prognosis of medical implants. the aim of this study was (1) to develop a new method to test the antibacterial efficacy of implant surfaces by direct surface contact and (2) to elucidate whether an innovative antimicrobial copolymer coating of 4-vinyl-n-hexylpyridinium bromide and dimethyl(2-methacryloyloxyethyl) phosphonate (vp:dmmep 30:70) on titanium is able to reduce the attachment of bacteria prevalent in peri-implant infections. with a new in vitro model with semi-coated titanium discs, we were able to show a dramatic reduction in the adhesion of various pathogenic bacteria (streptococcus  sanguinis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis),  completely independently of effects caused by soluble materials. in contrast, soft tissue cells (human gingival or dermis fibroblasts) were less affected by the same coating, despite a moderate reduction in initial adhesion of gingival fibroblasts. these data confirm the hypothesis that vp:dmmep 30:70 is a promising antibacterial copolymer that may be of use in several clinical applications.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 leader surveillance program.
AB  == the 2013 leader surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the united states. a total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. the groups were staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. the mic90 value for each of the 6  pathogen groups was 1 mug/ml. susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was  99.83%. only 12 isolates (2 s. aureus, 3 staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 streptococcus sanguinis, 5 enterococcus faecium, and 1 enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). three of these (2 s. aureus and 1 e. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. the findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.

TI  == collagen barrier membranes may accelerate bacterial growth in vitro: a potential  clinical risk to regenerative procedures.
AB  == objectives: evaluate the antibacterial properties of three commercial collagen membranes for guided bone regeneration (gbr). method and materials: biogide(r), osseoguard(r), and copios(r) membranes were tested for antibacterial properties against streptococcus sanguinis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis using a direct contact test (dct). samples of each membrane, sized 5  x 2 mm, were fixed to the side wall of 6 wells in a 96-well microtiter plate. bacterial suspension was placed on each sample. the plate was incubated at 37 degrees c for 1 hour to allow suspension fluid evaporation. fresh medium was added to each well and the plate was mixed. non-contaminated membrane samples served as negative control. bacterial growth was monitored spectrophotometrically at 650 nm for 24 hours. anova and tukey's comparison tests were used for the statistical analysis. results: the presence of the membrane samples did not disrupt bacterial growth. however, the presence of osseoguard membrane accelerated bacterial growth rate of s sanguinis and s epidermidis as compared to the other two membranes and control samples (p < .001), and of s aureus as compared to the control alone (p < .001). conclusions: the tested collagen membranes have no antibacterial properties. however, osseoguard presents a significant bacterial growth enhancement effect with possible significant clinical implications on the success of regenerative procedures around teeth and  implants.

TI  == susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  == objectives: to present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, resilon/realseal (rs). to determine if  rs is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show rs degradation. method and materials: emulsions of rs were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. lipase ps served as a positive control. pseudomonas aeruginosa, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade rs. the bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for rs degradation for 7 days. results: degradation of the emulsified rs manifested in the formation of clear zones around p aeruginosa, p intermedia, p asaccharolytica, s aureus, and s epidermidis. no degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain rs emulsion. conclusion:  endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade rs. these findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with rs may be impaired by a microbial insult.

TI  == microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. methods: microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. the presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (p </= .05). results:  enterococcus faecium (36%), streptococcus epidermidis (36%), eubacterium saburreum (28%), parvimonas micra (28%), streptococcus sanguis (28%), capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), leptotrichia buccalis (28%), enterococcus faecalis (28%), and staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of treponema socranskii (3%), fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). the highest mean levels were found for the following species: e. faecium, dialister pneumosintes, staphylococcus epidermidis and helicobacter pylori. there was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). a  positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the  levels of gram-negative and rod species (p < .05). conclusions: the microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting e. faecium and s. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. no correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical  findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gras]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases.  they are among the many gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. as a result, alternative therapies need to be developed  to combat these pathogens. we have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (plyss2), derived from a streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against mrsa, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), streptococcus suis, listeria, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), s. pyogenes, streptococcus sanguinis, group g streptococci (ggs), group e streptococci (ges),  and streptococcus pneumoniae. plyss2 has an n-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (chap) catalytic domain and a c-terminal sh3b binding domain. it is stable at 50 degrees c for 30 min, 37 degrees c for >24 h, 4 degrees c for 15  days, and -80 degrees c for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. plyss2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced mrsa and s. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a mic of 16 mug/ml for mrsa. a single, 2-mg dose of plyss2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice  in a bacteremia model of mixed mrsa and s. pyogenes infection. serially increasing exposure of mrsa and s. pyogenes to plyss2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to plyss2 and resistance to mupirocin. to date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, plyss2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.

TI  == [comparison of culture and real-time pcr methods in the detection of streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae in acute otitis media effusion specimens].
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae are the major etiologic agents of acute otitis media. this study was aimed to compare the detection rate  of s.pneumoniae and h.influenzae by culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) in the middle ear effusions of patients diagnosed as acute otitis media. a total of 60 middle ear effusion samples collected from children with acute otitis media were included in the study. the samples were inoculated and incubated in bactec ped plus blood culture bottles and bactec 9120 system (bd diagnostic systems, md), respectively, and the isolates were identified by conventional methods. for the molecular diagnosis of h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae, ply pneumolysin gene and hib capsule region, respectively were amplified by rt-pcr (lightcycler, roche diagnostics, germany). h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae were isolated from 5 (8.3%) and 3 (5%) of the patient samples with conventional culture methods, respectively. in addition in 11.6% of the samples other microorganisms (staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguinis, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans) were also isolated. on the other hand h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae were detected in 38 (63.3%) and 24 (40%) of the samples with rt-pcr, respectively. there was about eight fold increase in the detection frequency of h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae with rt-pcr compared to culture methods. when culture was accepted as the gold standard method, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of rt-pcr in the detection of h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae were estimated as 80%, 51% and 98.2%, respectively. as a result, rt-pcr was shown to be a sensitive method and could be preferred for the rapid diagnosis of h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae in the etiological diagnosis of acute  otitis media, especially in culture negative cases.

TI  == the effect of various topical peri-implantitis antiseptics on staphylococcus epidermidis, candida albicans, and streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == objective: although peri-implantitis has presented an ever increasing problem in  modern dentistry, satisfying therapeutic strategies or scientifically based treatment recommendations are still not available. the main object of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of six different topical antiseptics on three test microorganisms attached to titanium implant specimens.  material and methods: for biofilm formation, plane titan specimens were incubated either in candida albicans, streptococcus sanguinis, or staphylococcus epidermidis for 2h. the specimens were then treated with different topical antiseptics for 60s (sodium hypochlorite 1.0%, hydrogen peroxide 3.0%, chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2%, citric acid 40.0%, plax, or listerine) and with sterile saline as control. remaining vital fungi were quantified by means of a bioluminometric assay and the bacterial load and the viability of adhering s. epidermidis and s. sanguinis by live or dead cell labelling in combination with fluorescence microscopy. results: sodium hypochlorite was effective against all three species, whereas hydrogen peroxide was solely effective against c. albicans. chx and listerine showed antimicrobial activity against s. sanguinis and c. albicans and citric acid and plax against both tested bacteria. conclusions: none of the tested antimicrobial agents, except for sodium hypochlorite, showed a significant in vitro effect on all three test microbes. considering the possible toxicity of sodium hypochlorite, none of the tested - and so far widely used - antiseptics showed any broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect and could therefore not be recommended for the topical disinfection and detoxification of infected implant surfaces.

TI  == fibrin- and collagen-based matrices attenuate inflammatory and procoagulant responses in human endothelial cell cultures exposed to staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == infective endocarditis (ie) remains a serious complication after heart valve replacement. autologous valves constructed by matrix-based tissue engineering are under investigation to increase biocompatibility. the impact of the underlying matrix on the risk to develop ie is not known. the ie is characterized by bacterial adhesion and subsequent interactions of disseminating bacteria with endothelial cells (ecs) and monocytes, evoking endothelial proinflammatory and procoagulant activity, leading to heart valve destruction. in the current study,  we, therefore, have seeded human ecs on a fibrin versus collagen gel matrix and,  at confluence, infected them with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, and staphylococcus epidermidis. especially sta. aureus infected ecs grown on fibrin (4.2% of the inoculum) and collagen (3.7%) matrices, more than on ecs grown on noncoated plates (1.2%; p<0.01). this was associated with higher monocyte adhesion (61%; p<0.01 on fibrin and 43%; p<0.05 on collagen) versus control cultures (30%), even at comparable ec surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1. the collagen matrix attenuated the sta. aureus-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 expression  2.0-fold, compared with the noncoated control ecs. this reduction coincided with  a 4.2-5.0-fold reduction of the procoagulant activity, triggered in ecs grown on  noncoated wells, as a consequence of tissue factor (tf) expression by ecs, further stimulated by ec-bound monocytes. overall, moderate responses were seen on infection with str. sanguis and sta. epidermidis for both gel matrices. thus,  even when fibrin and collagen gel matrices equally increase bacterial adhesion, and subsequent monocyte adhesion to infected ecs, these matrices modulate ec responses to these stimuli, thus resulting in attenuated cytokine production and  attenuated adherent monocyte-dependent tf production by the ecs. further investigations will need to confirm whether also in vivo, ec-matrix interactions  can attenuate ec responses to bacteria and inflammatory cells to reduce ie at infected endovascular sites.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  part ii: new insights.
AB  == the second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. a simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast candida albicans, gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, neisseria sicca, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, gram-positive bacteria deinococcus radiodurans, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. a similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. the area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the wartburg law depending on exposure time. qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration  of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.

TI  == stimulation of fusobacterium nucleatum biofilm formation by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background/aims: bacterial infection is a major cause of periapical periodontitis. eradication of these microorganisms from apical lesions is essential to the success of endodontic treatment. the aim of this study was to clarify the molecular interaction between fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas  gingivalis and other microorganisms associated with periapical periodontitis. methods: microorganisms isolated from periapical lesions were inoculated into type-i collagen-coated polystyrene microtiter plates and maintained at 37 degrees c under anaerobic conditions for 2 days, after which, the quantity of organized biofilm on the plates was evaluated by crystal violet staining. growth enhancement via soluble factor was evaluated by separated coculture using a 0.4-mum membrane filter. results: f. nucleatum exhibited strong adherence to type-i collagen-coated polystyrene microplates. biofilm formation by f. nucleatum was significantly enhanced by p. gingivalis. it was complemented by compartmentalized coculture with p. gingivalis. enhancement of biofilm formation  by p. gingivalis was only slightly reduced by inactivation of its autoinducer-2-producing gene luxs. conclusion: the results suggest that p. gingivalis enhances biofilm formation by f. nucleatum by releasing diffusible signaling molecules other than autoinducer-2.

AB  == in multicellular organisms the development of adhesion bonds, either among cells  or among cells and components of the extracellular matrix, is a crucial process.  these interactions are mediated by molecules which are named adhesion molecules and play a main role both at the early stages of the development of tissue integrity and later. cell adhesion molecules (cams) have a key role in several pathologies such as cancer and inflammatory diseases. selectins, integrins and immunoglobulin gene superfamily of adhesion receptors mediate different steps of  leukocyte migration from the bloodstream towards the inflammatory foci. leukocyte interactions with the vascular endothelium are highly orchestrated processes that include the capture of free-flowing leukocytes from the blood with subsequent leukocyte rolling, arrest, firm adhesion and ensuing diapedesis. these interactions occur under high shear stresses within venules and depend on multiple families of adhesion molecules. as a response to infection mediators, leukocyte gathering is considered to be crucial for the adequate defence of the organism to any kind of injury or infection. endothelial activation contributes significantly to the systemic inflammatory response to bacteraemia and increased  expression. release of soluble endothelial markers into the circulation has been  demonstrated together with elevated plasma levels of cams and has been reported in bacteraemic patients. it has been proposed that infection of endothelial cells with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, or staphylococcus epidermidis  induces surface expression of icam-1 and vcam-1 and monocyte adhesion. in general, leukocyte/endothelial cell interactions such as capture, rolling, and firm adhesion can no longer be viewed as occurring in discrete steps mediated by  individual families of adhesion molecules but rather as a series of overlapping synergistic interactions among adhesion molecules resulting in an adhesion cascade. these cascades thereby direct leukocyte migration, which is essential for the generation of effective inflammatory responses and the development of rapid immune responses.

TI  == microcalorimetry: a novel method for detection of microbial contamination in platelet products.
AB  == background: measuring heat from replicating microorganisms in culture may be a rapid, accurate, and simple screening method for platelets (plts). microcalorimetry for detection of microorganisms in in vitro contaminated plt products was evaluated. study design and methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguinis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and candida albicans were inoculated in single-donor apheresis plts to achieve target concentrations of 10(5), 10(3), 10, or 1 colony-forming units (cfu) per ml of plts. contaminated plts in growth medium were incubated at 37 degrees c for 5 days in a calorimeter. positivity was defined as heat flow of at least 10 microw above the lowest value of the power-time curve. results: with microcalorimetry, inocula of 10 cfus per ml plts  could be detected with the following detection times: s. epidermidis (31.65 hr),  s. aureus (24.24 hr), s. sanguinis (7.82 hr), e. coli (7.53 hr), p. acnes (73.57  hr), and c. albicans (43.77 hr). the detection time was less than 4 hr at 10(5) cfus per ml plts for s. aureus, s. sanguinis, and e. coli. noncontaminated plts remained negative. the total heat ranged from 2.8 (s. sanguinis) to 8.3 j (e. coli). the shape of the power-time curve was species-specific and independent from the initial concentration of microorganisms. conclusion: the detection limit of microcalorimetry was 1 to 10 cfus per ml plts. microcalorimetry is a promising novel method for detection of contaminated plts. applying this method to all plt  products could reduce the frequency of transfusion-related sepsis and prolong the shelf life of plts.

TI  == vancomycin tolerance, a potential mechanism for refractory gram-positive bacteremia observational study in patients with cancer.
AB  == background: the clinical significance of infections caused by vancomycin-tolerant (vt) gram-positive organisms in patients with cancer remains unclear. methods: twenty-five patients with nonenterococcal gram-positive bloodstream infection, which was refractory to vancomycin therapy, were identified by reviewing the infectious diseases consultation database at the tertiary care cancer center. among these, 8 patients in whom vancomycin-tolerance was documented are described. antibiotic tolerance was defined as a > 32 times increase in minimum bactericidal concentration compared with minimum inhibitory concentration. results: eight patients with persistent fever and bacteremia of > 72 hours' duration after the initiation of vancomycin therapy were treated. the median age  of these patients, which included 3 men and 5 women, was 44 years +/- 11 years. solid tumors were more common (6 patients) and 2 patients had acute leukemia. six patients (75%) were neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm3), including  2 breast cancer patients who had undergone autologous stem cell transplantation.  the causative organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 3 patients), group g streptococci (n = 2 patients), and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis (1 patient each). all isolates demonstrated a minimum bactericidal concentration for vancomycin that was at least 32 times greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration. rapid defervescence (< or = 24 h) and resolution of bacteremia occurred with the addition of gentamicin (4 patients) or gentamicin plus rifampin (4 patients). none of these infections recurred after discontinuation of therapy. conclusions: lack of clinical and/or microbiologic response to vancomycin should raise the suspicion of possible infection due to vt gram-positive bacteria, and alternative bactericidal therapy  should be instituted early, especially in patients with underlying immune suppression.

AB  == peritoneal dialysate fluid (pdf) is a bacteriostatic medium that compromises the  antibacterial activity of cell wall-active agents. by use of an in vitro static model, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus  epidermidis (msse), and streptococcus sanguis were exposed to daptomycin at concentrations of 10, 30, and 100 mg/liter, cefazolin at 125 mg/liter, and vancomycin at 25 mg/liter in cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth or todd hewitt  broth (for s. sanguis) and pdf at phs of 5.5 and 7.4. the ph had no effect on antibacterial activity. neither cefazolin nor vancomycin produced a bactericidal  or a bacteriostatic effect versus mrsa, mssa, msse, or s. sanguis in pdf, while all concentrations of daptomycin were bactericidal against all organisms in pdf.  daptomycin did not exhibit concentration-dependent activity in pdf. daptomycin appears to be a promising agent for use in peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis, producing bacterial kill to a greater extent and at a higher rate than cefazolin or vancomycin in pdf.

TI  == echocardiographic presentations of endocarditis, and risk factors for rupture of  a sinus of valsalva in childhood.
AB  == background: in recent years, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis has been enhanced by the use of echocardiography. we sought, therefore, to review its effect on the management of endocarditis in children. methods: we reviewed all the patients presenting to our institution for evaluation for infective endocarditis from may 1994 to january 2002. the patients were stratified according to whether or not they had congenitally malformed hearts. results: of the 90 referred patients identified, 46 (51%) had positive ultrasonic findings. of these, we excluded 26 patients because of the presence of indwelling lines. the remaining 20 patients with features of endocarditis had a median age of 6.5 years, and a range from 0.14 to 8.5 years. there were 4 patients with normal hearts, and 16 with congenital cardiac malformations. we identified rupture of a  sinus of valsalva in four patients, with rupture into the left ventricle in two,  and into the right ventricle and right atrium in one each. the mitral valve was involved in six patients, the aortic valve in another six, including all four with rupture of the sinus of valsalva, both mitral and aortic valves in three, the pulmonary trunk in three patients, and the tricuspid valve and a blalock-taussig shunt in one patient each. organisms isolated included streptococcus mitis in 4 patients, streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 patients, streptococcus sanguis in 1, staphylococcus aureus in 3, staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, and enteroccocus in 2. cultures proved negative in 7 patients.  surgical intervention was needed in 12 patients, and one died (5%). only the left-sided chambers were involved in those with normal hearts. both patients infected with streptococcus pneumoniae had rupture of a sinus of valsalva. conclusion: involvement of the left-sided chambers is more likely in structurally normal hearts, and in cases with rupture of a sinus of valsalva, in which case infection with streptococcus pneumonia should be suspected.

TI  == a retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == objective: septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients. extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before hsct to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. the primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. study design: a retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic hsct to treat hematologic malignancies. radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a schei ruler on all teeth. microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or  any body sites. spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. results: radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. during the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. no statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. conclusion: in this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or  mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. a larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == monocytes maintain tissue factor activity after cytolysis of bacteria-infected endothelial cells in an in vitro model of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == intravascular infection with staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, or streptococcus sanguis can initiate fibrin formation on endocardial tissue, causing bacterial endocarditis. the ability of these bacteria to injure intact endothelial cells (ecs) and to aggravate tissue factor (tf)-dependent coagulation in the presence of blood leukocytes was investigated. cytolysis of ecs occurred after infection with s. aureus and, with membrane-bound monocytes or granulocytes present, also after infection with s. sanguis or s. epidermidis. monocytes that subsequently bound to the resultant bacteria-infected subcellular ec matrix (ecm) elicited tf mrna, tf antigen, and tf activity (tfa). this was most pronounced in  ecm prepared after the cytolysis of ecs by infection with s. aureus or s. epidermidis. we demonstrate that monocytes continue and intensify fibrin formation after lysis of bacteria-infected ecs, which suggests that, during the course of intravascular infection, early fibrin formation shifts from being mediated by ec-derived tfa to being mediated by tfa of monocytes bound to bacteria-infected ecm.

TI  == monocytes augment bacterial species- and strain-dependent induction of tissue factor activity in bacterium-infected human vascular endothelial cells.
AB  == in bacterial endocarditis (be), intravascular infection with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, or staphylococcus epidermidis can lead to formation of a fibrin clot on the inner surface of the heart and cause heart dysfunction. the events that start the coagulation in the early stage of the disease are largely unknown. we have recently shown that human endothelial cells  (ec) upon binding and internalization of s. aureus, but not s. sanguis or s. epidermidis, express tissue factor (tf)-dependent procoagulant activity (tfa). the present study shows that infection of ec with these three pathogens induces surface expression of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (vcam-1) and monocyte adhesion. subsequent coculture of  these cells synergistically enhanced tfa, which was exclusively dependent on tf molecules that were expressed on ec during coculture. tfa induction required direct contact between monocytes and bacterium-infected ec, but the signals for this response were not generated by the binding of monocytes through their beta(2)- or alpha(4)-integrins to icam-1 or vcam-1, respectively, on infected ec. the mechanism by which monocytes induce tfa in bacterium-infected ec was partly mediated by the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 produced by the cells during coculture. endogenous tumor necrosis factor alpha was not involved. this modulating effect of monocytes on species- and strain-dependent tfa of bacterium-infected ec supports our hypothesis that in an early stage in the pathogenesis of be, as well as other intravascular infections that lead to detrimental fibrin formation, the coagulation cascade can be activated on the surfaces of ec as a consequence of specific interactions between pathogenic bacteria, ec, and monocytes.

TI  == role of monocytes in experimental staphylococcus aureus endocarditis.
AB  == in the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis (be), the clotting system plays a cardinal role in the formation and maintenance of the endocardial vegetations. the extrinsic pathway is involved in the activation of the coagulation pathway with tissue factor (tf) as the key protein. staphylococcus aureus is a frequently isolated bacterium from patients with be. we therefore investigated whether s. aureus can induce tf activity (tfa) on fibrin-adherent monocytes, used as an in vitro model of be. we also assessed in vivo in rabbits with catheter induced vegetations, the effect of s. aureus infection on vegetational tfa. in vitro experiments showed that adherent s. aureus induced tfa on fibrin-adherent monocytes which was optimal at a bacterium/monocyte ratio of 1 to 1. monocyte damage occurred when this ratio exceeded 4 to 1 (visually) or 6 to 1 (propidium iodide influx) consequently, tfa decreased. in vivo s. aureus led to very high bacterial numbers in the vegetations and a significant increase of their weight.  however, tfa of infected vegetations was the same as of sterile ones. this may be due to the high bacteria to monocyte ratio as well as bacterium-induced monocyte  damage. teicoplanin treatment of infected rabbits reduced bacterial numbers in the blood and in the vegetations. two-day treatment resulted in an increase of vegetational tfa, but after four-day treatment vegetational tfa dropped, most probably due to a suboptimal bacterium/monocyte ratio. s. aureus endocarditis in  etoposide (vepesid)-treated rabbits, leading to a selective monocytopenia, caused a rapid death of the animals. in these rabbits no vegetations were found at all.  we conclude that, like streptococcus sanguis and staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus is able to induce tfa in fibrin-adherent blood monocytes. in addition, monocytes have a protective effect during the course of s. aureus endocarditis.

TI  == bacterial species- and strain-dependent induction of tissue factor in human vascular endothelial cells.
AB  == a cardinal process in bacterial endocarditis (be) is the activation of the clotting system and the formation of a fibrin clot on the inner surface of the heart, the so-called endocardial vegetation. the processes that lead to the activation of the clotting system on endothelial surfaces upon exposure to bacteria are largely unknown. in the present study, we investigated in an in vitro model whether infection of human endothelial cells (ec) with bacteria that  are relevant to be, such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, and staphylococcus epidermidis, leads to induction of tissue factor (tf)-dependent procoagulant activity (tfa) and whether this process is influenced by host factors, such as interleukin-1 (il-1), that are produced in response to the bacteremia in vivo. the results show that s. aureus binds to and is internalized  by ec, resulting in expression of tf mrna and tf surface protein as well as generation of tfa within 4 to 8 h after infection. no tfa was found when ec were  exposed to uv-irradiated s. aureus or bacterial cell wall fragments. s. sanguis and s. epidermidis, although also binding to ec, did not induce endothelial tfa.  this indicates a species and strain dependency. ec also expressed tfa after exposure to il-1. the enhanced tfa of ec after exposure to s. aureus was not prevented by il-1 receptor antagonist, arguing against an auto- or paracrine contribution of endogenous il-1. when il-1 was applied together with bacteria, this had a synergistic effect on the induction of ec tfa. this was found in particular with s. aureus but also, although to a lesser degree, with s. sanguis  and s. epidermidis. this influence of il-1 on the species- and strain-dependent induction of ec tfa suggests that bacterial factors as well as host factors orchestrate the induction of coagulation in an early stage in the pathogenesis of endovascular disease, such as be.

AB  == thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% co2 in air. a total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three  of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. all were identified as belonging to the streptococcus sanguis group. no beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in  apical periodontitis samples. twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, actionomyces odontolyticus and peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces meyeri. of 19 staphylococci and  micrococci, staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. however, less commonly known organisms such as staphylococcus cohnii and micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. the isolation of bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.

TI  == detection of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia using 16s rrna gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. the use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. the aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. one hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), enterococcus faecium (n = 2), streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), streptococcus mitis (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detected bacterial dna in nine of 11  blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for pcr; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the  conventional identification of the cultured isolates. bacterial dna was detected  in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures,  18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. the species presumptively identified by partial 16s rrna gene  sequencing were as follows: pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); escherichia spp. (n = 3); moraxella spp. (n = 3); staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); neisseria spp. (n = 1); and bacillus spp. (n = 1). the results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.

TI  == role of monocytes and bacteria in staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis.
AB  == the endocardial vegetation which is formed in the course of bacterial endocarditis (be) contains tissue factor (tf)-dependent procoagulant activity. earlier studies showed that monocytes are the main source of tf in the vegetations. the tf activity (tfa) of vegetations isolated from streptococcus sanguis-infected rabbits depended on the numbers of bacteria as well as monocytes in the vegetation. in this study, we investigated whether for staphylococcus epidermidis, a frequent pathogen in be, an effect similar to that found for s. sanguis could be shown. in vitro, s. epidermidis was found to stimulate tfa of fibrin adherent monocytes significantly. this stimulation was maximal at a bacterium-to-monocyte ratio of 7. in vivo, tfa was found to be significantly higher in s. epidermidis-infected than in sterile catheter-induced vegetations. reduction of vegetational bacterial numbers by teicoplanin treatment lead to a small but significant decrease of tfa. reduction of monocyte numbers by etoposide did not affect vegetational tfa. comparison of data for s. epidermidis and s. sanguis revealed that at equivalent bacterial numbers, vegetational tfas were approximately the same for both microorganisms. combining the results of the present study with those of a previous study using s. sanguis, we conclude that the main factor determining monocyte-dependent vegetational tfa is the number of  vegetation-associated bacteria. the lower tfa found for s. epidermidis-infected than for s. sanguis-infected vegetations can be explained by the significantly lower bacterial numbers in the infected vegetations and consequently a lower stimulation of vegetation-associated monocytes.

AB  == enriched broth medium is routinely used as a supplement for agar plate culture of cerebrospinal fluid (csf). to assess the clinical utility of broth cultures, 151  consecutive csf bacterial and fungal isolates obtained from 91 patients were retrospectively reviewed for the effect of results on treatment. treatment decisions associated with individual csf specimens for which isolates were recovered from thioglycollate broth only were compared with the treatment decisions associated with csf specimens for which isolates were recovered by agar plate culture. treatment was defined as initiation of or change in antimicrobial  therapy based on the reporting of csf culture isolates. thirty-six (24%) of the 151 isolates were recovered in broth only. three (8%) of these 36 isolates (from  34 patients) resulted in treatment with antimicrobial agents; however, 2 of the 3 treated isolates (candida tropicalis, proteus mirabilis) were recovered from a second csf specimen in agar plate culture within 24 hours. thus, only a single isolate (3%; staphylococcus epidermidis) was treated based solely on a positive broth culture result. in contrast, 60 (52%) of the 115 isolates recovered in agar plate culture from 23 (40%) of 57 patients were treated (staphylococci, 28; gram-negative bacilli, 14; cryptococcus neoformans, 10; streptococcus pneumoniae, 3; streptococcus sanguis, 1; other, 4). we conclude that treatment with antimicrobial agents based on isolates recovered from csf specimens in broth culture alone is infrequent and infer from the data that the use of csf broth cultures contributes little to treatment decisions.

TI  == the interaction of phospholipid liposomes with bacteria and their use in the delivery of bactericides.
AB  == liposomes have been prepared from dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (dppc) incorporating the cationic lipids stearylamine (sa), dimethyldioctadecylammonium  bromide (ddab) and dimethylaminoethane carbamoyl cholesterol (dcchol) and the anionic lipids dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (dppg) and phosphatidylinositol (pi). their adsorption to biofilms of skin-associated bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis and proteus vulgaris) and oral bacteria (streptococcus mutans and sanguis) has been investigated as a function of mole % cationic and anionic lipid. targeting (adsorption) was most effective for the systems dppc-chol-sa, dppc-dppg and dppc-pi liposomes to s. epidermidis. the effect of extracellular mucopolysaccharide on targeting was investigated for s. epidermidis biofilms. it  was found that targeting increased with the level of extracellular mucopolysaccharide for all liposome compositions studied. the delivery of the oil-soluble bactericide triclosan and the water soluble bactericide chlorhexidine was studied for a number of liposomal compositions. superior delivery of both bactericides relative to the free bactericide occurred for dppc-chol-sa liposomes and for triclosan delivery by dppc-dppg and dppc-pi liposomes targeted to s. epidermidis at low bactericide concentrations. dppc-chol-sa liposomes were also effective for delivery of triclosan to s. sanguis biofilms. double labelling experiments using [14c]-chlorhexidine and [3h]-dppc suggested that there was exchange between adsorbed liposomes which had delivered bactericide to the biofilm and those in the bulk solution implying a diffusion mechanism for bactericide delivery.

TI  == treatment of endocarditis with teicoplanin: a retrospective analysis of 104 cases.
AB  == infective endocarditis is an uncommon disease but retains a high mortality. glycopeptides are used for patients with resistant pathogens, those allergic to penicillins or for those outside the hospital. the once daily administration of teicoplanin and its low toxicity suggest that it would be suitable for use in the long courses required for endocarditis. however, the dosage and combinations to be used require further study. a retrospective review has been made of 104 episodes of endocarditis treated with teicoplanin in 101 patients seen over 7 years. most patients had been referred to major london hospitals following failure of medical treatment. after three loading doses of 400 mg, teicoplanin was given at a dose of 400 mg/day in combination with other antibiotics such as gentamicin. follow up was for one year. the most common pathogens were streptococcus sanguis (15 cases), staphylococcus aureus (13 cases) and staphylococcus epidermidis (10 cases). of 80 patients febrile at the start of treatment with teicoplanin, 63 (79%) lost their fever within a median of 2 days (1-35 days). cure without surgery was effected in 50 (48%) and 75% of patients survived. other antibiotics, usually gentamicin or rifampicin, were used in 92 (90%) of patients. two strains of streptococcus spp. were said to be resistant but there was no relationship between mic of teicoplanin and outcome. pathogens with a high mbc tended to be more likely to resist treatment. adverse effects resulted in the withdrawal of teicoplanin in 20 cases (19%) but most events were  mild and renal deterioration occurred in only five patients. teicoplanin was effective in the treatment of endocarditis and appeared to be safe given the severity of disease in the patients treated.

TI  == bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. the absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. to identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a  possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mm) for 4 h and with the ph kept at 7.0 by a ph-stat. removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or  294.4 mm [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, streptococcus sanguis  i and ii (sanguis and oralis), and strep. mitior (mitis biotype i); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mm were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mm when grown anaerobically. earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. the amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. none of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, neisseria sicca, haemophilus segnis, h. parainfluenzae, actinomyces viscosus and staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. the ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mm. this almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with  glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mm. in the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the targeting of phospholipid liposomes to bacteria.
AB  == phospholipid liposomes have been prepared from phospholipid mixtures including dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol (dppc/pi) and dppc/dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (dppc/dppg) mixtures and targeted to adsorbed biofilms of the skin-associated bacteria staphylococcus epidermidis and  proteus vulgaris and the oral bacterium streptococcus sanguis. the effects of time, liposome concentration and density of bacteria in the biofilm have been studied in detail for staphylococcus epidermidis. the targeting (as assessed by the apparent monolayer coverage of the biofilms by liposomes) to the biofilms was found to be sensitive to the mol% of pi and dppg in the liposomes and optimum levels of pi were found for targeting to each bacterium. the use of pi and dppg-containing liposomes for the delivery of the bactericide, triclosan, to biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis was studied as a function of the amount of triclosan carried by the liposomes. all the liposome systems tested inhibited the growth of bacteria from the biofilms after brief (2 min) exposure to triclosan-carrying liposomes. at low triclosan levels bacterial growth inhibition by triclosan-carrying liposomes exceeded that by an equivalent level of free triclosan. after short periods (min) of exposure of biofilms to triclosan-carrying liposomes the bactericide was shown to preferentially concentrate in the biofilms relative to its liposomal lipid carrier. the results  suggest that phospholipid liposomes with appropriately chosen lipid composition have potential for the targeting and delivery of bactericide to bacteria.

TI  == bacterial interference in vitro. comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

AB  == the microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. streptococci, predominantly s. salivarius, s. sanguis, and s. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. h. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and h. influenzae being identified in only one sample. anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, s. epidermidis dominating. fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.

AB  == the recovery of bacteria and the speed of detection of microbial growth in platelet concentrates (pc) were studied, comparing a novel automated blood culture system (bact/alert) with two traditional methods. full-scale experiments  were performed with a total of 33 units of pc (average content 320 x 10(9) platelets per unit) obtained from pooled buffy coats. six strains known as possible pc contaminants were tested: s. epidermidis, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, b. cereus, e. aerogenes, and s. sanguis. using an inoculum of 50-98 bacteria/ml,  bacterial contamination was detected in all of 11 pcs on 132 sampling occasions.  with a small inoculum (0.3-9 bacteria/ml), the bacterial contamination was detected in all pcs in which abundant growth appeared, but failed to be detected  in some instances where the bacterial content was very small. all of 11 uninoculated pc controls were negative. with the automated method the time for detection of a culture-positive pc was 6-16 h, clearly shorter than with the two  manual-visual systems. the new system provides a rapid, reliable, and labour-saving method for screening of bacterial contamination in pcs. this would  increase safety particularly if the present 5-day shelf life were extended.

AB  == certain monoclonal antibodies (mabs) neutralize the inhibition of hl60 cell growth by bacterial plaque extracts. the aim of this study was to enumerate and identify the bacteria reactive to these mabs at sites where periodontal disease was measured by gingival index, pocket depth and attachment loss. the bacterial colonies were grown on blood agar and the colonies counted directly and after immunoblotting. sites that bled on probing (n = 15) had a mean of 3.35% mab-positive colonies (sem = 0.52%) and sites that did not bleed (n = 9) had a mean of 1.61% (sem = 0.41%). the percentage of mab-positive colonies also correlated with gingival index but not with the total number of colonies sampled, attachment loss or pocket depth. antigen was expressed by 4 genera: strains of streptococcus sanguis and/or eikenella corrodens (8 sites), staphylococcus epidermidis (4 sites) and corynebacterium minutissimus (1 site). the results suggest that the antigens detected on these bacteria by the mabs may be processed to form toxins and maintain gingivitis by irritating the surrounding cells.

AB  == microbial adhesion to the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (nbte) is an important early event in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. fibronectin is a ubiquitous mammalian glycoprotein with diverse functions which binds to certain bacteria but not to others. in this study, we determined that fibronectin is present on the surface of nbte (after catheter-induced aortic valve trauma) but not on normal rabbit cardiac valvular endothelium. the adhesion of various bacteria and yeasts to human fibronectin in tissue culture wells was then measured. microorganisms with a high isolation frequency from endocarditis cases (staphylococcus aureus, candida tropicalis, c. albicans, streptococcus faecalis, s. sanguis) bound significantly better (p less than 0.01) to fibronectin in vitro than other organisms (escherichia coli, c. krusei, pseudomonas aeruginosa) rarely implicated in this disease. microbial adhesion to  fibronectin correlated closely with the propensity of each organism to produce endocarditis in rabbits (e.g., id50) with preexistent nbte. a similar distribution was noted after binding of soluble radiolabeled fibronectin to bacteria in suspension. the results suggest that fibronectin, expressed on the surface of nbte, may mediate microbial adhesion of circulating organisms to initiate colonization during the early pathogenesis of infective endocarditis.

TI  == recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  == recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. the survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. all species survived well or grew in serum. haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and group a streptococci were killed in all urine samples. the number of colony-forming units of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus and group b streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. these data suggest  that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == characterization of a monoclonal antibody specific for lipoteichoic acid from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == a hybrid cell line, 3g6, producing monoclonal antibody (mab) against the polyglycerophosphate (pgp) backbone of lipoteichoic acids has been derived by the polyethylene glycol-induced fusion of mouse myeloma cells and spleen cells from mice immunized with partially purified glucosyltransferase from culture supernatant of streptococcus mutans strain 6715. immunodiffusion tests and elisa  revealed that the antibody reacted with purified pgp from group a streptococcus pyogenes strain sv as well as crude phenol-water and saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria except for a few species such as biotype b s. sanguis, micrococcus sp., and actinomyces viscosus. whole cells of serotype b s. mutans and staphylococcus epidermidis were agglutinated upon addition of 3g6 mab, while  those of most other species were not significantly affected by this procedure. a  hapten inhibition study showed that glycerophosphate was only a potent inhibitor  of passive hemagglutination reactions between lta coated sheep erythrocytes and 3g6 mab.

TI  == bacteriology of dental abscesses of endodontic origin.
AB  == aspirates have been cultured from 10 dental abscesses of endodontic origin, all of which had penetrated beyond the bony alveolus to produce fluctuant swelling. sampling was by syringe aspiration. strict anaerobic techniques, including the use of an anaerobic chamber, were used for serial dilution and plating. randomly  selected colonies (100) from each culture were purified, characterized, and identified. seventy percent of the bacterial isolates were either strict anaerobes or microaerophilic. one abscess yielded a pure culture of a viridans streptococcus, streptococcus milleri. streptococcus intermedius dominated the flora in a second abscess. the common oral streptococcus, streptococcus sanguis,  constituted only 2% of the isolates from one additional infection. fusobacterium  nucleatum, bacteroides melaninogenicus, other bacteroides including b. oralis and b. ruminicola, anaerobic diphtheroids, peptostreptococcus micros, and staphylococcus epidermis were other predominant isolates.

TI  == laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  == the growth of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. fecalis, s. sanguis, s. bovis, s. mitior, s. agalactiae, escherichia coli, a-d group, klebsiella aerogenes, k. oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, pasteurella multocida or listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood  cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no  growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. the analysis detected the growth of s. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect  the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and species of micrococcus, corynebacterium or bacillus in 18 blood cultures.

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

TI  == enhancement of generation of monocyte tissue thromboplastin by bacterial phagocytosis: possible pathway for fibrin formation on infected vegetations in bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == the deposition of fibrin on infected vegetations and the presence of mononuclear  phagocytes that have phagocytized bacteria are remarkabe features in experimental bacterial endocarditis. in a study in vitro, we show that phagocytosis of bacteria by human monocytes enhances thromboplastin generation by these cells. maximal enhancement of the generation of thromboplastin by monocytes was about six times compared with that in the control experiment without bacteria, and it was obtained by preincubation of the monocytes with 5 to 10 bacteria per monocyte. no quantitative difference was observed between staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus sanguis as to the enhancement of the monocyte thromboplastin generation. an enhancement of the procoagulant activity generation was also observed after addition of bacteria to human or rabbit whole blood. probably, this generation was also due to synthesis of thromboplastin by monocytes. it is conceivable that fibrin deposition on infected vegetations during bacterial endocarditis is mediated by thromboplastin synthesis by monocytes.

TI  == secretion of lipids induced by inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in streptococci.
AB  == inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis causes an immediate and massive secretion of both newly synthesized and "old" lipids from several species of bacteria, including streptococci, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus subtilis. lipid  secretion occurs in the absence of detectable bacterial lysis. this novel phenomenon was examined in more detail in three strains of streptococci: s. sanguis (group h), s. pyogenes (group a), and s. pneumoniae. the secretion of lipids is specifically induced by inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis; it is not caused by inhibitors of protein, ribonucleic acid, or deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. the occurrence appears to be reversible since penicillin-induced secretion comes to a halt upon the timely addition of penicillinase, correlating  with resumption of culture growth. all cellular lipids are secreted in essentially the same proportions as those found in the drug treated bacteria. it  is suggested that continued peptidoglycan synthesis may be essential for the integration and retention of lipid material in the plasma membrane.
