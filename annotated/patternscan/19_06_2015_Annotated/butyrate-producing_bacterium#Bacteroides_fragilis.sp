TI  == xylo-oligosaccharides and inulin affect genotoxicity and bacterial populations differently in a human colonic simulator challenged with soy protein.
AB  == high dietary intakes of some protein sources, including soy protein, can increase colonic dna damage in animals, whereas some carbohydrates attenuate this. we investigated whether inulin and xylo-oligosaccharides (xos) could be protective against dna strand breaks by adding them to a human colonic simulator consisting  of a proximal vessel (pv) (ph 5.5) and a distal vessel (dv) (ph 6.8) inoculated with human faeces and media containing soy protein. genotoxicity of the liquid phase and microbial population changes in the vessels were measured. soy protein  (3%) was fermented with 1% low amylose cornstarch for 10 day followed by soy protein with 1% xos or 1% inulin for 10 day. inulin did not alter genotoxicity but xos significantly reduced pv genotoxicity and increased dv genotoxicity. inulin and xos significantly increased butyrate concentration in the dv but not pv. numbers of the key butyrate-producing bacterium faecalibacterium prausnitzii  were significantly increased in the pv and dv by inulin but significantly decreased by xos in both vessels. other bacteria examined were also significantly impacted by the carbohydrate treatments or by the vessel (i.e., ph). there was a  significant overall inverse correlation between levels of damage induced by the ferments and levels of sulphate-reducing bacteria, bacteroides fragilis, and acetate. in conclusion, dietary xos can potentially modulate the genotoxicity of  the colonic environment and specific bacterial groups and short chain fatty acids may mediate this.

TI  == structural segregation of gut microbiota between colorectal cancer patients and healthy volunteers.
AB  == despite a long-suspected role in the development of human colorectal cancer (crc), the composition of gut microbiota in crc patients has not been adequately  described. in this study, fecal bacterial diversity in crc patients (n=46) and healthy volunteers (n=56) were profiled by 454 pyrosequencing of the v3 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. both principal component analysis and unifrac analysis showed structural segregation between the two populations. forty-eight operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified by redundancy analysis as key  variables significantly associated with the structural difference. one otu closely related to bacteroides fragilis was enriched in the gut microbiota of crc patients, whereas three otus related to bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides uniformis were enriched in that of healthy volunteers. a total of 11 otus belonging to the genera enterococcus, escherichia/shigella, klebsiella, streptococcus and peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut  microbiota of crc patients, and 5 otus belonging to the genus roseburia and other butyrate-producing bacteria of the family lachnospiraceae were less abundant. real-time quantitative pcr further validated the significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of crc patients by measuring the copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme a coa transferase genes (mann-whitney test,  p<0.01). reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens  may constitute a major structural imbalance of gut microbiota in crc patients.

TI  == high proportions of proinflammatory bacteria on the colonic mucosa in a young patient with ulcerative colitis as revealed by cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes.
AB  == the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (uc) remains unknown. it is thought to be  due to an abnormal and uncontrolled immune response to normally occurring constituents of the intestine. microbial agents appear to be involved in the pathogenesis and intestinal bacteria seem to be an important factor in the development and chronicity. the aim of this study was to investigate the colonic  microbiota of a patient with uc. the colonic tissues were taken during surgery from a 12-year-old girl suffering from uc. the microbiota on the colonic samples  was studied by cloning and sequencing of amplified 16s rrna genes. compared with  healthy subjects, alteration of the dominant bacterial group was observed in the  uc patient. we found a high incidence of enterobacteriaceae, bacteroides fragilis, and the single phylotype of the faecalibacterium prausnitzii-like "butyrate-producing bacterium" l2-6. furthermore, there was a substantial presence of pseudomonas aeruginosa in the present case of uc. the high proportion of adverse proinflammatory species is striking in the present case compared with  more normal situations. even if those bacteria are not the cause of the uc, they  most probably enhance the symptoms of the disease.
