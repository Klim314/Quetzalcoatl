TI  == a probiotics-containing biscuit modulates the intestinal microbiota in the elderly.
AB  == objectives: evaluation of the impact of a biscuit containing the probiotics bifidobacterium longum bar33 and lactobacillus helveticus bar13 on the intestinal microbiota in the elderly. design: randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. participants: thirty-two elderly volunteers living in italy. the group was composed of 19 women and 13 men aged between 71 and 88 years (mean 76). intervention: subjects were randomized in two groups consuming one dose of the probiotics-containing biscuit or placebo once a day for 30 days. measurements: for each subject the intestinal microbiota was characterized using the phylogenetic microarray platform htf-microbi.array before and after intervention. results: our data demonstrated that one-month consumption of a probiotics-containing biscuit was effective in redressing some of the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota. in particular, the probiotic treatment reverted the age-related increase of the opportunistic pathogens clostridium cluster xi, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecium  and the enteropathogenic genus campylobacter. conclusion: the present study opens the way to the development of elderly-tailored probiotic-based functional foods to counteract the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from  nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains  of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
